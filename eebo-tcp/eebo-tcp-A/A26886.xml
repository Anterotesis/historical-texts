            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not long ago since it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding far from my thoughts, that ever I should have been so much imployed in Controversies with dear and Reverend Brethren, as since that time I have been. I repent of any temerity, unskilfulness or other sin of my own which might occasion it, and I am much grieved that it hath occasioned offense to some of the Brethren whom I contradict: But yet I foresee that some light is like to arise by this collision, and the Church will receive more good then hurt by it. We are united in Christ, and in hearty Love to one another, (which as my soul is certainly conscious of; so I have not the least doubt of it in most of
<pb facs="tcp:107958:4"/>
my Brethren with whom I have these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates) we are so far agreed, that we do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out scruple profess our selves of the same faith, and Church: and where the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of our Differences may seem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any great distance, which we are fain to manifest in our Disputes, we lay that more upon the opinion then the persons, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they discern not and own not such Consequences. And if any salt be mingled in our Writings (which is usual in Disputes that are not lifeless) or it is intended rather to sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son then to fret, or to bite that which each one takes to be an error, rather then the man that holdeth it; (If there be two or three toothed contenders that have more to do with persons then with doctrines, that's nothing to the rest) And thus on both sides those that erre, and those that have the truth, do shew that Error is the thing which they detest, and would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sclaim it, if they saw it; and that Truth is it which they love, and are zealous for it so far as they know it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And doubtless the comparing of our several Evidences, will be some help to the unprejudiced, to the attainment of a clearer discovery of the Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:107958:4"/>The greatest thing that troubleth me, is to hear that there are some men, yea (which is the wonder) some Orthodox Godly Ministers (though I hope but few) that fetch an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from our Disputes against the motions to Peace and Unity and unquestionable Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which on other occasions are made to them; and if any Arguments of mine be used to move them, they presently reply, [If he would promote peace, he should not break it, by dissenting from or writing against his Brethren.] But what if I were as bad as you can imagine, will you therefore refuse any Evidence that shall be brought you, or neglect any duty that God shall call you to? Will my unpeaceableness excuse yours? But stay Brethren; do you build the Churches Peace on such terms as these? Will you have Union and Communion with none but your own Party, that are in all things of your own Opinions? If these be your grounds, you are utterly schismatical in your foundations, though you should actually get all the Christians in <hi>Europe</hi> to be of your minde. O! me thinks men that are humble (as all are that shall be saved) should be so
<pb facs="tcp:107958:5"/>
far acquainted with the weakness of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, as to have meaner thoughts of them, and not to make them the Standard of the Churches Judgement, or the Center of its Peace. There's no two men of you all, of one minde in all things among your selves.</p>
            <p>But I confess your faults excuse not mine; and I am much too blame, if I be not willing to hear of them &amp; reform them. But I can do nothing against the truth; it is not in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be of all mens minds, when they are of so many and inconsistent. If I agree with some Reverend Brethren, it must displease the rest by disagreeing from them. And therefore I have long resolved to study to please God, (who may be pleased) instead of men, and do my best to find out the Truth, and entertain it and obey it, as far as I can understand it, and to propound it to others, and leave it to God and them whether it shall be received or not. And for my self to be heartily thankful to any, that will help me to know more, and deliver me from any Error that I am in.</p>
            <p>The Differences that these Brethren have blamed me for are in these three points or four: 1. About the Interest of Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb facs="tcp:107958:5"/>
and other Graces in our Justification. Of this I have not heard from any Brother, that yet he is unsatisfied, since I published my Confession; save what is in an Epistle to the Sermons on <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. to which I have long ago prepared an Answer (and the by-exceptions answered in this Book.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. About proving Christianity by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; of which I have heard from none since I published my Papers against Infidelity. 3. About the Universality of Redemption: and 4. About the Controversies of this Book.</p>
            <p>For the former of these last, I find a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, Learned man endeavouring to load me with some note of Singularity, I mean D. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus Molinaeus,</hi> in his Preface to his <hi>Paraenesis ad aedificatores Imperii in Imperio</hi> (a Book that hath much Learning, and more Truth then is fairly used, the face of it being writhen to frown upon them that own it, and Parties wronged even where Truth is defended, though through the unhappiness of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction oft clouded when it seems explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and through — I know not what, the Controversie seldom truly stated.) This Learned man hath thought it meet, for the

<pb facs="tcp:107958:6"/>
same man? 2. <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether this Learned man know the judgement of all <hi>England?</hi> 3. I meet with so many of <hi>Amyraldus</hi> mind in the point of Universal Redemption, that if I might judge of all the rest by those of my acquaintance, I should conjecture that half the Divines in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> are of that opinion. 4. Is it not a thing famously known in <hi>England,</hi> that this middle way of Universal Redemption hath been by Writing and Disputing and preaching main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by as excellent Divines for Learning, Judgement, holiness, and powerful Preaching (as far as we can judge) as ever <hi>England</hi> bred? Its famously known that B<hi rend="sup">p</hi> 
               <hi>Vsher</hi> was for it, that B<hi rend="sup">p</hi> 
               <hi>Davenant,</hi> B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>

               <hi>Goad,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Balcanquall,</hi> being all the Divines that were sent to the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> from <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> were for it: and <hi>Davenant, Hall,</hi> and <hi>Ward,</hi> have wrote for it: that those holy, renowned Preachers, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

was lately translated here into English, and published by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mauritius Bohemus,</hi> a Divine residing in <hi>Leicestershire.</hi> 5. Is it not famously known that the Divines of <hi>Breme</hi> go this way, and the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg</hi>'s Divines, &amp; that <hi>Wendeline</hi> complaineth to <hi>Spanhemius</hi> of it: and that <hi>Ludovicus Crocius, Mat Martinius,</hi> and <hi>Isel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge</hi> (besides the Brittish Divines gave it in as their judgement at the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi>; so that the Synod hath nothing against it; and nothing but what this <hi>unus Baxterus,</hi> and all of his mind do readily subscribe to herein. Nay, is it not manifested that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Twiss</hi> himself hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently written for it? 6. Can he that knows the <hi>Lutherane</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> doctrine believe both these, that the Arminians in <hi>Belgia</hi> are pleased with <hi>Amyraldus</hi> Method, and yet that <hi>nullâ parte haeret apud Lutheranos</hi>? 7. Can he that hath read what <hi>Davenant, Camero, Amyraldus, Lud. Crocius,</hi> &amp;c. have written against the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians, and what <hi>Grotius, Tilenus,</hi> and others of them have written against them, be yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that the Arminians are pleased with <hi>Amyraldus</hi> Method, any further then to be <hi>less dispeased</hi> with it then with some others? 8. When M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Woodbridge</hi> doth profess but that
<pb facs="tcp:107958:7"/>
he is for Universal Redemption in <hi>Davenant</hi>'s sense, [especially since he read <hi>Daile,</hi> &amp;c.] doth this Learned man well infer thence, that he was <hi>Daile</hi>'s proselyte, when the contrary is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, yea is the [<hi>fatetur se nondum concoquentem</hi> Amyraldi <hi>Methodum.</hi>] true or false? 9. When this <hi>unus Baxterus</hi> did write a Book for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Redemption in this middle sense, before he ever saw either <hi>Amyraldus, Davenant,</hi> or any Writer (except D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Twiss</hi>) for that way, and was ready to publish it, and stopt it on the coming forth of <hi>Amyraldus,</hi> and was himself brought to this judgement, by reading D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Twiss,</hi> and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of it and had in print so long ago pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed these things, whether this Learned man should after all this publish to the world, that I am <hi>Amyraldus</hi> proselyte? I speak but as to the truth of the report; for as to the reputation of the thing, I should think it a great benefit if I had the opportunity of sitting at the feet of so judicious a man as I perceive <hi>Amyraldus</hi> to be 10. Whether is <hi>Calovius</hi> a competent witness of the judgement of the Lutherans in general, or a witness capable of dishonouring <hi>Amyral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> when he so unpeaceably and voluminous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poureth out his fiery indignation against the
<pb facs="tcp:107958:8"/>
moderate Lutherans themselves, that are but willing of Peace, under the name of <hi>Calixtians,</hi> seeking to make them odious from the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable name of <hi>Georgius Calixtus,</hi> who went with them in that peaceable way? 11. If it be <hi>David Blondell</hi> that he means, when he saith of <hi>Daile</hi>'s Book [<hi>Obstetricante magno illìc Viro, sed Armimia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum cultore</hi>] (and <hi>Blondell</hi> only prefaceth to it) Whether any that hath read the Writings of <hi>Blondell,</hi> and heard of his fame, should believe this accusation? or rather — 12. Is it a certain Truth or a Calumny that is thus expressed of <hi>Dallaeus, [Certum est tamen hâc Apologiâ maluisse Arminianorum ordinibus inseri, quàm sedem inter contrà-remonstrantes tenere</hi>]? And is it certain, that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Molin</hi> knows the mind of <hi>Dallaeus</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he doth his own, or is sooner then himself to be believed in the report of it? 13. Whether the desire which he expresseth that <hi>Camero</hi> had been expelled, and the words that he poureth forth against him, do more disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Camero</hi> or himself? And if that Article of Justification were sufficient ground of his condemnation and expulsion, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Olevian, Scultetus, Vrsinus, Paraeus, Piscator, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedius, Wendeline, Gataker,</hi> and abundance more
<pb facs="tcp:107958:8"/>
should have tasted of the same sauce, Whether these persecuting principles savour not of too high an esteem of their own judgements, and tend not either to force an implicite faith in the Ministery, or to depopulate the Church, and break all in pieces? And whether more credit is to be given to the judgement of this Learned man, against <hi>Camero,</hi> or to the general applause of the Learned, Pious and Peaceable Divines of most Protestant Churches? For instance, such as B<hi rend="sup">p</hi> 
               <hi>Hall</hi>'s, who in his <hi>Peace-maker, p.</hi> 49. saith of him, that he was [the Learnedst Divine, be it spoken without envy, that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath afforded in this last age.] 14. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Learned man had not forgotten his former Triumph in the supposed unsuccessful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Amyralds</hi> Method, and the paucity of his partakers or approvers, when he wrote this in deep sorrow for the Churches of <hi>France, [Seriò ingemisco Patriae &amp; Ecclesiis in ea reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, quod jam totos viginti annos Methodus</hi> Amyral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di <hi>impunè regna verit: nemine intrà</hi> Galliam <hi>hiscere audente, aut ullo vindice veritatis ibi exurgente</hi>] &amp; do these words shew his desire of Peace or Contention in the Church? 15. Whether it be truth that he saith, that all the Divines of the
<pb facs="tcp:107958:9"/>
Assembly at <hi>Westminster</hi> were against <hi>Amyral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> Method, when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Vines</hi> hath often and openly owned <hi>Davenant</hi>'s way of Universal Redemption; and others yet living are known to be for it? 16. Whether it be proved from the cited words of their Confession, <hi>c.</hi> 8. §. 5. that such was their judgement, when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press no such thing? And I have spoken with an eminent Divine, yet living, that was of the Assembly, who assured me that they purposely avoided determining that Controversie, and some of them profest themselves for the middle way of Universal Redemption. 17. Is there one man in <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge</hi> (besides himself) that believes his next words, [<hi>pari obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo confodiunt hanc Methodum quotquot sunt bodie Doctores &amp; Professores Oxoniae &amp; Cantabrigiae</hi>] except on supposition that the foregoing words be untrue which <hi>pari</hi> relateth to? 18. Is it probable that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Twiss</hi> was an enemy to that doctrine of Redemption which he hath so often asserted, viz [That Christ dyed for all men, so far as to purchase them pardon and salvation on condition they would repent and believe; and for the Elect, so far further as to procure them faith and repentance it self:]
<pb facs="tcp:107958:9"/>
which he hath oft in many Writings as to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cranford</hi>'s charge concerning his severe accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Dallaeus,</hi> and judging his very heart to be guilty of such dissimulation, as [that he wrote not seriously, but contrary to what he thought, and that nothing could be more illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate. I shall not put the question, whether it be probable that these words could pass from such a man, because he is alive to vindicate himself, if the report be false, or to own it, if true. 19. Do all the contemptuous expressions of a Dissenter so much dishonour the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Dallaeus,</hi> as this Dissenters own praise of his former Writings doth honour it, when he saith of him, [<hi>A quo nihil hactenus prodii<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> quod non esset judicii acerrimi, eruditionis reconditis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simae, &amp; dostrinae sanctissimae, aut candidissimum pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus non referret; in quo nulla suspicio malignitatis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideret; multò minùs eâ aetate seriâ &amp; serâ erupturae, cùm lenit albescens animos capillus</hi>] This is enough to make a stranger conjecture, that the man is not grown either such a fool as to err so grosly as is pretended, or such a knave as to write in the matters of God against his own judgement. And indeed he that will prove himself a wiser, a much wiser man in these matters then
<pb facs="tcp:107958:10"/>
               <hi>Dallaeus, Blondel, Amyrald.</hi> &amp;c. must bring another kind of evidence for the honor of his Wisdom, then D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>L. Molin</hi>'s Preface or <hi>Paraenesis</hi> is. 20. Is it not an indignity to the dead, which the living should hear with a pious indignation, for this Learned man to feign that B<hi rend="sup">p</hi> 
               <hi>Vsher</hi> thought so contemptuously of <hi>Amyraldus</hi> Method? What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he might say of him in any other respect, its well known that he owned the substance of his doctrine of Redemption. The high praises therefore which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Molin</hi> doth give to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Bishop, do dishonour his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that makes the Bishops doctrine so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and gross. The like dealing I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, some Arminian Divines (I am loath to name them) have used against this reverend man: One of them of great note hath given out, that he heard him preach for universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and afterwards spoke to him, and found him owning it; therefore he was an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian: and I hear a <hi>Northamptonshire</hi> Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath so published him in print. O the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness of men seeming pious! The good Bishop must be what every one will say of him. Though one feigneth him to be of one extream, and the other of the other extream,
<pb facs="tcp:107958:10"/>
when (alas!) his judgement hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known in the world about this 30 years to be neither for the one, nor the other, but for the middle way. Do you call for proof? If I give you not better then either D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Molin,</hi> or the two Arminian Divines give, let me be branded for a factious Calumniator of the dead, whose name is so honourable, that the forgery is the greater sin. First there is a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of his own in many mens hands, dated <hi>March.</hi> 3. 1617. at <hi>Dublin,</hi> (which I intend to print, if no one else do it first) which asserteth this Doctrine in the same middle way as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> and <hi>Camero</hi> do. And I askt him whether he yet owned it, (not long before his death), and he said, He did, and was firm in that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I asked him to whom he wrote it, and he told me (as I remember) to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culverwell</hi> (I am certain it was to him, or to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Eyr,</hi> who, he told me, was the man that fell so foul on M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culverwell.</hi>) 2. If my own word be not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Kendal</hi> can bear witness that he was present, once when he heard him own this judgement of Universal Redemption in the middle way, and intimated that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Davenant</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Preston</hi> were minded of it by him; (as
<pb facs="tcp:107958:11"/>
reioycing that he sooner owned it;) and that we cannot rationally offer Christ to sinners on other grounds. Now because the Bishop went this middle way, when he speaks against the Arminians, some feign him to speak against his own doctrine. And when he spoke for U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Satisfaction, the Arminians say he was turned to them. This is the faithfulness of the <hi>world</hi>! It shames and grieves me to say, <hi>Of siding</hi> Divines; and as much almost to say, <hi>Of a publick Professor of History in Oxford</hi>: For the principal honour of a Historian, is his veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and impartial fidelity; and how much of that this Preface to the <hi>Paraenesis</hi> is guilty of, I leave to consideration upon the taste that is here given. But enough of this.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last particular in which I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend some few Brethren by my judgement, is that which is the subject of these ensuing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputations. But I can truly say of this as of the rest, 1. That if I should change my judgement and please these Brethren, its like I should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splease many more. For 2. I take it for granted, that I go in the common rode that the Church of Christ hath gone in from the beginning to this day; so far am I from singularity. 3. I
<pb facs="tcp:107958:11"/>
am most certain that my thoughts were so far from intending singularity or the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Church, by these or other points in Controversie, that I apprehended them strongly to be the truths that must be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the Churches peace when ever God seeth us meet to attain it. And though I never took a point for true <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because it was in the middle, or tended to peace, yet I purposely chose out these truths rather then other to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, because they tend to peace. And to the praise of God I speak it, that in those antient common disturbing Controversies between the <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Antiarminian, Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinist, Iesuite</hi> and <hi>Dominican, I have discerned those Principles which quiet my own mind, and which I am confident, were they received according to their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, would quiet the now-contending Christian world</hi>: But I am past doubt, to be derided as arrogant for this confidence; and should the Principles in a Method with Evidence be propounded, though purposely to heal the divisions of the Church, many of the several parties would but rage at the Reconciler, and pour out their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent accusations and reproaches against him, because he would attempt the healing of their
<pb facs="tcp:107958:12"/>
divisions, and would feign him to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of some new Sect, for seeking to put an end to Sects. But let any man make good my just demand, that the Principles propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed shall have an impartial reception according to their Evidence, and I will give you security to make good my confidence, that they shall quiet the Chrstian world hereabouts. But I know this is to be expected from none but God; nor at all on earth in any perfection.</p>
            <p>As to the present Controversie, it seemed good to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Blake</hi> to begin it with me; and to my Defense he hath opposed an angry Reply; not to my whole Book (as I did to that part of his which concerned me) but to here and there a scrap, disordered, and maimed, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled as he thought good. I was in doubt whether to make any rejoinder or further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense; but while I doubted, divers Reverend Brethren from several parts wrote to me, to move me neither to be silent, nor to answer all his words, which would be tedious to the Reader, but to handle the Controversies by way of Disputation, and to bring in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Blake</hi>'s Arguments under them, so far as shall be thought necessary. Though
<pb facs="tcp:107958:12"/>
at first I scarce liked this way, as seeming not a full answer, but such a course as he took with me, yet I did acquiesce in the judgement of my Brethren. But yet indeed, I think I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver printed a word at all in Defense of my self against M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Blake,</hi> but for another providence. The third Disputation, as here printed, was written before M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Blake</hi>'s Book against me was printed, or in the press (as I have reason to think.) A Copie of this I lent about two years ago to a friend: But by what means I know not, about three quarters of a year ago I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived tidings from a pious learned Minister in the West (writing to a friend of his not far from me) that there were such abundance of Copies of that Disputation in those parts, and some were so purposed, that it would be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if I did not do it my self. I confess I was much offended at the news, because the Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was imperfectly written, and on such a subject (as to the later part, which shews what sins may consist with Godliness) that I would have been loath it should have been by them made publike, as knowing how unfit it was for the eyes of the Profane: But when there was no remedy, the best I could do, was to add
<pb facs="tcp:107958:13"/>
some cautions, and annex the other Disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here adjoyned, which were hastily written, that the former might not go alone without that company that seemed necessary. And this is the occasion of this present writing.</p>
            <p>For the Matter of it, I have manifested that I hold the common Doctrine of the Church. And many another could I mention as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting in it, besides those particularly there ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Wil. Fenner</hi> in the second part <hi>of Christs Alarm,</hi> p. 92, 93. saith [<hi>Another inseparable mark of a true Church, is a sincere Profession of the word of God and true Christian religion, either in truth and uprightness of heart, or else so far as man can judge: For though the preaching of the Word come to a place, yet it doth not follow presently that there is a Church of God — but when divers of them embraced the Word either sincerely, or else to see to, as far as</hi> Paul <hi>and others could judge, then they were a Church: There must be a Congregation of People that do profess the pure Religion, and make it appear (at least to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man) that they are Godly in Christ Iesus: this is an inseparable Mark of a true Church, as we may see</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33.] See further.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Vines</hi> in <hi>his Treatise of the Sacrament,</hi> p. 150, 151. saith, <hi>That the Separatists [laid the foundation,</hi>

viz. <hi>That only Visible Saints are fit Communicants, which is true as to the Churches Admission: That real Saints only are worthy Communicants, which is true too, as to the inward Grace or Benefit</hi>] —And 151. <hi>There is a great difference between Christs real Members and Guests at this Table, and as I may say, the Visible Churches Members or Guests. If he be a visible Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of Faith, unshipwrakt, of capacity to discern the Lords Body, of Life without Scandal, he is a Guest of the Church.</hi> —]</p>
            <p>And p. 205. <hi>Though I should rest in serious Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion of Faith and Repentance, which is not pulled down again by a wicked Life, or scandalous Sin,—yet when a man lieth under the charge of our censure for some scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous sin, the case is otherwise,</hi> &amp;c.] Read the rest.</p>
            <p>And p. 324, 329. [<hi>The Covenant of God with us is, that all that believe in Christ that died, and receive him for their Lord and Saviour, shall have remission of sins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Answerable to this act of God, the Believer accepts of, and submits to this Covenant and the Conditions of it,</hi> viz. <hi>to believe, and to have God for our God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of makes a solemn profession in this Sacrament, giving up himself to Christ as Lord and Saviour, restipulating and striking hands with him to be his, and so binds himself, and doth as it were seal a Counterpart to God again; and not only so, but comes into a claim of all the riches and

[<hi>The grace which we have by it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin but continue grace or life; no man therefore receives this Sacrament before Baptism, because no dead thing is capable of nourishment; that which groweth, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity first live.</hi>] —</p>

            <p>Since these Papers were in the Press, I was told by a Reverend Brother, that <hi>Mr</hi> Blake <hi>professeth to hold the Necessity of the Profession of a saving Faith, as well as I</hi>; and by one of his special acquaintance, in the Ministry, who heard me express my mind, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Blake</hi>'s <hi>was the same.</hi> I durst not omit the mention of this, lest it should be injurious to him: And yet how far the reporters are in the right, and understand his meaning, I am no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able to tell you, but that they are credible persons. For my part, I defended my own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine against the charge which in two Volumes he brought against it. And I supposed he would not write so much of two Volumes against a Doctrine which he judged the same with his own. And I medled only with his books, and not his secret thoughts. Whether I have been guilty of feigning an Adversary, that took himself for none, I am contented to stand to the judgment of any impartial man on earth that will read our books. Surely I found it over each page, that <hi>a
<pb facs="tcp:107958:15"/>
Faith short of Iustifying entitleth to Baptism</hi>: and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver met with any such explication in him, as that by [<hi>A faith short of Iustifying,</hi>] he meant [<hi>A Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Iustifying faith.</hi>] And sure [<hi>Faith</hi>] and [<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>] be not all one; nor [<hi>Iustifying</hi>] and [<hi>Short of justifying</hi>] all one. Nor do others that read his books understand him any otherwise then I do, so far as I can learn; sure the Ministers that were Authors of the <hi>Propositions for Reformation of Parish Congregations, Printed for the</hi> Norwich <hi>Bookseller,</hi> understood him as I do, <hi>p.</hi> 17. where they say thus; [Obj. 3. <hi>But a dogmatical Faith may entitle to Baptism, as Mr</hi> Blake, <hi>Treat. on Con. speaks, though there be no profession of a justifying faith &amp; repentance.</hi> Answ. <hi>We cannot think so, seeing the faith required to be professed before Baptism, is such a Faith as hath salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on annexed to it.</hi> Mar. 16.16. <hi>It is a Faith of the whole heart,</hi> Acts 8.38. <hi>Repentance is also required to Baptism as well as Faith,</hi> Acts 2.38. <hi>and the Church in the usual form of Baptism, enjoyned the baptized person not only to profess the doctrine of Faith, but to give up his name to Christ as his servant and souldier, and to fight manfully against the World, the Flesh and the Devil,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we need add no more. Mr</hi> Blake<hi>'s mistake lies in this, that the ground of Baptism is either a Dogmatical faith, or a true justifying faith; which because no Minister can certainly
<pb facs="tcp:107958:16"/>
know, he must only require a Dogmatical faith. But we conceive neither of them to be the ground of Baptism, but the profession of a true justifying faith, or Acceptance of the Covenant</hi>] So far these Brethren.</p>
            <p>And whether it be not the <hi>Promise</hi> of a justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Blake</hi> takes up with, besides his faith short of justifying, read his Books, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure as you find cause.</p>
            <p>But yet if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Blake,</hi> be really of my mind, I have no mind to perswade the world that he is not, nor reason so to do; but when I know it from himself, I shall heartily rejoyce in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. For I am confident it is in love of Truth that both of us do dispute; and therefore if Truth get by it, we have our ends.</p>
            <p>For my part, I must still say, that if I took [a Dogmatical faith it self, or any short of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] for the Title and necessary qualifications of them that I must admit, I would baptize none, because I cannot know who hath that Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical faith, and who not. And I still find that even wise and pious men are oft as far to seek for the truth of their <hi>Assent</hi> as of their <hi>Consent,</hi> and would give a world that they were but certain that they truly Believe the truth of the Gospel. And I am sure that I am as far to seek for assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb facs="tcp:107958:16"/>
of the one as of the other in those that I examine, in order to the baptizing of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
            <p>There is newly come forth a Book of <hi>William Morrice</hi> Esquire, which seems by the Title page to plead for the sufficiency of this Dogmatical faith. When I saw the Book, made up of so much reading and expressing so much industry and learning, I much rejoyced that <hi>England</hi> had such a Gentleman; and I look on the Book, as a shaming reprehension of the idleness and ignorance of the multitude of the Gentry, that spend that time in hawking, and hunting, and complementing, which if better spent, might make a blessing, and not a burden to the Land. But out of that learned Volume I am not able to find any clear discovery, what the Author means by a Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical faith. But I conjecture that it is somewhat that must be conjunct with the Profession of a saving faith. For <hi>pag.</hi> 215. he saith, [<hi>because it is not only probable to Charity they may have found faith, but</hi> —] And pag. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>4. [<hi>He that receives the Seals of the Covenant, seals back a Counter-part to God, accepts of the Terms, and assents to the Condition,</hi> (which as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Vines</hi> before shews, is justifying faith.) —] And I desire it may be
<pb facs="tcp:107958:17"/>
observed what he saith, <hi>p.</hi> 247. to prove Baptism and the Lords Supper to be administred on the like grounds: And what he saith in <hi>p.</hi> 248, 249. against Baptizing the children of the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, and what he citeth out of <hi>Rich. Hooker, Eccl. Pol. l.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 87. to that end; and that the <hi>Childs right is rooted in the immediate parents</hi>: And that which he citeth out of <hi>Goodwins</hi> Mos. &amp; Aar. l. 5. c. 2. p. 223. that [<hi>Among the Iews the male-children of those that were but under Niddui were not circumcised.</hi>]</p>
            <p>And if any think that this learned Gentleman would have Ministers feed the humors of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal unruly multitude by giving them the Lords Supper, while they obstinately refuse to be ruled or to live a godly life, let them observe, that it is only Church-members, not living scandalously and still professing the Christian faith, that he pleads for. And no doubt but he will confess, that our Parishioners cannot by us be made Church-members against their wils; &amp; he distinguisheth between the Universal and a Particular Church, and well knows that all the Christian world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to my pastoral charge; and that I am not bound to deliver the Sacraments to all that have a right to them. And therefore if upon just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons I desire of the whole Parish, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:107958:17"/>
they own their membership in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church or not, and take me for their Pastor, and consent to the duty of members; and some deny it, and others will give me no answer by word or writing, no not after I have waited a year or two; and I told them, that I must take their silence for a denial; but they will continue silently to hear, and will not once say they own the relation, nor will submit to the unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able acts of Discipline; I am confident that it is not in the thoughts of this learned Gentleman, that I must needs take these persons for part of my charge, that will not tell me, they take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for such, or take me for their Pastor; no more then he will think himself bound to take a woman for his wife, and estate her in his Lands, and perform conjugal offices to her, that will not once say, She consenteth that he shall be her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. And this is the case of most of our people: The most Godly Ministers about us that gather not new Churches, but (on sufficient reasons and joint agreement) do only call the whole Parish to know whether they own their membership, and them for their Pastors, do find almost none but a few Godly that will own it, for fear of being troubled by Discipline. If all the Parish
<pb facs="tcp:107958:18"/>
therefore be our Church, it must be against their wils.</p>
            <p>And if any think that several passages in that Learned Volumn do make against the power, and consequently the labor of the Ministry and the Edification of the Church, I propound to their consideration, 1. That all the applicatory passages of the Discourse must be expounded as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to that controversie which occasioned them, which must be understood by the help of former writings. 2. Its not unusual with wise men in length and heat of Disputation, to make the face of Truth it self to seem sometimes to look awry in the application. 3. And other passages in the same Book may help you to a fair exposition of the offensive. As, e.g. <hi>p.</hi> 85. he saith, [<hi>Were a Pastor so familiarly conversant with his flock as he ought to be, and is some think implyed not only in</hi> Paul<hi>'s preaching from house to house, but also by those alike used idioms, [the Church in, or among you, and you in the Church,] or did not deem, the feeding of the Lambs by Catechizing to be beneath his magistery and greatness, he would need no other marks or signs to know his sheep by, then such as he might take from common conversation</hi>] And you need not question but this Learned Author would reckon them among the scandalous, that would
<pb facs="tcp:107958:18"/>
not speak with a Minister if he desire it, but get away when they know he will come to their house, yea, or will not <hi>come</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> considering he is made the Ruler over them in order to their spiritual good, and they commanded to obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. especially when a Ministers weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or the multitude of his Parishioners and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness will not permit him to seek after them. I may conclude therefore that for all the word [<hi>Dogmatical faith</hi>] in the Title page, this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is not like to be my Adversary.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the Jesuits themselves do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that the Doctrin which I have in this Book maintained, is the ordinary Protestant Doctrine, while they concurr in opposing part of it, under that title without our disowning it, and tell the <hi>Iansenians,</hi> that their Doctrine, by which they make the Church to consist only of those that have charity and true Grace, is the doctrine of the Protestants; as <hi>Petavius</hi> de Lege &amp; Gratia passim; &amp; p. 28.

               <hi>Roberts.</hi> I have said as much as I now intend in the Conclusion of these Disputations.</p>
            <p>If any Papists or other Adversaries shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that we are not of the true Church or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, because we thus differ, and are of so many minds; they may as well prove a man to be no member of an Hospital, or no Patient to a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, because he is not in perfect health; or none of the Scholars of such a Master, because he knows not as much as his Teacher, or as those of the highest form: Or that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were not both of the true Church, because they fell out even to a parting asunder: Or that <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> were not both of the true Religion, because one of them was to be blamed, and the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood him to the face, because he walked not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, and according to the truth of the Gospel, (an high charge, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13, 14.) yea, they may as well conclude that no man is of the Church
<pb facs="tcp:107958:19"/>
while he liveth on earth, because while we are here, we know but in part, and see but darkly or enigmatically as in a glass, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9, 11, 12. and because we account not our selves perfect, or to have attained, but follow after, and reach forth to the things which are before us, and press toward the mark; and where any is otherwise minded, we wait till God reveal this to us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12, 13, 14, 15. Or as if they would make us believe, that there are not more differences among the Papists then with us. But of these things I purposely speak in some Disputations against Popery, which with this are in the Press.</p>
            <p>And lastly, for those that will convert the truths which I here maintain, into the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of divisions, (when their nature is to heal) either making men <hi>Notoriously ungodly,</hi> that are not, and so rejecting them and their Children, or withdrawing into separated Churches, because such are Baptized or admitted to Communion, of whose qualifications they are unsatisfied, their guilt is upon themselves. The doctrine is not made guilty by their abuse: As the ignorant and unlearned have still wrested the Scripture to their own destruction, so have the self-conceited and erroneous always misused the Truth it self to the
<pb facs="tcp:107958:20"/>
disturbance of the Church. Its matter of double Lamentation, that yet there should be such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, and Parties, and Distances; when B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>

And I intreat all those Ministers &amp; People (that have time, and any regard to my advice) that they would dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently read over and over again those two books, though they cast by twenty such as this for it.

               <hi>Meade</hi> on Eccl. 5.1. pag, 130, 131. Offer not the Sacrifice of Fools; for they know not that they do evil.</head>
            <p>MY third <hi>Proposition</hi> was this: That when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was to be offered in case of sin; yet even then, God accepted not thereof <hi>primariò,</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and for it self; as though any refreshment or emolument accrewed to him thereby (as the Gentiles fondly supposed of their Gods); but <hi>secondarily,</hi> only as a testimony of the Conscience of the Offerer, desiring with humble Repentance to glorifie him with a present, &amp; by that rite to renew a Covenant with him. For Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was <hi>Oblatio foederalis</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now Almighty God renews a Covenant with, or receiveth again into his favour, none but the Repentant sinner, and therefore accepts of Sacrifice in no other regard, but as a token and effect of this. Otherwise its is an abomination to him, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:107958:21"/>
men professed a desire of being reconciled unto God when they had offended him, and yet had no such mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hence God rejects all Sacrifices, wherein there is no contrition, nor purpose to forsake sin, and keep his Commandments, which are the parts of Repentance: so is to be taken that <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. <hi>To what purpose is the multitude of your Sacrifices? — Bring no more vain Oblations: Incense is an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to me.</hi> And <hi>Isa.</hi> 62.2, 3. — And surely he that <hi>blesseth an Idol</hi> is so far from renewing a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Lord his God, that he breaks it: so did they who without conscience of Repentance, presumed to come before him with a Sacrifice; not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure atonement, but aggravate their breach.</p>
            <p>According to one of these three senses are all passages in the Old Testament, disparaging and rejecting all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices Literally to be understood; namely, when men preferred them before the greater things of the Law; valued them out of their degree, as an Antecedent Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: or placed their efficacy in the naked Rite, as if ought accrewed to God thereby: God would no longer own them for any Ordinance of his: nor indeed, in that disguize put upon them, were they.</p>

            <head>The first Disputation. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether Ministers may admit persons into the Church of Christ by Baptism, upon the bare verbal Profession of the true Christian saving faith, without staying for, or requiring any further Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of sincerity? <hi>Aff.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N almost all our controverted Cases, the Church still findeth the mischief of Extremes: and among the rest, in this about the due qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of those whom we must admit to the Sacraments. Some will not look after <hi>saving</hi> Faith at all; but have found out a Faith of another <hi>species,</hi> which they call <hi>Dogmatical,</hi> which they take to be the Title to both the Sacraments. Others, while they look after saving faith, will not take up with that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it (a bare Profession) which God in Scripture hath directed them to accept; but they must either pretend to search the heart, or stay for some better Evidences of Regeneration. The confuting of these last, shall be the business of this Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and the confuting of the former, shall be the matter of the rest.</p>
            <p>We here suppose that Baptism is a standing Ordinance of Christ, and that the use of it is to be the sign of our Entrance into the Church of Christ; not only solemnizing our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, in which upon our consent we were before se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107958:26"/>
entred, but also investing us in our Church honours and priviledges. For as the Prince doth by a sword conferr the order and honour of Knighthood (which he might do before by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Grant) or as a man doth by a Key deliver to a Tenant the possession of a House; or by a twig and turf, the possession of Lands: so doth God by Baptism deliver to the true Believer the honorable order of Christianity, and power to be a member of Christ and his Church, and a son of God, and therewith he delivereth him the pardon of his sins, and other Priviledges of his people: Though to them that come without this saving faith, there is only an Offer of the Internal Benefits from God, and no Delivery of possession; and only a Ministerial delivery of the possession of the external priviledges, without that Title which before God will warrant their Claim anh Reception; though there be enough in the Ministers Commission to warrant his delivery upon that Claim.</p>
            <p>It is here also supposed, that it belongeth to the Ministerial Office to Baptize, and by Baptizing to admit persons into the visible Church. And this is not the smallest part of their Trust, and Duty, and Honour, nor the least of the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, which is committed to their care. Ordinarily none can be admitted into the visible Church, or made a visible Christian as thus listed among such, but by the Office of the Ministry: And therefore the Minister is made the Judge of mens aptitude to this honour: for no man must act against, or without the conduct of his own Judgement. And therefore to whomsoever it belongeth to Baptize, ordinarily to them it doth belong to judge who is fit to be baptized.</p>
            <p>It may be thought that it is a very great power that Christ hath herein conferred on his Officers; and that it may be easily abused to tyranny, while every Minister shall have power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse persons their visible Christianity, or the badge of it, and so to make Christians as they please. But <hi>first,</hi> they are tyed up themselves by certain Rules, as we are further to shew in this Dispute: and <hi>second<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> if one should tyrannize, there are enow more to relieve us; <hi>thirdly,</hi> there is no power but may be abused; but yet it must be trusted somewhere; and into what hands should Christ have fitlier put it, than into theirs that are by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107958:26"/>
Gifts and Offices fitted for the trust? I have marvelled some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, when I have heard secular Rulers on one side, and the People on the other side, cry down the Ministerial power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating, or so much as keeping from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, that they did not as much or more contend against their Power of Baptizing and Judging who should be admitted into the Church. But I think the reason is, because Ministers admitted all so generally, that they were not awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the observation of their power herein, nor to any jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie of them, left they should (as they call it) tyrannize. But undoubtedly they might as fairly say, that it belongeth either to the Magistrate, or to the Bishop alone, or to the Major Vote of the Congregation, to Baptize, or Judge who shall or shall not be baptized, and so admitted into the honour of visible Christianity and Church-membership, as to say that it belongeth to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate or the Bishop alone, or the people to excommunicate, or to judge who shall be excommunicated. For the Power of taking into the Church Universal, is as great as that of putting out of a particular Congregation. And Christ gave the Keyes conjunctly and not dividedly; and therefore he that hath the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Key, hath the Excluding Key.</p>
            <p>Had our people but well considered, what Interest the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial Office hath in their very Baptism and Christianity, and that they cannot be New-born into the Kingdom of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of these Midwives, at least, (and Scripture gives them also the Title of Parentage) they would then have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned that by their very Baptism they are engaged to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery subserviently, to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to whom they are principally engaged: For, as the Liturgie speaks, they <hi>are Dedicated to God by our Office and Ministery,</hi> and they have their visible state in the Christian Church and Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of its Priviledges, delivered to them by our Office and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery; and therefore, me thinks, they should well bethink themselves before they renounce it and despise it, till they dare renounce and despise their Baptism: and those that do that, I do not much wonder if they renounce our Ministery.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, It is here supposed that a Profession is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, before we may admit men to Baptism; and that this must
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107958:27"/>
be a profession of the true Christian saving faith, and not only of some other sort of faith. And we take it for granted, that the aged are admitted upon their own profession, and the Infants upon the profession of the Parent, by whom he hath his Title to the Covenant, even as he is the seed of a believer.</p>
            <p>The Question then that we have now to discuss, is only concerning the sufficiency of this Profession, as to the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Baptizer, without any further Evidences of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.</p>
            <p>For the explaining and resolving whereof, I shall first shew you what that Profession is which we require, and shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in: and secondly I shall prove the Affirmative of the Question.</p>
            <p>And for the first, I shall first shew you what <hi>Profession</hi> is in general, and the formal nature of the thing, and the requisites thereto. Secondly, I shall shew you what <hi>this Profession</hi> must be <hi>in specie,</hi> as it is specified from the subject matter of it.</p>
            <p>And first <hi>Profiteor,</hi> is but <hi>palam fateor,</hi> in the common acception of the word. In civil cases, <hi>prositeri est publice &amp; apud acta ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid ultro denunciate, ut Calv.</hi> More especially, <hi>professio</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <hi>ad interrogata responsio,</hi> and sometimes <hi>sponsio</hi>; and in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary affairs, it is <hi>nomen dare.</hi> Ours in question hath something of all these conjunct. <hi>It is a solemn voluntary declaration (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression or confession) of our faith in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost</hi>; (in answer, usually, to the Interrogation of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster) <hi>with a giving up our name to God, by solemn sponsion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Flesh, the World, and the Devil</hi> (or in general, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent wayes) <hi>Profession</hi> is a relative action, and hath in it somewhat <hi>Material,</hi> viz. the <hi>Action</hi>; and somewhat <hi>Formal,</hi> viz. the <hi>Relation,</hi> which must be distinctly considered of. For <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is a signification of a mans mind concerning the thing profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi> The <hi>Action,</hi> which is the <hi>Matter</hi> of the sign, is not necessarily one and the same thing in all and at all times. The common acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is by word of mouth: Where that cannot be had, (as from the dumb) it sufficeth that they express by <hi>writing:</hi> where that cannot be had, the lifting up of the hand, or motion of other part of the body, or any thing that is apt to signifie what is in the mind, may be a just Profession. And if word, writing, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107958:27"/>
corporal motion be all joyned together, it is but the matter of the same Profession. God hath tyed us to no one particular sign as necessary, nor restrained us from any, by his Word; but only as the general Directions, (of doing all things Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, decently, to edification, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> may be an Obligation or restraint: but the more particular Direction must be fetcht by Christian prudence from the Light and Law of Nature it self. The nature of the thing, with concurrent circumstances, will teach us which is the fittest sign: And sometime the commands of our Teachers or Governours may determine that case, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter within their power to determine (according to Gods general Rules.)</p>
            <p>The formal Reason of a Profession, is, that it be <hi>signum mentis, aut verum, aut (et si ementitum, tamen) apparens:</hi> if it be only <hi>a seeming</hi> sign, or counterfeit, it is <hi>truly a Profession,</hi> but not a <hi>true Profession.</hi> I mean, it hath a Metaphysical verity, inasmuch as it is an action apt to signifie the mind, and doth signifie that which the man would have you think to be his mind: but it is not morally true, but false; because it doth not signifie that which is his mind indeed. All words are to be <hi>signa men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>; but when a man <hi>lyeth,</hi> his words are truly words, though not true words; and he doth speak that which he would have you take to be his mind, though not that which is so, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he useth a sign that is apt and appointed for the expression of the mind, though he abuse it to the concealing of his mind, and the deceiving of the Hearer. Yet if any will insist upon it, that it hath not the formal Reason of a Profession, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be true, and agreeable to the mind; let such know, that we take the word in a larger, and commoner, and (I think) fitter sense, even <hi>for that which a pretended to be a true sign of the mind,</hi> whether it be indeed <hi>true</hi> or not. Yet still <hi>pretended</hi> it must be to be a true Discovery of the mind, and to that use it is that the Minister must receive it: and thence it comes to pass, that there are besides the bare words, writings, and some modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, which are of necessity to the very cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ution of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Profession, and without which it cannot properly be called a Profession, or may not by a Minister be taken for such. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, 1. I shall enqure further, Whether this be so
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107958:28"/>
or not? 2. What those Modes or concomitant Acts must be? 1. And for the first; the reason of the doubt is, because some conceive that <hi>Profession</hi> is so far required for it self, (or for some other end, I know not what) as that it is not to be lookt at or required as a seeming or probable evidence of the thing professed. Mr. <hi>Blake Treat of Sacr. p.</hi> 129. <hi>saith of me:</hi> 
               <q>His Grand Rule is, That a serious Professor of the Faith is to be taken for a true believer. — If this Proposition were a Scripture Maxime, then it would have born a further super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; but being neither found there, nor any proof made that it is any way deduced thence, mother and daughters may all justly be called into question.—I do yield, that charity is to hope the best; but that we should put our charity to it, or our reason either, for probability or certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty when we are nowhere so taught, and have a more sure Rule for our proceeding, I see no Reason. I can scarce meet with a Minister that saith (and I have put the question to many of the most Eminent that I know) that he baptizeth any Infant upon this ground of hope, that the <hi>Parent</hi> is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, but still with earnest vehemence professeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. 1. <hi>That serious Profession of true faith is to be taken by us as a probable Evidence of the thing Profest, till men forfeit their credit,</hi> I shall (God willing) prove anon from Scripture. And if I did not before stand to prove it from Scripture, I desire Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> as he findeth cause, by the following evidence, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it either to my disability, or my modesty; If he find that I now prove it not, let him tell the world that I could not; (but let him not thence conclude that it is not true; for another may prove it, if I cannot): but if I now prove it, let him impute the former omission to my charity, which provoked me to hope, that with such as he (and so many as he here intimateth) it had not been necessary: nay, I thought it had been out of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie with us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If he yield that charity is to hope the best, Why not then to be <hi>put to it?</hi> Is it not <hi>put to it,</hi> when it must hope the best? Or is not this a contradiction?</p>
            <p n="3">3. What kind of holy Ordinance is this, wherein neither
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107958:28"/>
               <hi>Charity</hi> nor <hi>Reason</hi> must be <hi>put to it,</hi> when the state of another is presented to our consideration?</p>
            <p n="4">4. What is the <hi>more sure Rule for our proceeding,</hi> which is here mentioned? I must profess, that upon my most diligent search, with a willingness to discover it, I am not yet able to know what Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Rule is, (sure or not sure:) I mean, what that qualification is, which he saith doth entitle to Baptism. Though he call it a Dogmatical Faith, yet he requireth the will's consent; but to what, I am not able to discern, he doth so vary his Phrase and contradict himself. Onle by his Title on the top of the Leaf, I know that it is [<hi>A Faith short of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying</hi>] which he meaneth, which telleth me what faith <hi>it is not,</hi> though not what it is.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Either he will require a Profession of true Faith, or not: If not, then we are not yet fit to dispute about the ends to which that Profession is requisite, seeing we are not agreed whether the Profession it self be requisite in those whom we must admit. If the Profession it self be acknowledged necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then either for <hi>it self,</hi> or for <hi>another thing.</hi> Not for <hi>it self</hi>; For, 1. There is nothing in the thing. 2. Nor in Scripture, to intimate any such thing. But on the contrary. 1. It is <hi>signum mentis,</hi> and therefore is required to signifie what is in the mind. 2. Else a false Profession should be requisite and acceptable as well as a true, if it were Profession, <hi>quâ talis,</hi> and <hi>propter se,</hi> that were requisite. If it be not for the signification of what is in the mind; then though it signifie not the mind, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable: But that cannot be: for God hath forbidden lying, and never accepteth it, nor maketh it a condition of our Title to his benefits, as given to us by him. 3. It is not any one sign that God tyeth us to: Not <hi>speaking,</hi> for then the dumb could not profess: Not <hi>writing</hi>; for then none could be Professors that cannot write: But its <hi>any thing that may signifie the mind</hi>; which plainly shews, that it is required to <hi>this end,</hi> that it <hi>may signifie the mind.</hi> God never encouraged any to speak the bare words, be they true or false; but only to speak the truth.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Suppose it were only another <hi>species</hi> of Faith which is necessary to be professed in order to Baptism, would not Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> put either his <hi>Charity or Reason to it,</hi> to judge whether the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107958:29"/>
person do in probability mean as he speaks? If not: 1. Then he will not sanctifie God in his Ordinances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but abuse them, and wrong his Neighbour, by laying by Charity and Reason so much in the administration. 2. And then, if he knew that they came in scorn, or learn the word as a Parrot, he would accept them, which I will not imagine. But if he will <hi>put his Charity</hi> and <hi>Reason to it,</hi> to judge of the truth of a common Profession; let him shew us his warrant, and it shall serve us to prove that we must do so also in case of a special Profession.</p>
            <p>What ever the <hi>Faith professed</hi> be, If you say your Profession is required <hi>propter se,</hi> for the <hi>matter of the sign,</hi> and not for the formality and use of <hi>signifying,</hi> it were not only groundless, but a reproachful ascribing that to God, which we would not ascribe to the silliest man or woman about us, that hath the free use of Reason. And if the Profession be <hi>given,</hi> and <hi>taken</hi> (and so <hi>required)</hi> not <hi>propter se</hi> materially, but <hi>ut signum mentis,</hi> for the signifying of our minds; then sure I need not dig deep into Scripture or Reason, to prove that both the <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> of the minister is here to be Imployed, to judge whether indeed it do <hi>signifie</hi> the mans <hi>mind</hi> according to his pretences, or not. It grieveth me for the Churches sake, to read Mr. <hi>Blake's</hi> words of the <hi>Ministers he meets</hi> with: for if they do scarce any of them so much regard the probability of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Regeneration in the administration of that Sacrament, then they either Baptize upon an apparent Lye (if the Parent profess saving Faith, when he hath not the least probability of it); or else they take up with the Profession of another <hi>species</hi> of Faith (as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth.) And I crave their patient sober enquiry, Whether that be not to make another <hi>species</hi> of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism and of visible Christianity? and also, whether they have yet well discerned and determined what that Faith is that must be profest, and whether the world have ever yet seen an exact or satisfactory definition or description of it? and where? and in what words? and also whether they have not the same uncertainty of the sincerity of that lower Faith in the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, as of true saving Faith? and consequently, Whether Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> doctrine have delivered them from difficulties, or ensna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them? I crave of all those Reverend Brethren whom Mr.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107958:29"/>
               <hi>Black</hi> meets with, and are guilty of what he chargeth them with, that they would once more consider the matter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Having thus shewed that a Profession is necessary and that in its formal nature, and to its proper end, as it is a signification of a man's mind, and in order to the discovery of the mind, and not barely for the very terms or signs of Profession; I am next to shew what things are necessary (besides the bare words or other signs) to the Being of a Profession, or what properties or requisites are, <hi>sine quibus non,</hi> to the validity of it to its End, that it may be indeed taken by us to be <hi>signum mentis,</hi> and not be accounted Null and vain.</p>
            <p>And in General it is necessary that the <hi>Profession seem true:</hi> for a Profession that is notoriously fals, is uncapable of the Ends atd use that it is required for: for such a one will not signifie a mans mind, but the contrary.</p>
            <p>More particularly, 1. The Professon which we must take as valid, must <hi>seem to be made in a competent understanding of the Matter which is Professed.</hi> It's a known rule in Law that <hi>Consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus non est ignorantis.</hi> If a Parrot be taugh to repeat the Creed, it is not to be called a Profession of Faith. The same we may say of any such Ideot or child, or persons at age, who are <hi>notoriously ignorant</hi> of the matter which they speak: therefore it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of those that require such Professions, to endeavor to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern whether the person understand what he professeth, before he do it: and therefore in the ancient Churches their Catechists or other Teachers did first see to their understanding the sum of the Christian Faith, before they baptized any at age: and so should the Parents themselves be examined, before we baptize their children upon the account of their Profession, except it be when we have just cause to presume that the person under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth the matter professed. Yet if any shall grounldesly so presume, and be mistaken this makes not the Profession Null, as to the use which the Church makes of it, though it be Null as to the real internal Covenant of man with God, or to the Benefits of such a Profession by any grant or Gift from God; for in <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> it is no Profession or worse.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We must take nothing for a Profession, but that which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107958:30"/>
hath a <hi>seeming seriousness.</hi> For if it be Notoriously or apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ludicrous, or in a scorn, or not meant as it is spoken, it is then apparently false: and we are not to believe apparent fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It must <hi>seem to be voluntary or free:</hi> I deny not but some force may stand with a valid Profession: but that is only such a force as is supposed to prevail with the Heart it self, and not only with the tongue when the heart is against it. If any should say to a <hi>Jew,</hi> [If thou wilt not Profess thy self a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, I will presently run thee through with my sword, the words that should be forced by this threat are not to be taken for a true Profession, when it is apparent, that they are meerly forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fear. So that which done in a passion of Anger or the like, contrary to the ordinary prevailing bent and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart, is not to be taken as a voluntary and valid Profession.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It must be a <hi>Profession not prevalently contradicted by word or deed:</hi> Otherwise, still it is an apparent or notorious lie, which no man can be bound to believe. If a man say in one breath, [that he believeth in Christ] and in the next will say [that he doth not believe in him,] he nulleth his own profession by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation: and if he revoke it in the direct sense, it is all one as if he did it in the same terms: As if he say that he believeth in Christ, but withall, that he believeth him to be but a man, or a Prophet, or not to have died to ransom us from our sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so if he should say [I am a Christian [but yet] I love the world and the flesh more then Christ] the same must be said of a Practical contradiction, which is effectual to invalidate a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Profession. If a man should profess to the Prince, that he honoureth him, and when he hath done, should spurn at him, or spit in his face: or if a man should profess that he loveth you, and desireth your safety, and withall shall discharge a Pistol at you, or run at you with his sword; I leave it to your selves whether he be to be believed.</p>
            <p>Yet some Contradiction there may be, which may not nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a Profession: As when the terms of Contradiction seem not to be understood by him that useth them, or not to be meant in the contradicting sense; or when he seem's not to discern the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107958:30"/>
contradiction, but thinks both may consist, and seems to hold the truth practically, and so contradicts it speculatively or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly: or when the contradiction is more weak, and not seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly prevalent, as [<hi>I believe, Lord help my unbelief.</hi>]</p>
            <p n="5">5. When a man hath <hi>utterly forfeited the credit of his word;</hi> the <hi>Profession</hi> of that man <hi>must not be meerly verbal, but practicall.</hi> This is all clear in the Laws of Nature. When a man may be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said to have forfeited the credit of his bare word, is a matter of consideration. The common reason and practice of men, is against trusting a perjur'd mans bare word, till he give sufficient evidence of his repentance for that perjury: And the like may be said of one that hath often violated Promise, and given no Evidence of any effectual change upon his heart, but that still he hath the same disposition. The <hi>Novatians</hi> thought that those who lapsed hainously after the Baptismal Profession, were not again to be absolved, and admitted into the communion of the Church, but they did not exclude them from Gods pardon, as is commonly believed to them. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and others of those ancient Churches, do seem to exclude all from pardon of sin, after twice or thrice offending: but I suppose, they meant it only of hainous sin, and of pardon <hi>in foro Ecclesiae,</hi> and not of pardon <hi>in foro Dei</hi> (a distinction that was not then detested.)</p>
            <p>The truth is, the temper and quality of persons, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fault, and many circumstances may so vary the case, that it is not the same Number of promise-breakings, or sins after promises, that will prove the forfeiture of each sinners Credit. Ordinarily, in case of gross hainous sin, if a man have oft broke his promise, his bare word is no more to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but an actual Reformation must prove the validity of it. But there are some cases, in which once or twice breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise may forfeit credit, as to the Church, and some cases where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in more then three or four brecahes may not do it. But as for an Infidel that newly comes to the Profession of the Faith, or a notorious ungodly man that newly comes to the Profession of godliness, we must take their first profession, though their lives were never so vicious before; because though they have oft committed other sins, yet not this of Covenant-breaking with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107958:31"/>
God, and they seem to be recovered from their former uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionableness.</p>
            <p>Perhaps some one will say, that, if all this be to be look'd after before the validity of a Profession can be discerned, then this is an uncertain Rule for us to proceed by, in administring the Sacraments: for Ministers will be uncertain when all these qualifications are found in mens Professions. Besides that, it puts tyrannizing power into Ministers hands, which you tell Mr. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ombes</hi> of in your book of <hi>Infant-Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I have there shewed that the danger is greater in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists way of using this power than of ours. 2. This objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is as much against them that are for the title of a Dogmatical faith, as for us that require the Profession of a saving faith. For they cannot be certain of their lower faith it self, and therefore must take up with the profession of it: and if they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire all these qualifications forenamed of that Profession, then they may as well admit professed <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathens, and they will openly subject Gods ordinances to profanation. 3. Because it is a variable case, and requireth Judgement in the Administrators; therefore hath God made it a considerable part of the office and work of his Ministers, to Judge rightly of mens profession, that they may discern the meet from the unmeet: and therefore hath he required so much prudence and piety in Ministers, that they might be meet to judge in such cases. To bear these Keyes, and wisely and faithfully to discern who are to be admitted, and who to be excluded, is no small part of their Trust, and Power, and Work. The great necessity of Church Officers, and the nature of its Government, would be the better understood, if this were well considered. It is not a possibility of mens erring in such Cases as are committed to humane determination, that will warrant us to condemn that way, or to cast about for some more Infallible or easie course: such contrivances will have but the Popish success, and will lose us the credit of our honest just Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative decision, while we will needs pretend to an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, that the world may discern that indeed we never had it. The common-course of quarrelling with all Government where there is a possibility or danger of any great abuse, and evils there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, doth directly conclude in the simple rejection of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107958:31"/>
by man and almost any thing else that man must be the agent in: for as long as such vile imperfect wretches are the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, how can you think, the actual administration will be perfect? Get Angels to Govern immediately, or stay till men be as Angels of God, and then you shall have a cure for all these Inconveniences: but till then expect not good without evil, nor that so bad a creature as Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even the best of men, should govern any Society, or do any considerable work, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving upon it the Impression of his sinfulness, and many Imperfections.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Having shewed what this Profession must be in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and the Nature of the Act, I must next shew what it must be Materially, and <hi>in Specie,</hi> (as it is morally specified from the subject matter,) And in general, the thing to be <hi>Professed,</hi> is: [<hi>that the Professor is a Christian</hi>;] or, that he is a true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Believer in Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It is not his own belief, <hi>qua creditur,</hi> which he is to make Profession of, but the Christian belief, <hi>quae creditur,</hi> that is, the Doctrine of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This is a contradiction: He that professeth the Gospel to be true, doth <hi>eo nomine,</hi> profess his own belief of the truth of it. For will he profess it to be true, when he takes it not to be true? otherwise he either speaks but the words, while he takes it himself to be false which he speaks, or else he only meaneth or saith that, (other men think it to be true) though he do not. 2. We need not to ask any man for a profession to Evidence the Gospel to be true, but only to evidence his own Belief of it. The Gospel needs not their testimony, much less a testimony which they beleeve not themselves, which is as none. 3. Infidels are meet to be admitted to Baptism, if there be no Profession of their own faith required. But I suppose I need not to use more words against this objection.</p>

               </gap>cularly as Christianity, <hi>in sensu famosiori</hi> is the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entertainment of Christ in the soul; and faith, <hi>in sensu fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosiori,</hi> is that which is called Iustifying saving Faith; and a Church member, <hi>in sensu famosiori,</hi> is such a true Christian; so it is true Faith and Christianity whose Profession is thus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: and if there be but a bare profession without the thing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107958:32"/>
Professed, these are called Christians or believers but Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically or (as our Divines commonly tell the Papists) Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally.</p>
            <p>The Faith thus to be professed must be considered, in its Acts, and in its Objects. The first Act is the understandings as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the truth of the Revelation, upon the credit of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer, which Implyeth, yea formally containeth a crediting of his Veracity, and so an Affiance therein. 2. A <hi>Consent</hi> or <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness</hi> that Christ be ours on the Gospel terms; or an Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ and life, as offered: which Scripture calleth the <hi>Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Christ Jesus the Lord,</hi> Joh. 1.10, 11. Col. 26. which is stil implyed in the Affiance or Recumbency by which the Act of Faith is so oft entitled in Scripture, and which must be added.</p>
            <p>As the act of faith must needs be both of the Intellect and the Will, so the Object must be answerably, the Truth of the Gospel, and the goodness of the benefits there revealed and offered. The Church is more agreed about the particulars of the Latter, then of the <hi>Former:</hi> for as the Papists would make us believe that the Fundamentals and Essentials of the Christian Faith cannot be known as distinct from the rest, but that all which the Pope saith, is <hi>de fide,</hi> is of neces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity to salvation: so among our selves we are not well agreed, whether Fundamentals (that is, Essentials) can be enumerated. There is no doubt but we may easily enumerate them in General terms; and so our whole Christian Faith is contained in our common Profession at Baptism, [I believe in God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.] If we yet descend to some particulars the case is clear: that to believe in God the Father, is to believe, that he is the most Wise, and Great, and Good, and our Maker and Ruler, and our chiefest Good: to believe in God the Son, is to believe that he is God and man, the Redeemer and Saviour, ransom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us by his blood, and overcoming death by his Death and Resurrection, and procuring us pardon and everlasting life by his Merits: to believe in God the Holy Ghost, is to believe that he is the Sanctifier of the people of God that shall be saved. Thus much is Evidently Essential to the Christian Faith, and nothing but what is contained in this. But then the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty lyeth here, whether a more particlar belief of some
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107958:32"/>
truths contained under these comprehensive terms be not Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to Christianity.</p>
            <p>To which I only say in general, 1. That the belief of the Truth of the Promise, or other verities, being necessary in order to the determination of the Will, to the Acceptance of the good revealed therein, there is therefore so much of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Necessity to be believed, as is of Necessity to the determination of the Will, to accept God for our God, by Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and Jesus Christ for our Saviour by Redemption, and the Holy Ghost for our Sanctifier. 2. All that is essentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in these Relative Tit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es [our God, our Saviour, and our Sanctifier] must be particularly conceived of and believed. 3. The foresaid Explicatory terms well understood, seem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all such Essentials. 4. He therefore, that upon a true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem, doth believe all these, doth believe all that is Essential to the Christian Faith. 5. Some persons can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Matter contained in these words without any more words (having first the Grammatical and Scriptural Explication of them): others have not yet had such Explications, or at least understood them not, and so must have more particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, expository terms, that they may understand. 6. It is <hi>Matter</hi> that is primarily Essential, and Fundamental, and that <hi>Propter se:</hi> Words are to be called Essential, or Fundamental, but secundarily, and <hi>propter aliud,</hi> viz. so far as they are Means, without which the Matter cannot be received, but no further: and therefore no particular words are properly fundamental, or essential to our Religion; seeing that he that never heard those words, and yet believeth the matter by equiplloent terms, or any signs, is truly a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hristian. 7. The Essentials primary in the Matter are to all the same, but the Terms of Necessity for expressing them are not the same to all, either for number of words, or sentences; seeing one can receive that in ten words, ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her cannot in twenty. And hence is it, that if twenty men be set to draw up the Essentials of Christianity, they may do it in twenty several forms of words, and yet all express the same ess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntial Matter: and one Confession may be in ten lines, and another in more pages, and yet both speak the same Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hs; one more concisely or generally, and the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107958:33"/>
other more copiously and plainly. 8. Whatever other words may be necessary to some, besides those that directly express the above-said Matter of Belief, in God the Father, Son, and Ghost, they are not to this end necessary, that we may have more matter of Faith than is there contained, as if it were not all that is essential, but that this may by the ignorant be better understood: so that those other particular Articles, which some call Fundamentals, are but expositions of those three Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, that indeed we may receive them. 6. In point of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a Minister must require a more full and large expression of his Faith from one man than from another, <hi>viz.</hi> From those that he hath apparent cause to suspect of not understanding, or not believing what the more Comprehensive Concise Terms do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press: but yet, if either he neglect that duty, (or his previous inquiry and examination) though sinfully, or if the party that gave no cause of suspition, be yet ignorant, or an unbeliever, it doth not follow, that the Concise Profession was a Nullity for want of larger Explication. He that professeth to believe in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, hath made a Profession of saving Faith in all the Essentials, as to the sense of the words, and it is to be taken as valid, <hi>in foro Ecclesiastico,</hi> in the Judgement of the Church if there be not some of the above-named particulars apparent to invalidate it, (as Contradiction, apparent Ignorance, Derision, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> May it not be the safest way to imitate the Scripture examples in such cases, where we alway find Profession in order to Baptism, made but in few comprehensive terms? for, as by this way we follow the surest Guid, so are we most likely to comprehend all the Essentials, and leave none out; when spinning out a Profession to a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn in more particular Explicatory termes, if these same generals be not among them, may leave out much of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Religion, which these do comprehend. Not that I would have the people hear no longer discourses for Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but it is one thing, to put them into a Sermon, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; and another thing, to put them into the Profession of Faith.</p>
            <p>If, notwithstanding all that is said, any shall still be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against the requiring of a Professon of saving Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107958:33"/>
of the difficulty of discerning when it is that all the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals are professed; let such consider, that it doth as much concern those that differ from us, to untye this knot, if they can, as us. We have long shewed the Papists, that themselves must be forced to distinguish between those points of Faith which some may be saved without, and those which none can be saved without: and so indeed <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others of them confess. And those that say, it is a <hi>Dogmatical</hi> Faith that must be professed, must needs comprehend all the aforesaid Essentials in their <hi>Dogmatical</hi> faith, or else they cannot call it the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith. So that, as to the Object of Assent, they are equally concerned in the difficulties.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And then, for the second part of Faith, which is, the Wills consent, or Affiance, or Entertainment, Receiving, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, Embracing (or what other term to that purpose you will use) of the Good proposed in the Gospel, the same fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned words do also comprehend all that is Essential to the Object of this Act: for the Will as well as the Intellect, to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is all our Faith: that is, [<hi>To receive God as our God, our Creator, our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and Felicity, and Jesus Christ our Saviour, from the guilt and power of Sin, and to bring us to everlasting Glory, and this by Ransoming us by his death and merits, By Rising, Interceding, Teaching, Ruling us, and at last Raising and Judging us; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Holy Ghost as the witness of Christ, the inspirer of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Word, and as our Sanct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fier.</hi>] Thus is the Object of true Christian faith expressed, as containing the Objects of the Will.</p>
            <p>To conclude, in a doubtfull case, it is safe to be as express and particular as we can, in our Instructions and Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not barely to keep to the meer Essentials: because there are many of the Adjacent truths, or superstructures, which are of so great use, as that the fundamentals are hardly and seldom well entertained without them.</p>
            <p>And yet when we play not the part of Instructors, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parers, but of Administrators of Gods Ordinances, then we must take heed of exacting more as necessary, then is indeed neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; and in difficult Cases, when the difficulty lyeth in the Darkness of the persons heart, and you doubt, by reason of

the scantness of his expressions, whether he believe as he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, we must give credit to his own words, as far as reason will permit, and to judge the best, though we may fear the worst: and this will be our Duty; and if we should be deceived, it will not prove our sin, but his that makes the false profession: And this leadeth me up to the next part of my Task; which is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus explained the Nature of the requisite Profession, to prove the Affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. We have the warrant of their approved Example in Scripture whom we are to eye as our Pattern in Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the administring of Baptism upon a bare Verbal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: therefore we may so Administer it.</p>
            <p>I here suppose the Practice of the Church before Christs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation; which is out of all doubt: <hi>Moses</hi> took the Verbal profession of all <hi>Israel,</hi> to be a Covenant between God and them; wherein they avouched the Lord to be their God, and God avouched them to be his people. On the like terms did <hi>Joshua, Asa,</hi> and others renew the Covenant of God with that people; and on the same terms was circumcision administred. On these terms did <hi>John</hi> Baptize multitudes, whose lives he knew not before, and of whom he required no further Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than these present Professions to sati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fie him of their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. On the same ground did <hi>Peters</hi> Converts receive their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. For they baptized them suddenly, and the Scripture mentioneth no further search that was made by the Apostles after their sincerity; nor is it probable, it could be done upon three thousand souls. The same may be said of the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. and other Scripture Examples. It is past question, that they then took up with a present profession, and therefore so must we. For if any will be so overwise, as to give reasons why they may swerve from these Presidents, let them consider, whether they teach not the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107958:34"/>
licentious a way as effectually to avoid other Examples of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and so to destroy the order and Discipline of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> In those times Profession did hazard mens Lives; and therefore it was then a greater Evidence of sincerity, then it is in prosperous times. — <hi>Answ.</hi> It's true, that often it was haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardous: yet 1. When 3000 were converted at a time and when the Rulers durst not persecute for fear of the people, and when the Churches had rest and were so ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fied, walking in the fear of the Lord, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.31. then it was not so dangerous. 2. This Difference is but gradual and altereth not the case: For as still they that will Live Godly, shall suffer persecution, so Profession is taken in Scripture for a satisfactory Evidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The Law of Nature, which is the ground of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane converse, requireth that we believe men, till they have apparently forfeited their Credit; therefore so we must do here: and therefore must take their Profession as a sign of the thing Professed; and consequently valid.</p>
            <p>Deny the Antecedent, and you must overthrow all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Societies, which is contrary to Gods Will revealed in Scripture, and in Nature: They that will not believe others, must not expect that others should believe them; and so humane Converse will be overthrown, and all men must live by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or live as enemies, in constant diffidence of each other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj</hi> But wicked men have forfeited their Credit; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their word is not to be taken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They have not made such a total forfeiture (<hi>quâ wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>) as to warrant our unbelief For 1. There are such remnants of Common honesty in mans Nature, that commonly makes a Lye to be odious, and a matter apparently evil among uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted men. 2. They Profess themselves to be turned from their Wickedness; and therefore you cannot refuse Credit to them upon the supposition of their wickedness which they disclaim, without proof. 3. The Apostles took their Profession who within a few hours before had been persecutors, and guilty of the murther of the Lord of life: therefore a mans wickedness before, is not enough to invalidate his following Profession of true faith, repentance, and reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. We must not censure our Brother to be a Lier
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107958:35"/>
without clear evidence that he is so indeed: therefore we must take his Profession to be true, and consequently, to be valid.</p>
            <p>The Antecedent is plain in Scripture. No man <hi>may Judge</hi> (that is, ungroundedly, or without a Call) <hi>that would not be Judged. Who art thou that Judgest another mans servant?</hi> Rom. 14.4. Therefore we may not Judge them to tell a lye, when we cannot prove it, till they have quite forfeited their credit: no more then we may lawfully Judge a man to be a thief, or murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, or adulterer, or Heretick, when we cannot prove it. If the slander of the tongue be a sin, so is the slander of the heart.</p>
            <p>And for the Consequence, it is most clear, that either the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister must believe the mans Profession, or take him for a Lyer; there is no third way that can be pretended, save one, and that is, that we must suspend our belief, and neither Judge his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to be true or false. But this cannot be here pretended, with any tolerable appearance of reason. For, 1. God would never make mens profession necessary to their admittance, and put the Minister in the power of Baptizing upon such a Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and consequently, of requiring, receiving and Judgeing of that profession, if we might wholly suspend our Judgement of it whether it be true or false. It cannot be that I can be required, as an officer of Christ to require, and receive a mans Profession, without any respect of the truth of it: for it is therefore required that it may declare the mind: or else, why may not an Infidel be received without Profession: 2. And if I be not to Judge of the truth of a Profes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion, or of the falshood; then a Profess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently false, may be received: but that may not be, as hath been manifested. 3. It is denyed by learned Philosophers, that the mind can possibly hang <hi>in equilibrio,</hi> in such cases. 4. Its one half the uncharitable sin of rash Censures to suspend the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Charity, and not to Judge the person to speak truth, when he hath not forfeited h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s credit, as it is the other half to Judge him positively to speak falsly. 5. <hi>A pari,</hi> We must not sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend our judgement of the truth of mens Profession of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, that they may be Absolved and Re-admitted to Communion; but must discern whether probably their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107958:35"/>
be true or false: nor may we suspend our judgement of the Truth of that Profession, which we may have occasion to require, in order to the Lords Supper; or, to the private com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting of an afflicted conscience <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore not here nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; seeing the Profession is the same; and the reasons, at least, as urgent:</p>

            <p>I have thus at large recited the words of this Reverend Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Reader may perceive the true state of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, and how we are agreed in the main, and on what grounds he proceedeth; and that if there be any that consent not with me, in the point wherein he and I differ, they may yet be perswaded to take up in his way, and not remove so far from the truth as I conceive Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath done. And, as to the difference it self, 1. The main thing wherein I perceive that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I differ from this Reverend man and some other about such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is, that my Judgement of Charity is much more extensive then theirs seems to be. I confess, that when it comes to a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent perswasion of another mans sincerity, I am apt to be jealous as well as they; and also when we speak of the Profession of men collectively considered, I am forced to some harder thoughts of many, then some have: but when I have to do with Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, I am apt to extend this charitable Judgment further then I see many do: not by making the way to heaven any broader than they: For when we are upon the point <hi>in thesi,</hi> what is the proper qualification of a Saint, I think there is no difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us: but when we speak of it <hi>in hypothesi,</hi> and of the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al qualification of this Individual person, whether he have the foresaid life or not; I am apt to think it my duty, to judge the best till I know the worst; and to hope well (though with much fear) where some think they see no ground of hopes. I confess it seems to me but cold charity, that can afford men our good thoughts so far, as to take them for visible Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but can find no room for a hope of their being in a state of Salvation. I have hopes of the Salvation of many thousands, that I perceive some others have no such thoughts of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More particularly, I cannot yet see, that I can be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or disobliged from having a positive Hope (taking <hi>Hope</hi> in the vulgar sense) of the saving estate of that man that professeth seriously and soberly, that he truly Repenteth, and Believeth in Christ, and hath not yet utterly forfeited the Credit of his word. <hi>Charity thinketh no evil, believeth all things, hopeth al things:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5, 7. I think, the very Maxims of Nature, cleared, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107958:37"/>
enforced by Christ in the Gospel, do teach me to believe, that my brother is not a Lyar, till I see convincing evidence of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. I confess, I judge my self to owe this charitable constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and judgement of his serious Profession, especially in so so great a cause, to my Neighbour who hath not evidently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged me, even as much as I owe my bread to the hungry, and clothes to the naked, yea, or the liberty of the common Ayr or earth, if it were in my power to restrain it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And I do not find myself (at least ordinarily and easily) capable of suspending my judgement of the truth or falshood of a mans Profession, and being wholly neutral in it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea, I perceive, that it is the judgement of this Reverend Brother, that we should no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> be Neutral, nor suspend our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about the Truth of the Profession which we require; but that we should seek after that which he calleth a <hi>Moral</hi> Sincerity herein, yea, and sometime delay and try them further, who offer a suspicious Profession.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And I must confess, that I take it for a great sin, to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure my Brother positively to be a Lyar, and to be a child of the Devil, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd in a state of Damnation, without clear convincing Evidence.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And it seems to me a thing utterly Improbable, if not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107958:38"/>
that it is not <hi>Regeneration</hi> which they are supposed to profess: I answer, it is <hi>true Repentance, and Faith in Christ</hi> which they are supposed to profess; and that is <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of it, <hi>in sensu passivo.</hi> To what purpose should we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that men should be obliged by God to make so solemn a profession, which none of the hearers are in the least obliged to believe to be true?</p>
            <p n="7">7. We are certainly bound to believe a <hi>sober, credible</hi> person of proved <hi>fidelity</hi> in other things, when he solemnly professeth to Repent and believe; (else we must deny credit to that which beareth plain Evidence of Credibility:) therefore we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all others according to the proportion of their Credibility, and not deny them credit without just cause.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I never yet heard any assign any other cause why God should require an open profession, than the revealing of the thing professed, and the consequents thereof: therefore, till we hear a proof of some other Reason, we have cause to adhere to this.</p>
            <p n="9">9. All men are bound to judge, that God would have no man to tell a lye: therefore they are bound to judge that God would have no man to profess that he Repenteth, when he doth not: therefore, he that is to judge my Profession to be by Gods commanding and approving Will, is also to judge it to be a true Profession: But the Ministers and the Church are <hi>(judicio charitatis, &amp; fide humana</hi>) to judge, that the Profession of the person is such as God doth require and accept (as to the main substance,) before they baptize him, and receive him into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, upon the account of that Profession.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I conceive, that this Reverend Brother granteth in effect the thing which I dispute for, while he affirmeth, that such a Moral Sincerity may be lookt after, as that [<hi>All Circumstances considered by which Ingenuity is estimate among men, there appears no reason why the man may not, and ought not to be esteemed, as to the matter to think and purpose as he speaketh.</hi>] For I plead for no more then this. Object. <hi>But this is nothing to the Principle that it proceedeth from; special or common Grace. Answ.</hi> A true Repentance, and saving faith, can come from none but a supernatural Principle of special Grace: and therefore he that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107958:38"/>
professeth this Repentance and Faith, doth thereby profess that supernatural Principle: therefore, if am bound to believe, that he speaks as he thinks, then I am bound to believe that he is a truly penitent Believer, if he know his own heart: and he is liker to know it better then I.</p>
            <p>Moreover he saith, that [<hi>To ground a positive Act of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that a man is Regenerate,</hi> in foro exteriori, <hi>there is requisite some</hi> seemingness <hi>of spiritual sincerity that is, that he doth it from a spiritual principle, motives,</hi> &amp;c.] To which I say, that a serious Profession of Faith and Repentance, is a <hi>Credible see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingness</hi> of Faith and Repentance. And he that professeth true Faith and Repentance, must needs profess them as from a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Principle, and Motives, and to a spiritual End: for they cannot be from any other principle or motives (principally) nor to any other ultimate End.</p>
            <p>I am therefore forced to dissent from the main reason of this Reverend Brothers judgement herein, <hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>That there cannot be had a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107958:39"/>
beholder of mens thoughts. 2. God hath made man capable of knowing in his own thoughts: though its true, that the heart is so deceitful, that there is a great difficulty of knowing them of our selves; yet the meaning of that Text, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17, 9, 10. is concerning others, [who can know it?] that is, [who can know anothers heart?] But yet for all the deceitfulness, a certain measure of knowledge may be had. For, 3. Man hath a certain knowledge of the Evil of lying, and so a certain cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility naturally, or by the light of nature: as the examples of the very Heathens can witness. 4. The tongue was created to be the <hi>Index</hi> of the mind. Though mans actual language be acquired, yet his tongue was made for that use. All this set together, shews, <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> that though the Evidence be imperfect, yet an Evidence it is.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if there be such a thing as <hi>fides humana</hi> due among men, then there is such a thing as Evidence of Credibility. But the Antecedent is true: Therefore so is the Consequent. He that denyeth the Antecedent, 1. I suppose will consent that no man believes him. 2. And would not sure have any more converse used in the world. 3. And I would put it to the consideration of the contrary-minded, whether, if ordinarily there be no Evidence of Credibility in mens word, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions be not to be taken as signs of the thing professed, it were not best, either to cut out mens tongues, or else forbear teaching our children to speak, and so let language perish from the earth. For, if it be ordinarily understood as meer lying, it would seem the best way to extirpate it by this means.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And I have also the consent and experience of the world on my side, of the Credibility of the words even of common men in general. 1. All Societies are established on the credit of mens words. Princes and people enter their Covenants upon the credit and confidence in each others words. 2. All affairs are managed on this Supposition. The freest men in <hi>England</hi> do hold all their Estates and Lives upon the credit of the words, and common fidelity, that it is even in unregenerate men. They are sufficient Witnesses at any Bar. Two of these by a false oath, might put a man to death; and yet how seldom are such things done?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:107958:39"/>Moreover, how much doth all History depend upon the word of of man? Yea, how much of humane credit do we make use of, to assure us, that these which we now have are the same Scriptures that the Apostles writ; and that they are uncorrupted? and how far? and that these only are Canno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. It is most suitable to the End of Baptism, that the Adult should be Baptized upon a bare Profession. For Baptism is to be the Sign and means of their solemn Entrance into the Church, and reception of a Sealed pardon of sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, if you would stay till men prove their sincerity by their holy lives, you will have them grow before they are well plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and give you full Evidence of Church membership, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are rightly entred Members: And sure this is not like to be a regular course.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. My last Argument is, from the continued Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of the Church of God (which with <hi>Paul</hi> was somewhat.) I confess, the Churches after the Apostles daies did for divers ages prepare men long before they baptized them: True, they were <hi>Catechumeni</hi> before they were <hi>fideles,</hi> or baptized, But 1. That was not that they might have experience of the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their lives, as the necessary qualification of the persons to be baptized, but it was that they might instruct them in the Christian Faith, that they might know what they did, and be fit to make an acceptable Profession: and then, when they were prepared for such a Profession, they took the bare Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession it self as the evidence of the truth of the thing professed; still supposing, that it was such a Profession as is before descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and were not invalidate by contradiction, or the like: and therefore they did indeed expect, that those that lived in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious scandalous sins should stop their course, and forbear the committing of them, as well as profess Repentance for them: because that it would have nullified their Profession, if they had commited the sin, even when they professed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it. Therefore <hi>Austin</hi> in his Tractate <hi>de fide &amp; operibus,</hi> on that subject, would have none baptized that were guilty of living with Concubines in fornication, unless they would actually put them away: and then promise to forsake them for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107958:40"/>
the time to come: but he did not advise, that they should after all this, delay yet longer, to see whether they would make good that promise by their performance. I conclude therefore, that the Apostles, and all the Church <hi>having so long accepted of a bare verbal Profession, we must do so too.</hi>

If we shall believe the Professions of all or most men, we shall believe that to be true which is not true; and we shall believe more Lyes than Truths; for there are more that make false Profession then a true and moreover, we shall admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the Ordinances of God upon the credit of a Lye, which seemeth a prophaning them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. A known Lye you may not, you cannot believe: and should you administer the Ordinances upon a Profession which is notorious false, you should prophane them 2. But if I believe a Lyer when I cannot prove him such, that's none of my sin, nay its m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> duty. God made mens tongues to shew their minds: and so I am to take their words: but if they will abuse them to lying, that's their own sin, and not mine. 3. If you would believe no man, till you are sure that he saith true, then you must believe no man in the world: For though you may know the thing to be true by other Evidence, yet <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> truth: for belief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on the credit of the speaker. Your Argument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tendeth to the destroying of all humane faith, which is not to be endured. 4. It is but with a humane faith that we believe them: and therefore, we believe them but as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful fallible men who may possibly deceive us. It is not with such a faith as we owe to God, wherein we conclude the thing revealed to be so unquestionably true, as that it cannot possibly be false, because God cannot Lye: yea it is with a divers degree of Faith, that we believe divers persons, who are to us of divers degrees of Credibility. And if after all this, we be deceived in the most, the sin is only in the deceiver. And as for us; 1. We proceeded upon that evidence which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self directeth us to take: even a mans words, as the sign of his mind. 2. And upon that Evidence which the holy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Apostles of Christ have directed us to take; who
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107958:40"/>
were not rashly venturous nor prophaners of Gods Ordinances. 3. And if we be indeed deceived in the most, or in many, its rather a sign that we are in Gods way, than out of it; for as Charity believeth all things <hi>(credible)</hi> so Christ hath told us, <hi>that the tares and wheat must grow together, and that many are called and few chosen: and that in the end he will take out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them that work Iniquity:</hi> therefore such there will be.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>But it is now the custom of the Countrey, and a matter of credit, to be Christians in Name; and therefore all will be so; and if you ask them whether they Repent or Believe, they will say, Yea: Therefore this is no credible Profession; though theirs was in the dayes of the Apostles, when it hazarded their lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The hazard that attendeth a mans words is not necessary to make them simply credible, though, as to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, it makes them more credible: else we must believe no man but he that speaks to the hazard of his life. 2. The Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Gospel will not warrant us to alter the Rule of Nature and Scripture; else the Church must Incurre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difficulties in prosperity than in Adversity, if prosperity forfeit all mens credit: and so men should be kept out in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity who may be admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ted in adversity: when the Church had peace and were edified, <hi>Act</hi> 9 31. the Apostles altered not their practice. 3. We have great cause to rejoyce when Christianity is in so good credit, as that all profess it; and so, respectively, we may be glad when there are so many Hypocrites; that is, when persecutors befriend the truth which they persecuted, and when the Gospel is in so much honour. And though I am not of their mind that think it the first prescribed End of the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that Sacraments and Church-state should be the means of Conversion; yet I doubt not but God, foreknowing that many hypocrites would unjustly Intrude, hath so fitted his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances as to be advantagious to their Conversion when they have Intruded. He calleth not any to come into his Church without saving Faith and Repentance, nor is he consenting to any mans lying Profession, nor unworthy approach to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism or the Lords Supper; but yet they that do come unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107958:41"/>
and unwarrantably, do find that there, which tendeth to their Conversion, and frequently effecteth it: and this, I think, is the true mean between their Doctrine who maintain, that the Sacrament is prescribed as a converting Ordinance, and the unconverted are called to it; and theirs that say simply, it is not a converting Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Object. 3. <hi>This is the way to fill the Church with hypocrites, and ungodly ones; and that breeds all our stir, while they scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize their Profession, and will not be ruled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is Gods way, and then no Inconvenience will disgrace it. 2. We are foretold (as is said) that many are called, and few chosen, and the Church will have many unfound Professors to the end of the world. 3. When they are in the Church, they are under teaching, and Discipline to inform them: or if they be o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Object. 4. <hi>Then we must admit a drunkard or whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that still lyeth in his sin, if a bare Verbal Profession will serve the turn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No. You must see, that with his Profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he do forsake the sin repented of: or else he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth and invalidateth his Profession. If a man in his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness come to be baptized, and profess to hate drunkenness, he actually giveth his tongue the Lye. If a man swear that he hateth swearing, he contradicteth himself; and we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe him. If a Whoremonger keep his Concubine while he professeth to repent, he doth one thing, and saith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so that this doth not follow.</p>
            <p>Object. 5. <hi>It was believing with all the heart that</hi> Philip <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the</hi> Eunuch; <hi>and such a believing a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> True: and its such that we require. But <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> took a bare present Profession as the Evidence of that faith which they must accept: and so must we.</p>
            <p>Object. 6. <hi>But then we shall apply the Seal to a Blank.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By a Blank, if you mean, One that you ought not to apply it to, and that hath no right <hi>in foro Ecclesiae,</hi> I deny it:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107958:41"/>
but, if you mean, one that is not actually the subject of Gods promise, and to whom God is not actually obliged, (but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, as he is to Heathens,) and one that hath no proper right <hi>coram Deo,</hi> or <hi>Deo judice,</hi> as shall justifie his claim and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving before God, so I grant that we set the seal to a Blank. But thats not our sin, but his.</p>
            <p>And here I desire the Objectors carefully to note, that it is Gods design in the Gospel, so to order things, that the actual Application shall first be the act of the sinner himself. God by his Ministers indeed will be the first offerer; and the Spirit in the Elect shall be the first Exciter: But the first actual appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hender must be the sinner, and then the Ministers application, by the seals, is in order to come after mens own application. For man is to be the chooser or refuser of his own salvation, (which <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> giveth as a reason, why in those times of the Church, [<hi>When some, as the custom is, have divided the Eucharist, they permit every one of the people to take his own part: For every mans own conscience is best fitted to the act of choosing or refusing.</hi>] Stromat. <hi>lib,</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 2.) so that we are but to follow them with the seal; and therefore the applying or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing act must be first theirs: and theirs as professed, is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of ours. And therefore as it is their sin, and not ours, if they reject Christ; and their faith, and not ours, by which he is chosen to be theirs; so it is their sin, and not ours, if a misappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be made of the External Ordinance by them; and so we take not an invalid profession, we are bound to follow their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; for God never appointed heart searchers to administer his seals.</p>
            <p>Object. 7. <hi>But wicked men know not their own hearts, and therefore are uncapable of making a credible profession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They may know them better them I can. The Intellect hath naturally a power of knowing it self &amp; the will: though its true that the wicked have many difficulties in the way. 2. They profess now that they are not wicked, but converted: therefore you must not take it for granted that they are wicked, because they were so unless you can prove it; and if you prove them wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they profess the contrary, then indeed you invalidate their profession, but not by proving that they were formerly wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:107958:42"/>Object. 8. <hi>But though all this hold of Heathens or Infidels new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretending to be converted, and so coming for Baptism, yet it will not hold of professing Parents that bring their children to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, or of such as come to the Lords Supper. For such have been long in the Church already, and therefore must follow the truth of their Profession by a holy conversation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I grant this: and withall that the Pastor should be as diligent as he can to know the conversations of his people. But withall I still say, 1. That, as it was sufficient at his first admittance that he made a verbal Profession; so the same Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation lyeth on the Minister and people to believe his word still, till he forfeit his Credit, as it did at the first. A Verbal professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is still as Obligatory to us for belief, though more be requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him to second it. 2. And therefore I say, that if a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster through the numero usness of his flock, or want of ability, or opportunity, or other causes (yea culpable in himself) shall be ignorant of the lives of his people, he is to credit their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and not on that account to deny them Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. 3. They therefore that will exclude any, for want of a holy life, must bring a certain Proof of his unholiness of life; for they can require no more Proof from him of his holiness, but that he professeth it: And so I grant that as he professed Repentance and Faith at first entrance, so he is now to profess that he continueth therein, and walketh holy before God. And if he do but say that he doth this, no man can reject him till he first disprove him, supposing him to be a member of his pastoral charge, or otherwise obliged to administer it to him, if fit. Those therefore that will have any mans children kept from baptism, for their parents unholiness, or persons kept from the Supper, must not expect that men bring proof to them of their holiness beyond their profession of it, but must deal by them as by other notorious offenders, even admonish them of their unholy Carriages; and if he hear not, take witness, and then call the Church; and if he hear not the Church, then he must he rejected; and not denyed the Communion of the Church upon every mans uncharitable presumptions, or so heavily punished before he be judged or heard. 4. And they must know that it is hainous evils indeed that will prove
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107958:42"/>
a Professor certainly ungodly; and therefore they must look well to the validity of their proof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 9. But they have forfeited the Credit of their words, by their Covenant-breaking and wicked lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It must be a breach of the Covenant as owned by themselves at age, that must be sufficient to prove that. 2. And that more then once. For once failing doth not forfeit the Credit of a man's word. 3. And these violations must be proved, and not barely affirmed. 4. Yea it must be proved that he doth at the present, or hath of late lived in viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of former covenants. Otherwise Repentance manifested by Reformation repaireth his Reputation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 10. The text cited in the following Disputation proveth that the Apostles took all the members of the Church to be Saints, Adopted, Justified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we cannot think thus of all that now Profess themselves Christians, without being unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Sometimes the Apostles denominate the whole Church from the better part, as we call that a corn-field which hath many tares. And sometimes, being not heart-searchers, nor knowing the falshood of Particular men's Professions, they speak of them according to their Profession, which the Law of nature and of Christ commandeth us to believe, though only with such a humane faith, as may be mixt with much jealousie and fear of the contrary, concerning many of them, which the same Apostles also frequently manifested. But yet as they must believe charitably, so must they speak charitably, of the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of true Christianity.</p>
            <p>Besides those Objections, many particular Texts are urged by some to prove that it is only the Regenerate and such as shall be saved, that are to be added to the Church; which I shall not now stand to answer particularly; but only give this general answer to them all: If they mean only such as are Really san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and sincere, or elect, then we must admit none, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we know not one man to be such; but if they mean on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those that seem to be such I have proved already, that their own Profession of what is in their hearts, out of our sight, is to be taken for such a <hi>seeming,</hi> and doth qualifie them to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107958:43"/>
members of the Church For as the Matter of the Church as Invisible, is <hi>true Beleivers and Saints; so the Matter of the Church as visible, is the Professors of that faith and holiness and their seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides what hath been said in general Arguments to prove the Proposition, I had thought to have gone over many particular Arguments from several Texts of Scripture, partly giving us examples of such as by Gods approbation have taken Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as credible Evidences of the things Professed; and partly in precepts requiring a charitable credulity towards our brethren; but because I conceive the last so plan as to need no more, I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll forbear this till I hear that it seemeth necessary.</p>
            <p>But yet there's one other Objection to be met with. Those that feel this Proposition pull down the Principles of schism or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just separation, which they are engaged in, or inclined to, do Object, that if a bare Profession may admit to baptism, then it may admit to the Lords Supper, and to the Priviledges of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hurch-members; and so Church-Ordinances, and Priviledges shall be dispensed upon bare words and formalities, and so made nothing of. To which I answer; Are you able to search and know the heart? can you discern sincerity by an infall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble judgment? I know none but Mr. <hi>Trask</hi> that pretended to it. And if you cannot, and know you cannot, then you must be found to take up with falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble signs your selves. And those signs you may as well call meer <hi>formalities,</hi> as you do this in question. 2. And if we must needs take up with fallible signs, is it not better to follow the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture examples proposed to our imitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then to frame a new way of our own: especially when the Law of nature and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doth consent with Scripture, and the contrary opinion proceedeth from a dividing principle, and tendeth to division. 3. Make as diligent search as you can after the sincerity of your flock, as to their more profitable use of Ordinances, but make no other conditions of their <hi>Right,</hi> then God hath made. 4. It is onely a Profession that's serious, voluntrary, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted prevalently by word or life, which you must take, as is before described. And do you take it to be so unreasonable a matter to believe a man <hi>fide humana,</hi> who speak's of his own heart which another cannot see, when you can bring no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to disprove his words? If you know any thing by his life
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107958:43"/>
that certainly proves his Profession false, admonish him of it in the order that Christ hath directed you to, till he either hear the Church, or be rejected by the Church, or at least, by not hearing the Church, do give you cause to take him as a Heathen or Publican: but be not so much against the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and 2. All discipline that ever the Church hath used. And against common justice and reason as to do this by men on your own private judgement, without evidence, and a just tryal, and once hearing them speak for themselves, and many do that will unchurch a whole Parish, and gather a new one, on suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the invalidity of a bare Profession, and on supposition that most are ignorant and ungodly, before they have ever once accused them particularly, or dealt with, or excluded any of them in the way that Christ appointeth. If I certainly knew that in this Parish there were 4000 unregenerate Persons, and not 400 or 100 truly regenerate, and yet knew not particularly which the unregenerate Persons were, I ought not to cast out one man from the Church upon any such account.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But with what comfort can the Godly have communion with the societies that are so mixt with multitudes of the ungodly?</hi>

            <p>Object. <hi>They will say these words indeed, but in the mean time they will scorn at godliness, or disclaim it by their lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Those that do so, must be dealt with in Christs way as Church-members, till either they <hi>hear the Church,</hi> or be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected for their impenitency; but you must not dare upon this account to unchurch whole Parishes, nor ordinarily any one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that hath not been dealt with in the order that Christ hath appointed.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Disputation: I find that the two things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, are great occasions of the proneness of many godly people to schism.</p>
            <p>The one is, because they do not understand that Christ hath so contrived in it the Gospel, that every man shall be either the Introducter of himself by Profession, or the Excluder of himself by the rejection of Christianity. And so that all Church admissions or rejections shall be but the consequents of his own choice that the chief comfort, or the blame may be upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: And this is partly from the admirable freedom and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siveness of Gospel Grace, which the sons of Grace should glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie and rejoyce in, and not murmur at, and dishonour; and partly from the wise dispensations of our Legislator, that he may deal with men on clear grounds in their absolution, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, before all the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other cause of the schismatical inclination of some god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people, is, the great mistake of too many in confining all the fruits of Christs death, and the mercies or graces of God to the Elect; and so not considering the difference that there ever was and will be between the visible Church of Professors, and the invisible Church of true Believers. Alas Brethren, (in the name of Christ let me speak it to your hearts) do you grudge a few

common Priviledges, to common Professors, when you have the best and choysest part your selves! you have Christ himself, and do you grudg them the name of Christians, or the bare sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole or signs of his body and blood? You have sincerity of faith and Repentance, and answerably you have true Remission and Reconciliation: They have the profession of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and do you grudg them the empty signs of a Remission which they have lost by their hypocrisie and Unbelief? You have Inward communion with Christ in the Spirit, as you have Inward faith: Do you grudg an Extern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l communion with the Church to them that have the External profession of Faith? O Remember that the Net of the Gospel bringeth good and bad to the shore, and the tares must grow with the wheat till harvest, and then is the time that you shall have your desire.</p>

            <p>We here suppose that Baptism is still a needfull Ordinance of Christ, and that Infants are to be Baptized, and that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are the persons that should Baptize them: so that it is none of our work at this time either to defend the Ordinance it self against the Seekers, nor the subjects [as to their age] against the Anabaptists: nor the Agents against the Papists or others. Nor are we now to enquire who are those Ministers that are authorized hereto, or what is necessary to their calling and authority. But supposing these matters already determined, our present business
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107958:46"/>
is to enquire what that faith is that qualifieth persons to be the just subjects of Baptism, or to be such, whose Children may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it upon the account of their faith or Profession? I shall not needlesly spend time in seeking to make plain those terms that are already as plain as I can make them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What <hi>Professing</hi> is, I have shewed in another Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the like nature, and I think all understand that it is as much as <hi>palam vel publicè fateor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By [Faith] we mean not the Object of faith, the doctrine believed only or primarily, but the persons own Belief of the doctrine, and reception o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By [saving] faith, we mean not to intimate that any faith of its own nature can procure our salvation: nor that it doth of its own nature (<hi>in specie</hi>) as the nearest reason, justifie a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor is any way a proper efficient cause, natural, or politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, instrumental, or meritorious, or any other, of a sinners justification, but that it is that which the Donor of Christ and Life, hath made the condition of our participation of his free-Gift, and so doth morally qualifie the subject to be an apt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Because there are many other Competitors: we comprehend them all under the next words [upon the Profession of any other faith that comes short of it].</p>
            <p n="5">5. We enquire whether we either [<hi>must</hi>] or [<hi>may</hi>] Baptize such, and suppose that the [<hi>licet</hi>] and the [<hi>oportet</hi>] do here go together, so that what we <hi>may</hi> do, we <hi>must</hi> do, supposing our own call: as no doubt what we <hi>must</hi> do, we <hi>may</hi> do.</p>
            <p>But yet that I be not mistaken (which is a danger not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily escaped when I have done the best I can to be understood) I shall further tell you what I mean by saving faith, that is, what I take it to be. 2. What I mean by profession, and what I take that to be. 3. What are those other sorts that stand up in Competition with this, as a sufficient qualification. 4. And then I shall adjoyn some necessary distinctions. 5. And so lay down my thoughts in some propositions. 6. And then prove that which determineth the question. 7. And lastly I shall answer the Arguments that are brought against it, and for the contrary Claim.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:107958:46"/>And note through the whole, that if I do at any time call this profession a <hi>Ttile,</hi> it is in compliance with other mens lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, it being my own sence, that neither the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith nor the profession is properly a <hi>Title,</hi> which is <hi>fundamentum juris,</hi> and so an efficient cause, but only <hi>a condition of a Title.</hi> 2. That if I say it [<hi>giveth</hi>] Right or Title, I mean not efficiently, as if we could give a Right to our selves, but only that it is the condition which performed by us, doth morally qualifie us to receive it as freely given.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>saving Faith,</hi> I mean, an unfeigned Belief of the truth of the Gospel, with an unfeigned acceptance of Christ, who is there of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ered to be our sufficient and only Saviour, from the guilt of sin by his blood and merits, and from the power of it by his spirit also, and to bring us to glory in the fruition of God. Or it is a sinners assent to the truth of the Gospel in the essentials, and a sincere consent that God be immediately our only God, and Christ our only Saviour, and the Holy Ghost our only Sanctifier, and we his people in these Relations. I say <hi>immediately,</hi> that is, at <hi>present</hi> because if it be only a consent to be such <hi>hereafter,</hi> it is not saving. Or as the Assembly say, it is the embracing of Jesus Christ freely offered to us in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; Or it is a saving grace, whereby we receive and rest upon Jesus Christ alone for salvation, as he is offered to us in the Gospel. It is in those respects that are essential to the Office o the Redeemer and Saviour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By <hi>Profession</hi> I mean in the proper sense that which hath something <hi>present</hi> for its Object or subject professed; and difference it from a <hi>Promise</hi> which is onely of something <hi>future</hi> For it is a <hi>present</hi> Assent and <hi>consent</hi> that is to be professed though withal the object of this professed consent must be both the <hi>present</hi> and <hi>future</hi> relation to Christ; <hi>viz,</hi> that he be our Saviour and we his saved people from this time forth and for ever. So that a certain Promise <hi>de futuro</hi> (in the strength of grace) may be said to be made, in that a man must profess his consent both <hi>de presente et de futuro.</hi> But still though it be to a future Relation to Christ as well as a presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, yet is it ever to a preesent as well as a future: It is a <hi>present</hi> consent, that Christ be <hi>present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:107958:47"/>
my only Saviour, or a <hi>present</hi> acceptance of him to be <hi>presently</hi> my only Saviour that I must Profess.</p>
            <p>Note also that it is not a Profession that this <hi>faith of mine</hi> is indeed sincere justifying or saving faith, that I speak of: but it is a Profession of such a faith as indeed is justifying: For many a thousand Profess that faith which is justifying, and yet know it not to be justifying while they Profess it, nor know not that they do with a saving sincerity believe. Not one Godly person I think of ten thousand, would deny consent that Christ shall be presently their Saviour, and yet most of them know not that this consent is saving. If you ask them, [Are you heartily willing to have Christ to save you both from the guilt and reign of sin, and to glorifie you?] and they will say yea withal their hearts? or at least, [yea, if I know my own heart.] And yet at the same time may doubt whether they be true believers. But as it is the <hi>having</hi> of saving faith that is necessary to salvation, and not the knowledge that we have it; so a man may Profess that faith which is saving, and yet not Profess that he knows it to be saving: and it is not the latter, but the former that the Minister must expect from people in Baptism.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are next to consider, what are the Competitors which we now exclude? There are divers qualifications that are plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as necessary to those that must be Baptized: and our questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, which of all these is it indeed that may warrant a claim, or warrant our Practice? 1. The condition that some require in all that must be baptized, is <hi>Assurance or firm perswasion that they are true Believers,</hi> or have their sins pardoned by Christ, by his promise, which they now come to have sealed. 2. Another condition pretended as necessary is not such Assurance it self, because we know it not, but a Profession of such Assurance to the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch. These are both so groundlesly pleaded, and by so few (that are neer us) that I think it not meet to trouble you with them any more.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A condition pretended to be necessary, is, <hi>A true Justifying faith.</hi> This also is a mistake: but yet how far it is necessary to a true Right, I shall open anon; none of these three are meant by us in the question: for these are not short of saving faith, though we exclude the necessity of these, as is said.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:107958:47"/>4. Another qualification pleaded necessary and sufficient to the ends expressed in the question, is, [<hi>A Profession of a saving Faith</hi>] which is it that we are to defend.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A fifth claim is laid upon the pretended sufficiency of <hi>a Faith short of Justifying.</hi> But you will perhaps say, what faith is that? Those words tell us what Faith it is <hi>not, viz.</hi> It is not justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, but they tel us not what faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t is.] To which I must say, I know not my self, nor can I learn of all the writings of those that go that way, so perplexed and confounded, or uncertain are they, saying sometime one thing, and sometime another. But I shall have a fitter opportunity to enquire further into their mind or words anon.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another claim is laid upon the pretended sufficiency of the <hi>Profession of a faith short of that by which we are ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ified.</hi> I say, <hi>the Profession</hi> as distinct from that <hi>faith it self,</hi> which the former claim made mention of. Some other there are, that yet go lower, and think we may Baptize any that <hi>consent to be Baptized,</hi> though they profess no faith at all, nor their Parents, nor pro-Parents neither. And there have been so some foolish as to think that it is a work of charity to catch them and Bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ize them, whether they will or not. But it is not our present business to deal with these.</p>
            <p>The great adversary that we have here to deal with, is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists: And I shall in few words shew you part of their doctrine which we are now to oppose.</p>
            <p>Their great Fundamental error on which they build their tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Babel and tyrannical usurpation, is this: that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ecclesia enim est coetus homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ita visibilis, palpabilis, ut est coetus populi Romani, vel Regnum Galliae, aut respublica Venetorum.</hi>] Yet other Papists be not so strict with us, but that they will distinguish between the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Church and the true believing Church. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the next words citeth a passage as <hi>Austins,</hi> which he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; which maketh Faith, Hope and Charity to be the soul of the Church; and the external profession of faith and use of sacraments to be the Body of it; and some persons to be in it in one respect only, some in the other only, and some in both. They confess indeed that of duty, men <hi>should</hi> be found Believers at the first; but ordinarily they say, that is not to be expected and therefore they are first to be entered into the Church (this visible Church) by Baptism, that this may be a means to bring them higher: and by this entrance they are put under right guides, and into the true body, and so are fed with true ordinances, yea, with Christs body and blood; and so are in the way to a true spiritual state. The terms on which they must be admitted they say, into this Political Church (which is not the holiest of all) is a Profession of faith, and a consent to be a member of the society, and to be under those Pastors, and use those ordinances in order to further growth: so that these they suppose to have a true faith, and to be such as have right to this Church state; but yet to be but in the way to a special saving faith. for theirs is but <hi>fides informis,</hi> or meer faith, which is onely Assent (say they) joyned with the foresaid consent to live in a Church state: but when Love is added, then it is <hi>fides chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate formata</hi>; and then they are become of the true spiritual so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and have part in the soul as well as in the body of the Church, so that though they desire <hi>fidem formatam</hi> in all, yet it is not to be expected that so much as a Profession of it be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of those that enter into the first order by Baptism; but when they enter into a retired monastical life, then it must be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107958:48"/>
and it is found in all that are fully justified. For, say they, Baptism which entreth men into the visible Church, doth put away their original sin, and justifie them (that is, change them) <hi>in tantum, viz.</hi> from Heathenism, or infidelity, if they lay in it before; but it doth not justifie them from their more spiritual latent sins, such as lie in the heart, and keep out the power of Grace, but it is the work of special Grace (which is given upon the good use of their Church state and Ordinances) that doth this by giving them <hi>fidem formatam,</hi> with charity and hope. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all this there is some truth and some error: we confess that the Church is one Political society or Republ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck; but not head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by men, but only by Christ, the several particular Churches being as so many distinct corporations that all make up this one Republick; and are conjoyned internally by faith, love and obedience to the same Lord and laws, and externally by the use of the same confession, worship. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and holding correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and brotherly communion as far as occasion and natural capacity shall enable them: but not united in one visible frame of policy, so as to be under the same Governors, some as subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, and one person or a General council being the supream. No more then all the schools in <hi>England</hi> or in the world must have such a Political constitution, and Government by combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of schoolmasters. We confess also that the Church is but one as well as they, &amp; that they are to make the same profession and use the same worship, in regard of which they are called visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble members, and the Church a visible Church; as by reason of their faith and the spirit within them, it is called invisible: as if we should distinguish a man into visible and invisible in respect to his body and soul; which make not two men: we confess also that there is an ineffectual faith of assent that goeth without a hearty consent: and that many are to be admitted by us into the visible Church by Baptism (by solemnization) upon a bare Profession, who have not faith either of one sort or other. And we confess that such as so remain in the Church, do live under those benefits and means which have a special tendence to their true conversion. But yet we very much d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffer in this. The Papists make the Primary sense of the word Church, to be of the visible Church as the <hi>samosius significatum,</hi> and therefore they say
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107958:49"/>
that to be entred by Baptism, 1. Into a Profession of assent, 2. Into communion in Ordinances, and 3. Under one and the same Government, or external policy, is all that is requisite to make a Church-member. But we say that the first and <hi>famosius significatum</hi> is the whole multitude of true Believers that have the spirit of God, and his saving Grace; and that it is one and the same Church that is called first <hi>mystical,</hi> as being called out of the world to Christ by true faith: and then <hi>visible,</hi> because of their Profession of <hi>that same</hi> faith: and therefore if any Profess that faith who are without it, these are members but <hi>secundum quid,</hi> or <hi>equivocally,</hi> as the hair and the nails are members of the body, which indeed are no members in the proper and first sense: or as a wooden leg is a member, or as a body without a soul is a man: or as the peas or chaff and straw are corn: The body may be said to be part of the man, when it is anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but a corps or body that never was animated is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a part: the straw and chaff are called part of the corn-field (though indeed but appurtenances to the corn) but if there were no corn, they should have no such title, and when they are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable they shall lose it. Moreover, tis not a Profession of the same faith that the Papists and we maintain to be necessary to Church entrance. For they require as necessary, only a Profession of the Dogmatical or Historical faith of Assent aforesaid, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to subjection and use of Ordinances: But we require a Profession of that faith which hath the promise of pardon and salvation: They take their Church-entrance to be a step to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards saving conversion, and formed faith: we take it <hi>quoad primam intention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m Christi ordinantis,</hi> to be an entrance among the number of the converted true Believers: and that it is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental through their failing and hypocrisie, that any ungodly are in the Church and so enjoy it's external priviledges: and that if we could know them to be such, they should not be there, it being the work of the <hi>Gathering Ministry</hi> to bring men to true faith and repentance, and of the <hi>Edifying perfecting ministry</hi> to build them up and bring them on. And the Papists themselves ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received by Tradition a form of words to be used in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism which are sounder then their doctrine, and which in the true sence do hold forth all that we say, are put to their shifts
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107958:49"/>
by palpable mis-interpretation to deprave their own form. They do themselves require of the Baptized a Profession that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: and when we prove that this is justifying faith and that to [<hi>believe in</hi>] doth signifie Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; the Papists say it is but a naked Assent or Historical faith: and when themselves require the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when themselves do dedicate the person to Christ, they say it is but directly to his Church (that is, to leave the world of Infidels, and be numbred with the visible Church) as the means to a saving sanctification. And these notions they have filed and formed more exactly of late than heretofore, to make the snare more apt to catch the simple; still magnifying to the uttermost <hi>the visible Church-state</hi> as the only way to a state of justification and salvation. But yet as our Divines have observed against him, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself, when he hath superficially plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own cause, doth frequently, in the pleading it, let fall such words at unawares that do destroy it, and grant what we say.

But the new Papists, since <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> do see a necessity of a further distinguishing the Church as a visible po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical society, from the Church as truly sanctified: But that which we and all the ancients do make to be but the Profession distinct from the thing professed, the body distinct from the soul; the chaff distinct from the wheat; the shell distinct from the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; they make to be as the lower order which is the way to a higher, as the Alphabet or lower Rudiments, which are the way to Grammar; as an apprentiship to a trade; I mean as a state of preparation, to a state of infallible salvation. And because it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth their main design, they seem to draw near to the same conceit which they were wont falsly to fasten on the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And all this stir is, that they may advance <hi>their visible Church</hi> in the estimation of men, &amp; thereby the more easily keep the rule in their own hands,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107958:50"/>
and exalt themselves above Scripture, and draw as many as may be into their society: and therefore they drive the poor ignorant <hi>Americans</hi> by hundreds to be baptized, as we drive our beasts to watering, or our sheep to be washed; and in stead of staying till they make Profession of a saving faith with any seeming seriousness, they make Baptism an entrance into the state of the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> which was wont to be the passage thence into the state of Christians: that <hi>per fas aut nefas</hi> they may engage peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to themselves under pretence of engaging them to Christ; therefore it is that they so over extoll the visible Political state of the Church, as Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> saith, Lect. de visibil. eccles. <hi>pag.</hi> 128.

            <p>The chief adversaries therefore we have here to deal with, are the Papists, who over-magnifie the visible face of the Church, &amp; make the faith of men unjustified, to be true faith, though not <hi>formatacharitate,</hi> and make Hypocrites, and and wicked Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, to be truly and properly <hi>fideles</hi> and members of the Church, whom the Protestants affirm to be but <hi>secundum quid,</hi> materially, analogically, yea equivocally called members or <hi>fideles</hi>; and therefore they make Baptism to be an appointed means to admit men into this visible Political Church, as into the ordinary way and passage to the state of saving grace, or justification; but not ordinarily into the present possession of it: And therefore in conformity to all this they maintain that we must admit persons to Baptism, upon the bare Profession of faith, that is, Assent, with consent to be under the Government of the Church and the use of ordinances in order to be a better state. For saith <hi>Bellarmine, it is not Charity but Faith which makes a Christian</hi>: which our divines admit as true in our sense of the word <hi>Faith</hi> which includeth the will, and is proper to the truly regenerate; but they deny it in his sense of it, who maketh faith to be the only Assent of the intellect. Against this adversary
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107958:51"/>
therefore I shall principally bend the force of my Arguments, though to my great trouble, I must be forced to deal also with a Reverend Brother of our own; especially in answering his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fallacious arguments which he hath lately heaped up for that part which I must oppose.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Before I can positively answer the question in hand, I must premise these few necessary Distinctions. 1. We must distinguish between a Profession of faith according to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters sense of the words; and a Profession according to the speakers sense. 2. Between the Children of those that profess not saving faith, <hi>as theirs,</hi> and claiming Baptism on the account of some lower Profession; and the same Children as owned by some other that do profess saving faith. 3. Between the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Baptizing, and the Nullity of the Baptism. Those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions that are necessary for the answering of the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will come in their places. Upon these few I answer the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion negatively, explained in the following Propositions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not a Profession of saving Faith in the real intention of the Professor that we affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m necessary; but in the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the Minister judging of the words according to their common use and acception: For we know not the heart of the Professor, and therefore know not certainly whether he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend those words as a Profession or not. I do not mean, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be sincere in his Profession, and intend the thing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for thats no part of the Profession it self: but I mean whether he use the words which he speaks in the sense which they seem to us to import, and which they are used in by those that best understand their common signification. For example: a Papist presenteth a Child to be Baptized, Professing to believe in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost: I know that these words according to the Scripture use of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> signifie a true saving fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th; but I am not sure whether the speaker do understand any more by them then a lower faith of meer Assent. If I knew he meant no more, I would require him to express a saving faith, before I would Baptize his Child, on his account: but if I know it not, nor have just reason to question it, I must take the words as they are commonly used, and seem to be intended by him and so if it appear to me to be a Profession of saving faith, though
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107958:51"/>
I err and my errour be innocent, it is my duty to Baptize the Child. I have known a man of eighty years of age that took God the Son, to be the sun in the firmament: If, before I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood him, this man had professed to believe in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and presented his child to baptism with this profession (and I had no ground before to suspect his error, or to examine him about his faith) it had been my duty to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize his child. For though in the intended sense of the speaker, here was not so much as the Profession of an Historical faith, much less of a saving faith, yet I know not his heart, and the common use of those words as to another signification than he intended; and therefore I was Innocent in being deceived.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I meddle not here with the claim that is laid upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Ancestors, Adopters, or undertakers that profess saving faith; but only with the claim laid on the account of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or any others that profess not saving faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When I assert the unlawfulness, I do not intend thereby to assert the Nullity of all such baptism, when performed, though unlawfully: For though it may be Null or vain as to the special uses and benefits, yet it followeth not that therefore it is Null as to the true form and being of the Externall Ordinance; nor that this is to be re-iterated. And with these explications I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that <hi>Ministers may not Baptize the children of those that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess not saving faith, upon the Profession of any other faith that comes short of it.</hi> And here you must remember that our question supposeth the determination of the controversie [<hi>whether the same faith that is necessary in the aged themselves if they were to be baptized, be necessary to their childrens baptism on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi>] For it seems strange to me, that any should imagine that a lower belief in the Parent will help his child to a Title, than that which is necessary to his own baptism. But if any will insist on such a conceit, because we will not now make more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, then that in hand, let such all along suppose our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to be about the aged themselves, whether we might baptize the aged <hi>upon the Profession of any faith short of saving. And I thus prove the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. If we must not baptize any who profess not true Repentance, then must we not baptize any that profess not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107958:52"/>
saving faith. But the Antecedent is true (speaking of the Adult. Concerning whom as the more noble subject we shall carry on the Argumentation for brevity: still implying the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke necessity of their professing saving faith, for their childrens baptism as for their own) therefore <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Consequence of the <hi>Major,</hi> I prove thus. 1. True repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and saving faith are inseparable; therefore if one be of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, so is the other, and the profession of true Repentance cannot be separated from the profession of saving faith; therefore if one be necessary, so is the other. Some learned Divines take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith to be all one; some take repentance to be part of faith: but all take it to be as inseparable from it. It were easie by describing the requisite Professions of both to shew that they are so interwoven, that no man can profess the one w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thout the other: but I think it is needless, because few will deny it. By Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance here I mean that true Evangelical Repentance which is a special grace of God accompanying salvation; and not any common preparatory Repentance.</p>
            <p>The Antecedent is easily proved from Scripture: and I know not whether any Protestant deny it: many Papists indeed distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of Repentance and Faith, and say, that it is only a professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a preparatory Repentance and <hi>sides informis,</hi> a faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out love, that is necessarily to be expected from them. (before Baptism). But I prove the contrary. 1. That Repentance. 2. And such as is proper to the effectually called, is necessary to be professed by all that we may Baptize. I will joyn the proof of both together. <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. If <hi>John</hi> Baptist required the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of true Repentance in men before he would baptize them, then so must we. But <hi>John</hi> did so: therefore.</p>
            <p>the Consequence is clear. 1. For either <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism and Christs were the same, as most of our Divines against the Papists do maintain; (though <hi>Zanchy</hi> and some few more fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Judgement of the ancient Doctors in this) or as <hi>Calvin Institut.</hi> saith, the difference seems to be but this, that <hi>John</hi> baptized them into the <hi>Messiah</hi> to come, and the Apostles into the name of the <hi>Messiah</hi> already come. 2. Or if the difference be greater, we may argue <hi>à fortiori</hi>; If <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism required a Profession of Repentance, then much more Christs: for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107958:52"/>
Christ required not less then <hi>John,</hi> nor did he take the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent into his Kingdom whom <hi>John</hi> excluded.</p>
            <p>The Antecedent I prove. 1. From <hi>Mark</hi> 1, 34. He prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] And doubtless that Repentance which is in <hi>Remissionem peccatorum,</hi> is true special Repentance. One of our Divines, and many of the Papists have found out another evasion: that is, that <hi>John</hi> did engage them to repent, but not requiring a Profession or Repentance as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going baptism. But 1. this is against the whole current of expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors, ancient and modern, and 2. against the plain scope of the text. The words in <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.6. are, [They were baptized of him in <hi>Jordan,</hi> confessing their sins] This confession was with, yea before their baptism: and this Confession was the Profession of the Repentance that <hi>John</hi> required. <hi>Maldonate</hi> on the text, having first railed at <hi>Calvin</hi> and slandered him, as turning baptism into preaching (as if he had expounded <hi>Johns</hi> bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, not of water-baptism but preaching, when he only shews that both should go together) doth tell the Protestants that they cannot prove by this text that confession went before baptism, because it is named after: but that he might not seem utterly impudent, he confesseth that the thing is true, and that it is the sense of the text and that this he confesseth because he must rather be a faithfull expositor, then a subtile adversary. And if any should say that it's only confession that's required, which is no certain sign of true Repentance: I answer: when <hi>John</hi> saith [<hi>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins</hi>] he took that confession to be a sign of true Repentance. And our Expositors and the Ancients before them agree; that it was such a confession as was conjunct with a detestation and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the sin. And it is expounded by that of <hi>Acts</hi> 19.18. as <hi>Grotius</hi> noteth, to have a special detestation of the sin accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paneing it, where to the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is added <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And it may sufficy that the baptism to which this Confession was required, is the baptisme of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But it is objected that in the 11. <hi>vers.</hi> of <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. it is said by <hi>Iohn</hi> [<hi>I Baptize you with water to Repentance</hi>] therefore it is but an engagement of them to it for the future. <hi>Answ.</hi> Our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors have fully shewed that this signifieth no more, but [I
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107958:53"/>
baptize you upon your present Profession of Repentance, to newness of life.] For that this Profession did go before, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved already, and then the rest can be no more then the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of Repentance and exercise of it in newness of life, which they are engaged to for the future. Only if any falsly profess it at present, his own confession is an engagement to it as a duty. <hi>Grotiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 2, For the proof of the necessity of a Profession of Repentance before baptism, is this: If Jesus Christ hath by Scripture precept and example directed us to baptize those that profess true Repentance, and no other; then we must baptize them, and no other: But the Antecedent it true: therefore so is the consequent.</p>
            <p>All that requireth proof is the Antecedent; which I prove from an enumeration of those texts that do afford us this dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (besides the forementioned.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. Jesus Christ himself did by preaching Repentance prepare men for baptism, and for his kingdom, as <hi>John</hi> before began to do, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.17. so <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.15. The Kingdom of God is at hand; Repent ye and believe the Gospel.

but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost] Mat.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.16. It implyeth that Christs baptism comprehended <hi>Johns</hi> and somewhat more in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37, 38. when the Jews were pricked in their heart (which was a preparatory Repentance) and said to <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, [men and brethren what shall we do?] <hi>Peter</hi> saith to them, <hi>Repent and be baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins</hi>] so that we must require and expect true Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to be professed before baptism; for ver. 41. its added, [<hi>then they that gladly received his word were baptized</hi>] so that he baptized none that to outward appearance did not gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that word which could not be without a profession of that Repentance. And he that here perswadeth them to repent and be baptized for remission, doth in the next chapter, ver. 19. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them to repent, and be converted, that their sins may be blotted out, shewing what kind of Repentance it is that he meaneth. And as the work of General Preachers to the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving world is sometime called a <hi>discipling of Nations,</hi> which go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth before <hi>baptizing them,</hi> Mat. 28.19, 20. So is it in other places called a <hi>Preaching of Repentance, and commanding all men everywhere to Repent,</hi> Acts 17.30. <hi>An opening of mens eyes and turning them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive Remission</hi> (obsigned in baptism) <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>to repent and turn to God,</hi> ver. 20.

Note also that it is not only an engagement to this hereafter, but a thing presently done. They were in baptism buried with Christ; and put off the body of sin, and were quickened with him: and this doth also suppose their own present Profession to put off the body of sin, and their consent to be baptized on these terms.</p>
            <p>The like we have in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death? therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the Glory of the father, even so we also should walk in newness of life: for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also into the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107958:54"/>
likeness of his resurrection.</hi> Here also it is evident, 1. That all the members of the visible Church are supposed to be baptized into Christ and into his Death, and so to be buried with him by baptism into death, and planted together into the likeness of his death. 2. And that this is not supposed to be only an Engagement for the future, but a present entrance into the state of Mortification and Vivification, wherein they were to proceed by newness of life: And therefore <hi>ver.</hi> 5.6, 7, 8, 11. <hi>They are supposed to have the old man crucified with Christ, that the body of sin might be destroyed; And that henceforth they should not serve sin: And that they are so dead as to be freed from sin,</hi> as to the servitude thereof: <hi>And that they must reckon themselves dead to sin, but alive to God</hi>; He that Readeth the whole Chapter with judgement and Impartiality, will soon discern that true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Abrenunciation of the service of sin, was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by all that would be Baptized; And that hereupon they Sealed their own Profession and Covenant by the reception of Baptism, as Christ Sealed his part by the actual baptizing them; and that hereupon they are by the Apostle all called and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed such as they professed themselves to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. If it be the very nature and use of baptism to signifie and Seal both the present putting off the body of sin, and present putting on Christ, then the profession of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance must needs precede or concur with baptism: but the former is certain: of which more anon.</p>
            <p>I conclude then that both Scripture, and the very signs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the common consent of the Church (of which more after) do shew that true Repentance, and present Repentance must be professed by all those that we may baptize, or whose children we may baptize on their account: And consequently that true saving faith which is Inseparable from it (and some think is the same thing) must needs be Professed too; and not only Promised.</p>
            <p>We should before we leave this Argument hear what the Opposers say against it: but they are all in pieces (the Papists I mean) among themselves about it, some of them confessing what we plead for, and others of them (Especially the New ones) contradicting it, but by such reasons as I think not worth the while now to discuss.</p>

            <p>But I have spoke to this of Dr. <hi>Wards</hi> already in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix to my Treatise of Baptism. 1. To which of mine Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> taking exceptions, and publishing them, I published my Defence, and among many more used this Argument from the Necessity of Repentance: but Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> found it easier to say that of almost forty Arguments few were to the question, and so to pass them by, than to give us a satisfactory answer to them. But yet I find him upon the Point against another Pag. 107, 108. And there I find this Question, <hi>Did they</hi> (the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles) <hi>so require it</hi> (Repentance) <hi>as in reality to precede Baptism, Or were Satisfied with a Profession of it?</hi> I answer; If that you yield the last, it is enough to the main Point of difference. Pag. 108. He saith [<hi>Faith takes Christ to give Repentance] Answ.</hi> Only saving faith is properly called a Taking Christ: And that takes Christ to give <hi>more</hi> Repentance, but not to give <hi>the first</hi> Repentance: For Christ gives the first <hi>Faith and Repentance, (ut Amesius in medulla. l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. My first Argument was from the Necessity of a Profession of true Repentance. the second shall be from the Equipollent terms, or Description to the thing Described: Thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We must baptize no man that first professeth not to believe in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost: To believe in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is saving Faith (if sincerely done) therefore we must Baptize no man that first professeth not saving faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Major is proved from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. Where this is made the form of the words in baptism, or at least the End, and that which we must insist on. <hi>Calvin</hi> on the words yields the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists that faith is put justly before baptism, <hi>Nam alioqui Mendax esset, figuraque remissionem peccatorum &amp; Spiritûs donum offeret incredulis, qui nondum essent Christi membra.</hi> And that <hi>non abs re patris, filii &amp; spiritûs expressa hic fit mentio, quia aliter baptismi vis apprehendi non potest quàm si à gratuita Patris misericordia ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium fiat, qui nos per filium sibi reconciliat, deinde in medium prode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at Christus ipse cum mortis suae sacrificio: Et tandem accedat etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spiritus sanctus, per quem nos abluit &amp; regenerat; Denique suoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> omnium bonorum consortes faciat.</hi> It appeareth by comparing <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 3. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15 &amp; 10.2. that to be baptized into the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, is not only to be baptized by their Authority, but also to be thus Initiated into the Relation which the Church standeth in to them, and to be consecrated to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, as <hi>Musculus, Diodate,</hi> the Assembly of Divines Annotations, and the generality of Expositors do express. See Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> Pract. Catech. <hi>l.</hi> 6. §. 2. And especially on <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Grotius</hi> at large; and that it comprehendeth or presupposeth a Profession of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in the Father, Son &amp; Holy Ghost. For no man can devote himself solemnly by our Ministry to the holy Trinity that doth not first Profess to believe in them. Therefore the Church ever taught the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eni</hi> the Creed first in which they profess to believe in God the Father, Son &amp; Holy Ghost. And before they actually baptized them, they asked them whether they believed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107958:56"/>
in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost? To which they must answer affirmatively, or not be baptized.</p>
            <p>And for the Minor, that this believing in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, is saving faith, if sincerity done as it is professed, is proved, 1. In that to believe <hi>in God, in Christ, in the Holy Ghost,</hi> signifyeth not only the act of the understanding barely assenting, but also the consent and Assiance of the Will. 2. True saving faith is so expressed in Scripture: and the promise of eternal life is added to it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Ye believe in God, believe also in me.</hi> Joh. 1.12. <hi>To as many as received him, he gave power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe in his name</hi>: where <hi>believing in his name</hi> is made equivalent with <hi>Receiving him,</hi> and hath <hi>Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> immediately annexed to it: And all that are baptized must first <hi>Profess</hi> to <hi>believe in his name,</hi> and so <hi>receive him,</hi> and not only promise to do it hereafter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14 15, 16. <hi>Whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him shall not perish, but have eterna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> life.</hi> But all that are Baptized, must Profess <hi>to believe in him,</hi> Joh. 3.36. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on the son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> He that will distinguish now, and say, that it is not this believing on the Son here mentioned which must be Professed by all that will be baptized, but another believing on him, which leaveth him among those that <hi>shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> must prove and explain his distinction better then those that have undertaken it have done. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24. [<hi>Verily, verily I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, he that heareth my words, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation,</hi> but <hi>is passed from death to life.</hi>] If any words of Christ can put us out of doubt, that believing in the Father and Son is saving faith, these asseverations and plain expressions may do it, especially, being a thing so oft rehearsed. So <hi>Joh</hi> 6.35. <hi>He that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst,</hi> Verse 40. <hi>And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one that seeth the Son and believeth on him, may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</hi> Ver. 17. <hi>Verily verily I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.</hi> So John 7.38. and 11.25, 26. and 12.44, 46, and 14.12. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witness, that through his name whosoever
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107958:57"/>
believeth in him shall receive remission of sins,</hi> Rom. 3.20. <hi>That he might be just, and the Justifier of him that believeth on Jesus,</hi> [Rom. 45. <hi>To him that work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</hi>] Rom. 9 33. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</hi> So 10, 11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8 with many the like. From all which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that <hi>Believing on or in God, the Father, Son, and holy Ghost,</hi> is saving faith, having more frequent and as express promises of life, as anything whatsoever. And it is <hi>believing in God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Son and holy Ghost</hi>: that we must profess in baptism.</p>
            <p>To this I suppose it will be answered (for I know not what else can), that there are two sorts of believing in or on God the Father, Son and holy Ghost: and the Texts mentioned speak of one sort, which is saving, and that which we must necessarily profess in Baptism is another sort, that is, a faith not joyned with Charity, or a meer dogmatical faith. To which I answer, 1. Let them that thus distinguish, first clearly explain to us the branches of the distinction, and shew us the difference between the two faiths, and prove it from Scripture, and then prove that it is the last only that must needs be professed in Baptism; and then they have done somewhat. 2. It will be found no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thing for Scripture, to call any common faith, <hi>a believing on or in Christ.</hi> 3. That faith which is said to be in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, though in respect of <hi>sides in genere,</hi> it be really faith, yet in respect of <hi>sides evangelica in Christum Mediatorem, in specie,</hi> required in the Gospel, it is but Equivocally called faith, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that term to Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> is so abominable, let it be <hi>Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically</hi> a while, till I come to the proof, that it is but equivocally such. The faith that God requireth and maketh his promises on, is only the Faith called Justifying, or Saving; and the other is as a Mole to a Child, or a Monster to a Man, which is so far defective <hi>ex errore naturae, non ex intentione generantis,</hi> that it doth differ <hi>tota specie</hi> from a true man: and so doth this Faith differ <hi>in sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cie morali</hi> from Evangelical Faith. 4. When Faith is mentioned in a preceptive or promising way, the nature of the thing and the course of Scripture sheweth, that we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it of that faith which God owneth by precept or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and not of that which is but Analogically called faith,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107958:57"/>
and <hi>ex errore credentis</hi> is so monstrous that God never owned such by precept or promise: I can find where this Monster is ascribed to many, as to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and others; but let any shew us where it is <hi>in hac specie</hi> commanded by God, or hath any Promise made to it, in his word. 5. However, it will not I hope be denied, but that saving faith is the <hi>famosius analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatum vel significatum,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Analogum per se posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> must be understood of it, and not of the Analogical Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous faith. And therefore when in baptism we must profess <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Believe in the Father, Son and holy-Ghost it must be understood of saving belief, till we have a limiting Exposition proved. 6. Yea further, the nature of the Ordinance commandeth us this exposition: For when God hath so frequently promised pardon to believers in or on Christ, and then ordained baptism to be the seal of this promise, and required that the person to be baptized, profess to believe in Christ, it plainly followeth, that we must understand him to speak of the same faith in the promise, and about the seal, and not of divers sorts, unless he had so declared himself, which he no where hath done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the further proof of the <hi>Minor,</hi> I add that the same faith that is mentioned in the ordinary Creed of the Church, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> meant in the baptismal profession, and to be required before baptism: this will be confessed, 1. because the Creed it self hath been this 1300 years at least profess'd before baptism. 2. because the Creed it self is but the 3. fundamental baptismal Articles mentioned <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. enlarged and explained on subsequent occasions (as <hi>Sandford</hi> &amp; <hi>Parker de descenju,</hi> have learnedly and largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and <hi>Grotius</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. proves out of <hi>Tertullian, &amp;c.</hi> that the creed was not then in the form of words as now, though the same doctrine was used in other words to the same uses. But (I assume) it is saving faith that is meant in the common Creed by the phrases of believing <hi>in God the Father</hi> &amp; <hi>in Jesus Christ,</hi> &amp; <hi>in the holy Ghost.</hi> This our divines do so copiously prove against the Papists, that with most Protestants I may take it for granted.</p>
            <p>Saith Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> on the Creed, <hi>Pag.</hi> 128. [<hi>To believe is one thing, and to believe in this or that, is another thing, and is contains in it three Points or Actions of a Believer.</hi> 1. <hi>To know a thing.</hi> 2. <hi>to acknowledge the same.</hi> 3. <hi>To put trust and confidence in it. And in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107958:58"/>
this order must these three actions of faith be applied to every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle following, which concerns any of the persons in the Trinity. And this must be marked as a matter of speceal moment. For alwayes by adding them to the words following, we do apply the Article to our selves, in a very comfortable manner.

               </hi> he gives more largely the like Answer. And Pag 268. he gives the like answer to the Question, <hi>Quid est credere in Jesum Cristum, qui ascendit in coelum?</hi>] I am loth to weary my self &amp; others with citing Testimonies in a known case. Its well known that this or to this purpose is the common Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Protestants of the Creed and Baptismal Profession, and that they maintain it against the Papists, to be true saving faith that is meant in the words, (I believe in God the Father, in Jesus Christ, in the holy Ghost) I doubt not to cite forty &amp; forty more to prove this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when any shall shew me that it will be worth the labor. Yet I must say, that I approve not fully of some of their descriptions of justifying or saving faith which they hereupon give in: but yet they truly maintain that it meaneth saving faith I believe; and if they had but put the Wills Consent to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Articles and Relations and works of God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and our Affiance instead of a perswasion that they are ours <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I should have yielded to their descriptions. I conclude then, that believing <hi>in</hi> or <hi>on</hi> God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, is an Act of the Will, as well as of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is <hi>saving faith:</hi> And therefore all that profess this, profess saving faith: But all that will be baptized, must profess this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is agreed by all Divines that I know, Protestants and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, that to believe in the Trinity, is not only to believe in Gods Essence, or the three Persons, but also the Relations and great operations of each person for us: As to believe in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is to believe in him as our Creator and Soveraign Lord and chief Good. To believe in Jesus Christ, Is to believe in him as Redeemer and Saviour. To believe in the Holy Ghost, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him as a Sanctifier (and as the great Witness and Agent
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107958:59"/>
of Christ.) Now it is most certain, that to Profess, Assent and consent that God be my God, Christ my Saviour, the Holy Ghost my Sanctifier, is to profess Saving Faith. And bare As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is not meant in the words [believing in or on God] as is proved by our Divines at large. And if present consent be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, saving Faith is exprest; for no wicked man can truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that God shall be his God and chief good, and Christ his Saviour to save him from sin it self, as well as from punishment, and the Holy Ghost his Sanctifier. I may truly say (according to that of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> before cited) that never any but a true believer that had Justifying Faith, did truly say, <hi>I believe in God</hi>; but speak falsly in so saying. To take God for his God, is a thing that <hi>no man can truly do, but those that are called effectually by his Saving Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The foregoing Argument was taken from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requisite Profession; the next shall be taken from the very work it self, <hi>viz.</hi> the Presenting and offering our selves to be baptized, and willingly receiving baptism: Thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be the very Nature or appointed Vse of the external part of Baptism it self</hi> (yea, essential to it) <hi>to signifie and profes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> (among other things) <hi>the saving faith and Repentance of the Baptized</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at age;) <hi>then true Baptism cannot go without such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. But the former is true</hi>: Ergo, <hi>so is the later.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Antecedent (which only requireth proof) I prove thus: 1. It is of the Instituted Nature of Baptism to be in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, a Professing sign, as well as an Engaging sign <hi>de futuro:</hi> this I promise, as granted by all Christians that I know of, that have written of Baptism. And then let us consider of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the sign or external Ordinance, with the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each. That it is essential to it to be significant, and Obligatory on our part, as well as on Gods part, is commonly confessed. And 1. The Minister doth baptize him into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and the party doth (by himself or Parent) consent thereto; 1. Voluntarily offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himself to be so baptized; and then 2. Voluntarily Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that Baptism. And his offer of himself hereto, goeth before the Ministers baptizing him; and his Reception of that Baptism is Essential to it: so that Baptism essentially contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107958:59"/>
on his part a Signal Profession of consent to that which is meant in the form used by the Minister [<hi>I baptize thee into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost:</hi>] And that is, that God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost be mine, and I be theirs, in the Relations in which they are offered in the Gospel to Mankind: For all confess that it is a Covenant that is here Sealed, and so a mutual consent which the Signs are Instituted by Christ to signifie. Christ offereth himself to be Related to me, as my Jesus Christ; and by offering my self to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. and by voluntarily receiving it, I do actually profess my Acceptance of his Offer, that is, of himself so offered. God the Father offereth himself to be my God reconciled in Christ, and so my chief good; and by voluntary receiving Baptism, I do signally profess my Acceptance of him so offered. The Holy Ghost is offered to be my Sanctifier and Guide; and by voluntary Reception of baptism into his Name, I do signally profess my Acceptance of him so offered (Of all which I shall say more anon:) And if this be not the Faith which is Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and saving, then I know not what is; yea, I may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, then there is none such: so that it it a most clear case, that baptism as baptism, according to its Instituted Nature and use, doth contain the Persons actual signal Profession of present Assent to the truth of the Gospel, and Acceptance of God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost as therein offered. And it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth (as our Divines commonly maintain) an actual signal Profession that we there presently consecrate, or Devote, or Dedicate our selves to God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in the foresaid Relations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another part of Baptism, is, the Ministers washing the Person, and the Person first offering himself to be washed, and after actually receiving it, doth thereby signally profess his consent. Now this washing doth essentially signifie our wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from our former filth of sin, together with the guilt; <hi>our put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the old man which is corrupt, accord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng to the deceitful lusts of the flesh.</hi> He that signally professeth his present Consent to be washed by the blood of Christ from his former filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and guilt, and to lay by the filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, doth <hi>eo nomine</hi> profess saving faith and Repentance; But all
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107958:60"/>
that are baptized with the baptism of Christs Institution, do by the very voluntary Reception of Baptism, so profess; therefore they do thereby profess saving Faith and Repentance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Quo ad modum</hi>; Its commonly confessed by us to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists (as our Commentators declare) that in the Apostles times the Baptized were dipped over head in the water, and that this signified their Profession, both of believing the Burial and Resurrection of Christ; and of their own present renouncing the World and Flesh, or dying to sin and living to Christ, or rising again to newness of Life, or being buried and risen again with Christ, as the Apostle expoundeth in the fore-cited Texts, of <hi>Col.</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. And though (as is before said) we have thought it lawful to disuse the manner of Dipping, and to use less water, yet we presume not to change the use and signification of it; so then, He that signally professeth to dye and rise again in baptism with Christ, doth signally profess Saving Faith and Repentance. But this do all that are baptized according to the Apostolical practice: therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. about Nullity.</hi> But it will be objected, that this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument goeth so high, that it will prove that all mens baptism is a Nullity, who do not profess Saving Faith and Repentance, and so that they must be baptized again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This concerneth the Opponents to answer, more than me.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are no such persons, that I know of, and therefore they are not to be re-baptized. We distinguish between the secret <hi>Intention</hi> of Professing and the signal Interpretative Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing, which the Church is bound to take as really intended: And so I say, that when Christ hath Instituted baptism for such a signification, if any man seek and receive that baptism, he doth thereby Interpretatively profess to seek and receive it as such, to the use and Ends to which it was Instituted: seeing then all the baptized do apparently (as far as the Church can judge) profess Saving Faith and Repentance, even by receiving baptism, there is no room for the conclusion of this Objection. When they bring us forth one baptized Person, who did not make such a signal Profession then we shall give them a further answer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If they did by word of mouth say, that they believe with a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107958:60"/>
saving Faith, these words are but signs of their minds; and whether counterfeit or not, the Church cannot tell. And the same may be said of the Baptismal Action and Reception.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Therefore the Church must not take the external Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament for a Nullity, every time a mans secret Intentions agree not with his signal Profession; for then we should not know whether ever we baptize any one. But when it is discovered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he had other Intentions, that which was wanting must be yet done, (<hi>viz.</hi> his sincere Intentions, or saving faith) and not that which was not wanting be done again, <hi>viz.</hi> The exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Administration and Reception of Baptism.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is confessed to be essential to the Sacrament, that the Receiving of the washing by Water, doth signifie the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the souls washing by the Blood of Christ. Now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I can prove it of abundance of Parents, that when they presented their Children to Baptism, they did not understand that the water signified the blood of Christ, or the washing our cleansing by it from sin, and therefore had no such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in Baptism; would the Opponents baptize all these again? Let them answer this for themselves, and they shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for us? Or if the Case of Infant-baptism be quarrelled at, let them suppose that it were the Person himself that had been so baptized; though I am satisfied, that its all one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. If we must baptize none that profess not their Consent to enter themselves presently into the Covenant of Grace, with God in Christ, then we must baptize none that profess not saving faith. But the former is true; therefore <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also, if the very Reception of Baptism be a Profession of present entering into the Gospel-covenant with Christ, then is it a Profession of saving faith. But so it is; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Argument was implyed in the former: but the <hi>Medium</hi> that I now use, is, the Identity of this covenanting and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of saving Faith, supposing the Identity of Heart-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting and saving faith it self.</p>
            <p>The Antecedent I think will be granted by many of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and it is the common doctrine of the Protestants; and therefore, as to them, I need not prove it; I confess, some of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107958:61"/>
the Anabaptists, and some few others, do question whether Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism be a Seal of the covenant of Grace: But the quarrel is mostly, if not only, about the bare word [<hi>Seal</hi>]; for they confess that in sense, which we mean by sealing, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they confess that we do in Baptism enter into the covenant of God, and that it is a professing and engaging sign on our part, as well as an exhibiting, notifying, confirming sign on Gods part.</p>
            <p>The consequence is thus proved: He that doth <hi>ore tenus,</hi> or by profession, enter into the covenant of God, doth profess sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith; therefore if we must not baptize them without a professed entering into covenant, then nether must we baptize them without a profession of saving Faith. Only the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent requireth proof: And if I prove either the Identity of profest covenanting and profest true believing, or else the inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parableness of them, I prove the Antecedent. But I shall prove the Identity or the inseparability; yea, I doubt not of the first, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the most full proof. And here we must first consider what the Covenant is we are to enter. 1. And it is confest it is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and that there is but one covenant of Grace: This Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> aknowledgeth, for all the mention of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward covenant. 2. It is also a confessed thing on all hands, that it is God that is the first Author and Offerer of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; that it is he that redeemed us, who made the promise or covenant of Grace upon the ground of Redemption: and that this is frequently called a covenant in Scripture, as it is a divine Law or constitution, without respect to mans consent, (as <hi>Grotius</hi> hath proved in the preface to his Annotations on the Evangelists). Much more (out of doubt) it is, that it is called a covenant before man consenteth, as it is a covenant offered, and not yet mutually entered. In the former sense the word is taken properly, but in another sense, and for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing then in the later. But in the later it is taken Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically, <hi>viz.</hi> Synecdochically, it being but a covenant drawn up and consented to by God conditionally, and offered to us for our consent. 3. It is this same Covenant that is offered to us, and not another, that we are called to consent to or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in. And we cannot be truly said to enter into the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107958:61"/>
of God, if we make a new one of our own, and lay by his; for thats none of the Covenant of God: he never offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, nor will he ever enter it. 4. It is confessed by all, that there is an internal covenanting with God by the heart, and an External covenanting, or engaging our selves by words or other outward signs; and that this last is the Profession of the former. 5. And it is confessed by all the world, that internal Covenanting is an Act of the Will, and never of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing only or chiefly. 6. And this Act of the Will is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by the custom of Nations called [<hi>consent</hi>]: so that <hi>consenting</hi> to Gods <hi>offered Covenant,</hi> is the very formal Act or our Internal covenanting with him; and professing this consent, is the Signal or External Covenanting with him. 7. We are I hope agreed what the Covenant of Grace is, as offered on Gods part (or else its great pity) <hi>viz.</hi> that on the Title of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion first, and Redemption after, we being absolutely his own, it is offered to us, that God will be our God (our chief Good and Reconciled Father in Christ,) that Christ will be our Saviour, (by Propitiation, Teaching and Ruling us,) even from the guilt and filth or power of sin; that the Holy Ghost will be our indwelling Sanctifier; if we heartily, or sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accept the Gift and Offer, That God will consent to be our God, Christ to be our Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost to be our indwelling Sanctifier, if we will but consent. This is no doubt, the Gift or Covenant as offered.</p>
            <p>These things being premised, I come to prove not only the inseparability, (which is enough to my purpose) but even the Identity of Heart-covenanting and saving faith, and of sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal external covenanting, and the Profession of saving faith.</p>
            <p>To enter the Covenant of God unfeignedly in heart, is to accept God for my God, Jesus Christ for my Saviour, and the Holy Ghost for my Sanctifier, upon the Gospel offer: To believe savingly, is to accept of God for my God, Jesus Christ for my Saviour, and the Holy Ghost for my sanctifier upon the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel offer: therefore to enter the Covenant of God heartily, and to believe savingly, are the same.</p>
            <p>Moreover, to Covenant with God <hi>Externally,</hi> is to <hi>profess our Consent,</hi> that God be our God, Christ our Saviour, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107958:62"/>
Ghost our Sanctifier, on the Gospel offer. To profess saving faith is to profess the same consent: therefore external entering into the Covenant, and profession of saving faith, are the same thing.</p>
            <p>That this is the only true Covenant-entrance with God, is proved thus. It is only this Covenant of Grace that God calleth us to consent to, and offereth himself to enter with us: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is only this covenant of Grace, whose acceptance or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to it, is our entrance into the Covenant of God. There can be no covenanting in the present sense, but by two parties: But God doth not offer himself to us in any other Covenant but this, nor offer his consent to any other. And its confessed, that God is the leading Party, prescribing to man and imposing on him the terms of the Covenant, or Conditions which he must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. There is no possibility therefore of our entering into Gods covenant, when it is none of his Covenant, or when it is against his Will, or without his consent.</p>
            <p>And that this is the nature of saving faith, is manifest: For 1. It is not a meer act of the Intellect. Though Assent be the Initial Act (from which it hath oft its name) yet it is not the whole, nor the perfecting Act: Our Divines most commonly consent (except <hi>Camero</hi> and some few more) that faith is in the Will as well as the Understanding: And its first Act in the Will must needs be <hi>velle Christum oblatum</hi> or a consent to the Gospel-offer of God, Christ, and the Holy Ghost: or an Acceptance of the Redeeming Trinity in the Relation as they are offered to to be ours in the Gospel: After which followeth Affiance, as Assent precedes it. Our Assembly of Divines in their Catechisms say, That <hi>Faith in Jesus Christ is a saving Grace, whereby we receive and rest upon him alone for salvation, as he is offered to us in the Gospel.</hi> Or, as elswhere [<hi>to embrace Jesus Christ freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to us in the Gospel</hi>] And the Wills receiving is by Accepting or Consenting. Dr. <hi>Preston</hi> hath at large shewed in many of his writings (as I have elswhere shewed) that Faith and Heart-covenanting with Christ is all one. The Scripture calleth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith <hi>A receiving Christ Jesus the Lord,</hi> John 1.12. Col. 2.5, 6 This therefore with almost all Protestant Writers is past controversie. But if any will yet be stiff in it, that Faith is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107958:62"/>
only in the Intellect, (upon that common poor reason, that one Grace cannot be in two faculties) it may suffice to them, that I prove the Inseparability of saving faith and sincere Heart-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, and so of the profession of each, though I had not proved the Identity. And these same men do most earnestly plead for the Inseparability themselves, maintaining at large, that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent (which only they call Faith) if true, is Inseparable from true consent, which is the Heart-covenanting. Of which you may see Dr. <hi>Downame</hi> in his Treatise of Justification, and in his Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix against Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> at large.</p>
            <p>But here we are quite off with the Papists; for they stifly maintain, that Faith is only the Understandings Assent; only the Schoolmen and others of them confess, that it is a <hi>willing</hi> Assent: but it is one thing to <hi>will the Assent,</hi> and another thing to <hi>will or Accept the Good that is contained in the promise which we Assent to.</hi> This last is the thing in Question: And they tell us, that this is not Faith, but Love. To which <hi>Maccovius</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier</hi> answer them, that Faith and Love to Christ are all one; though Faith and Love to a distinct object, be not so.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereupon we proceed to a further difference, which is, that the Papists say, that Faith may be separated from Love; that Faith without Love doth not Justifie; but only that Faith which is informed by Love. How far this supposed great disagreement is meerly Verball, or Reall, I leave to the judicious Reader to judge, when he hath considered, that what we call Faith sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, they call <hi>Fides formata Charitate:</hi> That the Act of Faith which is in the Will, the Papists call by the name of Love, and not of Faith, yet both agree <hi>de re ipsa,</hi> that this is the thing which is necessary to Justification; and we confess as well as they, that meer Assent (of some sort) is separable from Love. But then the mischief is, that the Papists by false <hi>wording</hi> or <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> these Graces, are carried to the misinterpreting of many Scriptures, if not to many erroneous Doctrines also. And when they read of Faith simply, they commonly take it for meer Assent. And so they are led into error in the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie. For when they find that he that <hi>Believeth must be Baptized</hi>; they conclude presently with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that <hi>sides, non charitas facit Christianum:</hi> he that assenteth is a Believer, &amp;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107958:63"/>
therefore may be baptized. But our Divines have so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and so voluminously confuted this conceit, and proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them that faith is in the Will as well as the understanding, and that [<hi>to Believe in</hi>] signifieth to Accept, or rest upon, or have Affiance in, and that Faith and Love are inseparable, (yea true and through Assent,) that I shall not needlesly stand to do again a work so oft and fully done. And themselves confess, that when Faith is mentioned as Justifying, it includeth the act of the Will, (which they call Charity:) And sure we have oft proved against them, that this is the faith that is meant in Gods Covenant, and in our Baptismal Profession and Covenant with him, and in the Creed.</p>
            <p>In a word, that Faith which is meant by God in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant offered, must be meant by us in our profession of Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this offer. But it is a true saving Faith, which hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Remission, which is meant by God in the Covenant of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; therefore this must be meant by us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Major is clear; because else we do but Equivocate with God, and we do not Accept the same thing that he offereth. The Minor is clear: in that the Covenant of Grace is but one, and that one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant offereth Christ and Life to all that will accept him: so that the Acceptance puts us into a participation of Christ and Life, The Covenant offereth pardon of sin to all that Believe or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ; therefore it is a saving faith that it means, because it annexeth saving special Benefits.</p>
            <p>To these I add another Argument: which is this:</p>
            <p>The hearty Acceptance of the Gift, is the first and principal part of our Heart-covenanting with God: The hearty Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of that same Gift, is saving faith; therefore the first and principal part of our Heart-covenanting with God, is the same thing as saving Faith. The like I say of the Professions of each. Or thus: Our Heart-covenanting is the principal condition of the Promise (or Gods part of the Covenant:) Our saving Faith is the principal condition of the Promise; Therefore our Heart-covenanting and our saving faith are the same. The Major I prove by the <hi>Medium</hi> of the fore-going Argument. Our hearty Acceptance of the Gift, is the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal condition of the Promise. But this hearty Acceptance of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107958:63"/>
the Gift, is the first and principal part of our Heart-covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: therefore our Heart-covenanting is the principal condition of the Promise (or the first and chief part of that covenating at least). The Major is proved, 1. In that it is a free Gift: And our Divines, against the Doctrine of Justification by Works, or Merit, have fully proved, that its so free, that Acceptance is the condition of our Interest. 2. And the free Offers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel fully confirm it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55 1, 2.3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The main point that is necessary for me to insist on, is the proof of the Minor, which yet is so plain from what is said, and the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Gospel offer, that one would think it should need no more to be said to it: But that I perceive some few do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehend the nature of our covenanting with God, as if it were only an Agreement or Covenant to do somewhat for the future, that God may do somewhat for us for the future: And this gross mistake (gross indeed, in the very point of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel promise, which is our only tenure of our Title to Life), doth animate abundance of dark confused quarrelsom contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and oppositions, which I have had on this point. It is a matter of very sad consideration, that any Preacher of the Gospel had need to be perswaded, that the first and great part of the Covenant of Grace offered by God, and accepted by us, doth consist in present <hi>Giving</hi> and <hi>Receiving,</hi> not only in mutual Promises for hereafter. The Gospel is a most free Deed of Gift: some of its benefits it actually giveth, on condition of meer Acceptance to be <hi>presently possest</hi>; and some of them, on condition too, but in a waiting obediential way, to be <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after possest.</hi> In respect to the <hi>presently given</hi> benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is a <hi>Deed of Gift</hi> presently entitling us to them, and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent acceptance is the condition. But in regard of the <hi>future</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, the Gospel is also a Deed of Gift, but giveth not present Title, or at least not so full, and therefore requireth future conditions, as it gives future Benefits. At the present in the New Covenant, God giveth himself to be our God, Christ to be our Saviour, Head and Husband, the Holy Ghost to be our Sanctifier; and also the present actual pardon of our sins; the Justification of our Persons; the Adoption of Sons; the indwelling Spirit; a Right to a beneficial use of the Creature;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107958:64"/>
and a Right to the Inheritance of Everlasting life, so far, that if we should die that hour, we should be saved. All these God offered us at the present on condition of our Accptance, or consent. This consent is our Heart-covenanting; so that this first and great part of the Covenant consisteth but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Giving</hi> and <hi>taking</hi> of all these Benefits: which in a word the Apostle expresseth 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11, 12, by the words [<hi>Christ and eternal Life] God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son: He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life</hi>]. The remaining part of the Benefits are our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture helps of Grace, Pardons, Protections, final Absolution at Judgement, and eternal Glory. All these we have a right to at our first Justification, but it is a right to be continued only on some future conditions, that is, on the condition of our continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the Faith which we begun, and of our renewed faith and Repentance, and sincere Gospel-Obedience, which is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a receiving way. Now its true, that as to these fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conditions, we do not actually perform them in our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venating, but promise them: as God doth not then actually give us the very Blessings now mentioned, but promise them. But as to all the first expressed great Benefits, as God did <hi>before</hi> our Consents but promise and offer them, but <hi>in</hi> our covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or consent doth actually <hi>give</hi> them; so we do by our <hi>covenanting</hi> in heart (which is nothing but our consenting or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting) perform the conditions of Gods promise; and thus our very covenanting with God is the same thing as our fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conditions of the Covenant, that is, of Gods conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deed of Gift, which before gave us Christ and Life if we would accept them, and now giveth them actually upon our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. And I should hope that few Protestants think that our actual Justification and Adoption, our Interest in God, Christ, and the Holy Ghost, are suspended upon any future condition, which in our covenanting with God we must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to perform. I think I have made it plain now that our Heart covenanting with God is principally our present consent that Christ and Life shall be ours; God, Christ, and the Holy Ghost ours; and that this is nothing else but Justifying faith; and therefore that they are all one; and therefore the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107958:64"/>
of each of them is all one: and so that where one is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the other is so, being indeed not another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. We must not baptize any without the profession of that faith and Repentance which are made the condition of Remission of sins. But only the faith called <hi>justifying</hi> or <hi>saving,</hi> and the concomitant true Repentance, are made the condition of Remission of sins: therefore we must baptize none without the profession of that justifying faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Minor needeth no proof. And the Major I prove thus. If we must not baptize any but intentionally for present Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sin, then must we not baptize any without a profession of that faith and Repentance which is the condition of Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But the former is true: therefore so is the later.</p>
            <p>The consequence is past all doubt: for else we should Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that men may have present Actual pardon without that Faith and Repentance which are the condition of it; which subverteth much of the Gospel. The Antecedent I prove thus; If God hath Instituted no Baptism but what is Intentionally for the present Remission of sin, then we must not baptize any but Intentionally for the present Remission of sin: But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is true; therefore so is the later. I say [intentionally] in contradistinction from [Eventually, or certainly and Infallibly attaining that end.] Where further note, That I speak not of Gods absolute <hi>Decrees,</hi> as if his Intention in that sense could be frustrate; but of his ends as Legislator, speaking of him after the manner of men. but principally of the Instituted ends of his Ordinances; that is, the Ends which he requireth the Minister and people to use them for; and so it is <hi>Our Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> principally that I mention. As the Gospel it self is said to be Intentionally to save men; and though it condemn most, that is besides the first Intention, and but by Accident. And though this be principally to be spoken of the prescribed, imposed Intentions of their Conversion and Salvation; yet Christ is pleased in the Word to ascribe such Intentions to himself as attain not their ends: as professing that he came not into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved: that is, To condemn them is not his direct principal Intent, but only on supposition of their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107958:65"/>
willfull final rejecting of him: And this he speakes partly in the habit of a Rector or Promiser, and partly as man, or after the manner of men: And of the intention imposed on us, there is no doubt.</p>
            <p>Now I shall prove the Antecedent (for the consequence is past doubt) And first we are confirmed in this truth, because the Opponent (whom it concerneth) hath not proved any other Baptism instituted by God, but what is for present Remission of sins. If they can shew us one Text of Scripture that speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of any other, we shall give up all the Cause; but yet they have not done it that I know of. In the mean time we shall prove the contrary. God hath instituted but <hi>One Baptism</hi>: that one Baptism is for the present Remission of sins; therefore God hath instituted no Baptism but what is for present Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. The Major is proved from <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. <hi>There is one Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism.</hi> In the Minor we take the words [<hi>for Remission</hi>] not to speak of somewhat accidental, or to be intended only by the Administrator, uncertainly, or but sometime. And I prove it from Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Repent and be Baptized every one of you in in the name of Jesus Christ for the Remission of sins, and ye shall Receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost.</hi>] As <hi>Remission</hi> is here made the end of Baptism, so it is <hi>present Remission:</hi> For. 1. It is such as is the consequent of the Repentance which <hi>Peter</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them to; but that was <hi>present Remission.</hi> 2. It was to precede the giving of the Holy Ghost, in the sense there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; therefore it was <hi>present</hi> Remission. The great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that are brought to the contrary I shall answer afterwards, and more fully then prove the vanity and foul consequents of their opinion, that make a <hi>future</hi> Remission to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended end of our Administration of Baptism: and therefore I must desire the Reader to suspend his expectations of my fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reasons <hi>à Natura rei,</hi> till their due place. <hi>Beza in loc.</hi> saith [<hi>in nomen Christi</hi>] id est, <hi>dans Christo nomen, cujus mortis, sepulturae ac resurrectionis simus in Baptismo participes, cum peccatorum Remissione.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107958:65"/>
and ratifyeth the external Ceremony in those who are his:</hi>] Bullinger <hi>in loc.</hi> saith, [<hi>Baptizari in nomine Domini Jesu Christi, est Baptismatis signo testari se Christo credere ad Remissionem peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> 1. Mark, it is not only an engagement to Believe hereafter, but the Profession of a present Faith. 2. And that not a common faith, but that which hath Remission of sin. 3. And this was not an accidental separable use of Baptism: but he makes this the very exposition of <hi>Baptizari in nomine Jesu Christi.</hi> And next addeth, [<hi>Vel est in Baptismo per Christum recipi in gratiam.</hi>] Mark then, that even Baptism into the name of Christ it self doth signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that we are received into Gods favor by Christ: And thus he expoundeth the Covenant in the next words: [<hi>Est enim Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptismus pactum seu foedus gratiae, quod init inter baptizandum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biscum Christus.</hi>] And that it is a Professing sign of our true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he shews before [<hi>Et rectissimè conjungitur Poenitentia &amp; Baptismus, quia Baptismus Poenitentiae signum est</hi>:]</p>

the very Definition of Baptism he addeth, [<hi>Porrò non est su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menda ex hoc loco Definitio Baptismi, quia ejus partem duntaxat</hi> Petrus <hi>attingit. Per Baptismum (ut</hi> Paulus <hi>docet) crucifigitur vetus homo noster, ut in vitae novitatem resurgamus,</hi> Rom 6.4, 8. <hi>Item induimus Christum ipsum,</hi> Gal. 3.27. 1 Cor. 12. <hi>&amp; passim do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet Scriptura esse Poenitentiae quoque symbolum.</hi>] Indeed <hi>Calvin</hi> doth often fall upon the Papists, that make baptism to have no force against any sin but those before Baptism: But 1. He makes actual Baptism ever to be first for washing away our past &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sin &amp; not then to pardon future sin, but to put the person into an estate wherein he hath a remedie for future sin, at hand, and certain: 2. And he intendeth, that Baptism (as reviewed by faith) afterward may be usefull to confirm our Belief of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of renewed sin: which made <hi>Bellarmine</hi> fall upon him and other Protestants, as holding that the very remembrance of Baptism is effectual for pardon of sin.</p>

            <p>If then it be certain that <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism was for present Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sins, even the obsignation of a Remission already confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the promise, it will be at least as evident that Christs Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism is so to, and accordingly to be administred.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that the Faith which the Apostles before they bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed men did perswade them to, was still a Justifying Faith, (as <hi>Act.</hi> 13.38, 39. <hi>&amp; passim)</hi> as that which they were to annex the Seal of Baptism to, (or to Gods promise on mens believing.)</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9 It is said of the barren ungodly Professor, [<hi>that he hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins</hi>;] where I take it for a clear case that it is the Baptismal Washing which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle there intendeth, wherein all profess to put off the Old Man, and to be washed from their former filthiness. For I
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107958:68"/>
suppose we shall be loth to yield that it was an actual clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, either of Remission or Mortification, which the Apostle meaneth, left we grant that men may fall from such a state: And therefore it must be a Sacramental washing or Cleansing, wherein the matter was appearingly and sacramentally transact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. From whence it is plain, that the Apostle took it for granted, that as all the Baptized were visibly Church-Members, so were they all visibly washed from their old sins; which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both what was their own Profession, and what was the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted end and use of the Ordinance. The Apostle saith not that [he hath forgotten that he promised or engaged to be purged from his old sins,] but that [he was purged] from them. <hi>Pareus in loc.</hi> saith, [<hi>A veteribus peccatis purgatum,</hi> h. e. <hi>se esse baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum: seu se accepisse in Baptismo purgationis signaculum. Omnes enim baptizati debent purgari à peccatis, sicut dicuntur induere Christum,</hi> Gal. 3. <hi>mori cum Christo,</hi> Rom. 6. <hi>sensus est: Qui se volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in sceleribus, non recordantur se baptizatos esse: Abnegant ergo Baptismum suum.</hi>] 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 11. The Apostle saith of the visible Church of Corinth, [<hi>such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified, &amp;c.</hi>] where it is evident, that all the visible members of the Church are visibly washed, sanctified, justified, (of which Text I shall speak more anon.) And I thik it is clear, that by <hi>Washing</hi> here he hath some respect to their Baptism.</p>
            <p>I shall not stand now to add any more texts, because we shall have occasion anon to do it; but may hence conclude, that till one text of Scripture be produced from whence it may be proved, that Christ did institute such a thing as Baptism, which was not for the present signal Remission of sin, we must take the contrary for granted, because we have so many texts that tell us that his Baptism was for Remission of sin.</p>
            <p>I shall only here add, that the very sign it self which is the washing of the body by water, doth plainly shew that the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the soul by the blood of Christ, is the thing signified; and the present actual use of the sign is to signifie the presence and actuality of the thing signified. So that I conclude, that there is no Baptism to be administred without a Profession of saving faith and Repentance fore-going, because there is no Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107958:69"/>
that ever Christ appointed but what is for the obsignation of Remission of sin which is the consequent.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake page</hi> 171. reciteth some words of mine containing this Argument, thus: that faith to which the promise of Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and justification is made, must also be sealed to: Or that faith which is the condition of the promise, is the condition <hi>in foro Dei</hi> of the Title to the seal: But it is only solid true faith that is the condition of the promise of Remission: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that which gives Right <hi>in foro Dei</hi> to the seal] Who would think now but Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> had given some substantial an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this and other Arguments, when himself and some others are so confident of the sufficiency of them? His answer is this [<hi>To this I have answered, faith is not sealed to but Remis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion of sins or salvation upon condition of faith; and when I come to speake of the sealing of Sacraments, I shall God willing make this more evident, that the sacrament,</hi> quâ <hi>seal, immediately respects our priviledges not duties</hi>] Reply. 1. Is here one word of answer to any real part of the Argument? Is not this answer as little to the matter as if he had talk't of another subject. I think it my Duty to say that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospel do but proclaim to the Church the matter of our common lamentation, and the enemies joy, when some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently publish such kind of Disputations, and others are satisfied with them. And I must say, if all were such, they should never more be angred with one word of mine, in opposition to their assertions, though they would maintain that the Crow is white.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To that useless touch that he hath on a word (whose fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing explication might have spared him his labour) I may say that our Divines have ordinarily maintained hitherto that there is a mutual covenanting between God and us (and no man more then Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>) and that in the Sacrament there is a mutual seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the receiving being our seal, as the Act is Gods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg</hi> 6. If Baptism be instituted to be a seal of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of that faith which we have being yet unbaptized, then must we Baptize none that profess not a justifying faith (and their seed) But the Antecedent is true; therefore so is the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
            <p>The reason of the consequence is evident in that we must
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107958:69"/>
use Baptism only according to its nature, and to its instituted ends.</p>
            <p>The Antecedent is proved thus: Circumcision was institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a seal of the righteousness of that faith which they had being yet uncircumcised: therefore Baptism is instituted to be a seal of the righteousness of that faith which we have yet unbaptized; the consequence will not be denyed by them whom we now deal with: Because they confess that Baptism succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Circumcision. The Antecedent is evident in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. It being so expresly said of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom circumcision was first given. I cannot imagine what they will say, unless it be by recourse to the Anabaptists shift, to say, that Circumcision was instituted to this end indeed, to <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, and others that were sincere, but not to all that had right to it. But God here tels us, the established use and end of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and in such Relations, the end is inseparable. And as God hath not made many sorts of Baptisms or Circumcisions, so neither many neerer inconsistent ends, (or separable.) And we are likest to know the true end of the institution, where the institution and first example are reported to us.</p>

But I perceive by this how he is like to use other Authors that cannot speak for themselves, that would perswade men that I speak for him, even where I expresly speak for the same cause which I now maintain against him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> 13.35. [<hi>By this shall all men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye love one another.</hi>] Here Christ giveth a certain badg by which his true Disciples may be known. If only those that love one another, are true Disciples in heart; then only those that Profess to love one another, are Disciples by Profession: But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that this Love is a special Grace, and Inseparable concomitant of saving faith, is manifest in that [<hi>By this we know that we are translated from death to life, because we love the Brethren,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.14.

            <p>All this that I have said, is no more then we have ever pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, when in Baptism we renounced the World, Flesh, and Devil, and promised to fight under Christs Banner, to our lives end.

               <hi>Obj.</hi> Any one is a Disciple that is willing to learn of Christ. <hi>Answ.</hi> No such matter: In an improper sence you may so call them, but not in Scripture sense; where 1. A <hi>Disciple</hi> and a <hi>Christian</hi> are all one, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.26. But every one that is willing to learn of Christ is not a Christian; therefore not a disciple. 2. A Disciple of Christ is one that will take him for the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the Church (<hi>which whosoever heareth not shall be cut off from Gods people)</hi> and will learn of him as of the Christ. But so wil not all that will learn of him: for a man that taketh Christ but for a common wise man as <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> may be willing to learn of him: and so may be his Disciple in another sense, but not in the Christian sense, as a Christian. 3. He that is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely a Disciple of Christ in heart, doth take him for one that by redemption also hath Propitiated the offended Majesty, and as King hath authority to rule him; and submitteth to him in his whole office as he is the Christ: For he cannot be truly a Christian that taketh not Christ as Christ, and believeth not in him in all that is essential to his office, and so to the object of our faith. As he that believeth that Christ is God only, or Man only, is no Christian, so he that believeth in him as a Teacher only; for that is no more then to believe in him as in <hi>Moses</hi> or <hi>Elias:</hi> 4. He that is sincerely a Disciple in heart, must take Christ for his only Teacher in the way to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, renouncing all other except as they stand under him; and must be willing to be taught and guided by him in all things: therefore he that is a professed Disciple, must profess all this: And that is to profess saving Faith. For without saving faith no man can so believe in him, or be heartily willing to be taught by him.</p>
            <p>The lessons that they are to learn of him are self-denial, and the contempt of this world, and the love of one another, and to be meek and lowly in heart that they may find rest to their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107958:73"/>
souls, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27, 28. And these he proclaimeth when he inviteth men to his school. But no ungodly man is willing to learn any of these: and therefore unwilling are they to be his Disciples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. We ought not to baptize those persons (or their Infants as theirs) who are visible members of the Kingdom of the Devil (and his children) or that do not so much as profess their forsaking of the child-hood and Kingdom of the devil, But such are all that profess not a saving faith; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Major is proved thus. If we must Baptize none but for present admission into the Kingdom of Christ, then we must baptize none but those that profess a present departure from the Kingdom of the devil. But the former is true: therefore so is the latter. The Antecedent is granted by those that I have to do with. The reason of the consequence is evident, in that all the world is divided into these two Kingdoms, and they are so opposite that there is no passing into one but from the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> of the first Argument I prove thus. All they are visibly in the Kingdom of the Devil, or not so much as by Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion removed out of it who Profess not a removal from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in which the wrath of God abideth on them, and they are excluded by the Gospel from everlasting life. But such are all that profess not a justifying faith. Therefore I express the <hi>Major</hi> two waies disjunctively, lest any should run to instances of men that are converted &amp; have not yet had a cal or opportunity to profess it. If such are not visibly in the Kingdom of the Devil, at least they are not visibly out of it. The Major is proved, in that it is the condition of the covenant of grace performed that differenceth the members of Christs Kingdom from Satans: and so it is that condition profest to be performed that visibly differenceth them before men. It is the promise of grace that bringeth them out of Satans Kingdom: therefore it is only done invisibly to those that profess the performance of the condition. Moreover to be out of Satans Kingdom visibly, is to be visibly from under his Government; but those that profess not saving faith, are not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly from under his Government. Lastly to be visibly out of Satans Kingdom, is to be visibly freed from his power as the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107958:73"/>
Executioner of Gods eternal vengeance: But so are none that profess not saving faith.</p>
            <p>The Minor is proved from <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son,</hi> (or obeyeth not) <hi>shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him</hi>; where it is plain. 1. That the unbelief spoken of, is that which is opposed to saving faith, even to that faith which hath here the promise of everlasting life. 2. And that this leaves them visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly under the wrath of God.</p>
            <p>So in <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. In the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ bids them make him Disciples; and in the former he describeth those that are such, and those that remain still in the Kingdom of Satan [<hi>He that blieveth and is Baptized shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and he that believeth not shall be damned</hi>] Here it is evident that the unbelief threatned is that which is contrary to (and even the privation of) the faith that Salvation is expresly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to: and that all that profess not this saving fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th, are not so much as professedly escaped a state of Damnation: and that this is the differencing Character of Christs Disciples to be baptized (of which yet more afterward), so <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. It is the <hi>opening of mens eyes and the turning them from darkness to light, and the power of Satan to God, that they may receive Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sins, &amp;c. which is the</hi> true state of them that are Christians in heart: and the Profession of this that proveth them professed Christians: and they that do not profess to be thus enlightned and converted, do not profess to be brought from under the power of Satan; for that is here made the <hi>terminus à quo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi>] Here the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing into the Kingdom of Christ is by passing from the Kingdom of darkness, so that he is not <hi>Cordially</hi> in one that is <hi>Cordially</hi> in the other; and consequently he is not by <hi>Profession</hi> in the one, who is not by <hi>Profession</hi> past from the other: He that professeth not such a faith as proveth men in Christs Kingdom, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not so much as may prove him out of Satans. And expresly it is said, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8 10. <hi>He that committeth sin, is of the Devil. In this the Children of God are manifest &amp; the Children of the Devil; he that doth not righteousness is not of God, &amp;c.] These passages will

If we we are baptized into Christ, then are we Christ's and have put on Christ, and are all one in Christ, and are <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, and heirs according to promise. If any object that the Apostle speaks this but of some of them, even of the Regenerate, because he saith [as many of you] I answer, it is manifest that he speaks of all, 1 Because it was <hi>all of them</hi> that were <hi>baptized into Christ.</hi> 2.

            <p>Indeed this Text affordeth us divers Arguments. 1. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle supposeth all the Baptized to profess a justifying faith, among the Galathians: therefore so must we suppose of others,

But the rest of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here will be further touched on anon.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake saith</hi> p. 152. [<hi>Whether all union with Christ imply Regeneration, let</hi> John 15.2. <hi>be consulted, where an union with Christ is clearly held out: Yet</hi> Mr. Baxter <hi>brings that text among, others to prove that there are some saints that shall never be saved] Answ.</hi> 1. But I told you that by Saints I meant only those that profess an Acceptance of Christ, and not your Saints that only profess a lower faith. In this you do by me as you use. 1. Union with Christ in the primary and proper sense is proper to the sound believer; or else no Title or benefit on earth is proper to him. But as those are believers in profession that are not so in heart, so those are united to or ingraffed into the Church, and so to Christ, by an outward Profession, who are not so in heart. And this is called a Union, because they profess that inward Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they have not, which is the <hi>famosius significatum.</hi> Whether these be only equivocally said to be united to Christ, we shall enquire in season. But tell me where any man was ever said in scripture to be united to Christ without saving faith, or the Profession of it? 3. I suppose you know how many of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do expound <hi>Iohn</hi> 15, of a saving Union, and take the cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about unfruitfulness and Apostacy to be <hi>de rebus nunquam futuris,</hi> purposely given that they might not be future: But this I stick not on.</p>

               </gap> profess to take him for a Husband. Therefore for my part, I never intend to baptize any without profession of saving faith. As for Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> answer that [<hi>we are oftener said here to be espoused to Christ, then married</hi>] I think that this and many hundred such passages, do need no answer: But yet I shall say, 1. Either will serve my turn. No unregenerate man is truly espoused to Christ. 2. Though the whole Church in one, be solemnly to be married to Christ at judgement, that is, presented perfect, justified and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; yet that particular believers are married to Christ here, I am resolved by Gods assistance to believe while I believe <hi>Isa.</hi> 54.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. and many other Texts of scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 10. If <hi>Paul</hi> account all the Baptized, <hi>Saints, or sanctified men, dead with Christ and risen with him, such as have put on Christ, sons of God by Adoption,</hi> Abraham <hi>seed, Heirs according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and justified,</hi> then did they all profess a true justifying faith. But the Antecedent is certain, <hi>ergò</hi> so is the consequent.</p>
            <p>The Antecedent Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> confesseth. And I shall prove it by parts. The consequence is that which lieth chiefly on me to prove; and I shall do both together.</p>
            <p>The Apostle in the beginning of his Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and in may other places calls the whole Church <hi>Saints,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.11. He saith to them, [<hi>But ye are washed, ye are sanctified,</hi> &amp;c,] That part of the Antecedent then is certain. The conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence I prove thus. There are none called <hi>Saints</hi> in all the new Testament, but only such as where in <hi>heart</hi> Devoted to Christ by a saving faith; or <hi>Professed</hi> so much: therefore the word Saints in this case must signifie only such. If any will prove a third sort
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107958:75"/>
of Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> such as profess a faith not saving, they must do that which I never yet saw done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The first and most famous signification of the word <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Sanctified</hi> in the new Testament, is only of them that are in heart devoted to Christ by true faith: therefore the borrowed or Analogical, or less proper signification (call it what you list) must be of that which hath the likeness or appearance of this; and that is only the profession of it, and not the profession of another thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us peruse the texts, and see whether it be not a special Saint-ship which <hi>Paul</hi> ascribeth to these, and therefore as to appearance and Profession, they had! 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. [<hi>such were some of you; but ye are washed, ye are sanctified, ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God</hi>] and that sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But such did this seem to <hi>Paul</hi> which he speaketh of, as is exprest in the Text: therefore there must needs be at least a Profession of this.</p>
            <p>And because Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> tells me <hi>pag.</hi> 14<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. how well I know that he hath proved his assertion, I shall peruse all those Texts which he citeth to that end, in his Book of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g.</hi> 207 208. And first we must observe, that the persons that he there himself speaketh of, are [<hi>Visible Professors</hi>] as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the [<hi>Elect and Regenerate,</hi>] yea from those that [<hi>are really Saints, and shall be for heaven:</hi>] And he calleth them [<hi>men separate for God and Dedicated to him.</hi>] But this is unedifying slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery dealing to confound two distinct causes to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ther. He that is professedly Dedicated to God, is a Professor of saving Faith. He that is really and heartily Dedicated to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>od, shall certainly be saved. Here Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> pleadeth the cause that I do maintain, and not that which he hath undertaken against me and the common truth. I confess as well as he, that Profession maketh Saints visible, or by profession, as hearty Dedication to God by faith maketh real or heart-Saints. But how angry is he himself afterwards at this distinction of [<hi>Real and Professed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107958:76"/>
Saints</hi>] as if that none but the justified were real Saints. But what is all this to a Saint-ship consisting in the Profession of a faith short of that which is Justifying? I shall take these last to be Mr. <hi>Blake's</hi> Saints, and no Scripture Saints, (I mean Saints of his denomination.) till he have better proved that ever Scripture so calleth them. The Texts cited by him are these: Frst, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.3. [<hi>Saints on earth.</hi>] And I yield to him that there are Saints on earth. Then 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 16.10. where we read of [<hi>Collections for the Saints,</hi>] and [<hi>Administration to the Saints</hi>] By these (I doubt not) but he may prove that more than the heart-Saints are called Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that is because they profess and seem to be heart-Saints. These Texts are far from proving that there are any Saints that profess not saving sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I shall anon tell Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> who they were that <hi>Calvin</hi> and other Protestants do expound the word [<hi>Saints</hi>] of, in such Passages as these; though he hath already told us, that he [<hi>abhorreth</hi>] the Doctrine which they maintain.</p>
            <p>But this is a Practical case that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath here put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Communion of Saints doth not only consist in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in God's Worship, but also in mutual relief, and free communication of outward things, as the Text which he here citeth doth declare. Those therefore that are of his mind must communicate as well to the Professors of a common Faith, as of a saving Faith. But hear who they be that <hi>Pareus</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth <hi>Paul</hi> to mean [in loc. <hi>Docemur vero ad <gap reason="foreign">

Nam Fidei &amp; charitatis unitas omnes in Christo Capite conjungit</hi>] It is then the Members of Christ united in him and joyned in Faith and Love: And those that Profess to be such, are so to us.</p>
            <p>Acts 26.10. Acts 9.2. [<hi>When</hi> Paul <hi>shut up many of the Saints in prison, and did much evil against them, he knew no other way of distinction than an outward Profession, &amp;c.</hi>] saith Mr <hi>Blake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Nor do we know means hearts; nor think that <hi>Paul</hi> knew them. But the Question is, <hi>What they professed</hi>? Whether saving Sanctity or a common Sanctity and Faith short of it?</p>
            <p>He addeth, [<hi>We read of Churches of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.33.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107958:76"/>
               <hi>and they were taken in to be Church-Members as soon as they made profession, as they ceased to be Jews or Pagans, and took them to the way of Christianity,</hi> as we see <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12, 13, 38.] <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. They renounced the way of ungodliness and wickedness in general by a Profession of repentance, as well as the way of Paganism and Judaiism, in particular. There were no Christians that Professed not Repentance towards God; from dead works. 2. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there were <hi>Churches of the Saints</hi>; and therefore that none should be of the Church that Profess not to be <hi>true Saints.</hi> But prove if you can that there was ever either Church or Church-member called <hi>Saints</hi> in Scripture, that had no either special Sanctity or a <hi>Profession</hi> of it. You say nothing to prove that any were called Saints upon the Profession of a Faith short of saving Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Emphaticum est</hi> (saith <hi>Calvin</hi> in loc.) <hi>quod exprimit sanctorum acsi Ecclesias rite compositas à sinistra nota subduceret.</hi>] Of which see him fully on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. And as for those <hi>Acts</hi> 8. you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove that any of them were either called Saints or Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed without a Profession of a Justifying faith: as shall further be shewed afterward.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Blake</hi> addeth [<hi>The Epistles wrote to particular visible Churches are inscribed to Saints; among which, what some are, read both the Epistles to the Corinthians; yea, what almost all are in some Churches, read the Epistle to the Church of</hi> Sardis. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. No man in any of these Churches is called a Saint upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of any lower kind of faith, but only on the presence or profession of saving faith. 2. I have not heard a proof that the worst of these Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s had many members, (if any) that were impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and obstin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te in any error or sin after admonition, and so that were visibly destitute of the saving Sanctity which they did Profess. 3. If such there were, the Churches are commanded to cast them out, and then they will be no longer numbred with the Saints. 4. The Apostles may well call the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety Saints when part are really so in heart, and the rest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it. We commonly tell both Papists and Separatists, that the Scripture thus denominateth the whole from the better part; as a field is called a Corn-field, though theree be more Tares then Corn; and yet you will not call the Tares Corn:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107958:77"/>
No more will I call the ungodly <hi>Saints,</hi> when I know them though I will call the Church <hi>Saints</hi> where they are, and them, while they Profess themselves <hi>Saints,</hi> and I know not but they are so. 5. If you can with patience but read what <hi>Clavin</hi> saith on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. and <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> (to name no more now) you will see that Doctrine which you <hi>abhor</hi> maintained by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and in what current it is that your opinion floweth.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> adds [<hi>The Apostle tells us of the faith once delivered to the Saints:</hi> Jude 3. <hi>the doctrine of Faith as is agreed on all hands, all that profess that Doctrine are Saints.] Answ.</hi> All that cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally entertain that Doctrine are Saints in Heart; All that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess so to entertain it are Saints by Profession. (while that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession hath any validity.) But all that barely profess to assent to the truth of that Doctrine, and no mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, (unless as that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent may imply the Consent of the Will) are not Saints.</p>
            <p>But let us peruse some other Texts besides these that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> citeth. The Congregations of the Saints are mentioned in the Old Testament, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 89 5, 7. and 149 1. But what Saints these were, may appear by the Promises made to them. <hi>Ps.</hi> 149.5, 9, 4 &amp; 16.3. &amp; 37.28. &amp; 97.10 &amp; 132.9, 16. &amp; 145 10. The Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> a people neer unto him are called Saints, <hi>Psal.</hi> 148.14. but it is because they are a part of them, his people in heart, and the rest profess themselves to be his People in a saving sense. And if there were any that did not so, he was not an Israelite by Religion, nor to be of that Common-wealth, but to be cut off from his People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 9.13. The Saints at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> persecuted, were such as not only professed saving Faith, but also had the witness of Martyrdom and Persecutions to testifie their Sincerity. They that continued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and breaking bread, and prayers, having all things common, selling their possessions and goods, and parting them to all men as every man had need, praising God &amp;c. did profess more then a Faith and Repentance short of that by which we are saved: But so did the Church at <hi>Jerusalem, Act.</hi> 2.41, 42. to the end; <hi>yea, the multitude of them that Believed were of one heart, &amp; one soul, and great grace was upon them all,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32. <hi>to</hi> 36. so that we may see what Saints the Church at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were. And
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107958:77"/>
if all were not such, we see evidently that the whole was deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from such.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were all called Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. True: But what was meant by that word, and what Saints did they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to <hi>Paul</hi> by their Profession to be? Even such as were [<hi>belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God, whose Faith was spoken of throughout the world, that were dead to sin, but alive to God, that had obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine delivered to them, and being made free from sin became the servants of Righteousness and of God, having their fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life,</hi> Rom. 1.7, 8. and 6 11, 14, 17, 18, 21. <hi>whose obedience was come abroad to all men.</hi> Rom. 16.19. Here is more then the Profession of a common Faith.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Corinthians</hi> are called Saints; True: But what is meant by Saints? such as [<hi>called on the name of the Lord Iesus Christ, having much of his grace, enriched by him in all things, coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in no Gift, waiting for the coming <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Object.</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> saith, they were <hi>carnal,</hi> and taxeth them with some gross Errors and Sins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. So are all the Regenerate <hi>carnal</hi> in part, and guilty of too many sins: And it is not Impenitency after admonition that he chargeth them with. Their sin was no worse to our eye than <hi>David's</hi> or <hi>Solomon's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If any were so bad as to be notoriously ungodly, those are not of that number whom he calleth <hi>Saints,</hi> as they are not of them that have the following Descriptions of Saints

which I have cited; but only were among them, but not of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Galathians</hi> I find not called Saints; but to call them a Church of Christ, or Believers, is Equipollent. And what Saints were they? Why they were [<hi>all the Sons of God by Faith in Christ Jesus, having been baptized into Christ, and put him on, and were all one in him, and were</hi> Abraham's <hi>seed, and heirs according to the Promise.</hi>] Gal. 3.26, 27, 29. And [<hi>because they were sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into their hearts, by which they cryed Abba Father, and therefore were no more servants but sons, and if sons, then heirs of God through Christ.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> was afraid of them, lest he bestowed upon them labour in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It appeareth by what is said, that it was not such a fear as made him take them for ungodly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This confirmeth what I maintain; that the Apostles judgement of them proceeded according to the Evidences of probability: He took himself bound to believe their Profession so far as they contradicted it not; and according to the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of their Errors which were against it, he was jealous of their condition: and if they had proceeded so far as to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themselves certainly ungodly, <hi>Paul</hi> would have denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated them a Church no more.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> are called Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.1. But what Saints? such as were [<hi>blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, chosen before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before him in love, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107958:78"/>
Scripture are used to denominate or describe a Church or Saint, we might easily be resolved by such passages as these, what <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth by a Church or Saint.</p>
            <p>See further <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18. <hi>All Saints comprehend what is the breadth, and length, &amp; depth, &amp; height; and Christ dwelleth in their hearts by faith, and they rooted and grounded in love] Eph.</hi> 3.17, 18. But Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Saints do none of this; therefore they are no Saints in Scripture sense. With this text compare <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19. and see what a Church is and what it is to be <hi>fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the houshold of God</hi>: and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12. what Saints they were that were to be perfected: and 5 3. what Saints they were that must not so much as name <hi>Coveteousness, filthiness,</hi> &amp;c. And 3.8. <hi>Paul</hi> professeth himself <hi>less then the least of all Saints</hi>: But <hi>Paul</hi> never did nor would profess himself less then the least of Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Saints, who are not as much as by profession in a state of salvation, nor from under the curse and wrath of God. He that pronounceth them accursed with <hi>Anathema Maranatha, that loved not the Lord Jesus,</hi> &amp; bids <hi>grace be with them that love him in sincerity,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.24.) would not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced himself less than the least of these excommunicate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed ones. And were I worthy to be heard, I would advise my Reverend Brother to better consideration before he make such <hi>accursed</hi> Saints, or Churches, or Believers, at least that are visibly so: and that he would be cautelous of Canonizing those on whom <hi>Paul</hi> pronounceth Anathema Maranatha.</p>
            <p>To proceed, the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi> are called <hi>Saints</hi>; True, but what Saints? such on whom <hi>Paul</hi> was [<hi>confident that he which had begun a good work in them, would perform it till the day of Jesus Christ: to whom it was given on behalf of Christ not only to believe but to suffer for his sake: who alwaies obeyed in presence &amp; absence: for God wrought in them to will and to do: they only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to</hi> Paul <hi>in giving &amp; receiving: and they were such as bad cause alway to rejoyce,</hi> Phil. 1.6, 29. and 2.12, 13. and 4.15, 4.</p>
            <p>The Church of the <hi>Colossians</hi> are called <hi>Saints</hi>: But what Saints? such as [<hi>had faith in Christ Jesus, and love to all Saints, and had hope laid up for them in heaven, who were made meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light, being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the power of darkness, and translated into the Kingdom

of his dear Son</hi> (that is the Church) <hi>in whom they had redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins, being reconciled by the body of his flesh through death to be presented holy, and unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and unreprovable in his sight, if they continued in the faith, grounded and setled, and were not moved away from the hope of the Gospel, whose ardor and stedfastness of faith in Christ,</hi> Paul <hi>beheld in the Spirit with joy: who were buried with Christ in baptism, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen with him through faith; and being before dead, were quickened with him, and had the forgiveness of all trespasses, having put off the body of the sins of the flesh; who were dead, and their life was hid with Christ in God, and who shall appear with Christ in Glory when he appeareth.] Col.</hi> 1. and 2. and 3.</p>
            <p>If it shall be replyed, that <hi>Paul</hi> spake all this of them in the Judgement of Charity, or denominated the whole from the better part, and the Profession of the rest; I say even so also it is that he calleth them all Saints: the denomination is on the same ground as the description is. I cannot imagine what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable evasion can be made from this evidence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Thessalonians</hi> are consequentially called Saints, in being called a Church of Christ. And what a Church? and what Saints? such as [<hi>had the work of Faith, Labour of Love, and patience of Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, whose Election</hi> Paul <hi>knew, who turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God from Idols, to serve the true and living God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, who delivered them from the wrath to come, &amp; they received the word as the word of God, which effectually worked in them that believed, who followed the Churches in suffering; who were</hi> Pauls <hi>joy and glory in the presence of Christ at his coming, whose faith and Charity was so reported to</hi> Paul, <hi>that he tells them be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, if they stand fast: for God had not appointed them to wrath, but to obtain salvation by Jesus Christ.</hi>] 1 Thess. 1 &amp; 2. &amp; 3. &amp; 5. They were such Saints whom <hi>Christ would come at last to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in, and such Believers in whom he will then be admired, even because the Gospel was believed among them.</hi>] (therefore say not, To believe the Gospel is a common thing, short of saving Faith.) 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. We see then what the Church and Saints at <hi>Thessalonica</hi> was.</p>
            <p>The Hebrews (to whom the Apostle wrote) are called Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.24. And he doth not groundlesly call them Saints;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107958:79"/>
for they were such as [<hi>were made a gazing-stock by reproaches &amp; afflictions, and became companions of them that were so used, &amp; took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, knowing in themselves that they have in heaven a better and more enduring substance.</hi>] vid. ult. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.33, 34, 35. They were such indeed as he saw cause to exhort to perseverance, and warn of the danger of Apostacie (and the best have need of that) But yet [<hi>though he so spake, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded better things of them, and such as accompany salvation.</hi>] and he gives his reason of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>And having said so much of the several Churches under the name of Saints, I shall proceed and shew you what they are <hi>as Churches,</hi> though this will after fall in, in another Argument, because it will be fittes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for all to lie together, and then I shall refer you hither, when this afterward falls in. You may see by what is said, what Churches all these were that are already mentioned; and consequently what a Church is in Scripture-sense; not a society of men professing a faith short of justifying; but a society of men professing true saving faith; yea, so far pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing it, as to induce the Apostles to denominate them such, as supposing them such indeed: For as they knew some were such, so did they not know the contrary by any particulars, except those whom they commanded them to cast out, as none of them.</p>
            <p>The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> writes to the scattered Jews that professed Christianity: And what kind of Christians or Believers did he take them for? Why, for such as were [<hi>Elect according to the fore-knowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto Obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.</hi>] And Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> cannot say that this was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Election, or common Sanctification, and Obedience, and Sprinkling of Christs blood: For it is added, that [<hi>God of his abundant mercy had begotten them again to a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an Inheritance incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and undefiled, that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for them, and that they are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last times, wherein they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oyced, suffering the trial of their precious faith</hi>: and [<hi>having not seen Christ loved him, and believeing in him rejoyced with joy
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107958:80"/>
unspeakable and full of glory, receiving the end of their faith, the salvation of their souls.</hi>] If all these people had not, or professed and seemed not to have a saving faith, I know not what words can express a saving faith, nor what persons have such a thing.</p>
            <p>The like testimonies the Apostle <hi>John</hi> gives of them, as may quickly be seen.</p>
            <p>But all the doubt is, Whether the seven reproved Churches in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. were such or not? To which I say, 1. All of them professed the foresaid saving Faith. 2. There is no sin charged on them that was visible and inconsistent with true saving Faith. 1. For the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> we heard what they were estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Paul</hi> a little before; and here their grace is mentioned; and the faults expressed are consistent with true grace. 2. The same I say of the Churches of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatyra.</hi> And for the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> and other Hereticks, whom they are blamed for suffering (as the former is commended for hating them) they are such as were to be cut off from the Church; and while they were in it were not of it: Nor are they any where called Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Saints, Disciples, or Church-members.</p>
            <p>But it is the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> takes special no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. And it is said of her indeed, that she had a Name to live and was dead. But, 1. in that they had a name to live, it seems it was a living faith which they Professed, and not only one short of it. 2. Their death was not a death in reigning sin, such as is the death of the unsanctified: But a declining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, comparatively called death, as the children of God do oft complain of deadness. And therefore its next said, [<hi>Be watchful and strengthen the things that remain, that are ready to dye.</hi>] And its exprest, that their deadness was in that their works were not found perfect before God; that is, that many or most of them had defiled their garments, (with some Heresie or vice) which the rest had not done. 3. How far this was notorious to others, is of further enquiry. 4. If they had gone on so far, as by obstinate impenitency after admonition to shew themselves void of saving faith, they had been unchurched, as appeareth by the threatning.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is so far commended, as that the case is put out of doubt. And the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> though
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107958:80"/>
discommended, hath nothing visible charged upon it inconsistent with sincerity; and the luke-warmness which is charged on them, they are threatned to be spewed out for, and so to be unchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And thus we see what a Church was, and what Saints were, and what Believers and Disciples were supposed to be by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and what is the signification of these words in Scripture: for they are all of the same extent.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saith [<hi>He is a believer in Scripture,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>pag.</hi> 205.206.</note> 
               <hi>that is a visible Professor, that puts himself in the number of those that expect sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Jesus Christ.] Answ.</hi> 1. A Professor of what? Of true saving faith. 2. Not that puts himself among them locally only, for so may an Infidel; but that becomes one of them as far as to a Profession of it. And if they <hi>expect salvation by Christ,</hi> either they profess that faith which salvation is annexed to, or else they give God the lye, and contradict both Scripture and themselves even in their very Profession: As if they should say, [<hi>I look to be saved by Christ, but I will not take him for my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, nor be saved from sin by him</hi>] And sure such a Profession makes no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n a Saint, Believer or Church-member.</p>
            <p>Thus much I have said to prove that all the Baptized are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Saints; and therefore Professed a saving Sanctity.</p>
            <p>The second Title which I mentioned follows, (of which I shall be more brief.) All the Baptized are accounted to be dead and risen with Christ, even dead to sin, and risen to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of life; therefore they all profess a saving faith. The proof of this is full in the two Texts already cited, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12.</p>
            <p>Rom. 6.33 &amp;c. [<hi>How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein? Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by Baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Life. For if we have been planted together into the likeness of his Death, we shall be also in the likeness of his Resurrection. Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that hence forth we should not serve sin; for he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. — Likewise, reckon ye
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107958:81"/>
also your selves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a full Report of the use of Baptism and the Profession of all that are Baptized, and the state that they are supposed to be in: so that I cannot speak it plainlier than the words themselves do. <hi>Calv.</hi> on the Text saith, [<hi>Extra Controversiam est induere nos Christum in Baptismo, &amp; hâc lege nos baptizari, ut unum cum ipso simus. — Imò docet hanc mortis societatem praecipuè in Baptismo spectandam esse. Neque enim ablutio sola illic, sed mortificatio quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que &amp; veteris hominis interitus proponitur: Vnde palàm fit, ex quo recipimur in Christi gratiam, mortis ejus efficaciam statim emergere. Porro quid valeat hae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> cum morte Christi societas, continuo sequitur; — ut scilicet nobis emortui si amus novi homines: Nam à mortis societate transitum merito facit ad vitae participationem: quia haec duo inter se individuo nexu cohaerent, veterem hominem Christi mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te aboleri, ut ejus resurrectio justitiam instauret, nosque efficiat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas creaturas. — Haec autem est Doctrina; Quod Mors Christi efficax est ad nequitiam carnis nostrae extinguendam ac prostigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam: Resurrectio vero ad suscitandam melioris naturae novitatem: quódque per Baptismum in istius gratiae participationem cooptamur. — In summa; Qualis sit Baptismi ritè suscepti veritas docet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. which I shall not stay to recite, because it is to the same purpose and before cited.</p>
            <p>The third Title mentioned in the Argument, is this: All that are Baptized have Professedly <hi>put on Christ:</hi> therefore they have professed saving Faith. The Antecedent is expressed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. [<hi>For as many as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.</hi>] The Consequence is proved, in that, to <hi>put on Christ heartily,</hi> is, to be made true partakers of him, and living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of him: therefore <hi>to Profess</hi> this is inseparable from the Profession of saving Faith; yea, by that faith is he truly put on. <hi>Putting on Christ</hi> is the same with [Putting on the New man, which after God is created in Righteousness and true holiness, being <hi>renewed in the spirit of our minds</hi> Ephes. 4.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. Col. 3.10. <hi>It is putting on the New man which is renewed in knowledge according to the Image of him that created him.</hi>] So that this is no common work, if any be proper to the saved. And <hi>putting on the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> is put for the state of Sanctity,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107958:81"/>
in opposition to a fleshly Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13, 14. saith <hi>Calvin</hi> on this Text [<hi>Induere Christum hic significat virtute Spiritus ejus undique nos muniri, qua idonei ad omnes Sanctitatis partes redda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur: sic enim instauratur in nobis imago Dei quae unicum est ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae ornamentum. Respicit enim</hi> Paulus <hi>ad vocationis nostrae sinem, quia Deus nos adoptans, in corpus unigeniti silii sui inserit, &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem hac lege, ut nos abdicantes priore vita, siamus in ipso novi ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines. Quare etiam alibi fideles dicit Christum in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uere in baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> Gal. 3.27.] and upon <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.27. he saith [<hi>Quum dicit, Christum induisse, intelligit Christo sic esse insitos, ut coram Deo nomen ac personam Christi gerant, ac in ipso magis quàm in seipsis censeantur.</hi>] And he comes to the objection, How all that are baptized can be said to put on Christ, when Baptism is not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual with all? And he answereth in sum, That to Hypocrites it is uneffectual, <hi>qui nudis signis superbiunt.</hi> But then he saith, that the Apostle speaking of these [<hi>non respicit Dei institutionem, sed impiorum corruptelam.</hi> (But doubtless it is Gods institution that we must look to for direction in our administration.) <hi>Quum autem fideles alloquitur, qui rite utuntur, illa tunc conjungit cum sua veritate, quam figurant. Quare? neque enim fallacem Pompam ostentat in Sacramentis, sed quae externa Ceremonia figurat, exhibit simul reipsa. Hinc sit, ut veritas, secundum Dei institutum, conjuncta sit cum signis.</hi>] To the same purpose say other Protestants.</p>
            <p>The next Title mentioned in the Argument was, <hi>Sons of God.</hi> All that are Baptized are the visible or esteemed Sons of God by faith in Christ: therefore they all profess that justifying faith to which the real or special Son-ship is promised.</p>
            <p>The Antecedent is experssed in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16, 17. [<hi>For ye are all the Sons of God by Faith in Christ Jesus</hi>;] which he proveth in the next words, [<hi>For as many as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.</hi>] What <hi>Sons of God</hi> are in Scripture sense, may be seen <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Rom</hi> 8.14, 19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 1, 2, 5, 7. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. [<hi>If sons, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ</hi>] was a good consequence in <hi>Pauls</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. [<hi>In this</hi> (saith <hi>John) the children of God are manifest from the children of the devil: whosoever doth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother,</hi> 1 John 3.10.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:107958:82"/>
therefore Mr <hi>Blake</hi>'s Saints are not the children of God, but of the Devil. See also <hi>John</hi> 11.52. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 16.21.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> objecteth <hi>Rom</hi> 9.4. <hi>To them pertained the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi>] and <hi>Gomarus</hi> his Comment. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. <hi>Gomarus</hi> saith not, that any were in either sense sons of God, without a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> of saving Faith. 2. It was not after their unchurching for unbelief, that the Adoption is said to pertain to them, but before: and then let Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> prove if he can, that any <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were adopted without profession of that Faith which was then saving. I doubt not to prove the contrary anon. And 3. If he could prove that such there were among the <hi>Israelites,</hi> yet he will never prove that they are called Sons though the Nation were, because the denomination was principally from the true Sons, and next from the professed ones, but never from or to them that professed only a common faith. None are visibly Sons, that be not visibly true Believers.</p>
            <p>The next Title mentioned in the Argument is [<hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Seed</hi>] All that are baptized, are called <hi>Abrahams Seed.</hi> Gal. 3.17, 18, 19. therefore they all profess a justifying Faith. The Consequence is proved, in that none are <hi>Abraham's Seed</hi> in Scripture Gospel sense, but those <hi>cordially</hi> that are true Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and those <hi>appearingly</hi> that profess true Faith. This is proved <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. [<hi>that he might be the Father of all them that believe, that Righteousness might be imputed to them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.</hi>] This therefore is a justifying faith, and the priviledge of the Justified that is here mentioned. Its added <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13. [<hi>And the Father of Circumcision to them who are not of the Circumcision, but also walk in the steps of the faith of our Father Abraham yet uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cmucised: for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or his seed by the law, but by the righteousness of faith. —Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace, to the end the prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>se might be sure to all the seed — even to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, the Father of us all.</hi>]</p>
            <p>So <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6.7, 8, 9. [<hi>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness: Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham: and the Scripture fore-seeing that God would justifie th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> heathen by faith preached before the Gospel to Abraham: in thee shall all N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tions be
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107958:82"/>
blessed. So then, they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.] So <hi>ver.</hi> 14.16. [<hi>That the blessing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come on the Gentiles, through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the Promise of the Spirit through faith. Now to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his seed were the Promises made: he saith not, and to seeds, as of many, but as of one; And to thy seed, which is Christ:</hi> and so to those that are in him.</p>
            <p>It is hence most undeniable, That all <hi>Abrahams</hi> true Seed are Justified and have a Justifying faith; and all his Professing seed do Profess this faith.</p>
            <p>The next Title mentioned in the Argument is, [<hi>Heirs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Promise.</hi>] All the Baptized were Heirs according to the Promise: None that Profess not a Justifying faith are Heirs according to the Promise (either really or appearingly;) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none that Profess not a Justifying faith (or their children) should be baptized.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is expressed in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> (of which is all the doubt) is proved from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 17. where there is an express concatenation of [<hi>children, heirs of God, co-heirs with Christ, that suffering with him shall be glorified with him</hi>] Gal. 4.1, 6, 7. <hi>The heir is Lord of all, and a Son, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath the spirit of the Son, by which they cry Abba Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7. [<hi>According to his mercy he saved us by the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that being justified by his Grace, we should he made heirs according to the hope of eternal Life.</hi>] The heirs then are Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, Justified, and have the hope of eternal Life. So Eph. 3.6. <hi>The Gentiles being made fellow-heirs, and of the same body, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Promise in Christ by the Gospel, even the unsearchable riches of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 6.17. <hi>The heirs of Promise have their salvation confirmed by Gods Oath.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. They are all called the <hi>Heirs of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6, 9. It is true Justified Believers that have that Title. And <hi>Jam.</hi> 25. [they are called <hi>Heirs of the Promised Kingdoms.</hi>] And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. they are called [<hi>Co-heirs of the same Grace of Life.</hi>] So that to be <hi>Heirs</hi> in the first and proper notion. is to be <hi>Sons that have Title to the Inheritance of Glory:</hi> and therefore to be <hi>Heirs</hi> in the second Analogical notion, (for I will
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107958:83"/>
not yet anger Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> with the term <hi>Equivocal)</hi> is to be such as seem such, by Profession of that faith which hath the promise of that Glory: But the Professors of any other faith are none of them.</p>
            <p>The last Title that I mentioned in the Argument was [<hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed] Paul</hi> calleth all the Baptized Church of Corinth <hi>Justified:</hi> None that profess not a Justifying faith are called Justified; therefore none such should be Baptized.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> I proved to Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. [<hi>Ye are washed, ye are sanctified, ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>] Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth not at all deny the <hi>Major</hi> or the sense of the Text alledged to prove it. But darkly in generals Intimateth a denial of the <hi>Minor,</hi> silently passing over that particular Title [<hi>Justified,</hi>] as if he durst not be seen to take notice of it. I confess, its sad that good men should be so unfaithfull to the Truth, which is so precious and is not their own, and which they should do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against, but all they can for it. But in general he saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 152. <hi>Of Sacrament, [Other phrases are there brought, or Titles as proper to the Regenerate, which are well known in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be applyed to such as have Apostatized, and are brought by Arminians to prove falling away, and are censured by their Adversaries.] Answ.</hi> Those other Titles which I proved to be given to the generality of the Baptized, were no other than what we ascribe to them, [<hi>to be Heirs, and Justified, quickened and have all trespasses forgiven them, and to be saved.</hi>] And if indeed these Titles be so promiscuously used, it will be harder to understand Scripture, than Interpreters have hitherto thought. Why did not Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> shew but one Text (for this one in hand) where any are said to be Justified upon a faith short of Justifying? I think he was loath to name this Title, lest he should have seemed to contradict himself in the terms, or be put to the searching out for a distinction of Justification, which we have not yet heard of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he may tell us in what sense the unregenerate are Justified. If he should say, it is a conditional Justification, so Infidels are justified without any faith at all: but that is no Justification, because not actual. Mr. <hi>Hudsons</hi> words and <hi>Ames</hi> (which he annexeth) mention not Justification,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107958:83"/>
much less that any not Professing Justifying faith are Justified.</p>
            <p>And here I must needs again say, I know no man that hath made Scripture terms so Equivoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath done, while he pretendeth to <hi>abhor</hi> it. Two senses of the word [<hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Believers, Disciples,</hi> &amp;c.] we yield him, <hi>viz.</hi> as they signifie those that are such <hi>in Heart,</hi> and those that <hi>Profess</hi> to be such in heart. But these will not serve his turn, but he must moreover have a third sort, even such as only Profess another faith short of Justifying? yea and a faith which is specificially distinct from Justifying faith, yea and that by a Physical specification (if he will be understood, for he falls upon me for making but a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual difference, who yet ever affirmed a Moral Specifick differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.) So that we have not onely many sorts of <hi>Sanctification, Faith,</hi> &amp;c. but also of <hi>Justification</hi> too. Whether we shall have as many Salvations, and as many Heavens or not, in his sense, I yet find him not express.</p>
            <p>But I would know why he doth so usually say that [<hi>a faith short of justifying entitleth to B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tism: and Disciples, Saints,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are titles that belong to more then the justified.</hi> If indeed he take his own <hi>short</hi> faith to be really justifying, and his own new made Saints to be really justified; Doth not his own ordinary appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating the Titles of Regenerate and justified to (I know not how to call them; for he hath left me no one proper name for them that I can remember,) — to those that are the Heirs of Glory, shew plainly that in the primary signification they speak only of such, even in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s own apprehension: and that therefore the words simply expressed signifie no other; bare Professors of justifying faith being but seemingly, <hi>Analogically, secundum quid,</hi> — such; and his <hi>Professors of another kind of faith, being not such in either sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having gone thus far about <hi>Titles,</hi> let me add another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I find Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> so oft apply it to the — justified (I shall crave leave to use that term as proper to them, or else I confess I shall be at some loss for a name for them because he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them all out of my hand that I can think off.) And this is the Title [<hi>Regenerate</hi>] Christ hath instituted no Baptism, but what is to be a sign of present Regeneration (at least to men at age.) But to men that Profess not a justifying faith it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107958:84"/>
be adminstired as a sign of present Regeneration: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath Instituted no Baptism to be administred to such.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> I have proved already in the first Argument. And its plain in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi>] and so in <hi>Tit.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.5. Where it is called the <hi>Laver of Regeneration.</hi>] In both which though I am of their mind that think that the sign is put for the thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; yet it may thence plainly appear what is the thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; even Regeneration, or the new birth! yea so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly was this acknowledged by all the Church of Christ that there's nothing more common in the writings of the Fathers, than to take the terms <hi>Regenerate, Illuminate</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ptized</hi>] as signifying the same thing or at least spoken of the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: which occasioned one of our late Antiquaries so stifly to plead that Regeneration in Scripture signifieth meer Baptism, and that all the Baptized are Regenerate.</p>
            <p>I grant that it oft falls out that Baptism being misapplyed sealeth not Regeneration at present, and that the sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> person may afterward be Regenerate, and his remembred Baptism may then be of use to him for the confirmation of his faith. But this is not the Institutors commanded use of it, to be so admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred at first, if the party profess not saving Faith, though this review of it is a Duty, where it was so abused at first (of which none afterward.)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I shall take for granted, while Regeneration stands in Scripture so connexed to salvation; I know no Regenerate ones but the justified, or those that profess to have a justifying faith: Nor hath he proved any more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. All that are meet subjects for Baptism, are (after their Baptism, without any further inward qualification, at least without another <hi>species</hi> of faith) meet subjects for the Lords Supper (having natural capacity by age) But no one that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth only a faith short of justifying is meet to receive the Lords Supper, therefore no such a one is a meet subject for Baptism.</p>
            <p>Or thus: Those at age whom we may baptize, we may also admit to the Lords Supper (without any other <hi>species</hi> of faith) But the Professors of a meer common faith short of justifying,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107958:84"/>
we may not admit to the Lords Supper, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The duty of a particular examination before the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is nothing to our purpose, because 1. that makes a man fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he was, but the want of it is not in the cognizance of the Minister alwaies, nor will not justifie our refusal of a godly man excepting some apparent gross evils. 2. And it is the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of another faith and state that we are enquiring after, which will not be proved by the necessity of an actual examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or excitation of our present grace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> will easily grant me; and if any other deny it, I prove it thus. 1. It is the same Covenant that both Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments Seal; one for initiation, the other for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and growth in grace: therefore the same faith that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth for the one, doth sufficiently qualifie for the other. For the same covenant hath the some condition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are the same heresies that are conferred in baptism and the Lords Supper to the worthy Receiver. Therefore the same qualification (for kind) is necessary for the reception. The Antecedent is commonly granted. Baptism uniteth to Christ and giveth us himself first, and with himself the pardon of all past sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lords Supper by confirmation giveth us the same things: It is the giving of Christ himself, who faith by his Minister, <hi>take, eat, dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nk</hi>; offering himself to us under the signs, and commanding us to take himself by faith, as we take the signs by the outward parts. He giveth us the pardon of sin, sealed, as procured by his body broken, and blood shed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A member of Christs Church, against whom no Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be brought from some contradiction of his first profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, must be admitted to the Lords Supper: but the new bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed may be ordinarily such (at age); therefore if he can but say, I am a baptized person, he hath a sufficient principal title to Baptism <hi>coram ecclesia</hi> (I mean such as we must admit) though some actual preparation be necessary) unless he be proved to have disabled his claim on that account either by nulling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing that profession, or by giving just cause of questioning it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Church hath ever from the Apostles daies till now, without question, admitted the new baptized, at age, to the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107958:85"/>
Lords Supper, without requiring any new <hi>species</hi> of faith to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them to it. I take the <hi>Major</hi> therefore as past denial.</p>
            <p>All the controversie between Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and me is like to be about the <hi>Minor,</hi> whether the profession of his common faith short of justifying, make people fit for, or capable of the Lords supper. 1. No man should be admitted to the signal professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Receiving Christ as he is offered, who will not orally profess to receive him as he is offered. But all that are admitted to the Lords supper, are admitted to the signal profession of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Christ as he is offered. Therefore no man that will not orally so profess to receive Christ should be admitted to the Lords Supper. The <hi>Major</hi> is plain, because 1. Else we cannot know who is fit, if he will not make profession of it. 2. His refusal shews that he either understandeth not what he doth in the Sacrament, or is wilfully uncapable, by infidelity, or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency. 3. The <hi>Minor</hi> is evident in the nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The offer of the bread and wine with the command, <hi>Tade, eat, drink,</hi> is signally the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fer of the Lord Jesus himself, with a command to <hi>take him.</hi> He that pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s forth his hand to take the bread, professeth thereby to Accept of Christ as offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. If it be said, that Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> professor of a lower sort of faith, doth profess to take Christ as offered, I say, No: This proposition I here suppose as evident in it self, that no man but the sound Believer doth take Christ as offered, no not as Christ. He is offered as a Saviour from the Guilt and Reign of sin; and so Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> professor doth not so much as profess to accept him. For I hope we are agreed, that so to accept him heartily is saving faith. 2. No man should be admitted to receive a sealed pardon of sin (or have it delivered to him) that doth not profess that faith which is of necessity to make him capable of a sealed pardon: but he that only professeth a faith short of justifying, professeth not that faith which is of necessity to make him capable of a sealed pardon. Therefore he is not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Lords supper. It is a present sealed pardon that they profess there to receive by the very actual receiving: God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently offereth; and they presently profess to accept it signally, and therefore must do so verbally.</p>
            <p n="3">3. No man is to be admitted to the Lords supper that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107958:85"/>
not true Repentance for sin. But Mr. <hi>Blake's</hi> Professor doth not so: for that is inseparable from saving faith. Therefore Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> must deny the <hi>Major,</hi> or say nothing that I can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, but what is to no purpose. And if he do deny it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I would desire him once to give us a just Description of that Repentance, short of saving, which he will be satisfied with the Profession of, in his Communicants. 2. I must confess as much as I am against separation, I never intend to have communion with Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Congregation, if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess not saving Repentance and faith. And if he exact not such a Profession, I say still he makes soul work in the Church. And when such soul work shall be voluntarily maintained, and the Word of God abused for the defilement of the Church, and Ordinances of God, it is a greater scandal to the weak, and to the Schismaticks, and a greater reproach to the Church, and sadder case to considerate men, than the too common polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others, which are meerly through negligence, but not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified and defended. And if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> be angry at my speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these things, I cannot help it. I am bound to tell him of it as a faithful Brother, that I doubt not but God is angry at his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the great wrong that he doth the Church of God, while he is so angry at his Brother for resisting it. For my part, I would not have done his work, no nor justified it as some of his neer Learned Friends have done, for more than I will speak of. Its like he will hardly exact a Profession of saving Repentance from the lapsed for their Restoration to the communion of the Church, if he will not do it of the Church themselves in their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental communion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Furthermore they that will not profess true Love to Christ as a Redeemer, are not to be admitted to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. But no man can Profess true Love that will not Profess true faith: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved, in that it is a Sacrament of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Love: We receive the highest expressions of Christs love, and are to receive them with gratitude, which hath alwaies love in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. They that profess not true Pope of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Glory are not to be admitted to the Lords Supper. But
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107958:86"/>
none can do that but the Professors of a saving faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Major</hi> is proved, because it is the very end and use of the Sacrament to exercise Hope of Christs coming [<hi>Do this in remembrance of me till I come</hi>] which Implyeth Expectation, or Hope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. No man is to be admitted to the Lords Supper that Professeth not a sincere love to the Saints as Saints: But so can none do that Profess not a saving faith (without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting himself) <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved in that the very business of that Church there, next their communion with Christ, is to have communion with the Saints in Love: and if they be at variance but with one, they must <hi>leave their gift at the Altar, and go first and be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to their Brother, and then come and offer their gift.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> is so far from excluding the ungodly, that he would not have us so much as disswade them from coming. <hi>Pag.</hi> 196. he saith to that [1. <q>It is as I suppose, without all Scripture Precedent to warn men upon account of want of a new life by the Spirit, wholly to keep off from this or any other Ordinances of Christ — that we should warn men upon this account, upon this very ground, to hold off from all address to Ordinances, I have not learnt.</q>] <hi>Answ.</hi> That we should disswade them to come till they have that Faith and Repentance and Love to the Brethren which is the fruit of a new life, I have proved, and more have done it than you will ever well answer. And it will not follow, as you pretend, that then none must come that have not the certainty of their sincerity in the Faith, as I shall further shew when I come purposely to your Objections. And where you talk of unregenerate mens being incapable of examining themselves, its a great mistake; else no wicked man could despair, if he be not able to find himself to be wicked; And then it would be a sufficient Evidence of Grace for a man to find himself graceless, which is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>And its an unhappy confusion that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> is guilty of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all along, while he pleadeth against the Interest of the Regenerate only in the Sacraments, that he confoundeth most commonly the Professors of Justifying Faith and holiness, with his Professors of a faith short of Justifying; and thus in his
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107958:86"/>
arguing against Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and <hi>Galaspie,</hi> and others, carrieth on the matter in the dark; as if these were all one, or the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will serve for the one that will serve for the other; which is meerly to lose his own and his Readers labour, or leave him deceived, which is worse: How many leaves of that volumn, and his former of the covenants, are guilty of this dark mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leading work?</p>
            <p>I could willingly here answer his Arguments for unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate mens right to this Sacrament; but 1. I shall meet with much more about their pretended right to baptism anon, and the answer of those will serve for both. 2. And he hath so mixt the two Cases (of Professors of saving faith and of not saving) together, that if I deal with him on the later, he may say, he speaks of the former.</p>

                  </hi>'s Arguments defended against Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> answ. <hi>Argum.</hi> 1.</note> is from [the Nature of Sacraments, which are to signifie that we have already Faith in Christ, Remission of sin by him, and Union with him] The sense of the Argument is, That seeing Sacraments (according to Christs institution) are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming signs, presupposing the thing signified both on our part and on Gods; therefore none should use them that have not first the thing signified by them (at least those at age) To this Master <hi>Blake</hi> answereth, <hi>This to me is as strange as new, that Sacramental signs declare &amp; shew that we have Faith &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins. The Sacrament now in question is a sign of the body &amp; blood of Christ, in whom by faith remission of sins may be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I know; but that it is a sign either that we do believe, or that we have remission of sin otherwise than upon believing (to which this engages, but not presupposes) I know not,</hi> Repl. Though I undertake not to defend all the Arguments that other men use in this Case; yet this doth so much concern the cause of baptism which I am now debating, that I shall give you this reply to it: 1. The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental <hi>Actions</hi> are signs as well as the <hi>substance</hi> of bread and wine. The <hi>Offer</hi> with <hi>Take, eat,</hi> signifieth the offer of Christ to us, to be received and applyed: the <hi>Taking,</hi> and <hi>Eating,</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> signifieth our <hi>Acceptance,</hi> &amp; <hi>Application</hi> of him. With himself is offered the pardon of sin, and given to all that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him, which by <hi>Taking, Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> we profess to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107958:87"/>
do. It is my duty to tell you, that it is sad that a Treatise of Sacraments should profess not to know, that our believing and Remission is here signified. Its pity but this had been known before you had written of them, at least Controversally. What Divines are there that deny the Sacraments to be mutual signs and seals, signifying and sealing our part as well as Gods? and how ill do you to wrong the Church of God by seeking to make men believe that these things are <hi>new</hi> and strange? If it be so to you, its pity that it is so: But sure you have seen Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> Books against Doct. <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Davenant</hi> wherein you have multitudes of sentences recited of our Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that affirm this which you call new. It is indeed their most common doctrine, that the Sacrament doth pre-suppose Remission of sin, and our faith, and that they are instituted to signifie these as in being; (though through infancy or error some may not have some benefits of them till after,) it is the common Protestant Doctrine, that Sacraments do solemnize and publikely own and confirm the mutual Covenant already entered in heart; as a King is crowned, a Souldier listed, a Man and Woman married, after professed consent: so that the sign is Causal as to the Consummation and Delivery (as a Key, a Twig and Turff in giving possession), but consequential to the Contract as privately made, and the Right given thereby: So that the soul is supposed to consent to have Christ as offered first (which is saving faith) and then by receiving him Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally delivered to make publike profession of that consent, and publikely to receive his sealed Remission. Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> (cited by you) might well say, that <hi>primarily</hi> the Sacrament is Gods Seal; but did he say that it is <hi>only</hi> his, and not <hi>secondarily</hi> ours? And in the next words, you do in effect own part of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine your self, which you have thus wondered at as <hi>new</hi> and strange, saying [<hi>I confess it is a symbole of our Profession of Faith; but this is not the Faith spoken to, neither is Remission of sins annext unto it.] Answ.</hi> If you put (<hi>Profession</hi>) for the <hi>thing profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> you speak obscurely, when you might have spoken plainly: But if you mean as you speak, (taking <hi>Profession</hi> properly) then 1. You yield that the Sacarment is our symbole, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth or signifieth our Action as well as Gods. 2. And it is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107958:87"/>
not only a sign of our <hi>Profession,</hi> but a <hi>Professing</hi> sign and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a sign of the thing <hi>professed:</hi> For the external sign is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Internal acts of the mind, which without signs others cannot know: And therefore the Actions of <hi>Taking, Eating, Drinking,</hi> do signifie the same Internal Acts which a verbal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession doth signifie. As therefore the <hi>Words,</hi> and <hi>outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are two distinct signs of the same Internal Acts, so are they two wayes of Profession. My signal Actions do not signifie my words, (which are plainer signs themselves, and therefore need not darker to express them) but they both express my mind: so that they are not only <hi>Symbols of our Profession,</hi> as you speak, but <hi>Professing Symbols.</hi> 3. And if so, then they must be signs and Professions of those Internal Acts which correspond with them; which is the Inward Taking Christ, and Eating his Flesh, and Drinking his Blood by Faith, which (no doubt) are the proper acts of saving faith. 4. And therfore <hi>this is the faith spoken of, and Remission of sins is annext unto it,</hi> (which you deny) though it seems you will speak of the Profession of a common faith, to which Remission is not annext.</p>
            <p>The second Argument was from some Scriptures,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Galaspie</hi>'s Argum. 2. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</note> proving that the Sacrament necessarily supposeth Conversion and saith, and therefore is not to work it. To this Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> Answers; 1. By referring to what he hath said in another book about some of these Texts; and thither I shall follow him: 1. About <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. he speaks, <hi>Treat. of Cov. pag.</hi> 243. Because he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that these Texts are spoken of Baptism (and so are more to my principal end, and will hold as to the Lords Supper only:) I shall here peruse his Answers, having used the same Texts my self before. But (now I peruse the place) I find that his words of <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. are those that I have already answered in my former Reply to him: and you may peruse his Rejoinder, if worth the labor. The same I say of his words on <hi>Act.</hi> 8.36, 37. on <hi>Act.</hi> 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If by [<hi>the tender of the Gospel</hi>]
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107958:88"/>
you mean [<hi>the Gospel tendred</hi>], then either it is [<hi>the Gospel as the Gospel</hi>], declaring the work of Redemption, and offering us a Saviour to deliver us from sin and wrath: and this no unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man did ever gladly or heartily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccept. Or else it is [<hi>the Gospel as a Novel doctrine; or only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat part of it which offereth them pardon</hi> without the other part which offereth salvation from sin it self. And this is mentioned in the Texts (or some of them) that you refer us to: But that this is not meant in the Text, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. is plain; because it was the doctrine of Redemption, Faith and Repentance which they gladly received, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of it sold all, and lived in the Communion of Saints in the Praises of God. 2. Or else by [<hi>the tender of the Gospel</hi>] you mean, <hi>that which the Gospel tendereth</hi>: And that is, Christ as Christ with his full salvation, which no unregenerate man doth heartily Accept though pardon alone they would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have: but thats not the tender of the Gospel. If [the glad Acceptation of the tender of the Gospel] that is, <hi>of Christ as Christ, and his full salvation,</hi> be not justifying or saving Faith, I despair of ever knowing what it is: and if this Acceptation or Faith be common, all's common. I still believe that Justifying faith [is the Assent to the Truth of the Gospel, and hearty Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of Christ as he is there offered, or <hi>of Christ as Christ</hi>]</p>
            <p>And having distinguished of the Object, so must we of the Act. Its one thing to accept indeed by hearty Consent, and another thing to accept <hi>ore tenus,</hi> or to say <hi>I accept it.</hi> The former only the Godly have, as to [<hi>Christ as Christ</hi>]: the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate may <hi>ore tenus,</hi> verbally Accept Christ as Christ, and heartily be willing to have pardon by him, and submit to some common Reformation, least they should miss of that pardon: but Christ as Christ, they will not accept.</p>
            <p>Now to the Texts: And its hard that you should alledge <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. for [<hi>ready Accepting the tender of the Gospel,</hi>] when the Text saith plainly, that <hi>their hearts went after their coveteousness, and they hear the word and would not do it,</hi> though they took pleasure to hear the Prophet, as a minstrel to tickle their ears and not as a Minister to save them from sin: when as these in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>sold all</hi> and lived in Community with the Saints. Those <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20, 21. received the external Message, and Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107958:88"/>
               <hi>ore tenus,</hi> by verbal Acceptance, and Internally they would have had Christ <hi>ad hoc</hi> for their own ends, as a subject or servant to their worldly Interests; but they never received Christ as Christ, to save them from the world, and self, and sin; for these were still preferred before him; nor did they ever accept of God as their God, that is, their chief good and chief Lord. I am bold therefore (by your Patience) to say, that as to the Acceptance of Christ as Christ, or God as their God, or the Holy Ghost as their Sanctifier, they cannot be said to have done it, but <hi>equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally:</hi> and no otherwise did they receive <hi>the tender of the Gospel.</hi> As for the <hi>Galathians, chap.</hi> 4.15. 1. All were not in Love with <hi>Paul</hi> on the same account: and all love to the Preacher signifieth not an Acceptance of the tender of the Gospel. 2. And you cannot prove but that these <hi>Galathians</hi> did it sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and were sincere when this was spoken, for all their yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so far to the temptation of false Teachers. (Of which I have spoken before.) Of <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. hereafter.</p>
            <p>The sense of the third <hi>Argument,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Galaspie</hi>'s Argum. 3. defended.</note> is, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper giveth us <hi>New food, viz.</hi> the Flesh and Blood of Christ. Therefore it supposeth the new Birth and Life.]</p>
            <p>To this Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saith [1. Metaphors are ill Materials, to make up into Syllogisms.] Repl. 1. They are such as Christ used <hi>John</hi> 6. and frequently in Reasoning; and therefore I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to believe they are good Materials. 2. We must use Metaphors, or no words in some of the greatest Points in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (about God) 3. We cannot easily find fitter terms here then [<hi>New B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>[2. Saith Mr. <hi>Blake, A difference may be put between ordinary and quickening food</hi>] Repl. You should have told us your differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp; how it concerneth our case, if you would have had us ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of it. [3. He saith, <hi>The word gives new Food, and yet supposeth not new life,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.] Rep. The clean contrary is the scope of the Text you cite. <hi>As new born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> The Word therefore as <hi>Food,</hi> doth suppose <hi>new Birth, and Life.</hi> Christ as our first life

is given in the Word to those that had not life before; but Christ as our <hi>Food</hi> is given after both in the Word and Sacrament.</p>
            <p>But you say, [<hi>There is a Sacramental work preceding our eating, and there Christ is set forth to the aggravation of sin, to carry on the work of Contrition and Compunction.</hi>] Rep. Its a sorry argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that because there is that in the Sacrament which may bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit an ungodly man to <hi>see,</hi> that therefore he hath right to receive it, yea or is like to have benefit by it. He that will not consent that Christ shall be his full Saviour, may be moved to consent by seeing a Sacrament True, though it is not appointed to such ends, yet its possible. But how should he be moved to consent by receiving it, and so signa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Circumcision was a Seal of the Righteousness of Faith</hi> therefore so is Baptism; therefore so is the Lords Supper; therefore it belongeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to justified Believers. To this Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> answereth, 1. <hi>Then Ismael and each male were justified.</hi> Rep. 1. He whom you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer spoke only of the Adult: and then you should have said on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>then Ismael and all the males that had true right to Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were either justified believers, or the children of such, or</hi> (as to Church right) <hi>of those that Professed themselves such.</hi> And that is true. 2 And it is <hi>lis sub judice</hi> yet, whether the Synod of <hi>Dort, Davenant,</hi> &amp;c. or Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> were in the right, and so whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the seed of justified persons have an Infant justification with them, or not?</p>

He that maketh it the Instituted Nature or use of Circumcision to be a Seal of a Righteousness of Faith which the person had before, doth make his Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion a proof of his foregoing Righteousness of faith. But so did <hi>Paul</hi> concerning <hi>Abraham:</hi> therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>Paul</hi> may give us a full proof of it, though he spake those words to another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>

That because they so came not, they shall only suffer as those that came not, but also be cast out into a greater degree of misery, that is, because they come not with an upright, penitent, true believing heart, disposed to Obedience. Now the thing that Mr <hi>Blake</hi> should answer, is, whether it be not hence proved that men should have the Wedding garment of sincere faith before they come into the visible Church (they or their Parents) and much more before the Lords Supper? God saith, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having on a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment? But of this more anon.</p>

               </gap>h. <hi>Argument</hi> is [That ordinance which is not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to work Faith,<note place="margin">Argum. 8. defended.</note> is no coverting ordinance: but <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Faith comes by hearing,] <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> answers that <hi>reading and seeing Miracles may also convert, and so may Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as not being opposite but subordinate.</hi>] I reply. <hi>Hearing</hi> as the chiefest way of Reception, is put for all the rest: It is the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107958:90"/>
word heard or read, or some way received, that is the appointed means of Conversion. Its possible the Sacrament may be a means too: but give us as good proof that it was appointed to that use, or may be used to that end purposely by the <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, as we shall prove the same of the Word, and you shall carry the Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ninth <hi>Argument</hi> is,<note place="margin">Argum. 9. defended.</note> [That Ordinance which hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the promise of the grace of Conversion annexed to it, or any example in the Word of God of any converted by it, is no converting Ordinance: But <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ergo.]</p>
            <p>To this 1. Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> answers <hi>ad homine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which is not worth repeating (<hi>that examples will not satisfie his Adversary</hi>). 2. <hi>That we have as many examples of mens conversion by the sacrament, at we have of their receiving strength and nourishment.] Repl.</hi> A wonderful confidence! If Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> will bring as good proof of any converted by it, as we can, that the eleven Apostles, that the Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Acts 2. and 4. and the rest of the Churches were strengthened by it, he will make good that Assertion. 3. What he saith of our (<hi>not having precedents by name</hi>) is nothing to the purpose. If he can prove it of any named or unnamed, specially of Societies, it will suffice. 4. He tels us that [<hi>The examples of Conversion by the word perhaps well examined would prove short of such Conversion as is here intended. The Conversion in Gospel-Narratives is to a Christian profession.] Repl.</hi> 1. This is too unkind dealing for any Preacher of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to use with that Word which converted him, and hath brought in so many thousands to Christ, and which he himself preacheth for the conversion of others. I should offend the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Reader to stand to confute this, by proving that the Word hath been a means of true saving Conversion, yea the ordinary means. I refer Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> to what I have said before of the state of the Churches that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to: Was there not one sort of Ground that received the seed in depth of earth and brought forth fruit? Was not <hi>Paul</hi> sent <hi>by preaching to open mens eies and turn them from the power of Satan to God</hi>? Act. 26 v. 18. Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> in all his Epistles speak of the Saints, as conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted savingly by the word of the Gospel? What heaps of clear Testimonies might we bring out of his Epistles? How contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107958:90"/>
is this new Doctrine to the Word, and all the ancient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and all approved Protestants Judgements? I would we had such Evidence of true Conversion now among our Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors as the multitude of Converts gave, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and 4. and as the Jaylor gave, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.6. and the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. and as <hi>Lydia,</hi> and many other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But what if the Word had not truly converted them? its somewhat to be brought to an outward Profession of true faith, which the rest were that were then Church-members: But the Profession of your faith of another <hi>species,</hi> is not [<hi>the Profession of a Christian Faith,</hi>] though you call it so. If you will give me but as good proof of any one baptized person that was brought but to the Profession of this lower Faith, as I will give you of multitudes that were brought to true saving Faith by the Word, and more to the Profession of it, I will say that you have done that which never man did before you. I pray make tryal for the proof of some one.</p>
            <p>Well! But the main strength of the Argument which you had to answer, was concerning the Promise. To which you say, [1. <hi>When the adversary shall bring a Promise made to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for spiritual strength it will happily be found of equal force to the giving of a new life.</hi>] Repl. You next say, Implicite Promises may serve: Shew but one such. You say, [<hi>Every Promise made to the Word is made to the Sacrament.</hi>] Repl. Prove that, and take all. Though we have no Promise particularly of converting this or that man by the Word, yet we have that it shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert many in general. Shew where is a word of Promise that the Sacraments shall convert any one? Sure, if <hi>Paul</hi> had but had such a Promise of converting men by Baptizing them as he had of converting them by Preaching, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.17, 18. and els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, he would never have said, <hi>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for I am not sent to baptize but to Preach the Gospel.</hi> 2. We find where in that Sacrament, men <hi>have Communion of the Blood of Christ, and of his Body, and are partakers of the one Bread, and have communion with one another,</hi> and are helped by it, in calling to <hi>Remembrance Christ death</hi> (in hope of that coming:) all which are undoubtedly strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 16, 17. &amp; 11.25, 26. <hi>Act.</hi> 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But you cannot
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107958:91"/>
shew where ever any was either united first to Christ, or his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Body by the Lords Supper, or where it was appointed to be used to any such <hi>end, or where ever any generaral or Implicite Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of such a thing is made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tenth <hi>Argument</hi> was from the expresse danger of unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiving,<note place="margin">Argum. 10. defended.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.17. The summ of the answer is, That [<hi>This Argument would take off every Ordinance from the honor of Conversion.</hi>] Repl. But I conceive that the strength of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (or that which ought to be its strength) is wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt; which is not from the Necessity of <hi>a Preparation</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but of a <hi>special Preparation,</hi> or <hi>Worthiness,</hi> which is not so pre-requisite to the fruitful use of converting Ordinances. There is a saying by the superfluity of naughtiness, malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, before a man can in reason expect that the Word should convert him: and yet it may convert thousands that are not so far prepared, by doing that and the rest. But the Worthiness of a Partaker of the Lords Supper must be more than this. For 1. That which the Church is Judge of, must be that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver be a Church-member, professing true Faith, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting that Profession by a scandalous life. 2. Himself is required to examine himself for more, that is, whether he be sincerely what he Professeth, and Christ be in him (or else he is a Reprobate, and not to take the childrens bread,) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. and also that he have a Particular Preparation, according to the nature of the Ordinance. Its expresly Necessary, 1. That he discern the Lords Body. 2. That he do this in remembrance of Christs death, and with a hope of his coming: and 3. For communion with Christ, and his Church, and to be partakers of the one bread: 4. And with a Heart to take Christ and Eat; that is, to feed on him by Faith, when he takes the bread. But all this cannot be done by the unregenerate; nor is this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requisite before a man come to the Word, that it may convert him That Preparation which is pre-requisite in a meet receiver of the Lords Supper, it was not instituted to effect (unless as it may do it when God sees good, in an unworthy or prohibited use:) But true Faith and Repentance are Preparations pre-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite: <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You cannot say, that to the hearing of the Word as a means
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107958:91"/>
of conversion, true faith and Repentance is so requisite. The text you mention 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.2. I say again, speaks of the confirming and edifying use of the word, and not of the converting use. The converted must bring true saith to the Word if they will expect encrease of it: but the unconverted must not needs bring true faith, if they will be brought to believe by it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet remember that we say not that men ought to forbear coming that are unconverted; but that they ought to come; but how? To believe and repent, and so to come, and to do it in this order and no other, and they ever lye under all this Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>You next instance in Prayer, and conclude that [<hi>As for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er there is no more ground or colour to make it a converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance than the Supper,</hi> &amp;c.] Repl. 1. A man that hath but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon desires may be perswaded to ask for what he so desires: Though he have no Promise of Acceptance, you do not find him threatned with judgement for such a Prayer (so it be not grosl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hypocritical or wicked) as he is for unworthy receiving the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, without a discerning the Lords Body. 2. When we exhort any man to pray for Christs pardon, the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in exhort him to desire them; for desire is the soul of Prayer, and the chief part of its essence: Now the first of these desires which we exhort them to, is conversion it self, even that they would turn to God by a change of their wills, and express them in Prayer. 3. I can shew you where the wicked are commanded to seek the Lord, that is, by Prayer to express their returning hearts, which implyeth their returning it self; but you cannot shew where ever they are commanded to communicate with the Church in the Sacrament, but in this order, first to be converted and repent, and so baptized, and so communicate: or if Baptized already<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be Penitents first, and Communicants next.</p>
            <p>But if you would have all exhorted to the Lords Supper for conversion, whom we are bound to exhort to Prayer for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, you would do that which I confess I dare not do.</p>
            <p>The 11. <hi>Argument</hi> was,<note place="margin">Argum 11. defended.</note> that Ordinance which is Eucharistical and consolatory, supposeth such as partake of it to have part and portion in that thing for which thanks is given, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this its answered, that [<hi>the assumption might as well have bin of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107958:92"/>
the Word and Prayer, which are Eucharistical and Consolatory.</hi>] Repl. 1. To hear a Sermon is not to give thanks. 2. The Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Word must be according to mens various states. An unregenerate man may take this for consolation, <hi>If I be converted and repent and believe, I shall be saved.</hi>] A true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may apply it to another measure of consolation, [<hi>because I am a believer, this Promise is mine, that is, secureth me of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</hi>] Now if the Impenitent and unbeliever shall do the later, he sins such another sin as if he received the Sacrament, which is an Ordinance Instituted for personal assumption and application of the general Promise.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for Prayer. 1. To <hi>petition</hi> is not to <hi>give thanks.</hi> 2. And for Thanksgiving it self, an Impenitent man may not give thanks for true saving faith, Repentance, part in Christ, and hope of Glory, though he may for the mercy that he hath, because he may not lye. Now in the Lords Supper we must give thanks for our part in Christ, and pardon, and life through him: or at least, for the present Gift of Christ to us which we consent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</p>
            <p>Its added, [<hi>This Ordinance is not wholly Eucharistical,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is for humbling as well as for comforting.</hi>] Repl. But if the other use be common to it with other Ordinances, and here Inseparable from the Eucharistical, then other Ordinances may be used to that end; but this may not by him that may not do both; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if he receive the Sacrament; he signally Professeth both.</p>
            <p>The substance of the twelfth <hi>Argument,</hi> with its answer, is spoke to before:<note place="margin">Argum. 12. defended.</note> where Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saith, that [<hi>The unregenerate may so far be suitably worthy for this work, that he may know himself called to it, and that it would be his sin to hold back from it, and he may hopefully expect a blessing in it.</hi>] I reply: 1. That he is called to it remotely: that is, first to repent and believe, and to communicate, we yield; and that it is every mans sin that keeps off, that is, that comes not in this order. But that he may lawfully come before this Repentance, you never proved, nor shall do, I think. 2. I would you could shew us on what ground he may <hi>hopefully expect a blessing in it.</hi> True hope goeth not beyond the promise: but the unregenerate have no promise
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107958:92"/>
(unless the <hi>Arminians</hi> be in the right) of a blessing on any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; much less on that which they cannot prove that they may use till they are converted. Yet <hi>Hope</hi> in a larger sense they may have, where they can prove that God hath set them a work though they have no promise. But thats not here.</p>
            <p>The 13th. <hi>Argument</hi> is,<note place="margin">Argum 13. defended.</note> That Ordinance which was instituted for Communion of Saints, is intended only for Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Its answered by distinguishing of Sants as (<hi>such by calling and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for God</hi> (or <hi>regeneration</hi>: and that the <hi>Lords supper is the priviledge of the Church as visible.) Repl.</hi> Its one thing to ask, <hi>Who may demand it and come there?</hi> and another to ask, <hi>To whom may we give it</hi>? We may give it to all professedly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated for God. None may ask or take it but those that are <hi>heartily</hi> separated to God. But your Professor of a lower faith is neither of these, and therefore may neither seek it, nor may we give it him, if he do seek it. Whoever professeth himself separated for God, doth profess saving sanctification, which consisteth therein. Self and Earth is highest in all the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate: therefore they are not separated heartily to God.</p>
            <p>The 14th. <hi>Argument</hi> was,<note place="margin">Argum. 14. defended.</note> [If Baptism it self (to the adult) is not regenerating or converting, then not the Lords supper: but <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] This Argument Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath no more to say to, but that this seemeth to suppose an opinion of Conversion by the very work done, which he disclaimeth. But here is no such supposition at all intimated; and he should have dealt with it as he found it, and not so have bawkt it, especially when Mr. <hi>Gilaspie</hi> had so explained and confirmed it. And because Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> thought best to silence Mr. <hi>Gilaspie</hi>'s proof of his Assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; and I think it worthy the Readers observation, at least, that he may see how far Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> is from truth in his affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the singularity of my opinion, I shal here transcribe them.</p>
            <p>[Aaron<hi>'s Rod blossoming,</hi> pag. 514.515. <hi>The assumption) (that baptism it self is not a Regenerating Ordinance) I prove thus:</hi> 1. <hi>Because we read of no persons of age baptized by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, except such as did profess faith in Christ gladly received the Word, and in whom some begun work of the Spirit of Grace did appear (I say not that it really was in all, but somewhat of it did appear in all).</hi> 2. <hi>If the baptism of those who are of age be a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107958:93"/>
Ordinance, then you suppose the person to be baptized to be an unregenerate person (even as when a Minister first preacheth the Gospel to Pagans, he cannot but suppose them to be unregenerate) But I believe</hi> no Conscientious Minister <hi>(N. B.) would adventure to Baptize one who hath manifest and Infallible signs of unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Sure we cannot be answerable to God if we should minister Baptism to a man whose works and words do manifestly declare him to be an unregenerated unconverted person. And if we may not ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate such a one, how shall we bring him to the Lords Table?</hi>]</p>
            <p>The fifteenth <hi>Argument</hi> is [If Baptism even of the aged must Necessarily precede the Lords Supper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then this is not a convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance:<note place="margin">Argum 15. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</note> But <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] The reason of the consequence is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause true Repentance and faith are professed, and Remission of sin sealed in Baptism. Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> denieth the consequence, because all the Baptized are not Regenerate. <hi>Rep.</hi> But all the Adult Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized according to Christs Institution are Regenerate: (of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants its yet under debate) And if any be not so, it is they that erroneously seek that which they should not have sought.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Argum. 16. defended.</note>The last <hi>Argument</hi> there mentioned by Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> is from the Parable of the Prodigal, who returned before he had the Robe, Ring, Shoos Fatted-calf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> answereth that [<hi>All Ordinances are to bring a Prodigal to such a returning posture</hi>] which is a meer begging the question, and not answering the Text, which Interpreters usually thus expound.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Argument</hi> is <hi>pag.</hi> 245. recited [<hi>From the Directory, where the Ignorant,</hi>

You add your own corrupting gloss to the Directory: They say [<hi>warn them to forbear that live in sin against conscience,</hi>] You add, [<hi>the meaning is, if they resolve to continue in it,</hi>] And I pray you why will you turn us to mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, which is a secret of their hearts for a discovery of those whom we must refuse?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:107958:93"/>Is there the vilest Murtherer, or Adulterer, that is not purposed to leave it before he dies? 2. But what if he resolve not to continue it? Is it not bad enough if he will <hi>not resolve</hi> to leave it? Doubtles this shews Impenitency, and the other can do no more. 3 But yet you have here destroyed all your Cause in a word. For you have here excluded all unregenerate men: for all the unregenerate are habitually resolved in most heinous sin, and that against conscience. They all will confess that God is better then the world, and yet they all esteem the world before God, and love it better than God; they are a habitually resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to please their Flesh before God, and look to their worldly felicity before his Glory. I have your consent therefore on this ground to conclude, that [<hi>a Sacrament will not be accepted at their hands.</hi>] 4. But do you not contradict this, when you add [<hi>yet if such Resolutions do not appear</hi> &amp;c.] What if they appear not? I hats something to the Minister, but thats nothing to prove Gods acceptance, or the mans Title to claim the Sacrament. Should not secret sin deterr aswell as open? God and himself know them, though we do not.</p>
            <p>The 18th <hi>Argument</hi> [Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> overpassing, answers the 19th which is, <hi>It is not communicable to any but the penitent</hi>:<note place="margin">Argum. 19. defended.</note>

An unanswerable Argument, and a meer impertinent Answer. Is it not a wonder how the <hi>Major</hi> could be denied? without distinguishing of Penitence, and saying that the Sacrament is communicable to the impenitent as to saving Repentance, but not as to common Repentance, and therefore may convert to saving Repentance. But he answer as if the <hi>Major</hi> had been this. [<hi>That Ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Pope dwelleth not at <hi>Rome,</hi> because the Turk dwelleth at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> So much for these Arguments and their Answers: the rest I shall pass over which Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath about Sacraments being converting Ordinances; Only telling him, that I confidently deny his great Assertion, <hi>pag.</hi> 241. [the <hi>unconverted have a fundamental proper right to the Lords Supper</hi>] and yet do not find my self in any [<hi>inext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>icable snares</hi>:] nor will by difficulties be frighted to that opniion.</p>
            <p>I shall only here add in a word, what I yeild about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being a converting Ordina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Some that have no Right to partake of it, may possibly be converted by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on and hearing the adjoined word. 2. Its not impossible that he that sinfully and without title comes to receive it, may occasionally receive good by it. There is that there declared that hath a tendency to do good. 3. But whatever it may be a means of beyond Divine Appointment through his meer good pleasure, yet it is not Appointed to be demanded or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by any Impenitent unconverted man for his Conversion. 4, Yet if a Minister know them not to be impenitent, but yet suspecteth it, as he must give it them upon their profession, so he may desire in the managing of the work, that it may be converting to them if they are not converted; that is, that God will bring that truth to the heart which the signs represent to the eyes; and make it an occasion of good to them that are out of their way in demanding it. 5. Yet it is rather the Hearing and Seeing, than the <hi>Taking, Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking,</hi> that we may with any encouragement pray for this Blessing on. 6. I never know or heard of any converted by the Receiving of the Sacrament: but divers I have know converted by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it. As some that (by other kind of Doctrine than Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi>) having been brought to apprehend the danger of unworthy receiving, have been awakened so in their prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for fear of eating damnation to themselves, that it was a means of their conversion; And some that by after-fears, least then did eat unworthily; And perhaps some by the serious
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107958:94"/>
speeches of the Minister in Prayer and Instruction before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but none by receiving it self.</p>
            <p>It is therefore little to his main purpose or cause, that Mr. <hi>Blake sect.</hi> 13. <hi>Prop.</hi> 11. <hi>pag.</hi> 200. attempts to prove that (<hi>the Lords Supper with the word as appendant to it, may be serviceable to bring up those of Covenant-Interest to the terms and Propositions of the Covenant, may serve to work a man of Profession of faith unto faith saving and Justifying: a man in the Name the Lord's, to turn unfeignedly and sincerely to the Lord.</hi>) For x. his half Professor is not in the mutual Covenant (which its like he means by <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Interest.)</hi> 2. The distinction between a <hi>Nominal</hi> Christian and a <hi>Sincere; a Profession</hi> of Justifying faith, and <hi>that faith</hi> it self, leavs out the persons that he hath to defend; that is, The Professors of another <hi>species</hi> of Faith. 3. Its one thing to prove that the Sacrament <hi>may</hi> convert the unconverted, that is, that its <hi>possible,</hi> and that it is a thing that eventually hath come to pass; and another thing to prove, that it is commanded to the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or allowed them to be used to that end. The later is the thing that should be proved by him, and not the former on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>But because his Proposition is somewhat more bashfull than some of the Arguments brought as to prove it. (which have the face to look further) I shall briefly examine them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 200.201. Argum. 1.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s Arguments answered. Read <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spie</hi>'s <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>l.</hi> 3. and there you will see more Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s cause overthrown.</note> 
               <hi>Men of that interest</hi> (saith he) <hi>that Baptism receiveth, as the intention of the work in order to salvation, these the Lords Supper serves to carry on by sanctification to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But Baptism receives men of visible Profession only,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I distinguish between the secret Intention of God <hi>de eventu</hi> when he Instituted his Ordinances. 2. and the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed end or use of them, and the Intention which he commandeth men. And as to the last, I distinguish between the Appointed end and use of them as to the <hi>Minister</hi> and as to the <hi>Receiver:</hi> And so here are three distinct Questions before us. Quest. 1. <hi>Whether God, who appointed this Sacrament, did intend that it should</hi> eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>be used to the Conversion of any souls</hi>? To this I answer. No man can tell but by the Event. But I will not deny it, that which a man sinfully doth, may be the means of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version. If a professed Pagan may be admitted to the Lords
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107958:95"/>
Supper, no man can be sure that this (with the annexed word) may not be the occasion or means of his Conversion. The same I say of the Excommunicate: yet must we not therefore admit such. What God <hi>decreeth</hi> to do by his Ordinances, is one thing; and how and to what Ends <hi>we must use them,</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The second Question is, <hi>Whether the Minister may or must deliver the Sacrament to the unconverted, with this Intention that he may be converted by it?</hi> To this I answer, that the unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are of two sorts: 1. Such as profess not to be converted, or savingly to repent and believe; and to these he may not Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster it at all, and therefore not to such Ends. 2 Such as do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess saving faith and Repentance; and to these he may admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster it, with this disjunctive end; that if the person be truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, it may confirm him; if not, that if God so please, it may be a means of his Conversion.</p>
            <p>The third Question is, <hi>Whether the unconverted may Demand and receive that Sacrament as a means of Conversion?</hi> To which I answer flatly, No: whether it be a saving Faith or another sort of faith which he Professeth, if he have not saving Faith it self, he may not Demand or Receive the Sacrament at all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to any such ends.</p>
            <p>Now to come closer to Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s Argument; 1. I grant the <hi>Major,</hi> (as far as through the Lanthorn of his dark ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous phrases I can discern the sense of it,) <hi>viz</hi> that we may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit those to the Lords Supper, that are justly admitted to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, if naturally capable, and have not since given cause to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend them. And here Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> shews, that it is the lower <hi>species</hi> of Faith that entitles men (in his judgement) to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, because he maintaineth that this lower <hi>species</hi> entitleth them to Baptism.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Minor</hi> I grant of the Professors of saving Faith; and deny it of all others that Profess only another faith: nor hath he proved that such have a visible Interest, or Profession, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not Christianity, but only part of its essence, which they Profess.</p>
            <p>His 2. <hi>Argument</hi> is (<hi>It is the mind of God they be admitted: therefore to this end.] Answ.</hi> 1. It is not the mind of God that they
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107958:95"/>
should <hi>Demand</hi> and <hi>Receive</hi> it: therefore not to this end. 2. It may not be the <hi>admitters principal</hi> end, but a <hi>secondary,</hi> only on supposition that the Receiver be not what he seems to be, and so be not a lawful <hi>demander</hi> of it. 3. It is not the will of God that your Professor of another kind of faith only be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>In the end he sums up his Argument thus [<hi>Ministers must give the Sacrament so as it may be to edification, and not certainly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: But they must give it to some not yet throughly sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: therefore some not throughly sanctified may receive it to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and not to destruction.</hi>] Answ. 1. <hi>Plus est in conclusione, quàm in praemissis.</hi> You should only have concluded, [<hi>therefore Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters may give it.</hi> &amp;c.) and not [<hi>therefore some may Receive it.)</hi> For 2. The word (<hi>certainly</hi>) which you put in the <hi>Major</hi> (and leave out in the conclusion) refers either to the Certainty of the Object. or Gods subjective Certainty: or the receivers subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Certainty; and in all these respects its false. For if God or the Receiver were certain that it would prove destructive, yet the Minister may give it, if demanded; but not if he be certain of it himself. But 3. No Minister is required to be certain of the Demanders state, or whether the Sacrament will prove to his edification or destruction, nor whether the person intend rightly in it, but he is bound to give it to a Professor of saving Faith that Demandeth it, and to intend his good in it, which yet he cannot effect, if the Receiver be unmeet.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Minor</hi> I say, its true: but not of those that profess not true sanctification. The conclusion as is said, is <hi>aliene:</hi> For though there can be no <hi>Giving</hi> without <hi>Receiving,</hi> yet may there be lawful <hi>Giving</hi> when it is <hi>unlawfully Demanded</hi> and <hi>Received:</hi> therefore from <hi>lawful giving</hi> upon an <hi>unlawful Demand,</hi> to a <hi>lawful Receiving,</hi> is no just consequence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad hominem,</hi> I would frame the like Argument on Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s principles thus [We must give the Sacrament to edification, and not certainly to destruction. But we must give it to some that have not a <hi>Dogmatical</hi> faith: therefore some that have not a <hi>Dogmatical</hi> faith, must receive it to edification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> is his own: The <hi>Minor</hi> he dare not deny on his grounds: for we must give it to men that Profess a <hi>Dogmatical</hi> faith,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107958:96"/>
whether they have it or not: or else we must give it to no man, because we know not the heart. The conclusion therefore is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable, that according to Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s Principles, it is the end of the Lords Supper to convert Heathens to Christ by receiving it, so they will but lye, and say they are Christians first. I profess I see no way of Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s avoiding this, but by renouncing his dangerous Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The 3. <hi>Argument</hi> is, [<hi>The Law and the Gospel in their joynt strength may convert,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But in the Lords Supper there is Law and Gospel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.] Answ.</hi> 1. What may possibly fall out is nothing to the Question of Lawful Demanding or Giving. 2. There's neither Law nor Gospel in a wicked mans unjust De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Reception, and Lying signal professing to take Christ when he doth not: but Law and Gospel is against it. 3. The Law and Gospel which you mention as annexed to the reception are separable: and all you can thence prove, is, that a wicked man may be converted by seeing and hearing, and therefore may see and hear: but thats nothing to receiving. 4. Nor will it prove that he may see and hear, because its possible he may be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, because the same Gospel is in its season with due appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to himself to be preached to that end; and Christ hath not appointed his beholding the Application to another to be the commanded means for such ends.</p>
            <p>The 4. <hi>Argument</hi> is from the Heart breaking use of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by aggravating sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where the <hi>London</hi> Ministers are cited, <hi>&amp;c.) Answ.</hi> The same answer as to the last may serve. And 1. A wicked mans Demand and reception hath no humbling use, (but as any Lye or other sin hath) though his Beholding may. 2. Its an exalting use that this humbling use prepareth for, to the Receiver: seeing therefore the wicked are uncapable at present of the exalting use, they must have that humbling word delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by it self which they are capable of, and not conjunct with that which they are uncapable of. 3. The <hi>London</hi> Ministers speak not of the first humiliation in the passage of the New Birth, but of subsequential, at least, as to the first Intention of the work; and if of conversion, it is but upon supposition that unjust Demanders do intrude. 4. By the like Argument from the signification of the signs connext with the word, (which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107958:96"/>
Christ crucified and risen again) you might prove as well that it is for converting heathens.</p>
            <p>The 5 <hi>Argument</hi> is [<hi>That which is annexed to the word to second it in that very thing which works the soul to conversion to God, may bring</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. To the <hi>Major,</hi> if it may convert, it followeth not that it may be demanded to that end. 2. To be added [<hi>in that very thing</hi>] is not to be added [<hi>to that very use.</hi>] For the same word which <hi>confirmeth</hi> doth <hi>convert</hi>; but the Sacrament is not added to it for the <hi>converting</hi> use (as command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) but for the <hi>confirming</hi> use. To the <hi>Minor</hi> I answer by denying it as to the end. The Sacrament is not annexed to that use or end, though to that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng: because this is a use which the word hath without the Sacrament, and the Sacrament added to the same word is added for higher in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eparable uses which the unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are uncapable of. Its added to be a professing sign on our part that we take Christ and Remission of sin by him; and a seal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatory on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hrists part: And because the wicked are uncapable of these special uses, they are uncapable of a lawful receiving of the Sacrament 2. You may as well by this Argument too, prove that it is for conversion of Infidels Jews, Turks: For the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is annexed to the word in those very things that are for their conversion.</p>
            <p>The 6. <hi>Argument</hi> is from experience: To which I answer; All the experiences which Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> mentioneth, are not only no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his cause, but abundantly destructive to it. Many have been unwakened by fears of receiving unworthily to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, as wicked men do: will it follow, that therefore they may receive it who are wicked and unworthy? or that there is no such danger to them if they do: Or rather that they should not receive while they are such, and that there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger if they do; sure it is some danger that is the matter of their fear, &amp; some threatning which is the ground: if it be their du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y to receive it even while they know themselves to be wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is an appointed means to their conversion, what need they so to fear it, unless they fear the means of their own good? If they say, it is the unworthy receiving which they fear; Its true, but that is to receive it in state of wickedness, Impenitence and unbelief, as all the unregenerate do: surely it is the wrath of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107958:97"/>
God and eternal damnation which they fear, therefore they fear least it should fix them in that state. But your worthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant is in state of damnation, when only our unworthy communicant is such. Moreover will it follow, that because other mens doctrine which are against you doth put men into these fears which occasion their conversion, that therefore your doctrine which abateth such fears is sound? 2. Or will it follow that <hi>Receiving</hi> converteth, because the <hi>fears</hi> of <hi>unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> do convert or conduce thereto? surely preparations and fears of unworthy Receiving are one thing, and the wicked mans unworthy Receiving it self is another thing: The former may do much good, when the later is like to do much hurt. The thing that such fear, is, least they should have no saving part in Christ, or pardon, or eternal life, which you confess your pretended worthy Receiver hath not at all.</p>
            <p>The 7. <hi>Argument</hi> is from the <hi>Confession of eminent Divines of an opposite judgement, who will have all admitted present at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, to see the bread broken and divided.] Ans</hi> 1. Had you named those Divines, you had been the more capable of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.

But what if they had or did say so? Whats your consequence. How prove you that therefore they should be admitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive? or that receiving is a means ordained and enjoyned for conversion,<note place="margin">

            <p>My 12. <hi>Argument</hi> is from <hi>Mat</hi> 22.12. [<hi>Friend, how camest thou in hither not having on a wedding garment, and he was speechless.</hi>] To [<hi>come in hither</hi>] is [To <hi>come into the Church of Christ.</hi>] By the <hi>wedding garment</hi> is undoubtedly meant, <hi>sincerity</hi> of true faith and repentance; so that I may hence argue; If God will accuse and condemn men for coming into his Church or the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints, without sincere faith and repentance, then it is not the appointed use of Baptism to initiate those that profess not sincere faith and repentance. But the former is plain in the text; <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:107958:97"/>The 13th. <hi>Argument</hi> is this: We must Baptize none at age that profess not themselves Christians; (nor any Infants but on such a Profession of the Parents or Pro-parents) but they that profess only a <hi>species</hi> of faith short of Justifying faith, profess not themselves Christians. <hi>Ergo.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is certain; because it is the use of Baptism to be our solemn <hi>Listing sign</hi> into Christs Army; our Initiating sign, and the solemnization of our Marriage to Christ, and Professing sign that we are Christians, and we do in it dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and deliver up our selves to him in this relation as his own. So that in Baptism we do not only promise to be Christians, but profess that we are so already in heart, and now would be solemnly admitted among the number of Christians.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove thus: 1. No man is truly a Christian that is not truly a Disciple of Christ (that's plain, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.26.) No man is truly a Disciple of Christ that doth not profess a saving Faith and Repentance (save the children of such): therefore no man that doth not so profess is truly a Christian. The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove thus. No man is truly a Disciple of Christ that doth not profess to forsake all contrary Masters or Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to take Christ for his chief Teacher, consenting to learn of him the way to salvation. But no man maketh this Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that professeth not saving Faith and Repentance: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man that professeth not saving Faith and Repentance is truly a Disciple of Christ. The <hi>Major</hi> is evident, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Relation. The <hi>Minor</hi> is as evident, in that it is an Act of saving Faith and Repentance, to forsake other Teachers, and take Christ for our sole or chief Teacher in order to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. No man is truely a Christian that professeth not to take Christ for his Lord and King, forsaking his Enemies: but no man doth this but the Professors of a saving faith: <hi>Ergo.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. No man is a true Christian that professeth not to Take Christ for his Redeemer, who hath made propitiation for sin by his Blood, and to esteem his blood as the ransom for sinners, and to trust therein: But none do this but the Professors of saving Faith: therefore none else are Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:107958:98"/>The <hi>Major</hi> of all these three Arguments is further proved, thus: No man is professedly a Christian that professeth not to Accept of Christ as Christ (or to believe in Christ as Christ) But no man doth profess to take Christ as Christ that professeth not to take or accept him as a Priest, Teacher and King: <hi>Ergo.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is plain in it self, The <hi>Minor</hi> is as plain, it being essential to Christ to be the Priest, Prophet and King. And from these essentials related to us and accepted by us, doth our own denomination of <hi>Christians</hi> arise. And that a bare Assent without Acceptance doth not make any one a Christian, is past doubt, and shall be further spoke to anon. If Baptism then be commonly called our Christening and so be our entrance so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly into the Christian state, then it is not to be given to them that are not Christians so much as by Profession: but that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s Professor of another <hi>species</hi> of Faith is no Christian so much as by Profession, I doubt not is here proved.</p>
            <p>And furthermore, If a Faith defective in the <hi>Assenting</hi> part, about the Essentials of its Object, serve not to denominate a man justly a <hi>Christian</hi>; then a faith defective in the <hi>Consenting</hi> or <hi>Accepting</hi> part about the Essentials of the Object, serveth not to denominate a man a Christian: But the Antecedent is true: therefore so is the Consequent. By [<hi>Defective</hi>] I mean not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the matter of perfection of degree, but that wanteth the very Act it self.</p>
            <p>The Antecedent is proved, because else the Turks are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; because they believe so many and great things of Christ; and else a man might be a Christian that denyed Christs death, or resurrection, or other Essentials of Christianity.</p>
            <p>The Consequence is good: For Christianity is as truly and necessarily in the will as in the understanding; consent is as es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential an Act of covenanting as any. So that I may conclude, that as he is no Christian that professeth not to believe that Christ is the Priest, Prophet and King; so he is no Christian that professeth not to consent and accept him for his Priest, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and King: But so doth not Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s Professor of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faith: therefore he is no Christian, nor to be baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:107958:98"/>The 14<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
               <hi>Argument</hi> is this: If we must baptize men that profess not saving faith and repentance, then is it no aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such mens sins, that they either plaid the hypocrites in such Professions, or fell from them, or walkt contrary to them. (For no man can walk contrary to a Profession which was never made:) But the Consequent is false, therefore so is the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.</p>
            <p>Our Divines ordinarily charge wicked men with contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Profession which they made with God, either in Baptism or the Lords Supper. And they expound many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which the <hi>Arminians</hi> take as favouring their Cause, to be meant according to the <hi>Profession</hi> of wicked men. Now it seems to me, that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> by his Doctrine doth undertake to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all these wicked men, from this aggravation of their sin, and to take them off from repentance and humiliation for it: For if they made no such Profession in baptism (if at age) or in the Lords Supper, then it can be no aggravation of their sin that they walk contrary to it: But I dare not undertake to secure them from the punishment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 15. If all (at age) that are baptized (and all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lords Supper) must engage themselves to believe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently (in the next instant) yea or at any time hereafter, with a saving faith, then must they Profess at present a saving faith. Or, if we must baptize none that will not engage to believe sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, then must we baptize none that will not Profess a saving faith. But the Antecedent is true: therefore so is the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
            <p>The Antecedent is Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s Doctrine, who affirmeth that it is not necessary that they that come to baptism or the Lords Supper, do Profess a present saving faith, but its sufficient that they engage themselves to believe by such a faith. The Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is proved thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not the <hi>Beginning</hi> of saving faith which we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our selves to in the Sacraments, but the <hi>Continuance:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Beginning</hi> is presupposed in that Engagement: and so we must no more baptize without a Profession of <hi>Faith in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> than without an Engagement to believe <hi>hereafter.</hi> The Antecedent is proved thus: There is no one word in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107958:99"/>
either of Precept or example, where any person in baptism or the Lords Supper doth engage, or is required to engage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to begin to believe with a saving faith, or to believe with a faith which at the present he hath not: Shew but one word of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to prove this, if you can; if you cannot, I may conclude that therefore we must not require that which we have no Scripture ground to require.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Engagement to believe savingly, is either for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote distant time, or for the next instant: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut no unbeliever (as to that faith) is called to promise in Baptism such a saving faith, either at a distant time, or the next instant: therefore not at all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Not at a distant time:</hi> For first, that were to resolve to serve the Devil, and be an unbeliever till that time. 2. And no man is sure to live any longer time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Not at the next instant:</hi> For first, that instant cometh as soon as the word of Promise is out of his mouth, even before Baptism; and therefore by that Rule he must believe saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before. 2. We may as well stay one minute or instant to see whether he will perform his Promise, as to baptize him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that bare Promise of believing the next minute. 3. It is a ridiculous unreasonable conceit, that any man should say, [I believe not savingly yet, but within a minute of an hour I will;] and that this should be required in baptism and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God makes it not the condition or qualification of them that are to be admitted to Baptism or the Lords Supper, that they should Promise to do that which they have no Moral Power to do, (I mean, such as the seed or habit of Grace containeth, as to the act:) But the unregenerate have no Moral Power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with a saving faith: Ergo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved thus: 1. To promise to believe saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is to Profess that they are truly willing to believe savingly; but no wicked men are truly willing so to believe: therefore they are not called to promise it; for that were to be called to profess an untruth, and so to lye; Unless as they are called to be really willing and promise both; and that is but to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely faithful and to promise to continue so. 2. It is not found
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107958:99"/>
any where in Scripture that I know of, that God doth call any wicked man to promise to be a godly man or true believer before he is so; but only commandeth him <hi>to be so.</hi> And if God never call such men to such a promise at all, then is it not the condition or qualification of persons to be admitted to the Sacraments. (We still speak of the aged.)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved from many Scriptures, and is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Doctrine of all Antipelagians, at least; <hi>We are dead in trespasses and sins</hi>: and must we baptize and give the Lords Supper to such dead men upon a Promise that they will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live? <hi>Out of Christ we can do nothing: Without faith it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to please God. It is God that giveth to will and to do of his good pleasure.</hi> And no wicked man can tell whether God will give him the grace of saving faith: therefore he cannot promise to have it. But I shall speak more to this under the last Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 16. If there can be no example given in Scripture of any one that was baptized without the Profession of a saving faith, nor any Precept for so doing, then must not we baptize any without it. But the Antecedent is true: therefore so is the Consequent.</p>
            <p>What is pretended this way we shall examine anon among the Objections. In the mean time let us review the Scripture examples of Baptism, which might afford us so many several Arguments, but that I shall put them together for brevity. 1. I have already shewed that <hi>John</hi> required the Profession of true Repentance, and that his Baptism was for Remission of sin. 2. When Christ layeth down, in the Apostolical Commission, the Nature and Order of his Apostles work, it is first <hi>to make Disciples,</hi> and <hi>then to Baptize them into the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost</hi>; And as it is <hi>a making D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sciples,</hi> which is first expressed in <hi>Matthew,</hi> so <hi>Mark</hi> expoundeth who these Disciples are (as to the aged) by pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting <hi>Believing</hi> before <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism:</hi> and that we may know that it is Justifying faith that he meaneth, he annexeth first Baptism, and then the Promise of salvation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. [<hi>He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved.</hi>] This is not like some occasional Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical mention of Baptism, but its the very Commission of Christ
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107958:100"/>
to his Apostles for Preaching and Baptism, and purposely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth their several works in their several places and Order. Their first task is by teaching to make Disciples, which are by <hi>Mark</hi> called <hi>Believers.</hi> The second work is to Baptize them, whereto is annexed the Promise of their Salvation. The third work is to teach them all other things which are afterward to be learnt in the School of Christ. To contemn this Order, is to renounce all Rules of Order. For where can we expect to find it, if not here? I profess my conscience is fully satisfied from this Text, that it is <hi>one sort of faith,</hi> even <hi>saving,</hi> that must go before Baptism, and the Profession whereof the Minister must expect. Of which see what is before cited out of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Piscator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it was saving faith that was required of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and professed by them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 41, 42. is shewed already, and is plain in the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 8. The Samaritans <hi>believed, and had great joy, and were baptized into the name of Jesus Christ</hi> ver. 8, 12. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that it was both the understanding and will that were changed, and that it was not a meer <hi>Dogmatical</hi> faith: and that they had the Profession of a saving faith (even <hi>Simon</hi> himself) we shall shew anon when we answer their objections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. The condition on which the Eunuch must be baptized was [<hi>if he believe with all his heart</hi>;] which he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to do; and that was the Evidence that <hi>Philip</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> was baptized after true conversion, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Holy Ghost fell on the Gentiles,</hi> Acts 10.44. before they were baptized, and <hi>they magnified God.</hi> And this Holy Ghost was the <hi>like gift as was given to the Apostles who believed on the Lord Iesus,</hi> and it was accompanied with Repentance unto life, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14.15. <hi>Lydia's heart was opened before she was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and she was one that the Apostles [judged faithful to the Lord</hi>] and offered to them the evidence of her faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30, 31, 33, 34. The example of the Jaylor is very full to the resolution of the question in hand. He first asketh <hi>what he should do to be saved.</hi> The Apostle answereth him, [<hi>believe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107958:100"/>
in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved and thy house</hi>:] so that it was a saving faith that here is mentioned: <hi>He rejoyced and believed with all his house, and was baptized that same hour of the night or straight way.</hi> It is here evident that he professed the same faith which <hi>Paul</hi> required, or else the equivocation would make the text not intelligible. And that which was required was a saving faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 18 8. [Crispus <hi>the chief ruler of the Synagouge, believed on the Lord with all his house, and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed and were baptized.</hi>] Here we have two proofs that it is saving faith that is mentioned. One, in that it is called [<hi>a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on the Lord,</hi>] which expresseth saving faith. Another, in that it is the faith which related to the doctrine preached to them, as is expressed in the word [<hi>Hearing</hi>] that which they heard they believed: but they heard the promise as well as the History of the Gospel; and they heard of the Goodness as well as the Truth; and they heard Christ offered to them as their only Saviour; for <hi>Paul</hi> never preached Christ but in this manner, and to these ends, even as might tend to their Justification, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and it was a saving faith that he still exhorted men to.</p>
            <p>Those in <hi>Acts</hi> 19.5. were baptized as [<hi>Believers in Jesus Christ</hi>] which is saving faith; whether it were by John's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, or by <hi>Paul,</hi> or others, I now enquire not.</p>
            <p>And what all the Churches were supposed to be to whom the Apostles wrote, I have shewed before. In a word, I know of no one word in Scripture that giveth us the least intimation that ever man was baptized without the Profession of a saving faith, or that giveth the least encouragement to baptize any up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another faith.</p>
            <p>But before we proceed, Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s exceptions against some of these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but contain them when made. 2. And my arguing was to prove that every faithful Pastor must intend the making of sincere Christians, and not only counterfeit or half-Christians. This is a truth that so good a man should not have been sorry to hear. 3. If you mean that visible Churches contain not <hi>counterfeit</hi> and <hi>half-Christians,</hi> you might have been sorry long before this to hear both Protestants and Papists say the contrary.</p>
            <p>You add [<hi>Its well known whose language it is, that all charging duty on unregenerate persons is only to bring them to hypocrisie.] Answ.</hi> And if the end of that duty were no higher than to bring men to be counterfeit Christians, they had not said amiss. When we hear that charge, it is for perswading men to hear, pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for sincere faith: But if I perswade men to become Christians, and mean only the Professors of faith without the thing professed, or the believing with another sort of faith, then I might well be charged with perswading some to hypocrisie, and the other to be half-Christians. 2. You have not yet proved that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing the Professors of a lower faith, is the appointed means to bring them to saving faith.</p>
            <p>You say [<hi>In order to make men sincere Disciples they must be made visible professing Disciples] Answ.</hi> If there be not a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble equivocation, you must mean, that it is the same <hi>Disciple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> which some have sincerely, and others but visibly by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: and then it must be the same faith. And then you say to this effect that [<hi>in order to make men sincere, they must profess &amp; seem to be so before, they are so, that is, a lie is the appointed means to make the thing spoken become true</hi>] But if according to the current of your doctrine you mean in the later branch of your distinction, those only that profess another sort of faith, and so equivocate in the word <hi>Disciples,</hi> then I answ. 1. Your Disciples are no Disciples, nor so called once in Scripture. 2. Nor is that any thing to baptism, till you have proved that baptism also an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to your Discipleship, is a means appointed to bring them to a higher saving faith.</p>
            <p>You tell us that [<hi>men may be half Christians in order to be whole Christians] Answ.</hi> But not <hi>baptized</hi> to that end, nor must the Preacher intend the making of any half-Christians and no more.</p>

            <p>Next, where Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> would have proved the Text not to be meant of sound Believers, because they are such Disciples as a whole Nation is capable to be; I answered, that whole Nations are capable of saving faith, and proved it: to which he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth the capacity of stones to be made Children; As if men had no more then stones; And as if God could not make all in a Nation believers, by the same means us he makes some such.

those that are suspected of Heresie had said such words, what should we make of them! Doth all Passive or Objective power, Natural, Violent or Neutral, come into act? Doubtless no man that hath one thought of these things will say so; if he do, he must say that God can do no more then he doth: nor any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do more then it doth! But if there be such a power or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of a thing that shall not exist, then it is sad to hear God charged with making all such powers or Capacities in vain. He knows why he doth many things which he tells us not the reason of; but here there is reason enough apparent, to cause us to give God better words.</p>
            <p>I ask't whether Preachers be not bound to endeavour the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conversion of whole Nations? He answereth [<hi>I think they are to bring them, if Heathen, to a visible Profession, and as many as they can to thorow-conversion.</hi>] Repl. 1. This is no answer to my question; unless it import a concession of what was denyed. Must men endeavour to convert a whole Nation, or not? 2. If we must endeavour to convert no more than we can convert, then we must know the success before we endeavour which cannot be; and must endeavour to convert no more then will be converted, which is worse then false 3. I will not endeavour to perswade any man to Profess to be what he is not, or to have what he hath not, or to do what he doth not.</p>
            <p>He next noteth it as a <hi>remarkable contradiction in adjecto,</hi> that I say, (Vocation uneffectual is common to Pagans) saying, that [<hi>Calling in Scripture Phrase is not a bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let these Texts be judge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. <hi>(Because I have called and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded, but ye have set at nought all my counsel,</hi> &amp;c.) so <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.12 <hi>When I called ye did not answer, when I spake ye did not hear,</hi> &amp;c. so <hi>Isa.</hi> 50 2. &amp; 66.4. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.13. &amp; 35.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.3, 5. <hi>He sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But they made light of it,</hi> &amp;c.] I shall recite no more.

In reason we must distinguish between a precedency of <hi>prescribed duty,</hi> and of <hi>event,</hi> and not seek to <hi>blind the Reader</hi> (as you speak) by confusion. There is constantly this order in the prescribed duty that no man should seek Baptism but a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, for himself and his seed; and no man should baptize any but those that profess this true belief, and their seed. This is the fixed order of duty. But what then? will it follow that <hi>eventually</hi> faith never followeth baptism, nor baptism never goeth before faith? Yes, when you can prove that man never sinneth, by omitting his duty, and that God never recovereth a sinner by his Grace.</p>
            <p>You add [<hi>And then he may preach in England to build up con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, but not to convert</hi>] Repl. True, if there be none in England that neglected that faith which God commanded before, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived baptism in a case which is unmeet for it, nor any that were baptized in infancy when they were uncapable of believing. As to your frequent objection of the <hi>Nullity</hi> of such baptism, I shall <hi>Null</hi> it anon, in its proper place.</p>
            <p>His concession in terms from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. he retracteth by an exposition of his words as spoken <hi>Rhetorically,</hi> and thinks that ony one that ever read Rhetorick may know his sense; when there is such a Wood of Tropes and Schems that such Novices may sooner be lost in them, then hunt ont the sense of every Rhetorician. The proper sense, he takes to be [<hi>an egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous peice of affected non-sense</hi>] for then it were true that [<hi>justifying faith is a promise</hi>] Repl. It only follows that justifying faith is not only an Assent, but the wills consent to the covenant of grace, or that Christ be ours and we his; and this is heart-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting; and that the external verbal promising or covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, is the profession of this faith. And it is not my fault if I be put to tell you, that as long as you are such a stranger to the nature of justifying faith, as many such dark, though confident passages in your books do import, your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will want salt, if not sense.

His particular answers are, [1. Philip. <hi>may call for that</hi> de bene esse <hi>when the Eunuch was to be admitted, which was not yet essential to his admittance.</hi>] Repl. 1. Its strange that when we are disputing what is of a necessity to a just admittance, that we must turn to dispute of the <hi>Essentials</hi> of an admittance. I never thought that any thing but <hi>admittance</hi> was essential to <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>: but there are many things <hi>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>c quibus non licet.</hi> 2. <hi>Philip</hi> is determining a question, and giveth this in as the decision, [<hi>If thou believe with all thy heart thou mayest.</hi>] And to say that this is but <hi>de bene esse,</hi> meaning that it includeth not the Negative, [<hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise thou mayest not,</hi>] is to make <hi>Philip</hi> to have deluded and not decided or resolved. Use the like liberty in expounding all other Scripture, and you'l make it what you please. The second Answer is, that [<hi>Dogmatical faith is truly a Divine faith.</hi>] Repl. But not the Christian Faith, nor anywhere alone denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth men Believers in Scripture: I remember but one Text, <hi>John</hi> 12.42. where it is called Believing on Christ; and but few more where it is simply called <hi>Believing</hi>: but none where such are called Believers, Disciples, or Christians, or any thing that intimateth them admitted into the visible Church, without the Profession of saving faith added to this Assent. The rest which he here addeth, we shall take in, when we come purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to speak of that subject.</p>
            <p>I conclude, That all examples of baptism in Scripture do mention only the administration of it to the Professors of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith: and the precepts give us no other direction. And I provoke Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> (as far as is seemly for me to do) to name one precept or example for baptizing any other, and make it good, if he can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 17. is from 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. [<hi>I be like figure whereto even Baptism doth also now save us: not the putting away the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God.</hi> [Whence I thus argue; If Baptism be appointed for out solemn admission into a state of salvation, as <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark received men into a state
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107958:103"/>
of safety from the deluge, then none should be baptized but those that profess that saith which entereth them into a state of salvation. But the former is true: therefore so is the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here it is implyed plainly that this is <hi>quoad finem Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entis,</hi> the common appointed use of Baptism, which the Text mentioneth, though <hi>eventually</hi> it prove not the common effect, through the error of the Receivers. And this appeareth, 1. In that it was spoken plainly in the Text of the very Nature and appointed use of Baptism, and so of Baptism as Baptism, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Exception, Limitation or Distinction. Therefore it is not spoken of any d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fferent use that it is appointed for, to the Elect, as distinct from its common use to others. Its spoken of that signification and common use to which Baptism is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>save</hi>: Else we shall never be able to understand the use of it or any Ordinance from Scripture, if we shall take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to say, [It is this to one, but not to another;] when the Scripture saith no such thing, but speaks of the nature and use of it without distinction. Else when it saith, [<hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rcumcision is a Seal of the Righteousness of Faith.</hi>] we may lay with the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, It was so to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but not to all others.] And when the Lords supper is said to be appointed for the remembrance of Christ,] we may say, That's but to some, and not to others, when as the Text plainly speaks of the stated use of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to all. 2. And in the type its clear: for it was not some only but all that entered <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark that entered into a state of salvation from the deluge: therefore so it is here, as to the commanded use.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When Baptism is said to save us, its plainly meant of the state of salvation that Baptism entereth us into; and not of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism <hi>ex <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pere operato,</hi> effecting our salvation: And so Baptism comprehendeth the state into which we are solemnly by it ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated. As a woman that is married to an honourable man, or a Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dier listed under an honourable Commander, is said to be honoured, the one by marriage the other by listing: Where an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent consent is the great foundation on both sides of the honorable relations, and the subsequent state is the condition or state it self which is honourable: but the solemn signification is
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107958:104"/>
but the expression of the former, and passage to the latter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hereby its apparent, that though the <hi>answer of a Good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> be the principal thing intended and that saveth, yet the external Baptism is here included as the sign and solemnization; so that when the Apostle saith, (<hi>Not the putting away the filth of the flesh,</hi>) he means <hi>(not the bare outward act of washing alone or as such,</hi>) but baptism as it is entire, having the thing professed on our part, together with the professing sign.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is therefore but by way of signification, obsignation, and complemental exhibition, that Baptism saveth, it being neither the first or principal efficient or condition of it; But is valid as it is conjunct with the principal causes and condition, for the attainment of these ends.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is not a meer remote means leading towards a state of salvation, that Baptism is here affirmed to be: but an ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or means of entrance into that state of salvation it self. As the heart covenant or Faith doth it principally, so Baptism signally and complementally. This is plain; 1. Because it is not said to help us <hi>towards</hi> a state of salvation, but expresly to <hi>save.</hi> 2. Because the Type which is here mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> The Ark, was such a means, that all that entred into it for preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Flood, were actually saved from it. All this laid together, doth confirm both the Antecedent and Consequence of my Argument.</p>

            <p>Yet another Argument may hence be raised thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. If according to the Institution the Answer of a good Conscience must be joyned with Baptism for the attaining of its end, then must we admit none that profess not that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of a good conscience. But the former is certain from the Text: For Baptism is said to save; that's its appointed use: yet not the external washing, but the answer of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth it therefore this is of necessary conjunction; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it Baptism cannot attain its end: But it is to be administred &amp; received only in order to the attainment of its end, and therefore never in a way by which the end is apparently not attainable.</p>
            <p>What this answer of a good conscience is, we shall further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire anon. Both the common expositions fully confirm the point which I maintain. The Assemblies Annot. recite both thus; [<hi>Hence by the answer of a good conscience we may understand that unfeigned faith, whereof they made confession at their Baptism, and whereby their consciences were purified, and whereby they received the remission of their sins</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Some understand by the Answer of a good Conscience, that Covenant whereinto they entered at their Baptism, the embracing whereof they testified by their unfeigned confession of their Faith] viz.</hi> such a Faith as is aforesaid:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107958:105"/>
so that I conclude that this Tex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> doth plainly shew that Baptm is for the saving of the Baptized as to the instituted use, and may not be used meerly to any lower ends then to put them into a present state of Salvation.</p>

No one may be admitted to be a Member of the Church of Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the profession of a saving faith (by himself or Parents, or Proparents) therefore no one may be admitted to Baptism with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the profession of a saving faith.</p>
            <p>I speak of such admission to Church-membership as is in the power of the Ministers of Christ, who have the Keyes of his Kingdom to open and let in, as well as to cast out.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is past question, because Baptism is our solemn en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Church, who were before entred by private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and Accepted by the Covenant of God.</p>
            <p>All the question is of the <hi>Minor,</hi> which I shall therefore prove.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is before proved that all the Members of the Church must be such as are visibly, solemnly, or by profession, sanctified from former sin, cleansed, justified persons of God, the Heirs of the Promise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this cannot be without the profession of a saving faith, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This also is before proved, where it was shewed that no others are Christians, or Disciples.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The many thousands were added to the Church, were such as received gladly the doctrine of saving Faith and Repentance, and continued in the Apostles doctrine, and fellowship, and breaking of bread and Prayer: and so far contemned the world as to fell all, and make it common: And doubtless no man continued in those wayes, (of doctrine, fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) without the profession of saving Faith &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; for the very use of these is such a profession.

            <p>The Church <hi>is the Body of Christ,</hi> Col. 1.18, 24. and none are members of his Body, but such as either are united to him, and live by him, or at least seem to do so.

But so he is not effectively the Saviour of the Professors of a Faith that doth not justifie: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> he is the effective Saviour of those that profess a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying faith, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the sincere: but of others, neither way. Hitherto Divines have gathered from the plain texts of Scripture, that there is but <hi>One Church, One Faith, and One Baptism</hi>: and that those that had this <hi>Faith</hi> really, were to be baptized, and were real members of the Church; and that those that professed this faith, and so seemed to have it when they have it not, are visible members of the Church, and are so taken because their Profession is sensible to us, and by that they seem to have the thing professed. But the Opponents are fallen into a new conceit in all these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They feign a New Christian faith to themselves, <hi>viz.</hi> A faith that is short of Justifying; which Scripture and the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107958:106"/>
Church of God have taken to be but a preparatory to the Christian faith <hi>subjectively,</hi> or but a common part of it <hi>objectively</hi> considered: so that before there was but one Christian faith, and now they have made two. 2. And so before, there was but one sort of real serious or sincere Christians, consisting of such as had that real Christian faith: and now they have found out another sort of them, that hold another sort of faith. 3. So have they feigned a new Baptism; for the Old Baptism was for Remission of sin, and Burial and Resurrection wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h Jesus Christ, and to engraff men into the Church wich is the body of Christ, upon the profession of a saving faith: but the new feigned ends of Baptism are far different. 4. And they have feigned also a new kind of Church: For the Church of Christs constitution is but one, which is called <hi>visible</hi> from mens Profession, and <hi>invisible</hi> from the faith professed. But they have made a Church which consisteth of a third sort of members: that is, of men that neither <hi>have</hi> saving faith, nor <hi>profess</hi> it, but only have or profess to have a faith of a lower orb. 5. To this end they have confounded the Church and the Porch, the Vineyard and the adjacent part of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: those that heretofore were but <hi>Catechumeni</hi> or men in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the Church, are now brought into it: and are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerated to true Christians, before they once profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves such, and that upon a lower profession. 6 And hereby also the two sorts of Teaching are confounded, which Christ distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. That teaching which draweth men to Christ, and <hi>maketh them Disciples,</hi> and that which <hi>instructeth them when they are his Disciples</hi>; that which perswadeth them to receive <hi>Christ Jesus the Lord,</hi> and that which perswadeth them <hi>accordingly to walk in him.</hi> For they take him for a Disciple, that is but learning to be a Disciple, meerly because he submitteth to learn, and hath learned before some preparatory truths; though yet he be not made a Disciple indeed, nor profess so to be.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> is deeply offended with me, for saying that <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites</hi> that seem not only to be found Believers, and profess a Justifying faith, when they have it not, are only equivocally or analogically Christians or members of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I shall say somewhat more concerning those Believers that are
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107958:106"/>
described by him, who do not so much as profess a saving faith, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are no members of the Church at all (if notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,) and are not so much as to be named Christians, nor to be admitted into the visible Church. No man can prove that ever one man was admitted a Church-member in all the New Testament, upon the Profession of any lower kind of faith, than that which is the condition of Justification. Otherwise we should have two distinct Churches specifically different, or two sorts of Christianity and Christians differing <hi>totâ specie:</hi> because the faith which is here made their qualification, doth specifically differ by a moral specification. When the Jaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. was admitted into the Church by Baptism, with his houshold, it was upon the Professing of such a believing, by which both he and his houshold might be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as is before shewed. And so of all others in those times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 19. If we once admit men to baptism or the Lords Supper upon the Profession of any other than Justifying faith, we shall be utterly confounded, and not be able to give any satisfactory Description of that Faith, and so never be able to Practise our Doctrine, as being utterly uncertain whom to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize.</p>
            <p>That I may the better manifest this, I shall examine all the considerable Descriptions of that faith which I can meet with. The Papists themselves are not agreed in this business: sometime they speak as if a bare Assent would serve the turn; but common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they add that there is a Necessity also of consent, 1. To be subject to the Church. 2. To live under the Ordinances. And if they take the Intention of the party or Parents; or their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and Godmothers to be necessary, as they do the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Priest, then a bare Profession with them will not serve, nor can they tell when any one is baptized.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth speak so much, and purposely of this Point, that one would think we may expect an exact Description of this faith from him, if from any man: especially in his last Book, when I had so earnestly Intreated him before to do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the omission of it in his former Book: And yet even in this hath he done nothing but involve and obscure his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107958:107"/>
more than before: though I had purposely urged him to a plain discovery of his sense, even somewhat beyond the bounds of modesty, as it is esteemed of in common cases: For I perceived that the stress of our differences did rest much in this; because no wise man will leave his grounds till he see where he may have better; unless he mean to be for nothing, or of no Religion: there's no reason a man should upon every opposed difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish that he hath.</p>
            <p>And here, that I may do Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> no wrong, I shall cite his mind in his own words, and gather as many of his disclosures of it as I can find.</p>
            <p>For what he hath said in his Book of the Covenants, I have spoken to it already in my Apologie. And I write nor for those lazy Readers that had rather err than be at the pains of reading what is already written: I shall therefore suppose that, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he saith in his Treatise of the Sacraments:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 109. he saith [<q>I confess as much of Repentance in them as was required in any to the acceptation of Baptism: namely, A Renunciation of their false way, and a professed Acceptation of the tender of the Gospel.] <hi>And after</hi> [to renounce his way of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism, Judaism, and to profess and engage to a Christian faith &amp; conversation.</q>] Here I understand not Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s english, if he do not plainly renounce his cause, and say the same that I do, and so make vain his industrious opposition. The tender of the Gospel is the tender of Christ, and pardon and life to all true Acceptors of it. If <hi>the professed Accep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if <hi>professing a true Christian faith and conversation, and engaging thereto</hi>] be not a professing of that which is proper to the sanctified. (I mean in the special sense) then Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath made a new Christian Faith and Conversation which Scripture never prescribed nor described.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 172. He gives another, but the most express answer, which is likest to be his mind [<q>For a direct answer, I say, it it not profession to say we have this faith, but a profession of our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the necessity of it, with engagement to it that gives this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107958:107"/>
                  <hi>so P.</hi> 173. [I say &amp; do profess of those that have those secret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations wrapt up in their breasts, &amp; not yet from under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of lusts, yet convinced of their duty, and acknowledging the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, that it is the mind of God that they should be Baptized and have admission to Ordinances, in order to bring them more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and unreservedly to God. And this being the will of God, as you seem to yield when you say, we are bound to Baptize them:</q> 
               <hi>I say they have right in the sight of God to Baptism.</hi>] I shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin my Reply with his last passage; and I must needs say that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth unworthily abuse me and my words, in saying that [<hi>I seem to yield that we are bound to baptize them.] Them!</hi> What <hi>them?</hi> My own words which he citeth to prove this by me, are these [Vocation, which is effectual only to bring men to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profession of saving faith, is larger then Election, that makes men such whom we are bound to baptize] Forsooth in these words I contradict my self; I seem to give Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> the cause. I cannot but say, that it is pity the Church should be troubled with such an undigested undistinguishing management of controversies, for men to write so learnedly, and industrious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before they observe what they say. <hi>Is the outward Profession of a saving faith,</hi> (which I say makes men such as we are bound to baptize) the same thing with [<hi>the Profession of a common faith, short of saving, or with that common faith it self?</hi>] What should a man say to such a confuter, but advise him to joyn with us his weak Brethren, in desiring God to pardon us for such troubling and abusing the Church?</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to his Description of the persons to be Baptized, I shall add, 1. That his last Description, <hi>pag.</hi> 173. containeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what may stand with, First, an open refusal of God and Christ. 2. And that which is commonly taken for the sin against the Holy Ghost. For its past doubt that men may both be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of Duty, and confess the Necessity of it, and yet may openly profess, that the world and their lusts are yet so dear to them that they will not yet have God to be their God, &amp; Christ to be their Saviour, on the Gospel terms. And I think a man that openly refuseth Christ at the present, should not be baptized at the present, though [<hi>he be convinced of Duty, and acknowledge the necessity of it</hi>].</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:107958:108"/>As to his other Description, <hi>pag.</hi> 172. the word [<hi>Engagement to it</hi>] either signifieth [an engagement savingly to believe from that very instant forward] and this doth Necessarily import a present Profession of consent, and so of present saving faith: For man can so engage that doth not Profess such consent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: And this destroyeth Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> cause. Or else it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth such an engagement to believe for some distant future time, which is consistent with a non-profession of present consent to have Christ as offered. And this is the same with that before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed; If such may be Baptized, then they may say [we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that we must savingly believe in Christ, and we do engage our selves to do it, as soon as we can spare the world and forsake the Flesh and the Devil; but yet we cannot, and will not do this.] Baptize such who dare for me.</p>
            <p>But for a further search of Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> mind, observe his words, <hi>pag.</hi> 175. Where he answers to what I now object. And first he citeth these words of mine [Where you say that an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the Necessity of such faith, with engagement to it, is sufficient for a Title to the state. I reply. Then those that at present renounce Christ, so it be against their knowledge and Conscience, and will engage to own him sincerely for the future have a Title to Baptism] To which he replyeth [<hi>How comes I pray you that</hi> [future <hi>in? you manifest much reading in the Law: and I have heard this as a Maxim,</hi> In obligationibus ubi nullus certus statuitur dies, quovis die debetur; <hi>There is no day overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but engagement is for present,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>To this I rejoine; 1. It is the first time that ever I heard of an engagement that was not <hi>de futuro</hi> as to the performance. We are agreed that the Engagement is <hi>present</hi>; but the question is whether it be to a present or future performance. And it is by Covenant or Promise that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> supposeth this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made. And is there any which is not <hi>de futuro?</hi> If the Church cannot hit the Right way of Baptizing till such eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations as these direct them to it — If you Promise to believe <hi>de praesenti,</hi> either you do at that present believe, or you do not. If you do, your Promise as to that present act which you already perform, is vain: as if I Promise to give you that which I have given you already, or in that instant give you;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107958:108"/>
which were no promise, but a donation or profession: If you do not then believe, then your promise (as you call it) is a falshood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And to tell a lie, is no such a duty as can give right to Baptism. No man should say, <hi>he believeth,</hi> when he doth not. 2. But if it may be he means not <hi>futurum remotius</hi>] but [<hi>futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum proximum.</hi>] That cannot well be neither, because he saith [the engagement is for present.] But suppose he do mean by [<hi>present</hi>] the <hi>futurum proximum,</hi> either this importeth a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of saving faith, as well as an engagement to believe the next instant, or it doth not. If it do, I have the thing I seek, and Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> cause is given away. If not, then Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth feign God to require such a kind of promise or engagement as our ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile to baptism, which I believe the common vote of reason will pronounce to be vain, ridiculous, if not impossible by most. Vain it must needs be to make so solemn a promise of performing that in the next instant, which he may actually perform, &amp; save all that ado. Should I cause covenants to be solemnly drawn up, and witnesses called, and seals affixed, that I will give such a thing in the next Minute after the sealing; why then may I not as well give the thing it self? The Minister may stay one minute longer before he go to Church to baptize the person, or he may use one word or two more in prayer and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and by that time the instant would be come. And <hi>Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> it seems to me, that any man should be admitted upon such a promise as this [I will not yet leave my sin for God, nor renounce the world the Flesh and the Devill for Christ, or take him for my only Lord and Saviour: but I engage my self to do it, or I will do it as soon as the word is out of my mouth] or [I am not yet willing to have Christ as he is offered: but I will be willing the next instant.] If any say so to me, I will hold my hand from baptizing one minute, and ask him whether now he be willing? For certainly the man must break his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise between the making and the sealing of it, if he be not a sound Believer already. For there must go more then one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant between his promise and the Act of baptizing (unless we had greater velocity of action): If therefore Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s professor shall say, I promise to believe savingly the next instant [then if he do not, the promise is broke before it is sealed: If he do;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107958:109"/>
I know no reason but why I may require him to profess that which he hath.</p>
            <p>And is it not a kind of impossibility for any unregenerate man, rationally and soberly to promise to be regenerate the next minute or instant? Or for any that is destitute of saving faith, to promise to believe savingly the next instant: If he hath grace of such command and can believe the next moment, why not now? And doth not that man shew his heart unfound, that can believe the next moment, and will not do it at the present? If it be so in his power, let him not stand promising, but do it.</p>
            <p>But perhaps some will say that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> meaneth not the next instant or hour, or day, or any determinate time, but only an indeterminate time: some time hereafter. To which I answer 1. He expresseth himself by the terms [<hi>present</hi>] and [<hi>quovis die debetur:</hi>] therefore it expresly includeth the next instant or day determinately. 2. And if it were otherwise, either there is some future determinate time of the Debt and Obligation, or none. If none, its no covenant or Promise: and then it cannot be said <hi>quovis die debetur.</hi> If any, what is it? and when? Then a Promise to be a Christian, so long hence may give right to Baptism: And who can tell how long it must be? If any time before death, then thousands of Infidels, or persecutors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity may say, [We will be Christians before we die, and therefore will be baptised, though now we hate them for crossing us in our courses.] But this cannot be Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> meaning, for he speaks of a determinate time <hi>de [praesenti] &amp; [quovis die debetur.</hi>] And it is not <hi>debitum ex praecepto</hi> that he speaks of, (for that lieth upon Infidels,) but <hi>ex promissione</hi>; and therefore if <hi>quovis die debetur,</hi> then <hi>proximo die debetur</hi>; and if <hi>proximo die,</hi> then also <hi>proximo instanti</hi>; for none can shew a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why its due to morrow and not to day, or the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and if <hi>proximo instanti, vel hora vel die,</hi> then the Promise was made for the next instant, hour or day, or else the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation could not have arisen from that Promise as to that time.</p>
            <p>But faith Mr. <hi>Blake [bring me a man that in his heart is convinced that Jesus is the Christ, with his mouth professeth him, and engageth
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107958:109"/>
for him, and in the mean space actually renounceth him, and I will do what you would have me with him; that is, a man that is falling headlong down a ladder, at the same instant he is climbing up it</hi>]. To which I say, 1. If you mean an Absolute Renouncing him, or for the same time when he determineth to begin his Accepting of him, I confess it were a contradiction: but of your own feigning, and nothing to our business. 2. And therefore if you suppose the man to promise to believe savingly the next mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, then I confess it will not stand with a future Renouncing him: But then it is as true, that such a promise containeth, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, or supposeth a present profession of saving faith, or it is absurd and vain, as is aforesaid. 3. But if it be a promise to believe only at such a distance of futurity, then it not only may stand with a renouncing Christ till that time come, but seemeth to imply that so it is, if you suppose faith to be so far in the unregenerate mans power that he can make such promises of it. I told you before (which made you angry) where a renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Christ did stand with your two first qualifications, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and Verbal acknowledgement, <hi>viz.</hi> Mat. 21.38. <hi>This is the Heir; come let us kill him, and seize on the Inheritance.</hi>] And for your lust of Engaging to him (such an Engagement as you describe, to believe savingly) as I have said, if it be to believe at present, it is inseparable from a profession of saving faith. If only to believe at such a distant time, it is possible to renounce all actuall union and special communion with him till that time, and to say, I will not have Christ as offered til such a time, or till I can better spare my lusts; can you shew us here such contradictory work as your tumbler is supposed to make.</p>
            <p>Again, in <hi>Pag.</hi> 176. he reciteth the like, [<hi>Our profession quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying for Baptism is not a profession that we have such faith (which cannot be done without an eminence of faith to assurance;) but a profession of the necessity of it to salvation, &amp; an engagement to it.</hi>]</p>
            <p>To which I say, 1. For your reason in the <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> we shall silence it anon. 2. Again: One that openly refuseth Christ at present, may profess that necessity of Faith, and engage to it for the future at a distance, that is, to be a Christian so long hence. But he that promiseth it the next instant, if so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, doth profess it at this instant; For he professeth his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107958:110"/>
or willingness to have Christ as offered, which is saving Faith. For no man breathing can say (with any such credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as a sober man should regard) I will be willing or consent the next moment or hour; but he that is willing and doth consent or professeth so to do at this present when he saith so.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>p.</hi> 177. he saith to the citation of the foresaid Text, [<hi>I am sorry that such things should be mentioned where enquiry after truth is contended, and contention not studied. It is well known that I speak to a faith of profession, which is theirs that take so that party which is for that Christ, and not with those that professedly go in a full opposition against him, and are in a high rode (any such conviction of spirit supposed of sin, against the Holy Ghost.] Ans.</hi> It is your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed opinion that I argue against, and not your heart, nor any thing that is <hi>well known,</hi> by other means and to other men. If the faith or profession which you make a sufficient Title to Baptism, be consistent with such persecution or sin against the Holy Ghost (as you speak) then it behooved me to manifest the consistency, though it make you sorry; I do it to shew the face of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and not otherwise to contend &amp; your sorrow is but a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry defence. 2. What you do mean by [<hi>a faith of Profession</hi>]? This was not in the former descriptions which I examined or met with. Do you put the wrong end forward, and indeed mean [<hi>a profession of faith</hi> [or] <hi>a faith conjunct with a profession]?</hi> If not I know not what you mean. If you do, then what profession is it, and of what faith? Not of a saving faith; for that you before disclaimed; and if that were it that you mean must be professed, you yield the Cause. It is therefore the profession of some common faith; and that is it which you call Dogmatical. And if it be indeed a profession of a meer Dogmatical faith, or Assent, it is consistent with that renouncing Christ which I mentioned, and is no more than theirs [<hi>This is the Heir; come let us kill him</hi>]. But if it be more than Dogmatical, and have the Wills consent, why will no intreaty prevail with you to describe it, and tell us what it is that is consented to? and so prove that to you to be the title to Baptism and the Lord's Supper? In part or in whole; I know not whether, you tell me of their consent in the next words, [<hi>They take to that party
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107958:110"/>
which is for Christ and not with those that professedly go in a full op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position against him.</hi>] But I dare not say that now I have all your sense. 1. Where do you find in Scripture that such a faith is the Title to Sacraments? or that ever man was admitted to them upon such a profession? 2. If they may be so admitted, then let us see the consequence. By [<hi>taking to that party which is for Christ,</hi>] either you mean, 1. That they profess themselves to be of those that are sincerely Christians: or 2. That they profess themselves willing to be under Church Rulers and Ordinances (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> speaks;) or 3. That they will take part with Christians, in pleading, defending, &amp;c. If the first be your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then they profess themselves true Christians, and so to have saving faith. For there is but two sorts of Christians; Those that are really so, having saving faith: and those that are Analogically Christians, professing saving faith, when they have it not. 2. If you mean the second with the Papists, then consider that it is not into the Pope, nor Church Rulers, nor Ordinances that we are baptized, but into the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghost. And suppose that a man truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand on what terms Christ is offered in the Gospel, that man may say [I am content to be in the Church under teaching, and to receive the Sacraments, and to accompany Christians and fight for them; but yet I will not yet be a Christian my self; For I am not willing that Christ should sanctifie me, and save me from my sins. [And who that dependeth on the mouth of Christ would baptize this man? It is no more than belongeth to a <hi>Seeker</hi> or a <hi>Catechumne</hi> to be willing to hear. And God never made it a Title to Sacraments, meerly to bee willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. Else all may receive them that will. At least, I must profess that I can hardly believe, but that all that will receive them, must profess that they receive them to the ends which they are appointed to. And that no man can do, that doth not <hi>eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem actu</hi> profess himself a true believer. If the third be your sense, then no doubt but many Christians in the <hi>Indies</hi> have had <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> serva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

147. upon my earnest provocation of him to describe that faith which entitleth to Baptism. The words are these: [<hi>Seeing</hi> Mr. Baxter <hi>calls upon me to declare my self further in this thing, I do believe and profess to hold that he that upon hearing the Gospel preacht, and the truth of it published and opened, shall professedly abjure all other opposite wayes whatsoever, and choose the Christian way for salvation, promising to follow the Rules of it, is to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and his seed,</hi> &amp;c.] To which I reply: If this be not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of saving faith, I despair of ever being saved. 1. No man but a sanctified man can truly desire salvation it self, as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed consisting in the blessed fruition of God in Intuition, Love, Praise; and there is no other salvation. No man but the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate can truly renounce all opposite wayes. One opposite way is the way of the flesh and carnal reason, and the way of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No man can live out of action; nor out of moral action which tendeth to an end, and that end is his own felicity. He therefore that renounceth all other ways, must turn to Christ the only way: or else cut his own throat, or some way murther himself that he may cease action: or else must attain to a perfect desperation. 3. No man but the Regenerate doth heartily choose the Christian way for salvation. For what is that but to choose Christ for salvation? and what is that but (supposing as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) the true description of saving faith? 4. No man but the Regenerate can sincerely follow, or resolve and promise to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Rules of that way. For what is that but to follow the rules of Christ and Scripture? And what is that but sincerely to obey? So that he that professeth these four Points, or any one of them, doth profess that which is proper to the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. So that if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> do not here give up his Cause, and say as I do, understand English that can for me. If Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> dare adjudge all those to damnation that go not further than this faith which he here describeth to be professed, (as he must if he suppose this to be the profession of a faith short of saving) he shall never have my vote in approbation of his censure. If those who perform that which is here said to be professed, be not saved, I know not who will. Therefore I doubt not but it is the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a saving faith.</p>
            <p>But what need we make any further enquiry, or dispute
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107958:111"/>
against a man that professedly yields the cause? Hear his forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, <hi>pag.</hi> 147. [<q>His two first Arguments drawn from autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the first of the Assembly of Divines, and others of a number of Fathers, are brought to prove that the profession of a just<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It sufficiently implyed where I require a Dogmatical faith to Baptism. A Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical faith assents to that of <hi>Apollo's,</hi> Jesus is the Christ; and when I say that this entitles, I cannot mean concealed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but openly professed:</q>] Reader canst thou tell what to make of this? is not here a plain concession, that a profession of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith is requisite to Baptism? and doth he not averr that he never denied it? Perhaps we have disputed all this while without an adversary; as to Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> let it be so: and let us see the truth prevail, and I shall not be industrious to prove to Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> that he hath said the contrary. But yet me thinks its a marvellous thing that a man should so frequently express his mind against the necessity of the presence &amp; profession of a justifying faith, as to Baptism, and for the sufficiency of a faith short of justifying, and the profession thereof, as a title to that Ordinance,<note place="margin">And it is the Title over the top of his leaves that a Faith short of justifying en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</note> and now say that he never denyed the Profession of a justifying faith to Baptism, but in plain words hath oft affirmed it. Read the words that I before cited out of him: read both his books and see how much of the scope of them is this way. And let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when he hath done, tell us if he can, what Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> talk't for. By the words an English man would think that he had at large argued for the sufficiency of a faith short of justifying, <hi>in re &amp; professione,</hi> as to entitle to Baptism. But here he seems most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly to deny it. I say, <hi>he seems:</hi> for I must profess that I dare not presume that I understand him here neither. For the rest of his book which I thought I understood, seemed as plain as this. I began once of think that a fraud lay under these words, and that it is here necessity of Precept only which he means when he saith that [<hi>a Profession of saving faith is necessary to Baptism</hi>] and not a necessity to means, or that it is <hi>sine qua non.</hi> But though I know no other way to reconcile him here to his books, yet this cannot be his sense. For the man is not fradulent; and besides his following arguing sheweth the contrary. But then I
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107958:112"/>
confess that arguing amazeth me again. He will prove that he is for the necessity of the profession of a justifying faith to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism, because he is for the necessity of a Dogmatical faith, and that faith must be profess. Wonderful! Doth he make a justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and a Dogmatical faith all one? No; he constantly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth and opposeth them. How then doth he prove that he asserteth the necessity of the profession of a justifying faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he asserteth the necessity of a professed Dogmatical faith. Reader I am at a loss: I dare not say Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> is so; perhaps he understands himself, make thy best on't: for I can make nothing on't, or worse then nothing. But if really he will be of this mind that [the Reality of a dogmatical faith is necessary, and the profession of a justifying faith] I shall not only thank him for giving quiet profession to the truth, but I will give him some back again, and will come my self a beg lower then he; and will affirm that we must give them the Sacraments that profess a saving faith, though they have not so much as the Reality of a Dogmatical faith. <q>Yet Reader if thou think that there is any parcel of the cause which Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth not expresly give up, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his labour, adjoin his words <hi>p.</hi> 124. and rest satisfied [<hi>so that I conceit no promise of these Ordinances made to such a faith; but an actual investiture of every such believer in them.</hi>
               </q>]</p>
            <p>I have made the best enquiry I can into Mr. <hi>Blake's</hi> sense, and I cannot find any reasonable footing for a man to fix upon, if we once forsake our present hold; and say that it is a professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some other faith short of that which justifyeth, which is the title to the Sacraments. For as no man can prove out of Scripture then what faith it must be, but we shall there be at a loss; so whatever he assert, we have evidence enough to prove it insufficient. A Real Dogmatical faith cannot be the title; For then the Baptizer must know the heart. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of a bare Dogmatical faith or assent cannot be it: For then he that hath the faith of Devils, persecutors of Christ, and such as are supposed to sin against the Holy Ghost, should have title. Some consent therefore of the will there must be. But to what, if not to have Christ as he is offered, who can tell? A consent to be externally Baptized will not serve. A consent to Baptism as Baptism comprizeth saving faith. A consent to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107958:112"/>
be a named Christian, and to live among them, may be without any profession of Christianity. No man can tell where to fix, nor what we must consent to, to procure a Title, if once we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the present ground. If any man will give us yet a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Description of a faith short of justifying, entitling to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism and the Lords Supper, I shall be willing to examine it. For hitherto I cannot see where I should set my foot if I should leave the ground I stand on.</p>
            <p>I now come to examine the Arguments that are brought for the contrary opinion. And I shall begin with Mr. <hi>Blake's,</hi> and then proceed to some which others insist upon.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Blake <q>They that have right in the sight of God to many and great Priviledges of his gift, have a right in his sight to the first and leading Priviledges; this I think cannot be denied: having a right to those that follow, they have right to those that lead. If any had in the time of the Law right to the Passeover, they had right to Circumcision; and if any now have right to the Lords Supper, they have right to Baptism. But those of a faith that is short of that which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Jew outwardly where Circumcision of heart was wanting, had every way much benefit and advantage; he had therefore right to Circumcision, and those with him that are short of a faith that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies, have right in the sight of God to Baptism.</q>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107958:113"/>
not that right, but his election. A Frenchman hath right to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> but not because he is a Frenchman. The Jew outwardly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. had not his right by a faith short of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; But he had first an actual abode among Ordinances, and the offers of Grace and helps to salvation, by free providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all disposal of mercy. 2. The claim that he made to Church-priviledges before men, must be upon his <hi>Professing of saving faith</hi>; viz.

               <p>This answer sufficeth as to the present controversie: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth seem also to intend these Arguments to the following controversie, I shall briefly enervate them as to both, that I may not be put to go over them again when I come to that controversie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I deny that Baptism is [<hi>the first and leading Priviledge of Gods gifts.</hi>] It is a great Priviledge to have the Gospel preached to them, to have pardon conditionally offered them, that is, if they will accept of Christ to be converted, and made a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; to be born of Christian Parents. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These and more are Priviledges, and before baptism. 3. I distinguish at large of the term (<hi>Right)</hi> in my Apologie. Here let it suffice to say: 1. Right is properly so called, which in this case must arise from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise or proper gift. 2. Or it is Analogically so called, which ariseth 1. indirectly from Gods command to the Parent, Priest, Pastor <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to do this for all that require it, upon a profession of true faith. 2. Or from bare permission or providential dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal. 4. I distinguish also the Jews case from ours: They had some promise of a continuance of Ordinances among them, though not for perpetuity, yet for a long time, which no Church on earth hath now. 5. And now I answer to the <hi>Minor</hi>: 1. An Analogical improper right, resulting from permission, and a command to Ministers to Baptize all that upon such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession require Baptism, this I ever granted to all that profess sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith. 2. But a proper right, from promise or proper gift, which may warrant them to claim or require the thing from God or man; this I deny to any but true believers and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107958:113"/>
their seed. They may not lawfully require it, though we must give it them if they do require it, upon such a profession. 3. But without a profession of saving faith, they may neither require it, nor we give it if they do require it, whatever other short faith they have, or profess. 4. Thus also the Case was with the Jews, allowing the difference made by the foresaid peculiar Promise to them.</p>

               <p>The Jews were nigher to God than other people. 1. In that they had the offers of Grace which other people had not. 2. And many great Deliverances and temporal priviledges, which others had not. Both these Infidels and Heathens may now have; and therefore they prove no Right to Baptism. 3. They were nigher by some promises peculiar to that Nation, which is nothing to us. 4. They were nigher by their <hi>Consent</hi> to the offers of Grace, and the Covenant of the Lord; which was proper (in sincerity) to the sanctified. 5. And by their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Consent,</hi> and external engaging themselves to the Lord (whether they had inwardly faith or not.) Now to the <hi>Major,</hi> I grant it: but add, that the three first sorts of <hi>Nearness</hi> give not right to Baptism: All admission to <hi>near Relation,</hi> comparatively to others, is not by Circumcision or Baptism. But it is only a <hi>Nearness</hi> in the two last senses that are questionable as to this. And I have before shewd, in what sense true <hi>Consent</hi> to the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107958:114"/>
Covenant gives right, and in what sense an outward profession of <hi>Consent</hi> gives right; and that your common faith gives none in either sense. Lastly, if your conclusion were granted, its nothing to our question: For as is said, all admission to near relation is not by baptism: One Infidel may be nearer God and the Kingdom of Heaven then another, and yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The words are [<hi>Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his waies, and to keep his Statutes, and his Commandments and his Judgements, and to hearken to his voice: And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people,</hi> &amp;c.] Do you think that they that in <hi>heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that the Lord be their God, and to walk in his waies,</hi> &amp;c. have not saving faith?

The Argument will not hold from <hi>one</hi> common gift, to <hi>any</hi> common gifts, nor to <hi>this</hi> common faith. Prove this Consequence. 2. I distinguish in the Antecedent between arguing from gifts as a Title, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Title, and arguing from them as satisfactory eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a Title, such as profession it self is. To the proof from <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. I say further: It followeth not [he that hath received the Holy Ghost may be baptized] therefore he that hath your common faith may be baptized. For thats no evidence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Holy Ghost. 2. The Holy Ghost was promised only to be true Believers, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17. and not to any others: Yet God did not hereby restrain his own power from giving it to others. Seeing therefore God had promised it to true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, though he did give it to some others, it followeth that

it was a probable evidence of saving faith, though not a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: And therefore it might warrant us to baptize them, as Profession it self might do: Especially when it accompanied that Profession: seeing that both Evidences are more full than one, and yet one is sufficient as to us. 3. You cannot prove that ever God gave the holy Ghost to any that professed not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith: Nor yet that any man was baptized upon any such gift of Miracles without the profession of saving faith. Those <hi>Acts</hi> 10. confessed Christ, and professed faith before they were baptized. 4. You cannot prove that it was only common gifts of the Spirit that is meant in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47.

But our Question is, what the Circumciser must look for? and what was necessary to warrant them to circumcise them? And that was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession (by the person if at age; if not, by his Parent or pro-Parent) of a true saving faith, and nothing lower. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to take the Lord only for their God; and if they did but that sincerely, they should be saved: For to be our God, is to be our chiefest Good, and to take him for such, is to Love him above all and prefer before all. To take him for our God, is to take him for the Principal Efficient of our Being and Well-being: And so to take him, conteineth the chief Dependance on him. To take him for our only God, is to take him for

               <p n="1">1. There's no shew of reason for the Consequence. If any such thing would follow, it would be but this, [<hi>That we must re-baptize them whose Parents professed not saving faith</hi>;] and thats not one that ever I saw present a child to Baptism, if we speak of a verbal Profession. 2. Neither will this perhaps follow neither: but only that which was not done, should be done; that is, Profession; and not that which was done, be done again; that is, external Baptizing. 3. I find by sad experience to my sorrow, that a considerable part of some Parishes, or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, are ignorant of the Fundamentals: I have spoken with abundance that know not that Christ is God or Man, or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (but they say, he is a Spirit;) nor that the Holy Ghost is God; nor why Christ dyed; nor that any Satisfaction is made for our sins; or any thing done or necessary to their pardon, but our own Repentance and Amendment: and with some that know not that the Soul goes to Heaven before the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor that the body shall ever rise again. Now I would know of Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> Whether all the Children of these Parents must be Baptized again, or not? For certainly these have not

               <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> will require the profession of a Dogmatical faith, and an engagement to believe savingly, as strictly (I hope) as I will require the profession of saving faith, and an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to actual obedience. And if a Dogmatical faith and such an engagement must be profest, then it must be known by him the professeth it, as necessarily as the other. And I would fain know of him how meer Dogmatical believers are sure that they have a Dogmaticall faith. 1. Many of them know not what that faith is, nor what the essentials of Christianity are; nor know not those essentials themselves, as I before said from sad experience. They might therefore be sure that they <hi>have not</hi> a true Dogmatical faith, but not that they <hi>have it</hi>; and yet they are as confident they have it as other men. 2. Many that believe the same truths as others, believe them but <hi>side humanâ,</hi> and not <hi>divinâ:</hi> and therefore have no true Dogmatical faith. 3. Many do but half believe them, and think they may be true &amp; they may be false, and cannot tell whether they may believe them or not, but indeed do not; their unbelief being more predominant, and therefore from it must be denominated. 4. Many true saving
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107958:121"/>
believers are sorely tempted about the Truth of the Gospel, and troubled with doubts, and their Dogmatical or Historical faith is but weak, and mixed with much unbelief: so that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether their belief or unbelief be predominant, and consequently whether they believe or not. And for my part I see no reason but that it should be as hard to a true Christian to know whether he truly believe the <hi>Dogmata Christiana,</hi> the Articles of Faith, the truth of the Gospel, as to know whether he truly rest upon Christ, or love God above all. And I know many learned, wise, and godly men (to all appearance) that are in doubt, and long have been, of the truth of their assent to the Gospel, and are troubled with no other doubtings of their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity (in any great measure) but only as the doubts of this doth cause them. Some of the ablest men that ever I knew have groaned out many a complaint: O, I am afraid I am an Infidel! I cannot believe the Word of God! I know not whether I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it or not!] A Turk may have some thoughts or motions that it may be true; but if he be more perswaded of the falsness than of the Truth, he is not to be denominated a believer. Now if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> will but tell us plainly, how he would deal with these that doubt of their very historical faith, and what he would have them do, then I will tell him the like by them that doubt of their saving faith. 5. Nay see what a desperate plunge he puts his believers to. He requireth them to perform im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities. They must engage to believe savingly; that is, they must profess a consent so to do. And this they must know that they do sincerely; or else they cannot do it in faith as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection saith:) when as it is a thing that no unregenerate man can do sincerely. If he engage to believe savingly, he doth it not sincerely, but ignorantly or dissemblingly. At least, few of them know that they do it sincerely (as themselves will here confess;) what then must these do in such a case?</p>
               <p n="6">6 At least, let the heart and light of a godly man and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly be compared, and I will appeal to Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether a Godly man be not as likely to know his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in saving faith, as an ungodly man to know that he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h truly a Dogmatical faith, and doth truly engage to believe sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly. I could soon shew such disadvantages that a wicked
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107958:121"/>
man hath to know his own heart, even in this point, that me thinks might easily determine this Controversie, if it were needfull to stand upon it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is the duty of the godly to give God thanks for his saving Grace; for converting them, giving them the Holy Ghost, Justifying, Adopting them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Must none perform this duty but they that have attained Assurance of their Conversion, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, Adoption, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Then it is not many that must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. But if others may and must do this, on the same ground they may and must perform the other. It is the duty of every child of God to pray and praise God in the relation of a child, in a special sense, and to call God Father in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial sense, and to plead those Promises with him that are the proper portion of his Children. And must all omit this that have no assurance or subjective Certainty? It it the duty of each member of the mystical body of Christ to love the Saints, and assist them as fellow-members: Must none do this, that is not certain of his own member-ship? If I should instance in all the particulars of Christian Duty that this case extendeth to, you would see that this your principle reduced to practice would make bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> unhappy work in the Church and would do much to the extirpation of a very great part (if not the far greatest) of the service of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In all such Cases our Actions must follow the smallest prevalent perswasions of our Judgement, though far short of full Assurance. If a true Believer do think himself to be such, he may profess himself such: When so far as he knoweth his own heart, he doth believe and repent, he may profess that he doth believe and repent, implying or expressing that he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth according to the knowledge he hath of his own heart. We are so strange to our selves, that if only Certainty must move us to Action, I think we should sleep out the most of our lives. He speaks sincerely that speaks according to his perswasion, and as he thinks, though he be not certain.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In such cases it condemneth not to act in doubting, but the same man that doubteth may act in faith. Indeed if the doubting be so predominant, that a man is more perswaded that he doth not believe, than that he doth (whether dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107958:122"/>
or savingly) then he may not profess that he doth believe: that is, he may not think one thing, and speak another, and speak or do against his Conscience: And also if it be in an indifferent thing, as about meats, or drinks, or indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent daies, where he is certain to be innocent if he forbear, and uncertain to be innocent if he act, then he must take the safer side, and therefore forbear. And the Apostles words will reach no further than to these two points. He that hath unbelief, and therefore doubing, may say, Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The thing that is necessarily required to the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal participation, is not an Assurance that our faith is sincere and saving, but that it be really that Faith which is sincere and saving, whether we know it so to be or not. Many a man knoweth that he hath that faith which is saving, and yet knoweth not that it is saving. And many one knoweth that he performeth the <hi>saving act,</hi> but through vain scruples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth not whether he do it <hi>sincerely</hi>: And many <hi>think</hi> or <hi>hope</hi> they are <hi>sincere</hi> that yet doubt of it. I have met with many that have lived in deep distress for want of perceiving the truth of their faith; that have cried out [I have no true faith, I cannot believe! Faith is a perswasion of Gods love to me, or a resting on him for salvation, and I cannot be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of his love to me, nor can I rest upon him.] And when I have convinced them that [the Gospel is 1. a Narrative of what Christ is, and what he hath done and suffered for us; and 2. an offer of Christ, and life to all that will accept the offer: And therefore that faith is 1. an Assent to the truth of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and 2. a Consent to be Christs, and that he shall be ours.] And when I have asked them whether they do these two things or not: whether they believe the Gospel to be true, and are willing that Christ and Life be theirs, and that they be Christs? they profess very cheerfully both this Assent and Consent; they are w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lling to have Christ if they know their own hearts; and yet they dare not say that they are true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; partly through general fears, and partly because they know not that this which they profess is saving faith. Now in such a case we are to let them know that it is the <hi>thing,</hi> and not
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107958:122"/>
their <hi>Certainty of the thing</hi> that God hath m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de necessary. And therefore we do not, nor must not ask them in Sacramental Administrations, whether they have <hi>saving faith</hi> by meer name, without description? but whether they believe in God the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost; and renounce the World, Flesh, and Devil? and whether they are willing to have God for their only God, and Christ for their only Saviour, and the Holy Ghost their Sanctifier? And he that saith, <hi>yea,</hi> doth profess a saving faith, though he know it not so to be. And what would Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> do with him if he say neither Yea, nor Nay?</p>
               <p>Having thus vindicated the Proposition against their Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and shewed the van<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty of all other waies, and that we can have no certainty what Profession to expect, if we expect not a Profession of saving Faith, I may well sum up all, and still insist on the 19th Argument, that we must expect the profession of a saving Faith, seeing if we take up with any other we are utterly at a loss: Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> cannot agree with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self what faith to require, nor hath given any certain descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, when he hath so voluminously talkt for it: and what he or others seem to require, as a thing distinct from sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, we see sufficient Reason to reject, as being wholly unproved, and by us proved insufficient to this use.</p>
               <p>I shall now therefore proceed to my 20th. and last Argument, for the Proposition, which is drawn from the constant practice of the Universal Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>It hath been the constant practice of the Catholike Church since the Apostles daies till now, to require that Profession of saving Faith and Repentance, as necessary before they would bapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ze, and not to baptize any upon the Profession of any lower kind of Faith: Therefore it must be our practice also.</p>
               <p>And here I must confess my self in as great an admiration at the words and dealings of Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and some godly learned Divines that go with him in this Cause, as ever I was brought to by the groundless confidence of such men. He must shut his eyes against the fullest Evidence of Historie and Church-practice, that will deny that it hath been the practice of the Universal Church of Christ to baptize upon the profession of a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107958:123"/>
saving faith, and not otherwise: Insomuch that I must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that I am not (for my own part) able to prove that ever any one person since the daies of the Apostles, was baptized upon the profession of any other faith, by any save the gross Hereticks, even those whose Baptism was accounted invalid. I desire Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> or his Neighbours of his mind, to help me to an instance of any one approved Baptism since Christs time, or his Apostles upon the account of a faith that was short of justifying, and not upon the Profession of a justifying Faith. Hitherto this is not done by them, &amp; the contrary is fully done by others: and yet (to my admiration) they as confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that all the Church of Christ hath gone their way, or that it hath been their constant practice, and that they should forsake the example of the Church, if they should do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: and they except against my Opinion as novelty. I must confess that such Experience hath brought me to lower thoughts of the credit even of good men than formerly I have had, and to resolve to try before I trust. One would think that the matter of fact in such a point as Baptism, which we all pass through, should have been out of question before this day.</p>
               <p>For the proof of the Churches practice, 1. I have already said enough about the Apostles own practice and the Church in their daies. Even when they describe the faith which they require expresly by assent alone, yet they shew that it is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Assent which they require; and the promise of pardon and salvation is in the same or other Scriptures affixed to that Assent: But this I shall not recite now.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The constant practice of the Church since the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>postles to this day, is undoubtedly known. 1. by the very form of words in Baptism. and 2. be the historie of their proceedings therein.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is certain that the Church did ever Baptize into the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost: And as I have proved before, the voluntary seeking and reception of that Baptism containeth the actual profession of a saving Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is certain that the persons to be baptized if at age, did profess to believe in the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:107958:123"/>3. It is also certain, that they did profess to renounce the Flesh, the World, and the Devil; which is a profession of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Repentance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And it is certain, that they promised for the future to live in new obedience; which is the consequent of saving faith: and thus they publikely entered the three stipulations; <hi>Credi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Credo: Abronuncias? Abrenuncio: Spondes? Spondeo.</hi> And no man can do this that hath not saving faith; therefore the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing of it is not without the professing of a saving faith; Nay indeed it containeth the profession of that faith.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Moreover it is a known case that the ancient Churches commonly took all those that were duly baptized to be in a state of salvation. That they supposed them to have the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of all their sins, I think none doubteth that ever read much of their writings. <hi>Davenant</hi> in his Epistle of Baptism giveth many proofs, and many hundred more may be given, if any be so blind as to deny it. All the doubt is, Whether they also ascribe Regenerating, Renewing Grace to all the rightly baptized? And though <hi>Davenant</hi> deny that they ascribe the infusing of habits to it, as to infants; yer 1. he denieth it not as to the Adult; nor 2. that they ascribed the Gift of the Holy Ghost to it, as to Infants. And yet as long as they put all duly baptized (both Infants and Adult) into a state of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it matters not as to our question, whether Infants had habitual Grace. And yet Mr. <hi>Graker</hi> hath brought so many proofs out of the mounments of Antiquity, even for this also (that the Fathers <hi>uno ore</hi> took all the Baptized to be regenerate or renewed by inherent grace) that when his <hi>Amanuensis</hi> had transcribed them, he f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is undeniable that they took all that were duly baptized, to be presently in a state of salvation, without any delay: and therefore they did not take Baptism as a common Ordinance to lead men up to the use of other Church Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as the Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which is also common to the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously ungodly,) and so to saving grace.</p>

                  </gap> that I know of, till Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> lately contradicted it.) And so they took this Justifying Faith and true Repentance to be prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to Baptism; and therefore note, 1. That all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned terms describe only Justification and Sanctification. 2. That they never speak a word of Justifying Faith or Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance infused by Baptism; for these are supposed. 3. That therefore they ever enquired before hand whether they believed in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and renounced the Flesh, the World, and the Devil (as is aforesaid;) and caused them to profess this before they would baptized them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fathers erred not so much as many suppose in their ascribing to Baptism. For 1. sometime by <hi>Baptism</hi> they mean
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107958:125"/>
not only the external Ordinance, but the whole work therein to be done; viz. the Accepting Christ solemnly in Covenant, and giving up our selves, as a sanctified people to him, renouncing the Flesh, the World, and the Devil, and so becoming fully Christians. This is baptism with them, and not the outward sign alone. And what saith <hi>Peter</hi> less, when he saith, [<hi>Baptism saveth us</hi>] and thus expoundeth himself when he hath done? And what say the Fathers more? 2. When they speak of these effects of Baptism, they suppose a due recipient or subject, that is, A true Believer, or the Seed of such: and therefore they oft speak of the inefficacy of the outward Baptism to Hypocrites. 3. When they speak of the outward Ordinance only, the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which they ascribe to it, and all the great effects, are to be understood but by way of obsignation and solemnization, and not solely, excluding the internal Faith and the Covenant: as actual solemnized Marriage gives a woman right to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and all that he hath, when yet she had a right by secret Covenant and Contract before. Now common Reason, and the Nature of the thing and many of the Contexts shewing that the Fathers and Councils must be thus expounded according to these Rules, I would fain know how they deserve that heavy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation that we commonly lay upon them for their Judgement in this, or what ground the Papists have to plead them general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their efficay <hi>ex opere operato</hi>? And yet I will not excuse each particular person of them thus.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it is the Baptism of the Adult that the Church hath generally ascribed so much to; and therefore though they took all the Adult for Regenerate and Justified when baptized, yet they did not judg so of Infants. <hi>Answ.</hi> I will answer this in Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> words. <hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 64.

faith, when they speak of Infants right to Baptism: therefore its plain that they supposed it not in themselves. <hi>Answ.</hi> True: By which you may discern that Faith was presupposed as the Evidence of their right to Baptism and its effects, that is, to Justification and Sanctification: and therefore it was such a Faith as had the promise of these effects, <hi>viz.</hi> Justification and Sanctification; and therefore not another kind of faith. And this faith was supposed to be in the Parent for himself and his seed, because the condition or qualification of the Infant is but this, that he be the seed of a Believer. But then you must note, that though they supposed the condition of Right; <hi>viz.</hi> faith to be in the Parent, and not in the Infant himself, yet they alway affirmed the consequent fruits; <hi>viz.</hi> Regeneration, and Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Adoption to be in the Infant himself and not in the Parent for him. I may answer this therefore in Mr <hi>Gatakers</hi> words, <hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 65. [Resp. 1. <hi>Aliud est fides ipsa, aliud Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio, seu mentis internae renovatio, quae sine fidei actu ullo consistere potest.</hi> 2. <hi>Ad fidem Patres alienam adeò confugiunt, ubi de par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulorum salute agunt; quia fidei alienae beneficio foedere continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; ab Baptismiritum suscipiendum jus obtinent.</hi> Vid.

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But is it a likely thing that the Fathers and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church should be so blind as to take all for truly justified and regenerate that are baptized? Then either they must take all the members of the Visible Church to be such, and so be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; or else they must suppose them to fall away from saving grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The supposition of falling away was too common with them, though a few words on the by have fallen from some few of them that seem inconsistent with it. 2. They did not take <hi>All Collectively</hi> to be justified that were baptized and Church-members, but <hi>All Distributively,</hi> or each single person, 3. And that was onely by that judgement which is grounded on humane faith, because they are bound, <hi>fide humanâ,</hi> to believe that he is a true believer that professeth himself so to be, as all the baptized at age did. 4. But when they came 1. to speak of <hi>All collectively,</hi> 2. or of Hypocrites in general, 3 or of any that did after discover themselves to have dissembled in Baptism
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:107958:126"/>
particularly; then they declare the uneffectualness of Baptism to those Hypocrites, and that they took not all the Visible Church to consist of justified Ones; but that the Hypocrites, though baptized, were but the chaff, and the upright were the Wheat. But it is but <hi>Hypocrites</hi> that they say this of, and not men that never (by themselves, or their Parents, or Pro-parents) did so much as profess the Christian justifying faith, but only a faith of another kind;</p>
               <p>And as it is true of the Ancient Church that they never bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized any without the Profession of saving faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, so it is true of all the Christian Churches in the world, that I can hear of to this day. The Papists themselves do use the same words in Baptism, as are afore expressed, and require a Profession in the Parents or pro-Parents, or the person, if at age, that they believe in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and that they renounce the Flesh, the World, and the Devil. And though their false Doctrine force them to mis-expound their own words, yet custom hinders them from changing them. And about the sense, they are not agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Some of them, as is said, would have Baptism only (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily) to admit Infants into the visible Church, and place them under Government and ordinances and give them <hi>ex opere operato</hi> a certain preparatory grace. Some of them will have it to imprint an indelible Character (they know not what) and to give them true Sanctification (which they call justification) by inherent grace. Some of them affirm, that as to Infant-Baptism the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath not defined whether it justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or not, and therefore it is not <hi>de fide.</hi> And Accordingly, some of them make true faith pre-requisite in the Parents; and some of them make a certain congruous disposition <hi>(Meritum de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruo</hi>) to be pre-requisite; but wherein that congruous Merit must consist, they know not, or are not yet agreed: Commonly its thought to be in a <hi>fides informis,</hi> or bare Assent. (Which Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> calls a dogmatical Faith) conjunct with a reverent esteem of the Sacraments and a consent to become members of the Catholike Church, and to be under their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and use the Ordinances: Or a consent in the Parent that the child do these.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:107958:127"/>And for the reformed Churches, it is past all question by their constant practice that they require the Profession of a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Christian Faith, and take not up with any lower. The Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> till the late change, may be seen in the Common-prayer-Book, wherein all that is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned is required.</p>
               <p>The Judgement of the present Guides of our Churches (as to the most) is easie to be known by the Conclusions of the late Assembly at <hi>Westminster.</hi> In the larger Catechism they say [<hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is not to be administred to any that are out of the visible Church, and so strangers to the Covenant of promise, till they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess their Faith in Christ, and obedience to him: but Infants descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from Parents, either both, or but one of them, professing faith in Christ, &amp; obedience to him, are in that respect within the covenant, and to be baptized.</hi>] Here you may see whom they take to be of the visible Church, and in <hi>that respect</hi> within the covenant. 1. The words [<hi>professing faith in Christ</hi>] if they were alone do signifie a justifying faith profest. For though [<hi>to believe in Christ</hi>] may sometime signifie a lower kind of Faith, yet <hi>analogum per se positum, stat pro famosiori significato.</hi> 2. But that there may be no doubt of their meaning, they add the necessity also of a profession of <hi>Obedience</hi> to Christ, to shew that it is the working faith which must be profest. And it is not only a <hi>Promise</hi> of Obedience for some distant futurity, but the <hi>Profession</hi> of it, which they make necessary. And I conceive that he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth faith in Christ, and obedience to him, professeth that which will prove saving, if he have but what he professeth.</p>
               <p>The same they say in their confes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion of Faith. <hi>Cap,</hi> 28. And again in the shorter Catechism: <hi>Profession of Faith in Christ, and obedience to him, is the thing required.</hi> In the Directory also they tell us that <hi>Baptism is a seal of the Covenant of Grace, of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffing into Christ, and of our Vnion with him, of remission of sin, Regeneration, Adoption, and Eternal Life: that the water in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism representeth and signifieth both the blood of Christ, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away all guilt of sin original and actual, and the sanctifying vertue of the spirit of Christ against the dominion of sin and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our sinful nature That baptizing, or sprinkling and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing with water signifieth the cleansing from sin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107958:127"/>
is made to believers and their seed,</hi> &amp;c. And they mean, no doubt, the promise of the foresaid special mercies: for even Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> himself doth (once) deny any promise of baptism to be made to the Infants that he pleadeth for. And the promise of Justification, Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is made to no believers, but those that have justifying faith, otherwise than as it is barely offered, and so it is to Infidels also.</p>
               <p>They add also in the same place [that <hi>All who are bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ized in the name of Christ do renounce, and by their baptism are bound to fight against the Devil the World, and the flesh.</hi>]</p>
               <p>All this is further manifest in our daily administration of Baptism. I never heard any man baptize an Infant but upon the Parents, or Susceptors, or Offerers Profession of a justifying faith. Nor do I believe that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> himself doth baptize any otherwise; though he dispute against this, and for another Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. The grounds of my conjecture are, 1. Because I suppose he is loth to be so singular as to forsake the course of the Church in all ages: And therefore I conjecture that he requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to profess that <hi>they believe in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and that they renounce the world, the Flesh, and the Devil.</hi> 2. Because he so often professeth that he taketh the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized to be in covenant with God, and that this covenant is by them entered in baptism &amp; he saith that he knoweth but of one Covenant, and that is the covenant of saving grace; and that they are presently obliged (<hi>debetur quovis tempore</hi>) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not only for a distant futurity that they engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And if this be so, it is past doubt that they profess a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith. For the Gospel hath two parts, 1. the Narrative, or Historie of Christs person, and sufferings, resurrection <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. and the offer of Christ and life to sinners; Accordingly Faith hath two parts; 1. the Assent to the History, or to the truth of the Christian Doctrine, (and this Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be necessary) and 2. <hi>Consent</hi> to the offer: And this is called the <hi>Receiving of Christ</hi>: And this is our <hi>Internal cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> confesseth necessary. For the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting of the <hi>Heart</hi> is this very <hi>consent,</hi> with a resolution for future duty: and the covenanting of the mouth is the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or Profession of this <hi>Consent,</hi> with a promise of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

                     </gap>cted non-sense</hi>] as to say, that <hi>justifying faith is a promise:</hi> Yet it is not only all the <hi>sense</hi> that I have of the nature of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying faith, (that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is an Assent to the Truth of the Gospel with a consent to the offer, or heart-promise to be Christs) but it must also be his own sense though <hi>disaffected,</hi> or else he must palpably contradict himself: There being no other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal entering or accepting the Covenant or Offer of Grace, but by that consent and heart promise. 3. And I must also conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture this, because we even now found Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> denying that <hi>ever he denied the necessity of the Profession of a saving faith to baptism.</hi> But if in my conjectures I be mistaken in Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> practice, I must say that I know not of any man else living, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed a Christian Pastor, that baptizeth upon any lower faith, without the profession of a justifying faith, and that Repentance which is its constant concomitant.</p>
               <p>I had gathered a great many expressions of the Antients which I had thought to have inserted to shew their judgement: But perceiving it wholly needless because of the forementioned Evidence, I supersede that labour.</p>
               <p>And it seems not very necessary to mention the judgements of our reformed Divines, as expressed in any of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular sayings, when their publike Confessions and Practises are so satisfactory herein.</p>
               <p>I have recited many of their Testimonies before, and more that conduce to this end, I shall reserve to the following Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and therefore shall here add the fewer.</p>

               <p>Pag. 389 [1. <hi>In this case where the soul answers not to Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Engagements, Sacraments are but as outward shadows, and bare empty signs, and set out by the Spirit of God in Scripture with all their rites and Ceremonies (as other Ordinances of like nature) in the most low, despicable and undervaluing words that is possible. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism in the letter is no better with the Apostle than putting away the filth of the flesh; the clensing of the hands, the feet, or face, from dirt or filth, is the same with it: The Pharises washing of hands, yea their washing of Cups, Platters, (as low as it is laid by our Saviour) was as efficacious and as acceptable. Circumcision also when it led not to, but from Christ, is called by the Apostle by the name of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi> Phil. 3.2. <hi>Any gash made in the flesh, or rent in the garment, as well pleaseth.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Pag. 390. [<hi>Sacraments in this case are only aggravations of sin, and heightning of judgements. In case of Vncircumcision in time of the Law, and Non-baptism in these times, sins were no more than transgressions of the Law, but now they are breaches of Covenant. Then they would have been meerly rebellion against Soveraignty, but now they are Apostacy and Treachery.</hi>—]</p>
               <p>[4. <hi>When Conscience answers not to Sacramental Engagements, in participation of Sacraments, men subscribe to the equity of their own condemnation, and give assent to the sentence of death pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against them.</hi>] Read also his <hi>sect.</hi> 6. throughout, shewing how many sorts of men do forfeit their Covenant, and the mercies of it: And he concludes of them all [<hi>Pag.</hi> 404. <hi>These are the men

               <p>These and many the like passages of Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s do seem to me to militate against his own opinions (some of the former Directly, and the later Consequentially.) Yet do I not charge him with Self-contradiction; for its like he understandeth himself better than I do. But even from these last me thinks I have sufficient reason to demand, 1. Whether it be not a mans duty to forbear Baptism or the Lords supper, while he gets a fitter capacity, rather than <hi>by the claim of them</hi> to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe his own condemnation? or whether the necessary order of his duty be not first to believe and repent, and then to claim these ordinances? 2. Whether it be worth the while to write or preach to perswade men to offer such a service to God as doth but condemn themselves? and is no more acceptable to God than the Pharises washing cups, or than the cutting of their flesh, or the rent in the garment? 3. Seeing that saving faith is of another moral <hi>species</hi> than all other faith, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had without a supernatural work of the spirit, even a new creation; <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether it be not cruelty in me to comply with that mans desires that would have Baptism or the Lords Supper, without making a profession of saving faith, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any sign of it himself, and would engage himself to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve savingly the next minute, though he do not now, when I know before hand that he is most likely within one minute to break that engagement; and so within a minute, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he stir out of the room to become a perjured or treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous man, that hath plunged himself into deeper misery, and subscribed to the justness of his condemnation? Were it not more wisdom and mercy to stay (as was aforesaid) one hour longer, or a day, and try whether he will believe savingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, rather than engage him to do it the next hour, who doth not so much as pretend to any Ability to perform his own promise, nor can shew any promise from God that he will give him that Ability; either Absolute, or Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:107958:142"/>
to clear my self from some imputations of self-contradiction which Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> chargeth upon me; And I shall briefly try whether ever I pleaded his cause, or have put my weapons into his hand to defend it with.</p>
               <q>Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Charge of self-contradiction examined, and found groundless and abusive.</q>
               <p>The first pretended Self-contradiction which I observe (by intimation at least) charged on me by Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> is pag. 114. My words first cited defend a Conditional Covenant made to the non-Elect; and I say that this may be said to be sealed to some of them; that is, those that hypocritically professing true fath, claim and receive the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Well! And what have I said against this? Why this, [If men be taught once that it is a faith short of justifying and saving faith, which admitteth men to baptism, as having true right <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> it will make foul work in the Church.] But where the contradictions? Or what was it, I wonder, that occasioned the jealousie of it? He that cannot, or is resolved he will not see any difference, 1. between a Reprobates claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which he hath no proper right to claim, and a mans claiming that which he hath right to claim: 2. and between sealing to a meer conditional promise, where the condition is not performed, (and sealing to a conditional promise, where the condition is performed or professed so to be) as that there is an actual or absolute obligation on the Promiser. 3. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that sealing which is the end of the Sacrament, and that sealing which is notoriously deficient through the incapacity of the subject; contrary to the appointed end and use of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance: 4. And between the profession of a saving faith, and the profession of another kind of faith: I say he that can or will see no difference between these, no nor any two of these, let him account me and call me a self-contradicter, and spare not; And I shall answer him when I have nothing else to do.</p>
               <p>Another Confutation that I am supposed to give my self, is cited by him. p. 148. thus [No Minister can groundedly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:107958:143"/>
the Sacraments to any man but himself, because he can be certain of no mans justification, being not certain of the sincerity of their faith. And if he should adventure upon probabilities or charitable conjectures, then should he be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of profaning the Ordinance, and every time he mistaketh, he should set the Seal of God to a lye.] I confess there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of mine that can be so plausibly objected to me as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the present assertion, as these last words: but yet there is no just ground for that objection, if I be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. These words are plainly bent against their opinion that make Election or saving Grace to be the Title to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Church must judge of, and that not by the Profession of the Claimer, but as distrusting his word upon other evidences of Grace, as discoveries of the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Conversion, or the practise of those Duties wherein a stricter profession is manifested, or the like. The men that I oppose hold these Assertions. 1. We must give the Sacrament to none but the godly in sincerity. 2. We must not believe a mans Verbal Profession, though not contradicted. 3. But we must require the visible proofs of his godliness. 4. At least such as make it probable to us that he is godly. To these men I answer, 1. That it is false that we must give the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to none but the truly godly: though its true that none else should require them. 2. That we must give them to those that profess saving faith, though they have it not: For it is the Foundation of all humane Converse that we give credit to mens words, when we have no just cause to dis-credit them, especially in matters out of our reach and within theirs, such as are the secrets of their own hearts: We must therefore take their Profession, unless it be contradicted by such palpable Evidences as Nullifieth it or maketh it invalid. 3. That we have no other grounds to proceed on but this: and that on their grounds, they must profane Gods Ordinance every time they mistake in the judgement of Charity, and apply it to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men: But not so on ours, who must apply it to Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. And therefore they have no warrant to make any further scrutiny into the sincerity of a mans grace, as <hi>sine qua non</hi> to their administration of the Sacrament; seeing that a Verbal
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:107958:143"/>
profession not evidently contradicted and invalidated by words or life, is the means of discovery by which we must be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. But yet I never dreamed that we must not require pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession it self of saving faith, and that as a probable sign of the thing professed, but that we must look after another kind of faith.</p>
               <p>And if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> will not take up with bare profession of his dogmatical faith, he will oft profane the Ordinance too. For he knoweth not when it is in sincerity in any man. And we know by their Ignorance that multitudes are without it.</p>

But if you be brought to my opinion, this Resolution will be changed. 2. Are you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved never to baptize more on the grounds that the Church of Christ hath alwayes baptized on? 3. I here propound to you and the world the Reasons of my opinion. And then I shall leave to the judgement of wiser men then my self whether your rejection of this opinion be a greater disgrace to <hi>it</hi> or to <hi>you.</hi> 4. What if you cannot know the Parents justifying faith? Will it follow that you may not know a <hi>Profession</hi> of it? 5. You would do the world a curtesie to tell them, by what means you are more certain of the sincerity of a Dogmatical Faith, than we can be of a Justifying Faith? Or will you upon consideration
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:107958:144"/>
resolve yet never to baptize any more, not administer the Lords Supper, because you can never be certain that your Receivers have a Dogmatical Faith?</p>
               <p>The next place where I am cited against my self, is <hi>pag.</hi> 150. because I speak of Saints that shall not be saved. <hi>Answ.</hi> And so I do still. But yet I still say that <hi>Analogum per se positum stat pro famosiore significato.</hi> And therefore the words [<hi>Saints, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> &amp;c.] must ordinarily be understood of such as are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, where there is no limitation, or special reason to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>The next place where I observe my self cited against my self, is, <hi>p.</hi> 158. Because I maintain that it is an Error in Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> to say [<hi>That the Covenant whereof baptism is the Seal, is only the the absolute covenant, made only to the Elect</hi>: Therefore Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> infers [<hi>And if men in the state of nature be in that covenant that baptism sealeth,</hi> viz. <hi>the conditional Covenant; then men in the state of nature and short of justifying faith, have right to baptism.</hi>] To which I reply; 1. I have shewed you at large how far men unsanctified are or are not in covenant with God; and in what sense they have or have not right to baptism: And yet must we still use the undistinguished terms, as if I simply denyed without distinction? Yea, before you confess that you tell it abroad in your discourse, that I say none have right to baptism but they that have saving faith, and that <hi>you can hardly gain credit to your words.</hi> The way to gain credit were to speak truer, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in your discourse of other men behind their backs. A Right by any promise or mortal grant from God to them, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: but I affirmed Hypocrites to be the rightfull objects of the Ministers Act, or that we may lawfully give it them, and that thus far they have such an (improper) right. And yet still you would make me believe that I simply deny them right. 2. Your Consequence here is wholly groundless. It is one thing to say as I do [<hi>That the conditional covenant is made to the non-Elect</hi>] And another thing to say as you term it [<hi>that they are in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>] For that word is very ambiguous. If your consequence be good from my Assertion, then you may as well prove that Turks, Jews, and Heathen may have the Sacraments given
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:107958:144"/>
them. For I affirm that the conditional Covenant is made to them. 3. The thing that I maintain against Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> is,<note place="margin">I have in my <hi>Apology</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> thus to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand me.</note> that the Sacrament sealeth not only the absolute Promise to the Elect; but the conditional Promise; and this in two sorts; 1. To true Believers who perform the condition, God sealeth effectually obliging himself <hi>Actually</hi> and confirming their faith. 2. The same conditional promise he sealeth to intruding Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, but not so as to oblige himself to them, but condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally still as the promise it self doth: Because the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal promise giveth not actual right, or enduceth not on the Promiser an actual obligation till the condition be performed; which is with true believers and no others. I desire both Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> and you to know my meaning when I so plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it, before you trouble your selves and others in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting it.</p>
               <p>Another supposed Contradiction is <hi>pag.</hi> 159. recited. He ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued [<hi>That faith on which</hi> Simon Magus <hi>was baptized, is that which admitteth to Baptism. But</hi> Simons <hi>faith fell short of saving and justifying.</hi>] To this Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th I give a sudden answer, <hi>viz. [concedo totum, sed de sideratur conclusio</hi>] And he adds [<hi>He is certainly much to seek both in syllogism and common reason, that could not infer, and could not know that I left the Reader to infer that [therefore; A Faith that is short of justifying entitles to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism] and so I have the whole in question yielded, and that which was once said would make foul work in the Church if granted</hi>] To this I reply. 1. I shall not presume to say that you are much to seek either in Syllogism or common reason. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut I think it meet to say that I pity the world, and especially hasty inconsiderate Readers that must be troubled and abused by their writtings that understand not what they speak to. I pray peruse your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment again, and see whether any more will follow than this [<hi>Therefore a faith short of saving or justifying admitteth to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</hi>] And this I granted, taking <hi>Simons</hi> faith to be an assent conjunct with a profession of saving faith (as most Interpreters do that I have seen; expounding [<hi>he believed</hi>] by [<hi>be profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to believe,</hi> and <hi>had some conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ction.</hi>]) But was the word [<hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled</hi>] in your Argument? And might I not well say <hi>desidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur conclusio</hi>? The question which you would have conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:107958:145"/>
was that which now you conclude [<hi>It entitleth to Baptism</hi>] And then there is more in your Conclusion than in your Premisses. <hi>Admitting</hi> is not <hi>Entitling.</hi> I granted you oft before that we may <hi>Admit</hi> an Hypocrite (yea a stark Infidel) if professing true faith, he require the Sacrament: But I denyed that in strict or proper sense they had <hi>Title</hi> to it, or might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it. I may justly and necessarily give, if required, what another unjustly requireth; yet upon this gross oversight of my obvious sense, Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> goes away as with a full concession of his Cause: And no doubt in some mens eyes hath carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>His two Arguments against me from my own words, <hi>p.</hi> 166. I have answered before.</p>
               <p>The next touch of this nature I find <hi>pag.</hi> 167. [<hi>Profession be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good step in the way to sincerity, which a man would think Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>would not dislike, who so far speaks the mind of Christ towards men, that if they will come but only to a visible Profession, he will not deny them admittance there, because they intend to go no further, but will let them come as near as they will.</hi>] Repl. And so I confidently say still: And what's this to your Cause at all?</p>
               <p>The next that I observe are cited, <hi>pag.</hi> 184. and 186. In the latter, 188. he reciteth a passage of mine in the Saints Rest, where I say that [<hi>the meer sober-professing to repent and believe in Christ, is a sufficient Evidence of their Interest to Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> (coram Ecclesiâ) <hi>and admittance thereto by Baptism.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Upon which Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> assumeth [<hi>What have I spoke more than here is said? and did I ever speak with more and higher Confidence? I say, that a faith which is short of justifying gives title to Baptism:] And he saith, [such gives sufficient Interest to Church-membership, and consequently admittance to Baptism.</hi>] Repl. I must needs say, that it is to be lamented that Passion or Inconsiderateness should carry you to such evident untruths. Did ever I say that [<hi>such</hi>] a faith gives evidence? Did I there once mention <hi>such</hi> a faith? Did I not expresly say, [<hi>A sober Professing to repent and believe in Christ.</hi>] And did you not set these words before your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders eyes? And yet will you in the next words perswade him that I talk of <hi>a faith short of justifying?</hi> Did you think men would
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:107958:145"/>
take no heed what they read? It is the <hi>Profession of true faith and Repentance</hi> that I spake of, and not your faith that is short of it, which came not into my thoughts. This dealing is not like to edifie; though with some it may be effectual to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead.</p>
               <p>Yet upon this abuse you ground a triumph, adding [<hi>So that if my doctrine herein be loose, the Reader will hardly find his to be fast: and it hears not well to play fast and loose.</hi>] It was loose ground that these words were built on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 184. Another Confutation of my self is thus expressed, [<hi>I desire Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>to tell us how he hath mended the matter, and provided for the honor and lustre of the Christian Name, or made up at all, the gap of which he speaks. He sayes the Church is bound to baptize as largely, as I say men have Right to Baptism.</hi>] Repl. Dear Brother, it is not well that your pages should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain so many such untruths. I would we had never medled with controversie, if it cannot be managed without such guilt. You say that a <hi>Dogmatical faith entitles to Baptism.</hi> I say we ought not to Baptize men without the <hi>Profession of a saving faith.</hi> Is this the same with yours, or as large? Is it all one to baptize them that will profess that they are willing to have Christ as he is offered in the Gospel, and them that will profess no such wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness at all? Why do you expect that your Readers should believe your so frequent and evident mis-reports? Your next words also are untrue, that I [<hi>refuse none that you receive</hi>] if you did practise according to your doctrine; and that where [<hi>you say they have Right, I say we are bound to baptize them without Right.</hi>] A double untruth. First, It is not the same persons that we speak of. Secondly, I distinguished of Right, and told you, that if you will call that <hi>Right</hi> to another, which results from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to me to baptize him if he demand it, such Right he hath. You next add [<hi>How will this make Christianity look with any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter face? how much will</hi> Worcester-shire <hi>Congregations where this is received exceed other Congregations where unanimously it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed?</hi>] Repl. Divers of your flings at the <hi>Worcester-shire</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations might have been spared, without the least dishonor to your prudence, justice, charity, or piety. If you have a mind to be the Accuser of any Churches of Christ, you should descend
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:107958:146"/>
to particulars, and deal with such people and in such cases that you know, and not print untruths of such Congregations, which the Countrey knoweth to be such, as you have done, <hi>pag.</hi> 142, 143. upon the credit of your false reporters. If I have deserved such dealing from you the Christian Assemblies of <hi>Worcestershire</hi> have not. Restrain your indignation to me, and abuse not your Brethren that meddle not with you.</p>
               <p>And what is it that is denyed unanimously by other Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations? Surely not the necessity of professing a faith thats more than Dogmatical; at least I know no such Congregations, and I hope I shall never know such; For all your frequent and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent intimations that yours is the common opinion of Divines, and mine is singular: If paper could blush, abundance of such passages would confute themselves, and prevent the delusion of your credulous reader, who will believe you to save the labor of a tryal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 185. The words of mine that are cited as against my self are these [<hi>Vocation which is effectual only to bring men to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profession of faith, is larger then Election, and makes men such whom we are bound to baptize.</hi>] true: How unhappy am I, that must contradict my opinion in the very words which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it! But still will you perswade men, that an outward profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of true saving faith is all one with another kind of faith (no man I think knows what) which you are busily promoting to be the Title to Sacraments?</p>
               <p>I shall not stand to search Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s book for more of my self-contradictions, or trouble the Reader with a further vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: For in thus much he may see the face of the rest, and discern the judiciousness and equity of the Charge.</p>
               <p>But as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> dealeth by me, so doth he by the Authors whom he alledgeth for his opinions, as <hi>pag.</hi> 152.153, 154, 155. and elswhere: He sticks not to cite them as owning his cause, who in the very words recited by him, do condemn it. For in those words they make the Church as visible to consist of profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors as distinct from true believers, and know no members but true Christians and Hypocrites (who therefore pretend to that Faith which they have not: or else how are they Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites?) And whats this to Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s new visible members
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:107958:146"/>
that profess only some other kind of faith? or how will this warrant his new kind of Baptism, which must be administred upon the Profession of another sort of Faith?</p>
               <p>The Lord illuminate us, and pardon all the wrong we have done to his Church and Truth, through our darkness and self-conceitedness.</p>

The third Disputation. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Infants of Notoriously un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Baptized Parents have Right to be Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Question is of the greater moment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause about Matter of Practice, and that in a Point wherein the Honor of God on one side, and the Rights of mens Souls on the other, are so much concerned. It suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth first, that Baptism is <hi>Gods Ordinance,</hi> of continued Use, and that some are to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. Secondly, that it is a <hi>Benefit,</hi> or else we could not, in the sense now used, be said to have <hi>Right</hi> to it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It supposeth that some <hi>Infants</hi> have Right to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. This Question therefore is not to be disputed with the Anabaptists, who deny the presupposed. And they that are so indifferent in the former, as to take it for an inconsiderable matter. Whether Infants be baptized, or not, must needs judge this Question of the Infants of the Ungodly, to be much more inconsiderable. Fourthly, Yet doth it not suppose that the Infants of <hi>any</hi> ungodly persons have this Right, as if it were <hi>only</hi> the Right of <hi>Notorious</hi> ones that were disputable: but the word [<hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious</hi>] is added to limit our present Dispute to that sort, for several Reasons; at this time passing by the other, but not taking it for granted. Fifthly, Nor doth the Addition of the term [<hi>Baptized</hi>] to [<hi>Parents</hi>] take it for granted that no children of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:107958:149"/>
unbaptized Parents have such Right; But it limits the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to that sort only, as fitter in several respects for our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
            <p>For the explication of the terms; 1. By Infant we mean Children not yet come to the use of Reason; so that as they are not <hi>sui Juris,</hi> but at anothers dispose; so they are unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable naturally in any Contract to dispose of themselves, being unfit to give consent, through a natural defect of that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which is pre-requisite. By [<hi>a natural Defect</hi>] I mean of nature in it self considered, and not as corrupted by sin, nor as neglected sinfully by our selves or others. So that I see not but that <hi>Ideots</hi> are in the same condition as Infant children. But of that let every one think as they see cause. In Law <hi>homo primae aetatis</hi> is an Infant, even after he can speak; though as to the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologie he be called an Infant, <hi>quia fari nescit,</hi> i. e. <hi>loqui non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, ut</hi> Isidor. <hi>lib.</hi> 11.2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By Parents we mean principally Natural Parents, those who begat those Infants; but secondarily also (as I suppose) those that have Adopted them, or bought them, or received them as given or delivered to them, so that they any way become <hi>Their Own,</hi> and they have the dispose of them, and are enabled to enter them into Covenant, so as to oblige them on the highest terms; Though I know it is not properly that these are called Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; The word [<hi>Parent</hi>] is primarily applicable to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only, as not being <hi>à Parendo,</hi> but <hi>à Pariendo,</hi> and thence to the Father also, because of the Relation between <hi>Gigno &amp; Pario</hi>; and so <gap reason="foreign">

But it is only the immediate Parents that we here mean; though <hi>Festus</hi> saith, that <hi>Juris prudentes avos &amp; proavos, avias &amp; proavias parentum nomine appellari dicunt.</hi> And though the word <hi>Parens</hi> be sometime taken <hi>pro Consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo:</hi> And <hi>Hierom</hi> saith <hi>advers.

He that doth thus, is a <hi>Godly man,</hi> that is, a man that doth sincerely believe in God, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and is devoted to God.</p>
            <p>Besides this principal sense, there are some others common, both in the defect, and in the excess; 1. Among Heathens he is called <hi>Pious,</hi> 1. who is a devout honourer of their Gods, though Idols; 2. or who is merciful to people in misery; 3. or who is an Honourer of Parents and Superiors, or who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious according to their insufficient light. 2. Among
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:107958:150"/>
Christians, 1. Some call any man <hi>Godly,</hi> that is, zealous in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious matters, though so unsound in the fundamentals, that he worshippeth he knows not what, or so ignorant about Gods very nature and his relations to him, that it is not God indeed as God that he worshippeth: and though he be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally incapable of true Love and Devotedness to God, for want of right conceivings of him, even in those respects that are es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to the Object of the Christian faith. 2. Some call a man Godly that makes a sound Confession, and knows the Christian Doctrine, and saith he believeth it, though he notoriously ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that his Will doth not consent, that the God whom he confesseth shall be his God, (his Ruler and Felicity,) nor the Christ whom he confesseth, shall be his Saviour on his own terms; nor the Holy Ghost his Guide and Sanctifier. 3. On the other side, Many will call no Man <hi>Godly,</hi> that is not noted for some eminent difference, in Parts and Zeal, from others that live about him. If they see him neglect some Duties that he is bound to, as not to come to some private Meetings that are used regularly and to Edification, or not to Read, or Hear so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently or diligently as he should, or not to Pray in his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (which in some Cases its possible a Godly man may neglect), or if he commit some sins, which yet its possible a Godly man may commit, they account him ungodly, though possibly it may be otherwise in the main<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that no man is by them esteemed Godly, unless he go beyond the weakest sort of true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. As for them that call none Godly but their own parties, or sect-fellows, I will pass them, as not worthy our further mention.</p>
            <p>Among all these senses, it is the first in which we here take the word [<hi>Godly</hi>] so that it is only <hi>Christian Godliness</hi> that we mean, which is a sincere believing in God, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, even with true intellectual Assent, and hearty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: from which heart-Godliness, there follows that sincere Obedience to the will of God (to first and second Table) which is the proper fruit of it: and Repentance after disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence known. It is therefore such a Godliness as is proper to them that have the promise of Justification and Salvation that we mean, comprehending Repentance towards God, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:107958:150"/>
Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ. Of the contrary to this only is the Question.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By (<hi>Notoriously)</hi> ungodly, we mean such as do evidently manifest their ungodly hearts, 1. either by verbal professing it; 2. or by their rebellious ungodly lives, that they leave to those that converse with them, no just &amp; reasonable ground to judge them in probability to be Godly, but are certainly known by those that live about them, yea, by the Church (if they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of any particular Church,) who have an ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent ability to discern, to be ungodly persons, that is, not to believe in God as aforesaid, but to be indeed contemners of God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as all are that are not Godly, though not all in a like degree. They that are <hi>notoriously</hi> known to be thus ungodly, or unholy, or unbelievers, are those here intended.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By (<hi>Baptized</hi>) Parents, we mean only such as have had the external sign joyned to a Profession of the Christian faith, and Dedication to God; and so have covenanted <hi>ore tenus</hi> with God by themselves, or parents: and not those that have been sincerely Dedicated to him, and so have God re-engaged unto them: For it is a contradiction for to call such at the time of such Devotedness [<hi>notoriously ungodly</hi>:] and to say that they fall from it, is contrary to the judgement of those whom we now deal with, and therefore not to be expected. Some do so define Baptism, as to make it essentially to be Gods actual seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exhibiting, of an actual pardon to the person baptized. But we take it not thus: We speak only of those that have so formla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y performed and received the externals of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as that the Church doth justly take them for her baptized Members, though yet they werr not truly united to Christ, nor was God ever actually reconciled to them, as his People.</p>
            <p>So much for the Subject: For the predicate, we must first explain the term <hi>Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning which, I must refer you mostly to what I have said to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> pag. 5 SECT. 39. more fully than here I may stay to express my self.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the properest sense, <hi>Right</hi> respecteth some <hi>Good</hi> which
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:107958:151"/>
we have <hi>Right</hi> to; and that Good is the matter of some Gift, or other civil Action, which may confer <hi>Right:</hi> so that a man may afterwards claim it as his own, or the Use or Profession of it as his Due, according to the Nature of the thing, and of the Grant. 2. In a more diminute and less proper sense, a man is said to have <hi>Right</hi> which is accidentially in his Profession, without his unjust Usurpation, though he know not whether he shall keep it a moment, nor hath any civil right given him thereto. 3. In a sense yet less proper, a man may be said to have Right to that Action, which it is another mans Duty to perform to him, or that Good which another man is bound to do to or for him, though properly he have no Title to it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. 4. In a sense, though proper, <hi>quoad relationis fundamentum,</hi> yet Catachrestical as to the Denomination of the thing; a man is said to have right to an Evil: as to that punishment which according to Law and Justice in his Due, or which he is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to bear.</p>
            <p>According to the first of these senses, every man hath a <hi>Right</hi> to or in Gods Benefits, to whom he hath <hi>Given</hi> them by any Promise, Covenant, Grant, or other Moral act; which may be the Foundation of Right, called a <hi>Title.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to the second sense, all those have <hi>Right</hi> to Gods blessing that have them in <hi>Possession,</hi> through a meer natural col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Providence, without their sinful seizure. As if you see a man by the way lie naked, and cast your cloak over him, and say nothing to him: Though you may take it away again at your pleasure, and assure him not of the use of it for a moment, yet he hath right to possess it while you permit him. Thus every Pagan hath Right to his Life and Time, and Food and Raiment, while God doth providentially vouchsafe them to him.</p>
            <p>According to the third sense, All those have a Right to Gods mercies, to whom we are bound as Instruments to conser them, though it be but by accident that we are so obilged, and though God be in no Covenant-engagement to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, nor give them any proper right or claim to the thing: So if God bid me <hi>Give to him that needeth:</hi> and because I know not all that need, he bids me judge upon probable appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Hereupon if a rich man go in rags and pretend necessity,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:107958:151"/>
it is my Duty to give to him; and so far this Rich man hath a Right to my Alms, as that he is a rightfull Object of it, as to the righteousness of my action. So if God bid me <hi>forgive him that wrongeth me, if he Repent</hi>: and then direct me to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he repent by the Evidences (there being no other way:) and these Evidences being only probable, and not demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stive: here it is my duty to forgive him that repenteth not, if he seem to repent, and so he may have such an improper right to my forgiveness. So if a Heathen seem to be a true Christian, and yet dissemble, I am bound to use him as a Christian; and and so far he may improperly be said to have right to any Christian Ordinance, which I am bound to dispense to him, If he claims this Ordinance of me, he sins against God, and requireth that which properly, and before God, he hath no right to, and which he ought not to claim: but yet he clams nothing but what I am bound to give him upon such a claim. You may see then that here may be three distinct questions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this three-fold sense [of Right] For the fourth I will pass, as not concerning our present business.) 1. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such subjects have any Right to Baptism by any gift or grant of God to themselves!</hi> 2. <hi>Whether they have right from Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence putting them into possession of it.</hi> 3. <hi>Whether it be a Ministers duty to baptize them</hi>? And I think it necessary to handle all these, or at least the first and last distinctly, because that one dependeth on the other, and we know not which is ordinarily meant when this question is put. Only to the Explication of the last term, we must speak a word: <hi>viz.</hi> what is meant by that <hi>Baptism,</hi> the Right whereto we are now enquiring after? It is one question whether they have Right to the thing signified, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ and his Benefits; the pardon of sin, and Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is another question, whether they have Right to the bare sign, and the consequential Priviledges with the Church, arising from their reputing such a man to be a true Christian. And another question, whether they have Right to <hi>Both</hi> these? Also it is one thing to ask, Whether men have right to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their own part in Baptism, in part? or in whole? And another, Whether they have right to Gods part? We make no question but every man hath liberty given him to do
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:107958:152"/>
his own part entirely, yea it is his Duty: And so every Infidel is bound to bring his child to Baptism; that is, To cease his Infidelity, and to Dedicate himself and child to Christ, and seal it with being Baptized. But this is nothing to prove that he hath Right to Gods part in Baptism, that is, either to the Washing as Gods seal and sign; or to the cleansing signified, and other Benefits conveyed by it. 2. Nor is it any thing to prove that he hath a Liberty to do the latter and external part of his own duty, without the internal and former precedent; that is, to be baptized before he consent to the terms of the Covenant. As a man that is bound to consent in mind to any thing, and promise with the mouth, yet may not promise before he consent; that is, Dissemble or Lye.</p>
            <p>I shall now briefly determine the Question as to each of the three forementioned sorts of right distinctly: And as to the first I take the Question to lie thus (supposing it only the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Baptism thats meant.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether the Infant Children, especially natural, of men exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally baptized, but now notoriously ungodly, have by any Gift of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Grant from God, a right to external Baptism?</hi> Which I determine Negatively; They have no such right.</p>
            <p>And herein the justest order, it belongeth to the Affirmer to prove such a right. He that brings his claim, must shew his Title. No more therefore can be required of me but this Argument.</p>
            <p>If such Infants can shew no good Title to such Baptism, (nor any for them) then have they no Right to it. But they can shew no good Title. <hi>Ergo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is undeniable; for <hi>Titulus est fundamentum Juris.</hi> For the <hi>Minor</hi> I argue thus: If they can shew any good Title, it is either some grant of God written in his word, or seeme not written. But neither written, nor not written: therefore none at all.</p>
            <p>Those sober persons that we have to do with, will not plead an unwritten grant. If any do so, they must make it evident to a Minister, before he can take it for currant.</p>
            <p>If there be any written grant, let them shew it; for we know of none.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:107958:152"/>But yet we shall attempt the proof of the Negative, and then examine the Arguments which are usually brought for the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative.</p>
            <p>If the Children of such Parents have such Right to Baptism, it is either for their own sake (<hi>i.e.</hi> some Title or ground in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.) 2. or for their immediate parents, 3. or their Ancestors, 4. or some Undertakers, 5. or the Church. These five grounds are pleaded by some: And though our Question directly speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only of the second; and therefore if any of the rest be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it nothing makes against our Negative determination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we take it <hi>Reduplicativè</hi> (of the children of such Parents <hi>as theirs</hi>:) yet we judge it most usefull to our main end, that we touch upon each of these several Claims.</p>
            <p>And 1. If the Infants of such Parents have any such Right from any thing in themselves, it is either from somewhat proper to themselves and some others such as they, or somewhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Infants: But neither of these; <hi>Ergo</hi> — 1. For the first Member, I know nothing said but this: [<hi>Possibly they may have some seed of Grace in them, we know not the contrary.</hi>] Answ. 1. As to us, its all one, <hi>non esse, &amp; non apparere</hi>: we must have some Evidence of such a seed of Grace, or else we cannot discern it. 2. Else we must baptize the children of all or any Heathen or Infidel; because for ought we know, they may have some seed of Grace.</p>
            <p>For the second Member, it is thus argued by some: <hi>God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth nothing but Consent on our parts, to our enterance into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, seeing it is a Covenant of free Grace: but all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants must by us be supposed to Consent: therefore all must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have Right to Baptism.</hi>] The <hi>Major</hi> we grant. The <hi>Minor</hi> they would thus prove: <hi>It is a Rule in the Civil Law, That it is supp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sed that a man will be willing of his own Good</hi>; And another Rule there is, <hi>That the Law supposeth a man to be what he ought to be, till the contrary appear; therefore Infants, who make not the contrary appear, are by us to be judged virtual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters or Accepters of the Covenant; and consequently to be Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized.</hi> Answ. These Rules may hold in dealings between man and man, about such things as Nature may both discern to be Good, and desire; but they cannot hold in the Case in hand;
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:107958:153"/>
1. Because Nature cannot sufficiently <hi>discern</hi> the Desirableness of the Blessings of the Covenant, compared with those things that must be renounced. 2. Nor can it truly <hi>desire</hi> them without Grace. 3. And the common Experience of the world telleth us, that the most of men, by far, do not truly consent, when they hear the terms of the Covenant. This therefore may not be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed: For Natures Inclination to our own Good, is no suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground of the supposition: Nor yet any Obligation that can lie on us to charitable thoughts of Infant's Inclinations. For it is one of the Principles of our Religion, that Nature is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, as that every man is the great Enemy of himself conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially, as being inclined to the way of his own ruine; till Christ the Physitian of Nature do work a Cure. 4. And if this Argument would hold, it would prove that all the Infants of the world have right to Baptism; which is not to be supposed. 5. Yea it wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d prove that they have equal right with Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which is yet more evidently false. 6. Infants in such Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants are reputed to be as their Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nt, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>huse for them that cannot chuse for themselves. If therefore the Parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent not, it is supposed that the Child consen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s not; and no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent can truly consent for his childe that re useth for himself. 7. The Covenant hath not only benefits on Gods part to be conferred, but also duties on our part required; and it cannot be supposed that all will faithfully perform such duties. So much for the first pretended Title.</p>
            <p>The second pretended Title of such Infants to Baptism, is upon the account of the Interest of their immediate Parents; and because this is both the proper subject of our question, and also the great difficuly, and most insisted on, I shall say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more to it: And I prove the Negative thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If notoriously ungodly Parents have no right themselves to the Benefits of the Covenant, nor to be Baptized if it were now to do: then cannot their children have a right upon the account of any interest of theirs. But the Antecedent is true: Therefore the validity of the consequence is evident; in that no man can give that he hath none to give, nor can we derive any Interest from him that hath none himself. If any say, he may have an Interest for his child that hath none for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:107958:153"/>
I Reply. 1. Then the childe hath not his interest in and with the Parent, nor as reputed a member of him. 2. That Interest must be produced and proved. I have not yet heard what it should be save what the next Objection intimates.</p>
            <p>Why then may not the same be said of an Infidel, that he may have a right for his child, though none for himself? It is objected, that being himself baptized, he once had right to Church-membership for himself and his child; and though he hath lost this by Apostacy himself, yet there is no reason why his child should be a loser by his fall. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this objection the children of all Infidels, Jews, Turks, and Heathens should have right for their Parents sake, supposing those Parents to have been once baptized, and now to be Apostates. 2. But those children were either born <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> their Parents Apostacy, or <hi>after.</hi> If before, then I grant the Parent loseth not the childs right by Apostacy, because that right was fixed upon the child himself, upon the account of the Parents interest. And we may suppose him baptized thereupon, and so there is no cause for a doubt: For as the case is rare for a man that before was rightfully a Church-member to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, to Apostatize between the Birth and Baptism; so I will purposely shun that Controversie, Whether the child by such Apostacy loseth his right, or whether a Baptized Infant be supposed excommunicate in the Fathers excommunication? For my part, I affirm no such thing: But if the child be born after the Parents Apostacy from faith or a godly life, then no man can say the childe loseth any right by the Parents sin; for how can he los<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that which he never had. If you say the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent had it for himself and his child; I answer, true, had he been sincere on supposition he had children; but not for those children he had not, though if he continue in the faith till he have them, he then hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hose Priviledges for himself and them; they can be no subjects of right that had no existence; I grant he may have a grant of such right to him and his seed, as a Prince may grant to a faithful subject to him and to his heirs: But 1. This is on supposition that he will have heirs. 2. That he forfei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his right before he hath heirs: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise as he apparen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th it to himself, so doth he to them:
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:107958:154"/>
if he make an intercision, he stops the conveyance of the benefit by a prevention, so that it never comes to the Heir: But because it is the antecedent that requires all the proof [that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously ungodly Parents have no Interest themselves to be Church-members, and to be baptized, if it were to be done again] I shall prove it as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Argu.</hi> They that have not that faith which is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant, and notoriously shew that they have it not, have no right to Baptism. But such are all they who are notoriously ungodly. <hi>Ergo.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Or they that notoriously manifest that they consent not to the terms of the Covenant, have no right to Baptism. But, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved hence. 1. What else is there to hinder any Heathen from the like Right? 2. Because that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Profession of such a further consent is necessary to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie baptizing of them. 3. Because mutual consent is necessary to a mutual Covenant; and the Covenant must be mutual: no man hath right to Gods part that refuseth his own. This is all so far past question, that I pass it over the more lightly. All the doubt then is of the <hi>Minor,</hi> [Whether no man have the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary condition of the baptismal Covenant on Gods part that is notoriously ungodly] or [Whether all such ungodly men do notoriously manifest that they consent not to the terms of the Covenant] I speak not here of any subsequent condition which God imposeth upon the Covenanter only for the future; but only of the condition which God imposeth upon us that he may be in Covenant with us, and that it may be a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and that this is a true inconsistent with notorious ungodliness, I was going about at large to prove it; But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I have done it already in 26. Arguments, against Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s, and therefore I think it better for you &amp; me that I refer you thither, than to write them here over again, or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly to add any more to the same purpose: If any say that though God require as a <hi>duty</hi> such a Faith as is inonsistent with notorious ungodliness, yet not as <hi>Absolutely necessary</hi> that he may be engaged to us in Covenant, or that we may have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per right to Baptism; I answer, God hath but one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

of Grace which Baptism sealeth; our sound believing is the condition of that one Covenant; that is, that it may be a Mutual Actual Covenant: If then there be any other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant having other Conditions, we must wait till both Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Conditions be made known. Were it worth the while, or a thing necessary, I would stand to prove the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no Covenant sealed by Baptism which only promiseth Baptism as the Benefit, or any other meer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals; but that the Covenant which Baptism sealeth is only that which promiseth Remission, Salvation, and outward Mercies as appurtenances and means so far as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>

               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. They that have no right to Remission of sin, have no right given them by God to Baptism; but the Notoriously Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly have no right to remission of sin. <hi>Ergo.</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Minor</hi> will not be denied. The <hi>Major</hi> is proved thus: God hath appointed no Baptism as his gift, but what is for remission of sin, as the thing sealed and exhibited by it. Therefore, They that have no right to Remission, have no right to Baptism. The Antecedent is undoubted; The Consequent is grounded on this truth, that God hath made no Covenant to any man of the bare seals without the thing signified: shew such a Promise if you affirm it. 2. What God hath joyned so nearly as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting sign and thing exhibited no man may lawfully put asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Its a mans sin to take the sign without the thing signified. It is not probable therefore that God hath made any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the naked sign without the thing signified: If God give right to such an ungodly man to be baptized, then he gives him right to be Baptized for Remission of sin (for this is his express and affixed Use and signification,) but he doth not give him right to be Baptized for the Remission of sin. <hi>Ergo.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove thus. If he give him Right to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized for the Remission of sin, then either for actual Remission (to be sealed by Baptism) or for Conditional future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; but for neither of these. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not for Actual Remission; for then Notoriously Ungodly persons are Actually remitted; which is not true: Nor for

               </gap>onal; for then no more is given then all the World hath (at least that hear the Gospel) even persecuting Infidels; and then all they may as well be baptized; for God pardoneth all upon condition they repent and believe.</p>

               <hi>Argu.</hi> 3. If God be not at all actually obliged in Covenant to any notorious ungodly man, then is he not obliged to give him Baptism. But God is not obliged so to him. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is unquestionable; The <hi>Major</hi> is granted by most of our Divines, who make the contrary Doctrine <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> that God should be obliged to man in the state of Nature, in such a Covenant: If God be obliged to give them Baptism, then if he should not give it them, he breaks Promise with them; But the Consequence is unsound; <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. Nor doth he give them power to claim it from the Church-Officers; for they can shew no Title.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. If God have given a Covenant-Right to a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ungodly man to be baptized, then either to baptism only, or other blessings with it; but neither of these, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. The first will not be affirmed: What then be the other blessings? Either they are <hi>special</hi> and <hi>spiritual,</hi> but that's not defended; or <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>common,</hi> which is like is meant; for they call it an outward Covenant.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as God hath given outward things but conditionally to Believers; so there is no such Covenant of outward mercies alone that can be shewed in the word which is now in force to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. According to the definition of most of our Divines, the outward washing alone without inward Grace, is not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism: Therefore if God give them right to the washing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Grace, he gives them not right to Baptism: but this is but <hi>ad hominem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do but superficially touch these things. 1. Because (as I said) the Arguments to Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> are full. 2. Because I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that all this is granted with those Divines with whom I have debated this point, and that they confess that none but sound Believers have engaged God in actual Covenant to them, but only in the common conditional Covenant, and consequently it is not by Covenant grant that the notoriously ungodly have
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:107958:155"/>
right to Baptism, but by other waies which we are next to speak to. I am informed that this is all granted; but then I must add, that they yield that such men have no true proper right at all: for such proper right is of the nature of the <hi>debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> the dueness of the Benefit. So that a man may thence lay claim to it as his due. And the right (between God and Man) we receive only by Gods moral Gift, which is by some promise or grant by his word or revelation of his Will <hi>de debito habendi;</hi> for this dueness or right is a moral thing, and must come by his moral act, such as among men we call political or civil.</p>
            <p>But mark how the other two sorts of right differ from this: That which follows Gods Physical disposal by Providence, gives a man no proper right of dueness, but only makes it <hi>non injustum,</hi> and I think not prope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l positively <hi>justum,</hi> that he should possess it: as if I see a man ready to dye for cold, and cast a garment on him: only these two things follow; first that is is <hi>not unjust</hi> for him to possess it; 2. That it <hi>is unjust</hi> for any other to deprive him of it; but this is no <hi>dueness</hi>: or if he have any proper right, it is after the <hi>possession,</hi> and not before.</p>
            <p>And then the third sort of right which ariseth from a precept to others concerning the manner of their duty, is properly no right, as not giving a due or title to the Benefit, but only it makes my act of application to be <hi>just,</hi> and him to be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a <hi>just Act</hi>; not <hi>just</hi> because of his <hi>Title,</hi> from a gift of God; but from a <hi>precept</hi> to me: so that as the three Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments differ, <hi>Gift</hi> or <hi>Covenant, Natural disposal,</hi> and <hi>Precept,</hi> so do these three sorts of right differ: the first only being <hi>debitum,</hi> the second <hi>non injustum,</hi> the third <hi>justum</hi>: and the Subject of the third is but <hi>my act</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not the <hi>person</hi> who is the Object. It is <hi>just</hi> that I obey God, and so do such an Act on him.</p>
            <p>Having said thus much for preparation, I shall anon speak more particularly to the two later sorts of right: but first we shall touch briefly the third pretended title, which some insist on, of such Infants proper right to baptism.</p>
            <p>The third was upon the account of their Ancestors true faith, though the immediate Parents weee notoriously ungodly
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:107958:156"/>
They that plead this title, will not prove it good: 2. I thus disprove it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrum.</hi> 1. If the Promise to the faithfull and their Seed to many generations, doth necessarily suppose an uninterrupted suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of faithful Progenitors of that seed, then that promise gives no right to the Infants of notoriously ungodly Parents. But the Antecedent is true: therefore so is the Consequent. The Consequent I suppose to be manifested before: the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent I prove by these following Arguments: 1. If the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise suppose not an uninterrupted succession of faithful Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors, then by virtue of the Promise to <hi>Noah</hi> all the world have Right to baptism. But the Consequent is false: therefore so is the Antecedent. If they urge the words of the second Commandment, it is certain that it is not a thousand genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions since <hi>Noah.</hi> This Question is commonly put to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in this case, [Where shall we stop, and on what grounds shall we stop, if it extend not to all the world?] and they answer variously: One reverend Brother, Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> on the Covenant, <hi>pag.</hi> 140. saith [<hi>He knows few that say the Predecessor gives right without the immediate Parent. But all concur in a joint way to communicate a Covenant Interest.</hi>] This yields the necessity of a non-intercision. Others say, first out of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Ames,</hi> [<hi>Vbi non prorsus interciditur Christianismi professio, &amp; ubi praesumuntur esse Christiani.</hi>] to which I answer; If it be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christianity properly so called, then the right may come by the immediate parent, and there is no intercision. But if it be in a profession equivocally so called, that is, such as is not a probable sign of the thing professed, then I suppose I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that such a profession is indeed not a profession, gives no ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and such is that of every notorious ungodly parent. 2. It is answered by others, that <hi>it must be by some Ancestors alive that will undertake their education.</hi> To which I reply; then the Ancestor gives him not a right as an <hi>Ancestor,</hi> but as an <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi> (of which more anon;) though he be no fitter to be an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker than another. Others say, that the <hi>children of Christians known or presumed to be such, living or dead, may baptized.</hi> Repl. Then all the children under the Turks, whose Ancestors were
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:107958:156"/>
known Christians, may be baptized; and why not all the world, when <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> were known to be in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? or all this Nation, if they had been Heathens this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, because their Ancestors were justly presumed to be Christians?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. In the common sense of such a Covenant amongst men, it would necessarily suppose an uninterrupted succession of faithfull Progenitors, that make no forfeiture before any right can be conveyed to their issue: therefore it must be so interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our present case, seeing we must not go from the known use or sense of words, without some apparent reason, whereof here is none that I see; And the Antecedent is a known case. If a Prince do convey certain priviledges &amp; Honors to a man and his Heirs and Posterity for ever, this word certainly implies this supposition or condition, that neither he nor any after him do make a forfeiture: for if they turn Traytors, the Covenant is broke, the Grant is void, and they cannot by that convey any such right to Posterity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. If the Promise aforesaid did not imply a necessary non-interruption of faithfull Progenitors, then the Promise and threatning could not be verified: but the Consequent is not to be admitted; therefore the Consequence is plain, in that as the Promise is to many generations of those that love God and keep his Commandments; so the Threatning is, that he will visit the sins of the Fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of, &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.34. where God proclaims it with his name; and doubtless both the Threatning and the Promise is such, that it cannot be that the same persons are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both at once: being certainly therefore under the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they are from under the Promise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum</hi> 4. The Threatning to the third and fourth generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is necessary to be understood on supposition, that <hi>there be an uninterrupted succession of wicked Progenitors</hi>: therefore by proportion so must the Promise be understood, as to a <hi>necessary succession of faithful Progenitors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. The natural Interest that Ancestors have in such Posterity is not immediate, but <hi>mediante Parente proximo:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so is the Covenant-Interest; because it proceedeth on sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:107958:157"/>
of the Natural. We receive nothing from a Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but by a Father, but what dependeth on his free will: an intercision therefore preventeth our Priviledges. It is here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that it is <hi>harsh to affirm that the immediate Parents sin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priveth Posterity of the Benefit, though the Ancestors were never so godly; for so the children should suffer for the Parents sin.</hi> Ans. 1. the children never had right, therefore never lost it. 2. Its just that they suffer for the Parents sin: when Parents have lost their right, they cannot convey it to others. Object. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of the Jews, <hi>They are beloved for the Fathers sake.</hi> Answ. So far beloved, as that God will reclaim them in after-ages, and now convert a remnant: but not so far beloved, as that any child of an unbelieving Jew had right to Baptism for <hi>Abraham</hi> or any Ancestors sake, and that Love was from a part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant proper to <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed. Object. <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e their children to a false God; yet this did the children of</hi> Israel, <hi>and yet their Posterity had right to Circumcision.</hi> Answ. I will reserve the answer of this to the end, where we shall have further reason to consider it, and next proceed to the fourth pretended Title of such Infants.</p>
            <p>The fourth part of this Question is, Whether the Infants of notorious ungodly parents may not have right to Baptism, <hi>on the account of some Vndertakers</hi>? Answ. If this be so, its nothing against our Negative determination of the main Question, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether they have right for their Parents sake? 2. We di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish of Undertakers; some are such as will undertake that another man shall bring up his child well: 2. Some will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to do it themselves, yet not to educate it as their own, but as another mans, and at his disposal: neither of these underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings can give any right. 3. But if the child do either by the total resignation of the Parent, or by adoption or the death of the Parents, or by purchase, or any other just means, become his <hi>Own</hi> that undertakes for him: so that the child is <hi>ejus juris,</hi> as his own children are, and at his dispose, then the Question is much harder. And for my part, I encline to judge that such a child hath Right upon that mans account: 1. Because that in a Law-sense this man is his Father. 2. Because all that God requireth in the free universal Covenant of Grace, to our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:107958:157"/>
of his Benefits, is our consent: and children do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent bo those <hi>whose</hi> they are: For they that <hi>owe</hi> them, or <hi>whose</hi> they are, have the disposal of them, and so of their <hi>Wills</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively; and may among men make any Covenant for them which is for their good (at least,) and oblige them to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of conditions. 3. Because God so determined it with <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he called him so solemnly to renew his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and so to the Israeliets after. Of which for brevity, see what I have said in my book of Baptism, <hi>chap.</hi> 29. <hi>pag.</hi> 101, 102. which I need not here recite. Let every man see with his own eyes: but for my part, I resolve (till I see better reasons for the contrary) to admit no child to baptism, u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on the undertaking of any other susceptors, such as our Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers were, without a better Title then their susception: but if any will say, This child is <hi>mine,</hi> and at <hi>my</hi> disposal, though not mine by natural generation, I will not dare to refuse to Baptize it, if the person that presenteth it and devoteth it to God, be capable of so doing, as being himself a Believer. And I think that it is a considerable work of Charity to get the children of Infidels or such among us are nominal Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and Infidels indeed, that they may have that benefit by you which they cannot have from their natural parents.</p>
            <p>The 5th. Title that is commonly pleaded for the Right of the children of notoriously ungodly Parents to baptism, is, upon the account of the Churches faith, and the Magistrates Authority over them. For this, it is pleaded, 1. That the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate or soveraign Ruler hath power to dispose of his Subjects, and therefore to make Covenants for them, and in their names, as much as a Parent hath: for the power of a Magistrate is greater than of a Parent, in that the Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>strate may put chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to death, and so may not a Parent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Soveraign hath a Governing power above a Parent: but it is not on that the great contract or right is grounded. But the Parent hath a greater propriety in the child than the Governor; and so hath more Right to dispose of him in this case. The Soveraigns power is in order to the Good of the Common-wealth; the Parents is for the Good of the Child directly. 2. <hi>Bodin</hi> (and some others) think that
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:107958:158"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> Custom was good, that Parents should have power of Life and Death as to their Children: though few approve his Judgement or reasons. 3. I doubt not but a Soveraign may use his Authority to procure the baptizing of Children by the Parents dedication of them to God. But still it must be <hi>modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante parente vel proparente,</hi> by procuring their consent, who have the nearest Interest in the child, and greater than the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate can have; though not greater ruling power. <hi>Obje. But there are some Rulers that are</hi> Domini <hi>as well as</hi> Rectores, <hi>and the people and all that they have are theirs; so that there is no proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in the Nation but themselves: and in such a case it seems that they may dispose of the consent of their subjects. An.</hi> 1. ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Its <hi>lis sub judice,</hi> whether this be not meer unlawfull Tyranny, or Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so the Title Null because against the Law of God in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 2. Or if any think that the example of <hi>Joseph,</hi> or of the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites buying children, will prove the contrary, yet 1. It can be but to their Civils, as Goods, Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their Right wherein is adventitious and accidental; and not to the fruit of their bodies, where their right is so natural that none can take it by violence from them: I say therefore that here it cannot be without the Parents voluntary Alienation and Resignation of their Children to the Soveraign; which they cannot do but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on weighty considerations. 2. The Soveraign in this case hath the same right in Adult subjects, as in Infants, seeing they are all Vassals to him as their Lord. And yet it is manifest in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that God will have the personal consent of the Adult, before they shall have any interest in his Covenant: Because when their Soveraign Lord hath all the right that is possible, he leaveth them the power of their own wills: And so as they have still naturally a nearer right in themselves (than he hath) which they cannot alienate; so it seems they have in their children. 3. At least this is nothing to almost all the world, where the Rulers claim no such absolute Dominion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. 4. God in Scripture requireth Parents and not Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to circumcise their children, and to educate them: And <hi>Joshua</hi> would promise for no more but himself &amp; his houshould to serve the Lord, and bids the people choose whom they would serve. Yet I will not deny but that a Ruler may use some
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:107958:158"/>
sharp means to procure the consent of Parents, in some cases. And I also confess that this Argument, though least insisted on, hath (in my opinion) much more plausible appearance of strength, and better deserves a further consideration, than the great and common Argument of the Parents. Right by such a Profession as consisteth with Notorious Ungodliness, upon which most build almost all t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eir Cause. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>astly, I conceive that as a Governors Right is in the Common-wealth and main bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Nation, enabling him to Rule them in the fear of God, so I will not deny but that he may call together the chief part of them, or a Representative body, and urging and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their consent, he may devote them by a National Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d and promise himself to rule them in his fear. And I would this duty and the Scripture Patterns for it were better laid to heart. But still this leaves the Parent that nearer Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Interest in his Individual children, on which God hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed rather to ground his Promises and Threatenings to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
            <p>The second <hi>Argument</hi> is drawn from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Go and disciple me all Nations, baptizing them:</hi> From whence it is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, that the Infants of notorious ungodly Parents being Members of a Discipled Nation, may therefore be baptized as such Members. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If the nearer Interest of their Parents be not supposed necessary, then this Argument makes as much for the Right of the child of any Jew or Heathen, as of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, for they may be Members of that Nation which is Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled. 2. But they must be Members of it <hi>quà tales, as</hi> discipled; and that they are not till they are themselves Disciples. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles are first commanded to <hi>Disciple</hi> Nations, and then to Baptize them on supposition that they be discipled: therefore they must baptize none but those that are discipled. They must endeavour the discipling of each Individual; but if they prevail but with the greater and Ruling part, it may be called a Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled Nation, and a Kingdom that is become the Kingdom of Christ: but yet as it is but for the sake of the chief part that the whole is so denominated, so it is only that part that is to be baptized; seeing a bare denomination of the whole, gives not right to any part that hath none of the ground of that deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:107958:159"/>
Nor did the antient Churches so understand this Text: For when <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> and other Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperors had the Rule, they did not judge that all their Subjects should be baptized.</p>
            <p>The 3d. <hi>Argument</hi> is drawn from the Interest of the Church: They say, Those that are born within the Church, though of unworthy Parents, the Church may take them and present them to baptism. <hi>Answ.</hi> How are those born <hi>within</hi> the Church, whose Parents are no Members of the Church? (Of which more anon.) If the Parent be utterly unworthy, and the child can have no Right upon his account, then certainly he is not to be reckoned in the Church. And if you mean, that all those that are born <hi>among</hi> the members of the <hi>Church,</hi> or where they have <hi>Civil</hi> Rule, may by them be presented to Baptism; then the argument must be the same with that before, or so vain as to need no confutation: Unless the Church will accept the Children as their <hi>Own,</hi> according to the sense of the fourth fore-mentioned Title; and then any one Member may better do it than the whole Church.</p>
            <p>Having spoken to the five pretended Titles distinctly, and shewed you how far they are any of them allowable, and how far not; I shall proceed to the second Question in the begining propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> [Whether that the Eventual Disposal of God by a Physical Act of Providence, do give any Right to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of notoriously ungodly Parents to be baptized?] And I need not say much to this: 1. Because I know of none that plead this Right. 2. Because it is but a <hi>non-injustum,</hi> and I think scarcely so much as a <hi>Justum</hi> much less a <hi>Debitum,</hi> that is here grounded. 3. But especially, because it is unquestionably evident, that if this give any kind of Right, it is but to a Possession <hi>ad libitum Donatoris,</hi> after the reception; and not at all to the first Reception. And therefore it cannot with the least shew of Reason be pleaded before-hand to enable any mans claim to Baptism, nor to enable a Minister to baptize any, nor yet <hi>ex post facto</hi> to justifie the Act of the Baptizer or of the Baptized.</p>
            <p>Yet how far it may prohibite any man to dispossess them of the state or priviledges of the baptized, till God give them a clear warrant, is worthy consideration.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:107958:159"/>3. But it is the third Question concerning the third sort of Right that most of all concerneth us to discuss; seeing as far as I can perceive, it is this that our Brethren of the contrary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do intend to insist upon, as discerning some inconvenience in affirming, God to be any otherwise than conditionally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Covenant with any Notorious ungodly men, yea or any that are unregenerate. To this therefore we must next speak.</p>
            <p>The Question is [<hi>Whether it be Gods command, that Ministers should baptize Children of notoriously ungodly men?</hi>] Or [<hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be their duty?</hi>] Or [<hi>Whether such Children be the Objects of our Just, and Justifiable Action of Baptizing?</hi>]</p>
            <p>And I conclude the Question Negatively, supposing that we speak both of Parents natural and civil, and so that they come in upon no better account than the Title of such Parents, as is before explained. Here 1. I grant, that if the natural Parents be ungodly, we may baptize on the the Title of their civil Parents, or Pro-parents; I mean any that truly <hi>Own</hi> them as <hi>Theirs.</hi> 2. Much more if any one of the Parents be godly, though the other be ungodly. 3. Also, If there be a probable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Godliness, though indeed there be not Sincerity, it is our duty to baptize the children of such. Because 1. we have no natural capacity of judging but according to evidence, and we have no evidence for a certain judgement concerning the estate of another mans heart. 2. I have elsewhere made it appear (and more abundantly might easily do) that when God mentioneth any person qualified with such a Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which to us is uncertain to be the object of our Act, his meaning is that we should rationally and charitably judge of men according to evidence whether they are such or no, and so take them, and use them accordingly, the <hi>Apparere</hi> being here as the <hi>Esse</hi> to us. So when he bids us, if a Brother wrong us oft, and oft say It repenteth me, forgive him: it is all one with that other [If he repent, forgive him.] We know not certainly whether he repent or not; but we must take him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably to repent, that giveth us the evidence of a probable profession. So if we are to baptize those that repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or their children, how can we judge of them but by a
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:107958:160"/>
probable profession. 4. It is therefore granted, that though such a degree of Ungodliness as is consistent with sincere Godliness, be Notorious, yet that's not the subject of our Question: for that doth not denominate a man (ungodly) seeing it is from the predominant part that he must be denominated.

               </gap>r Seed, who profess Godliness, because that by professing it they seem probably to be godly; then must we not baptize them who do not seem probably to be godly (or, if you had rather, <hi>to be true Believers:</hi>) But the Antecedent is true. Therefore so is the Consequent.</p>
            <p>For the Antecedent, I have said enough for it to Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi> If it were not <hi>propter fidem significandam,</hi> that profession were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, but <hi>propter se</hi> as the condition of the Covenant: then 1. God would not have said (He that believeth and is baptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, if thou believe with all thy heart thou mayst be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: and, Repent and be baptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but rather (if thou wilt but say thou believest thou mayst be baptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 2. And then all that profess should be justified: For all that be in the Mutual Covenant with God actually, are justified. 3. And then such profession would be of flat necessity to Salvation, as well as faith, which it is not, but on supposition of Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, a Call, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I think I may take it for granted, that Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is required <hi>sub ratione signi,</hi> as a sign of the thing profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: nor can any man, I think, give a better reason of its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:107958:160"/>
though another after this may be, because God will have the outward man to serve him, by thus signifying by its operations what are the Elicite Acts and dispositions of the Will.</p>
            <p>The Consequence of the foresaid <hi>Major</hi> proposition is past doubt, I suppose. If any think otherwise, the next Argument may rectifie them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> 4. He that is not to be judged a credible professed Christian or the child of such is not the just object of our act of baptizing (Or, We ought to baptize none but those whom we should judge true professed Christians, and their children) But the notoriously Ungodly are not to be judged true professed Christians, nor their Children the Children of such: therefore not to be baptized.</p>
            <p>As the word [Profession] signifieth a pretended discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the mind (with an intention to deceive) so I confess it may be called a profession Physically or Metaphysically true: But it is not this natural Truth that we here mean: nor yet do I stretch the word so high as to comprehend the full gradual correspondency of the Act to the Object: but I plainly mean a [Moral Truth] opposed to [a Lye] or Falshood:] And being speaking about moral-Legal things, the terms must be necessarily understood according to the Subject: So that it were proper in this Case, If I simply maintained that such are [Not Professors of Christianity] at all; because in a moral Law-sense they are not such. For no man is to give credit to a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious lye; so to speak, is equal to silence, as to any obligation that it can lay upon another, either to believe him, or to use him as one that is believed. My meaning therefore is, that we are not to baptize that man or his child, upon a profession which is notoriously false; so that our selves and the Congregation do certainly know, or have sufficient Reasons to be confident, that the man doth lye.</p>
            <p>For the proof of the <hi>Minor</hi> (which I know will be denied) thus I prove it: If either the Profession be evidently but E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocally called a true Profession, or the Christianity profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be but equivocally called Christian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty, then the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously ungodly are not to be judged true professed Christans.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:107958:161"/>
But the one of these is so with all notoriously ungodly persons. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is past doubt, seing there must be the true profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of true Christianity, that must justly denominate a man (at age) a true Professor of Christianity. If he notoriously want the first, he is morally no Professor: If he want the later, he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hristianity. To prove the <hi>Minor,</hi> we will begin with the later. We speak not now of any Accidentals that pertain not to the Being, but tend only to the well-Being of a Christian. Now I hope it is past controversie among us all, that it is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to our Christianity, that it be in the Intellect and Will, whatever we say of the outward Man: and for the Intellect, that we believe in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: And it is essential to our believing in God, that we believe him to be our Creator, Chief Ruler, and chief End and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. And to believe in the Son Essentially, containeth a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that he is Jesus Christ our Lord, that is, that he is the Redeemer of the world, who shed his blood to save his people from their sins by pardon and sanctification, and who will raise them from the dead, and judge them to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Blessedness: and who is their Lord and Ruler on this ground, and to this end; to believe in the Holy Ghost essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, containeth a believing that his Testimony of Christ was true, and that he is the Sanctifier of those that shall be saved. It is as much essential to Christianity, to consent that God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost be such to us as we profess them to be, as aforesaid: which is included in believing <hi>in</hi> God, and <hi>in</hi> Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost: And therefore the sum of the Covenant is [I will be your God (upon Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition by Christ) and you shall be my people] Now the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously Vngodly</hi> do either profess to believe and consent to <hi>all</hi> this, or but to <hi>part</hi>: If to <hi>All,</hi> then they lye, of which more anon: If but to <hi>part</hi>; then 1. it is not the Christian Faith, no more then a heart, or a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> say, that he that doth not believe and consent to the whole Essence of Christianity, doth not truly believe or consent to any Essential (though for that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it not) But were their Faith never so firm in any one
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:107958:161"/>
part, it is not Christianity, or the Christian Faith, without the whole. If it be the Christian Faith to believe in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only, then those that deny Christ, are Christians. If it be the Christian Faith to believe only in Christ, though they deny the Father, or the Holy Ghost, then men worse then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls or most Heathens, are Christians. Indeed there is so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary a connexion, that it is not possible truly to believe in God the Son, without believing in the Father and the Holy Ghost, and believing the Eternal Glory to which he hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us and will lead us. If it be Christianity to believe all the Creed by meer Assent; then first, the Devils are Christians; for they believe and tremble. Secondly, and then it would be a Profession of Christianity to say, [I do believe Christ to be my Lord, by right of Redemption, but his Laws are so strict, and cross to my pleasures, that I am resolved he shall not rule me, and I will venture all rather than I will take him for my Ruler on such terms.] Or to say, [I believe the Holy Ghost is the Sanctifier of Gods Elect; but I will not consent that he shall Sanctifie me] Or to say, [I believe that Christ dyed to save his people from their sins, but he shall not save me from mine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I cannot spare them.] Who dare say that any of these were a Profession of Christianity? We must believe with the heart, if we be Christians. Christianity is not a bare Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It lyeth in the covenant of the soul with God, and it is the consent of the Will that is that covenanting. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sometime expressed by loving Christ above all. They that said, [<hi>This is the Heir</hi>] believed in a sort with the Assent of the brain: but when they add, [<hi>Come, let us kill him, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance may be ours</hi>] I think they shewed that they professed not Christianity. He that saith, [<hi>I will not have this man to raign or rule over me.</hi>] disclaimeth Christianity. He that disclaimeth an Essential part, disclaimeth the whole. It is not the Being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out these part.</p>
            <p>All this laid together, shews us that Christianity, or the Christian Faith, truly and properly so called, which denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth a man properly a Christian, is <hi>specifically</hi> distinct (as to a moral specification) from the faith of the highest unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man: (When Mr. <hi>K.</hi> wrote a digression against me on a
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:107958:162"/>
mistake that, I had denyed this, I did not think that others would so call me out to the defence of it.) And seeing that they differ by a moral specification, it is clear that they admit not of the same Definition; and that the term [Faith] or [Christianity] applyed to both these, cannot mean the same thing: but must here be an equivocal. Thus I have cleared it, that to profess the belief of one part of the Christian faith only, is not to profess the Christian faith, or to profess to be a Christian: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such are not to be baptized, seeing we must baptize them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, if we will bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them with Christian Baptism.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Next I shall shew that if any Notorious ungodly person do say he believes the whole, even in God the Father, Son and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, such saying is not a true <hi>Profession,</hi> nor valid to its uses. To this end let us enquire what it is to <hi>Profess: Profiteor</hi> is <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licè fateor.

               </gap> 
               <hi>est sermo.</hi> Now the natural use of speech is to signifie our mind to others. And the very essence of a <hi>Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> lyeth in the <hi>open declaring</hi> of the mind, in the very signifying use of the words or actions. For it containeth (as other signs do) 1. The thing signifying, or the matter of the sign, and that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, writings or other Actions capable of this use (of which there are divers.) 2. the thing signified; which is our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Assent and consent. 3. The party to whom we signifie it. 4. The actual signification, or Aptitudinal: that is, that it be a sign Aptitudinal in it self, and actual, when rightly observed by others: in which Aptitude lyeth the very formal nature of the sign. This being so, it is most evident that if it have not an Aptitude to signifie our mind, it is not a sign. You may say, if he dissemble, yet he may make profession, yet profession is no sign of his mind. I answer, it is no true sign of the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, but the end which he pretendeth to use it for is, to be a sign: and as a sign we expect and receive it; and did we know the heart as God doth, we need not ask men whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but presently go to their hearts and see, and so baptize
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:107958:162"/>
them or refuse them (or their Children.) It being then the very use that the Church makes of mens profession to signifie mens minds, it is clear 1. that where there is nothing that we can justly take as the signification of a mans mind, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth as a Christian, there is no moral profession of it: and where a man signifieth his mind that he doth not so believe, there he professeth <hi>not to believe</hi>: And if he make two contrary professions, one that he doth believe, and the other that he doth not, if we know one to be certain and undissembled, and the other to be false, the later is Null, and the former to be received. All this being evident, it next followeth, that we shew, that no Notorious ungodly man doth make true profession of Christianity: For 1. If it be evident that he useth words not understood, as a <hi>Parrat,</hi> then is it not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: For <hi>Ignorantis non est consensus</hi>: and so <hi>nec Professio</hi>: else a <hi>Parrat</hi> may be a Professor. 2. He maketh openly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Profession; For he doth by words or deeds, or both, profess that he will not be ruled by Christ, that he will not be sanctified or released from his sin: that he will not take God and Glory to come for his chief Good, but the things of this life, and will obey the flesh before God. It it be in plain known sins, which they can find no vain excuse for, some of them will say words of equal force to these: but though most will not do so; yet their Actions openly profess it.</p>
            <p>But because this is the thing that will be denyed, I add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 1. Actions are capable of signifying a mans mind as well as words: though not ordinarily so soon, or easily, yet some Actions do; yea, and much more certainly. 2. God plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tels us of some, <hi>that profess that they know God, yet in works they deny him</hi>: so that works can speak as plain as words, and deny God, and unsay what a deceitful tongue hath said. 3. If these persons in question do not thus deny Christ by their works, or do not Profess, to be no Christians, then either it is because ungodliness is consistent with Christianity, or doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or imply Infidelity, or else because the [Notoriousness] of this ungodliness is no Profession. The first cannot be said: For 1. As Godliness in a Christian sense comprehendeth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:107958:163"/>
and even the true acknowledgement of the God-head it self; so ungodliness containeth the disowning of God and the refusing of all true Love of him, or seeking him as our End, and it comprizeth in it the refusal of Christ to bring us back to God, and of the Spirit to conform our souls and lives to his Will. As therefore God is the Ultimate End, and Christ as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator but the means or way; and as loving God is a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent duty than believing in Christ in it self considered, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness which is contrary to the Love of God, is a greater sin than unbelief in it self, as to Jesus Christ the Mediator: yea and ever containeth this unbelief as its second and lower part, though it be denominated from the opposition to God, as the greater part of the sin. 2. However no man will deny but that they are concomitant, and that every ungodly man is an unbeliever. 3. Yea as ungodliness is contrary to our subjection to the Lord Redeemer, it is a real part of Infidelity it self. I may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore that to be Notoriously ungodly, is to be Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously no Christian, but an Unbeliever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And that this Notoriousness is a certain profession, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For 1. the mind is declared by it: Christ himself telleth us that out of the heart come Murthers, Adulteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. If you say, men may do such and such things against their will, I answer, 1. Then they are not Notoriously ungodly; if they do not Notoriously shew their wilfulness. 2. The Will hath the command of the outward man. 2. And as it declareth the mind, so doth it certainly declare it. For first, else still it were not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious ungodliness. 2. Words may be easier counterfeited than Deeds, especially the scope of a mans life. 3. And hence it is that the Lord Jesus himself when he comes to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will try more by Deeds than verbal Profession, and will reject such Professions when they are contradicted by evil actions, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>Not every one that saith unto one Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father. Mat.</hi> 25. Christ will convince those by their <hi>not feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cloathing,</hi> &amp;c. his members, that they were no true Believers, who still go about to justifie themselves. And they that shall say, <hi>Lord have not we eat, drunk,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cast out Devils, &amp; preacht in thy
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:107958:163"/>
name; shall be answered with a Depart from me ye workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, I know you not.</hi> Men shall all be <hi>judged according to their works.</hi> It is clear then that Notorious ungodliness is a Profession or signification of the very mind and will: yea and a profession most certain; for it cannot be dissembled. He that is notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ungodly is most certainly no true Christian: But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession which this contradicteth, is not so certain; nay it is most certainly false. So that as God doth, so man must take mens works and lives for a Discovery of their mind, and judge them by it.</p>
            <p>I have stood the larger on this, because that profession of Christianity is the common title that is pleaded for such persons; and therefore I have shewed that they are not to be reputed for credible Professors. If it be not a probable sign, it is not to be taken for a valid profession: But words contradicted by the Notorious tenor of the life, are no probable sign, but these works are a certain sign of the contrary. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any man yet do think that any words, though not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly signifying the mind, are a valid profession, and to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a Title; then it will follow, that if a man should laugh in your face, and foretel you that he will come and make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in scorn of Christ, or if he tell you that though he speak such words, it is not from his heart, but through fear, or to get some honour with men; or if when he baptized his child in the name of Christ, he tell you that he intendeth not that he shall serve him; or if he say of himself he will baptized in tht name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and renounce the world, flesh and Devil, but he intendeth not to stand to it, nor to do as he promiseth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> any of these must be taken for a Profession, and this man for a Christian: which no wise man I think will affirm. If an affirmation presently contradicted by words as express and certain, be not to be taken for a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, then much less is an affirmation more certainly contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the tenor of the life, yea and too oft by professed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency.</p>
            <p>The sum is this, We must not baptize him into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost (or his children for his faith) who we are sure doth not believe in the Father, Son, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:107958:164"/>

But all Notoriously Ungodly are in one of these ranks. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To explain my meaning in this Argument, Observe 1. that I take not the common doctrine for true, that a particular Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical or Organized Church, or incorporated Society of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, is a meer Homogeneal part of the universal Visible Church: All the Universal Church doth not consist of such Societies, no more than all this Common-wealth doth consist of Corporations. For a particular Church, is as a particular Body-Corporate; and all the Members of the Universal are not so: Though all ought to be so that can attain it, yet all can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain it, and all do not what they ought: Even in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my a Souldier may be lifted by a General Officer into the Army in general, long before he is placed in any Regiment or Troop; yea there are some that are Messengers, and for other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that are not to be of any Regiment. So sometime a man is baptized, as the Eunuch, before he be entred into any particular Church, perhaps long: And some were of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which are dissolved, and stay long before they can joyn
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:107958:165"/>
themselves to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And some live as Merchants, in a movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble travelling, condition: And some are bound for the good of the Common-wealth to be Embassadors, or Agents, or Factors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> resident among Infidels, where is no Church: And some may be called to preach up and down among Infidels for their conversion, as the Apostles did, and fix themselves to no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church: And some may be too ignorant or neglective of their duty in incorporating with any: And some upon infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and scrupulosity hold off. So that its apparent that all the Visible Church is not thus Incorporated into particular Churches.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I do firmly believe that Baptism as Baptism, doth list, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or admit us only into the Universal Church directly, and not into any particular Church; but yet consequentially it oft doth both: And as the Parent is, so is it supposed that the Infant is. If the Parent live an itinerant life, and bring his child to Baptism, that child is entered into the Universal Church on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, except he leave the child resident in any particular Church, and desire it may be a member of it: But if the Parent be a member of a particular Church, when we Baptize his child, we receive it first into the universal Church, and then into that particular (as an imperfect member:) For we justly suppose it is the Parents desire, which is it that determineth this Case.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I firmly believe that the common opinion is an Error, that All that are cast out of a particular Church, are cast out of the universal.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea, or that he that is put out of one particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated Church, must be avoided by all other such Churches.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Yet do I believe that it is a worse Error to say that all that are cast out of one such Church, may be received into commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by other Churches, or single Christians.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I do therefore distinguish of such Exclusion as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call Excommunication, or casting out of Churches, or suspending from communion. 1. As to the ground and cause of the Exclusion. 2. As to the <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> or the <hi>in quantum,</hi> or intended effect of the Exclusion. 1. It is one thing
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:107958:166"/>
to be excluded on a cause that is supposed exclusive of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity it self: and another thing to be excluded on a cause that supposeth him uncapable of the Priviledge of all incorporated Churches: and a third thing to be excluded on a cause that makes men uncapable of Member-ship with that one Church only, or some particulars, and not all. 2. So as to the effect, It is one thing to be excluded from the number of Christians as such; Another thing to be excluded from all Incorporated Churches as such: And a third thing to be excluded from one particular Church only, or some more on the like ground that are in the like case. Besides all this, I distinguish between an Exclusion upon the certain Nullitie of the Title; and a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension while the Title is under tryall, upon a just occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of questioning it. From hence I hold as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there may be just reason to cast a man out of a particular Church, who yet is not denied to joyn with other particular Churches. For example, if a member of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church hold me to be no true Minister, and that he may not communicate with me, supposing him to mistake; or if he hold it his duty to contradict the Doctrine and Practice of Infant-Baptism, or the like, he may make himself utterly uncapable of communion with this Church, who yet may be capable of communion with other Churches. The like oft falls out where Churches differ about lesser Doctrines or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or Ordination of Pastors; a man that will in a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling zeal suppose himself bound to be a continual disquiet to that Church where the occasion is, may be cast out from that, and uncapable of joyning with any of that same opinion and way, and not with others that are of his own way and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A man may be cast out of a particular incorporated Church <hi>as such,</hi> and consequently be at present uncapable of being a member of any such particular Church on Earth, and yet not be cast out of the Universal Visible Church, or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christians, much less of the Invisible. As for example: If a man hold and maintain that there are no true Ministers in Office in any particular Church on earth by reason of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption in the succession of Ordination; that man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:107958:166"/>
uncapable of being a member of any such Church: and yet while he holdeth the whole Doctrine of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty besides, and openly professeth it, and supposeth that private gifted-men may Teach and Baptize, he may still be a vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ible Christian, and therefore not fit to be cut off from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church of Christians. So in any the like Case. <hi>Quer.</hi> Whether this be not the Case of those that place all Church-power in the <hi>Major</hi> vote of the people, so that the Church must be governed only by such Vote, and the Pastor is but the mouth of the People, to act according to their Vote? Whether men of this judgement, declaring and professing it, be capable of being members of any true incorporated Church on Earth (though they may be members of such Societies as their own, of humane invention, contrary to the Word, and to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Essence of a true Political Church.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. I also distinguish between the excluding of a man from communion as <hi>No true Christian,</hi> and excluding him as a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous or infectious Christian. As it was one thing for the <hi>Jews</hi> to remove the dead, and another to remove a Leper from the camp. And I suppose that 1. Ordinarily we are not to exclude any from our communion for a scandalous sin openly repented of. 2. Yet it is possible that it may be of so hainous a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that for the Credit of Religion, and the avoiding of all occasion of Reproach by those without, it is not meet to admit such an Offender into our communion, till after some convenient time and larger manifestation of our disowning their crime, and of their extraordinary repentance of it. But this is but tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 3. It is possible also that a man may have such an itching zeal to propagate a false opinion, though consistent with Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that we may be bound to exclude him our actual communion, to avoid the infection of the Church: As also that his crime may so induce others to imitation, that though it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with Christianity, we must exclude him as an infectious Leper, because a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I conceive that an open Apostate needs no decisive senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Excommunication, but only declarative. We cut off no man from Christ, but declare who they be that cut off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from that Christianity which they seemed to have.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:107958:167"/>5. Yet I conceive that an actual Apostate, that is not totally an Infidel, but renounceth only some parts of the essentials of Christianity, and is loath to confess himself no Christian, and will intrude into the communion of Christians, whether to avoid shame, or disquiet of conscience, or danger, &amp;c. I say, such a One is the fittest object for the sentence of highest excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, even from the number of Christians, supposing him notoriously to be such. As if a man should call himself a Christian, and thrust into their communion, and yet maintain, that Christ is but a Prophet, such as <hi>Mahomet</hi>; or as the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that he is not God, or that there is no Resurrection or Life to come, or that there is no Holy Ghost; or that Christ is not to be obeyed when the Flesh is against it; and that every man may live the life that best pleaseth his flesh; or that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self will obey his flesh before Christ, or not let go his sin for the hopes of Glory, at the command of God. Among these I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon a Notorious ungodly man, who will in words call himself a Christian, but by a more certain discovery make known that indeed he is none. Here the Church is not only to <hi>declare</hi> him none, but to <hi>sentence</hi> him none: For a meer Declaration suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not a Controversie, but a Sentence or Decision doth: and his vain pretence and unjust intrusion made it a Controversie, as between him and the Church, though to the Church the Case be notorious. This man then is cast out as <hi>No-Christian</hi>: when I conceive that such a man as <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. (were they now with us) while they lay in that sin, should be removed from actual communion, as Lepers, or scandalous Christians, or (at most) as such as have given us reason to question their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There is also a threefold suspension: The <hi>first</hi> is from some special act or part of communion only, (as the Sacrament of the Lords Supper) during the time of a mans just tryal. A duty not being at all times a duty, it is meet that he forbear while he is under such tryal, who hath given just occasion of suspicion and accusation. I mean here, only the tryal whether they are guilty of the fault that they are accused of or not. This suspension is not penal, but the orderly doing of duties. Another suspension is, when the Crime is confest, or proved.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:107958:167"/>
and the only thing in doubt is, Whether the person be penitent or impenitent? supposing the Crime an heinous Scandal, the person may be excluded all special communion; with this limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Till they manifest Repentance. And this is the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon censure, I think, that the Church hath use for. The <hi>third</hi> sort of suspension is, that before-mentioned, when though we are satisfied of the persons Repentance, yet the heinousness of the Crime, or the scandalousness and occasion of Reproach to the Enemy, or the Infectiousness, may necessitate us to delay his Re-admission. In these two later there is somewhat of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mixt with the suspension: In the former, not so. In these two later, we judge the person to have no Right at that time to enjoy communion, because no aptitude to possess it; but not that he hath lost all Right to future communion. But yet his Right will not be plenary for the future, unless he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and get an aptitude for communion. Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> if we cast out a man as no true Christian, then we deny him to have any Right for the future; that is, his chief Title is Null, and he must have a new Title, as the foundation of his Right, before he can have any Right: whereas the scandalous Christian hath his funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Title still; but only hath a barr put in his way from present Possession.</p>
            <p>I have been the larger on this, that you may fully know the meaning of the Argument; and on what ground all Objections are to be Answered.</p>
            <p>And now you see that I speak not of every sort of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication here, but only that which justly excludeth from all Christian communion, as Christian: and not that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth only from any or all particular Churches (Though of this last I suspend my determination); And I speak not of meer suspension at least, of the first or third sort. Indeed my opinion is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. That all so excommunicated can give their children no right to Baptism (nor be fit <hi>mediums</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of it) 2. That all justly suspended from communion of Christians, till they manifest Repentance, having given the Church great cause strongly to suspect them of utterly graceless Impenitency, should have their children, who are born while
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:107958:168"/>
they are in that condition, suspended from Baptism (unless they have a better Right than from them.)</p>
            <p>Lastly note that I mention, not only actual Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by sentence, but Excommunication <hi>ipso jure</hi>: For if it be Excommunication, all's one; and the later the most unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable.</p>
            <p>I now prove the <hi>Major</hi> thus: If such Infants cannot receive union and communion with the Universal Church, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Parents Interest, then neither can they receive Baptism on that account. But the Antecedent is certain; which I prove thus: Such Parents cannot be the means of conveying that to their Children, which they have not themselves. But they have no such Union and Communion themselves; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know in some cases (as in working Grace on others) a man may be a means of effecting that in another which he hath not himself. But that it is not so here, I think will be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the Parents Right is all the condition (in Question now) of the childs Right: and it is only this kind of Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that we mean.</p>
            <p>The Consequence needs no proof: To be baptized, is to be put into union and communion with the visible Church. (This is one inseparable use of it:) therefore he that cannot be a fit <hi>medium</hi> to convey one, cannot for the other.</p>
            <p>For the Father and Mother to be put out, or judged out, and yet the child taken into the same body as a branch of them, and on their account, is plainly to Do and Undo, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict our selves.</p>
            <p>To this it is said by some, That an Excommunicate man lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth but his <hi>Jus inre,</hi> and not <hi>adrem</hi>; and retaineth still his fundamental Right; and therefore as to this, is still a Church-member: he is but suspended from present benefit, and not cut off from all Title. To which I answer; 1. If this be true of all Excommunicate persons, then is it impossible so much as by a Declarative Excommunication, to cut off any from the Universal Church: If a man maintain that Christ is neither God, nor Redeemer, but a Prophet, second to <hi>Moses</hi> or <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:107958:168"/>
and yet will call himself a Christian, and usurp communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if we cast him out, he hath still a Fundamental Right. Can any man have a fundamentall Righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that denyeth any Fundamental Truth? But if any will say, That this is not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, but Declaring or Judging a man to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate: I reply, Rather than we will differ about the Name, call it what you please, as long as you know what we mean. He that notoriously sheweth that he hath not Christ, hath no fundamental Right. Whether <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. and 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. speak of this or that sort of Excommunication, is little to our Question.</p>
            <p>It is further objected, [<hi>Either the excommunicate persons sin divests the child, or the Churches Censure. But neither</hi>; Ergo, <hi>&amp;c. Not the former: for no sin but that of Nature descends to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Man transmits not his personal Vices, Fault or Guilt, no more than his Graces.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> As if the Question had been about divesting a child of a Right which he had before, and not rather of the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Right which he had not. We suppose the child born af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Parents are excommunicate: And had that child a Right be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore he had a Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng? and so before it could be any subject of Right, you talk of uncloathing him that was born naked and never cloathed. We rather suppose that the new-born child must then receive a Right from the excommunicate Parent, or have none: and therefore conclude it hath none, unless on some other Interest then theirs.</p>
            <p>It is further objected as to the Censure, [<hi>I never read that Church-Censures were like that plague laid on</hi> Gehazi, <hi>to cleave to him and his seed:</hi> See <hi>Deut.</hi> 24 16.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Church censures deprive not the child of any Right that it had; for we suppose it unborn: but they shew the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be in an incapacity of conveying it that Right which it never had. I say therefore to your Argument, The sin of the Parent preventeth the childs Right; and the Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure declareth and judgeth it so prevented And on your grounds and arguing, why may not you say that the child of every Turk and Indian on earth hath Right? for their Parents
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:107958:169"/>
did no more divest them of it than these; and their sins can no more be transmitted.</p>
            <p>But though it be not necessary to be asserted, to the uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the present Cause, yet I must tell you that I believe that Parents transmit more of their sin than of their Graces to Posterity; and I am somewhat confident that you say what you can never prove, and deny a Guilt which it better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemed you to acknowledge and lament.</p>
            <p>Next to the proof of the <hi>Minor</hi> of the main Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> [that notoriously ungodly persons are excommunicated from the society of Christians, as such, <hi>ipso Jure</hi>; or are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced no members of the Universal Church,] To be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate <hi>ipso Jure,</hi> is when the Law is so express, and so fully applyeth it self to the case of the offending person, that there may or must be an execution of it by the people, though there do no sentence of the Judge intervene; when the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law, and the notoriousness of the Case may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant an execution without Judgement. And that it is so here, I prove thus.</p>
            <p>The Case is supposed Notorious, and the Law is plain, and commandeth all men to execute it, whether there be any Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or not: Therefore such are <hi>ipso Jure,</hi> excommunicate. 1. In a lower sort of Excommunication, the meer Law may require our execution without a sentence: therefore much more in a grosser and plainer case. We must not eat with the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. We must avoid them that cause Division, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. We must note such men as are disobedient, and have no company with them, that they may be ashamed: yea, we are flatly commanded in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that we withdraw our selves from every brother that walketh disorderly, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.6, 14. All this we must do, though no Ecclesiastical Judge do sentence them, when the case is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. We must reject a known Heretick after the first and second admonition: we must turn away from wicked Livers, though they have a form of Godliness, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3:5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning those that are not Christians: we are bid come out from among them, and separate our selves, and touch

And these seem to be persons much in the case as now we have to do with: such as professed themselves Christians in name, and yet denied the fundamentals, and lived wickedly: v. 7.8, 9. of Ep. 2. [<hi>Mary deceivers are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the World, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a very Deceiver, and Antichrist; whosoever transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God.</hi>] whether this was written to a Lady, or a Church, whether of the Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks or other Sect, it differs not much as to our case. Also God calls all his people, whom it did concern, to <hi>come out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, that they pertake not of her sins, &amp; receive not of her plagues,</hi> Rev. 18.4. But I need not prove, I hope, that we are not of the same body with known unbelievers; and that <hi>unbelieving</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth as small, if not a smaller evil than <hi>ungodliness,</hi> and is comprehended in it, I have already manifested: And its known that we are to shun the company of a wicked man, that will take on him the name of a Christian Brother, more then of an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever that pretendeth not to be one of us: For with the later we may eat, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 27. though we may not communicate with him in his false worship (<hi>ver.</hi> 16.17, 18, 20, 21.) but with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer we may not.</p>
            <p>And whether the <hi>ungodly</hi> be any more of our <hi>Body,</hi> or fit for our communion than Infidels that so profess themselves in words, let Scripture judge. When God separateth his own People from others, it is not only as from <hi>unbelevers,</hi> but he most freqently giveth the reason from their Pollutions; so that it is from them as from the <hi>unclean.</hi> Lev. 20 24. <hi>I am the Lord your God which have separated you from other People: Ye shall
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:107958:170"/>
therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, &amp;c. which I have separated from you as unclean: And ye shall be holy unto me; for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you from other People, that ye should be mine</hi>] So answerable hereunto all Gods People under the Gospel are called <hi>Saints</hi> as well as Believers: and <hi>Paul</hi> tels all the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> not only that they are changed from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity to Faith, but [<hi>such were some of you</hi> (that is, wicked Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers); <hi>but ye are washed, ye are sanctified, ye are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6 11.] And he is blinde that seeth not how in all the ceremonial Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of <hi>Moses,</hi> which were Types of Christs cleansing his Church, the Lord doth most eminently declare his Purity, and hatred of sin, and the necessity of Holiness and Purity in his People, as well as the necessity of pardon by Christ: Answerable whereunto in the Gospel, Christ is as eminently declared the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier as the Pardoner of men: <hi>He saveth his people from their sins,</hi> themselves; <hi>and washeth, and sanctifieth, and cleanseth his Church, that he may present it spotless to God.</hi> Lev. 15.31. &amp; 12.2, 3, 5, &amp;c.

            <p>I think it is clear, that those whom <hi>Paul</hi> describeth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. are to be avoided by all Christians, as not in the Christian body: and he describeth them by their unholiness, and particular vices; and saith of their Teachers, that they are [<hi>Men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith</hi>]; yet have their Disciples a <hi>form of Godliness.</hi> And doubtless [<hi>Reprobates concerning the faith</hi>] if so known, are not to be numbred with Christians. Those from whom we are to be separated here and hereafter, are sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led oft [<hi>The Vngodly</hi>] Psal. 1. And as in some places the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

is between <hi>Believers</hi> and <hi>Vnbelievers,</hi> so in others, between the <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi> or <hi>ungodly,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.17, 18. where all these are descriptions of the same men, [<hi>ungodly and sinners</hi>], such as are not of the <hi>house of God [men that know not God</hi>] And it was the world of the <hi>Vngodly</hi> that God brought the Flood upon; and to be an example to those that after should live <hi>ungodly,</hi> was <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> destroyed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5, 6. And <hi>John</hi> tell us, that <hi>in this the children of God are known from the children of the Devil; he that doth wickedness is not of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note well the description of these, <hi>Jude</hi> 4. On one side they pretended to be Christians, for they are said to be [<hi>crept in</hi>] among them; [<hi>to turn the Grace of God into lasciviousness</hi>;] they were [<hi>spots in their Feasts, clouds without water, carried about of winds, without fruit, twice dead</hi>] vers. 12. It is apparent then that they were Baptized ones. Yet the Apostle excludeth them from the very number of Christians, calling them [<hi>twice dead, plucked up by the roots, men that denyed the only Lord God, and our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> ver. 4.12.] And the Desciption of them, is, that they are ungodly Hereticks, that taught and practised ungodliness: as you may see, ver. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18. <hi>walking after their own ungodly lusts, sensual, having not the spirit, of whom</hi> Enoch <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied, saying.

            </p>
            <p>All these passages, with multitudes more, shew that the name of a Christian unworthily usurped, maketh not a notorious ungodly man to be in any capacity of a better esteem with God or the Church, or any good men therein, than are openly professed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, especially that want the means which they enjoy: For all this pretence of theirs can give us no probability of any more then a superficial Assent, less then that of the Devils, and this is but knowing their Masters will, which prepareth these Rebels to be beaten with many stripes. And should that which makes them the greater sinners, give them right of admittance into the Church? It is <hi>Agustines</hi> Argument. <hi>lib de fide &amp; oper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The case is yet more clear that such are excommunicated <hi>ipso jure,</hi> when we consider that it is far more usual for Gods Law to serve without a sentence, then mans: most of the matters of our lives are there determined to our hand, and we must obey the Law, whether there be any judgement of man to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, or not: God hath not left so much to the judicial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of man, as humane Laws do. It is a great doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any power, properly Decisive-judicial in the Church-Guides or not? but doubtless, it is more limitedly and imperfectly Decisive than is the power of Judges in the matters of the Commonwealth. So that if all the Rulers in the Church should forbear to Censure Notorious Apostates, Hereticks, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ones, yea if they all command us to hold communion with them, because they call themselves Christians, we are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:107958:171"/>
bound to disobey them, and to avoid such as to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous communion: For else we should obey man against God, who hath directed many of these precepts to all Christians, and not only to the Governours of the Church. If the Guides will suffer the <hi>woman</hi> Jezabel <hi>to teach and seduce,</hi> and the <hi>Nicolaitans to abide</hi> among them, whom for their filthiness <hi>God did hate,</hi> it is the peoples duty for all that to avoid them, if they will be Guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. Yea <hi>Cyprian</hi> tels the people that it belongs to them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake and to reject an unworthy Minister that is by others set over them, or doth intrude. I conclude therefore that as all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans must (beyond dispute) use an open Infidel as such, though it belong not to the Church to judge them that are without, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Law here serves turn without a judgement, the case being past controversie: so also a Notorious ungodly man, though pretending to Christianity, and entertained by the Church, is to be avoided by every good Christian, as being <hi>ipso jure</hi> excommunicated by God.</p>
            <p>Most of the Objections that I have heard against this, are from men that not understanding this phrase of Excommunication <hi>ipso jure,</hi> through their unacquaintedness with Law-terms, have supposed that we meant no more but <hi>de jure,</hi> or that they meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Excommuication, or it was their due: But <hi>ipso jure</hi> means <hi>ex vi solius Legis, sine sententia Judicis</hi>: Its common for Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in several Cases, either where Judges or other Officers are needless, or cannot be had, or may not be staid for, to enable the subject to do execution, without any more judgement. And so we are bound to <hi>avoid such Notorious</hi> ungodly ones, as being as Notoriously no Christians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But if all this were unproved, yet still it is sufficient to our purpose in hand, that the Church-Guides are at present bound to Excommunicate them. And sure they cannot at one and the same time be bound to cast out him and take in his child upon his <hi>Right</hi> into the number of Christians.</p>
            <p>Its Objected, <hi>The Excommunicate are members under cure. Ans.</hi> Those that are but <hi>pro tempore</hi> suspended from some particular acts or parts of communion, are so; and those that are only cast out of an Incor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>orated Church, and not the Universal, or from among Christians as Christians. But for the rest that are so cast
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:107958:172"/>
out, the case is otherwise. Many different acts of the Church, and cases of the persons, are usually confounded under this one word [<hi>Excommunication.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Object. Austin <hi>complains of one that had Excommunicated one</hi> Classicanus, <hi>and with him his whole Family; which he dislikes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the son must not suffer for the fathers sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> What is this to our business? We plead not for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating any child for the Parents sin; but for <hi>not Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> them at first into communion, when the Parents have lost their Right, and the child is born after. 2. What if by the Law of the Land a Traitors Estate be forfeit? if his Heir therefore receive not that which he could not give him because he had lost it, will you say that this is contrary to Gods Ordination, that the Son shall not suffer for the Parents sin? The Son may yet have some priviledge, from a Father, which he could not have, were that Father an Infidel or excommunicate person; and therefore all the world have not the same Priviledges as the Church. So much of that Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 16. Those whom we may justly Baptize (supposing them of age and natural capacity) we may justly admit to the Lords Supper while they are no worse than they were at Baptism. But we may not admit a notorious ungodly person to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: Therefore we may not justly Baptize such: And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, not their children upon their account.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is plain: No Church-member ought to be kept from Church-communion in the Lords Supper, but upon some just Accusation of a crime which he is since guilty of, more than he was at his Admittance. But the Baptized are Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is by one objected, that <hi>this is the Anabaptists Argument (or one to this purpose) to keep out Infants, because they are not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lords Supper. Answ.</hi> That is for want of natural capacity to use the Ordinance; and not for want of a <hi>Right,</hi> if they had such capacity. But for men at age, I suppose it past doubt that you may admit them to the Supper on the same qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as to state worthiness, on which you may admit them to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism. Object. <hi>The Baptized are</hi> Incipientes; <hi>the Communicants</hi> Proficientes; <hi>Therefore there must be more in all Communicants
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:107958:172"/>
then is requisite in the Baptized. Answ.</hi> There ought to be more, because they ought to grow in grace. But 1. it is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site that they be in any other <hi>state</hi> then the Baptized: Nor 2. Is it absolutely necessary that they have any further degree of grace. For 1. the Lords Supper is the means of increasing grace, and doth not ever suppose it encreased. 2. The Apostles admitted the new baptized into their communion, to breaking of bread and prayer presently, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. and 4. Indeed there is requisite in the Receiving, and before, thoughts suitable to that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, according to its difference from other Ordinances; and so there is in each Ordinance according to its nature: And in that sense, as to some acts, its as true that there is somewhat more required also in Baptism, then in receiving the Lord Supper. But thats nothing to the case.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is granted me by almost all, on supposition that we can have a Classis to exclude the offender: And many grant that every Minister may suspend one from the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in this case, by forbearing his own act. I wonder how so palpable a mistake did come to be so common with wise men, as that a single Pastor (at least when he is the sole Governor of that Church) may not exclude on just occasions? Doubtless they may without a Classis <hi>take</hi> in men into the Universal Church (for a Classis was not called for every mans Baptism:) Therefore if one man may be the sole Ruler of a particular Church (of which there's little reason to doubt) why may he not do the Office of a Ruler? But there's much to be said for this on a fitter occasion. See <hi>Gilesp. Aarons Rod. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>pag.</hi> 541.</p>
            <p>The last Consequence I take for granted, on what is said before, and the meer nothing that is said against it; <hi>viz.</hi> that if the Parents be in such a state in which they may not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to baptism, were it then to do, then may not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>be admitted</hi> on their right or Interest, because they are to come in as <hi>Theirs.</hi>

Baptism is ordained to admit all the baptized to be visible children of God: those that are Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously the children of the Devil, cannot be admitted to be (at that time) the visible children of God. Therefore they may not be Baptized.</p>
            <p>For the proof of the <hi>Major,</hi> see <hi>Gal,</hi> 3.26, 27, 28 29. <hi>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus: For as many of you as have been b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For the <hi>Minor</hi> of the main Argument, see 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Let no man deceive you; he that doth righteousness is Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: He that committeth sin is of the Devil. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the Devil. Whosoever doth not Righteousness is not of God.</hi>—] This Text proves also the inconsistencie of these two Estates.</p>

               <hi>Argu.</hi> 18. He that will not be Christs <hi>servant,</hi> may not be baptized (nor others on his account) But notorious ungodly ones, while such will not be Christs servants. <hi>Ergo.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved, in that it is part of Christianity in the Essence of it: He is to be believed in, and accepted as Lord and King: All his Subjects are his servants. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved from <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Know ye not that to whom ye yield your selves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey? whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> 19. He that will not hear Christ as the Prophet of the Church, may not be baptized: But notorious ungodly <hi>Ones will</hi> not hear Christ as the Prophet of the Church: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be baptized: (nor any on their account.)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved 1, In that it is part of Christianity: And to be baptized into his name, is to take him as our Prophet. 2. Such should be <hi>cut off, Acts,</hi> 3.23. (Mr. <hi>Gilespie</hi> and others expound <hi>Moses cutting off,</hi> of Excommunication:) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not admitted in such a condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> 20. If notoriously ungodly baptized Parents are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously uncapable of presenting and dedicating their children to Christ, &amp; covenanting with him on their behalf, then are they
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:107958:173"/>
Notoriously uncapable of Interesting their children in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or Baptism (Or, Then may we not baptize them on their account) But the Antecedent is true; as I prove thus. 1. A man that notoriously refuseth to accept of Christ himself, and to take him as he is offered, to covenant truly with him, is Notoriously uncapable of doing the same on the behalf of another: For he that hath no true faith for himself, cannot have it for his child: (though perhaps he may be content that his child let go some sins for Christ, which he cannot spare himself.) but, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He that is, Notoriously a perfidious Breaker of his own verbal covenant, is while such, uncapable of covenanting with Christ for another. For such a mans word is not to be taken; he hath forfeited his credit, till he repent and return to his fidelity: But such are all the notorious Ungodly. <hi>Ergo.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Consequence of the main Argument, is clearly good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he that brings any child to be baptized, must covenant for it with Christ; for it is a mutual Covenant that must be entered in Baptism. The child cannot consent or covenant by it self, therefore it must do it by others, and that must be those that present it, as having Right on their Account: And he that is not Willing for himself, cannot Consent for another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> 21. From the second Commandment, with all those other Texts that express Gods differencing the seed of the wicked and godly. If it be Gods will that there shall be visible notes of his displeasure on the children of the Notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ungodly, as theirs, in comparison of the children of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then we ought not to baptize them. But the Antecedent is true; Therefore so is the Consequent.</p>
            <p>Here note, 1. That we speak not of any children of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, who at age renounce their Parents waies, and themselves fear God (of whom <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. speaks:) but only of them, while Infants, and as theirs. 2. In the Antecedent I mean that God hath so visibly noted out the children of the Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously ungodly, as such, to lie under his displeasure, that he would have the Church and all take notice of it, and esteem of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:107958:174"/>
them accordingly. The reason of the Consequent is, because Baptizing puts them among those that are visibly under Gods favour, the Church being called the Body of Christ, the House of the Living God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But those that be visibly from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his special favour, should not be put into such a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>The Antecedent I prove 1. from the second Commandment: where note 1. that the parties differenced are the Posterity of them that hate God on one side, and on the other those that love him and keep his Commandments: Not only between Professors of Faith, or of Infidelity, but between godly and ungodly: it being usual in Scripture to call the ungodly Haters of God, and justly; and it is those that love him not, and keep not his Commandments, that are called haters of him. 2. Note, that it is a visible mark of his favour which he there putteth on the seed of the godly, from whence we may well gather their Church-membership, as I have shewed elsewhere. Therefore it is a visible note of his disfavour which he putteth on the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously ungodly; from whence we may gather that they are not to be visible Church-members. 3. Note also that this is in the Decalogue, and a standing determination of God, and not ceremonial or transitorie.</p>
            <p>Note also how the Scripture all along concurs. The seed of <hi>Cain</hi> are called the children of men, though its like they acknowledged God to be their Maker, who might have heard <hi>Adam</hi> tell them of the creation. And indeed it is ungodliness and wickedness that God drowned the World for. Yet are these children of <hi>Cain</hi> as an excommun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Infants of all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the world are drowned with their Parents in the Flood: The Infants of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> are destroyed with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who are said by <hi>Jude</hi> to suffer the vengeance of eternal fire, as an example (not of original sin) but to those that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter should live ungodly. The children of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed for their Parents sins, while <hi>Israels</hi> are preserved. The children of <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

were all stoned to death and burned for his sin, <hi>Josh.</hi> 7.15.26. It was Gods command to <hi>Israel,</hi> that if any City were reduced and drawn away to serve other gods, that City, infants and all should be destroyed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.12, 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God commanded <hi>Israel</hi> to put to death all the Infants of all the Nations that were given them for Inheritance, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.16, 17. which was for the Parents abomination. The <hi>Amalekite</hi>'s infants must all be slain: So are all the Males among the little ones of the <hi>Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Numb.</hi> 31.17. The children of <hi>Daniels</hi> Accusers are cast into the Den of Lions, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.24. And <hi>Babylones</hi> little ones must be dash't against the stones, <hi>Psal.</hi> 137.9. The wicked are cursed in the fruit of their body, yea, <hi>It</hi> is cursed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.18.32.41. Christ would have gathered the children of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> great and small, but did not, because they would not. On that Generation he brought all the righteous blood that was shed from <hi>Abel</hi>; and takes witness from their own mouths, that They were the children of them that killed the Prophets. Now I think, if the children of the notoriously ungodly lie under Gods visible displeasure thus far, they should not by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism (as theirs) be taken into that society that are visibly in his favour, and distinguished from all the world as a Peculiar people, a Holy Priesthood, a Royal Nation, the Children of God, the Body and Spouse of Christ, and the Temple of the Holy Ghost.</p>

               <hi>Argu.</hi> 22. That Doctrine is not found which confoundeth the Catechumeni, as to their description, which the rightfull members of the Church. But such is the Doctrine that we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; yea worse. For the Catechumeni might understand and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the fundamentals (which is all the Title that these men can produce by their profession: But they were not to be admitted into the Church till they had more, even resolutions (expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) to obey: Nay, many such without the Church had some willingness to learn, and waited long on teaching to that end: But so will not many of these in question. I plead not for any Error of the Antients, in keeping men from Baptism that were fit for it; but only mention such as were but in preparation to such fitness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 23. That Doctrine is at least much to be suspected,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:107958:175"/>
which by contradicting the very Natural Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth tend strongly to disgrace Jesus Christ, and tempt the world to Infidelity. But such is the Doctrine which we oppose. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the proof of the <hi>Minor,</hi> Note, 1. That it is a natural cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Verity, that the Righteous Lord loveth Righteousness, and that he is a hater of sin in whomsoever, and delighteth in that Holiness which is his very Image; and that God is no Accepter of persons, but in every Nation, he that feareth him, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Righteousness, is accepted of him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Note, That the Doctrine which we oppose, holdeth, that Jesus Christ doth set so much by the bare believing that He is the Son of God, yea the verbal profession of it, and so little by Holiness, that if men will but make that profession, let them live how they will, let them be Adulterers, Murderers of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Mothers, perjured to God and Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they lose not their Right to this Priviledge, that even the children of their bodies shall be of the family of Christ upon their Interest or Account: yea though themselves will not so much as soberly promise to amend, yea though they be Persecutors of any that would reform them, or any other way notoriously ungodly. Doth not this strongly tempt men to imagine that Jesus Christ came not to cure souls, and bring men back to God, and save them from sin, but to seek himself and his own honor, and that he preferred the acknowledgement of his dignity before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of God, and mens souls?

and to bring back revolted man to the Holy Image and obedience of his Maker, and who professed himself but the <hi>Way</hi> to the Father, and therefore established and valued faith in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but in order to the acknowledgement and love of God, and so of Godliness and Holiness, as its end and a greater good; yea that hath purchased us by his blood to a glory which doth consist in the fruition of God, in the perfection of Holiness, and hath sent forth his spirit into the souls of men to be in office their Sanctifier, and to make such wondrous changes on mens hearts, as shameth all the rest of the Religions of the world: yea who hath made his Kingdom to consist in Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost; and the heavenly wisdom to be first Pure, then Peaceable, Gentle, easie to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, and who hath sanctified to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works, and makes so strict and holy a Law to guide them as he hath done.

            <p>I admire that grave men among us, and Godly, who will stretch their wits to the uttermost to defend that which is the more common opinion of Divines of best repute among whom they live, before they will differ from them, can yet make so small a matter of differing from the Fathers, and universal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Primitive Churches, (as far as we have any means to disprove it.) That it was their Judgement and practice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to baptize any Notorious ungodly person, while such, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears past all doubt. 1. By their requiring a profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. 2. And a profession of Believing in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and renouncing the world, the flesh and the Devil, and promising a new life. 3. By their Judging the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized to be in a state of salvation, which was on supposition of their true sanctification. 4. By their too much care in delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Catechumeni (in later times) lest they should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:107958:176"/>Let me recite the testimonies of one or two of our own, and one of those Antients, each of the highest Authority in the present case.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Gilespie, Aarons Rod. l.</hi> 3. <hi>ch.</hi> 15 <hi>pag.</hi> 544. saith, [<hi>It were a Profanation of the Sacrament of Baptism, to Baptize a Catechumene, a Jew, or a Pagan, professing a Resolution to turn Christian, he being manifestly under the power of abominable Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sins, and being still a prophane and wicked liver, although he were able to give a sound and orthodox Confession of Faith.</hi>] From whence he argueth, that therefore the same men are not to be admitted to the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Spanhemius Epist. ad D. Buch. pa.</hi> 14. gives three reasons to prove that <hi>Athrists, Epicures, Profane men,</hi> qui vitam inter fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitia traducunt, &amp; aperte ostendunt se non habere fidem, quâ creditur, nec spiritum sanctificationis secundum ullum ejus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, quamdiu in ista impietate perstant, nec poenitentiam tum profitentur tum spondent, <hi>may not lawfully be baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And our Divines commonly say, In Baptism we engage our selves to a holy Life: those therefore which live not holily are covenant-Breakers, and herefore have not Right to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the covenant. See <hi>Piscat. in Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>Obser. ex v.</hi> 6 8.10. &amp; <hi>in Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>v.</hi> 19. &amp; <hi>Davenane is Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Peter Martyr in Rom.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Zanch. in Ephes.</hi> 5. <hi>loc. de Bapt. cap.</hi> 3 <hi>Thes.</hi> 37. many more I omit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Doctrine of the Antients I have given a touch of elsewhere, as to these points. All that I shall now say is to desire the learned Reader (that hath not done it) to peruse all over that book of <hi>Augustine de fide &amp; operibus,</hi> which is wholly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on this subject. There were then some Christians, whose opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was, that if a Heathen lived in whoredom, when he turned Christian, he was not to be refused Baptism till he would promise Reformation, and would put away his whore; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the Apostles baptized upon believing, and required obedience afterward, and works are to be the consequent fruit of Faith, therefore the Pastor should first baptize them on their profession of Faith, and then help them on to obedience after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Yet were these men so far from imagining that it was not Justifying faith that is required to Baptism that upon that
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:107958:176"/>
supposition, they run into another error, which <hi>Augustine</hi> takes to be their worst and the root of the rest; and that was, That this Belief in Christ was the foundation, (meaning a dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal faith) and that an evil life of such baptized believers was but hay and stubble built on the foundation, and such should be saved, though as by fire. Against all this <hi>Augustine</hi> wrote that Book, and proves that such may neither be saved nor baptized, and that Faith is another thing, and Obedience of another necessity than they imagined. The Reading of this Book I expect will do more in this present Argument, to perswade most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters, than the perusing of all my Arguments, because of the Authority of <hi>Augustine,</hi> and especially of the Church, whose Practice he discovereth.</p>
            <p>If it be said that this concerneth not Infants, I answer, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it will be but few that will not by what is said, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that no man in an estate unfit for Baptism, can convey a right to his Infants to be baptized. Read also <hi>Augustin. Epist.</hi> 23. <hi>ad Bonifac.</hi> where is much worthy observation. And <hi>ad Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Euchrid. c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We come next to answer the chief Arguments of the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which are not already answered in what went before, in way of defence to the several Arguments as we propounded them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. The children of Notorious ungodly parents had right to circumcision, before Christs Incarnation: therefore the children of such have right to Baptism since.</p>
            <p>This is the great Argument, besides which there is scarce any that hath a shew of difficulty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is certain that the Fabrick of the Jewish Politie, especially the grounds and Reasons of all Gods Institutions of those times, are so imperfectly known by us, that it is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unfit to reduce so many clear Gospel Arguments to one dark one from those Laws. For it is a most necessary Rule, that in all our Disquisitions, we must reduce Uncertainties to Certainties, and not Certainties to Uncertainties: our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must be <hi>à notioribus ad mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and professeth that he doth not so, but from the ground of the Institution:
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:107958:177"/>
And how dark are those grounds in some Cases to us?</p>
            <p n="2">2. I yet see no proof of the Proposition, that then such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of notoriously ungodly parents had (on their account) a right to Circumcision.</p>
            <p>Where first note, that we must first denominate men Godly or Ungodly, as principally in their respect to God himself, so next from their respect to the Rule of Godliness then in force; which being not the same in many things then as now it is, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness was not in the exercise, the same materially then in all things as it is now. The sum of it was, to take the Lord that Redeemed them from bondage to be their God, and to give themselves in consent to be his people, and obey his Laws.</p>
            <p>Now let us see where is their proof of the proposition. They say, all Israelites whatsoever were to be Circumcised, by right; I answer, that's no proof: Let us look to the Institution, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 8, 9, 10. and there we shall find, 1. That the Covenant goes before the Seal; and this Covenant is, that God will be a God to them, which they were on their parts to take him to be. 2. This Covenant is with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed after him. 3. Next follows an Injunction that he and his seed do keep Gods Covenant. 4. And then is Circumcision Instituted (though called the Covenant, yet but) the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as it is called <hi>ver.</hi> 11. By all which it appeareth that the seal Instituted supposeth the Covenant Instituted, and the seal applied supposeth the Covenant entered, and then by that it is signed between God and them: As if the Prince confer such Lands and honors on a Noble man and his seed in all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and require every Heir to come, and upon taking the Oath of Allegiance, to receive the great seal for the confirming of his Title: This supposeth that this Noble man and all his seed, that expect that benefit, do continue their Allegiance; that for all this Grant, If any of them turn Traytor, his Posterity can receive no right from him, but it is prevented.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is known that every Israelite was oft to renew this Covenant with God: yea all the Body of the People often together did it in <hi>Moses</hi> daies, and they owned God continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Sacrifices, and other Holy Worship. Moreover consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the People at that time seem to be generally or mostly
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:107958:177"/>
such as were not of the strain that now we are enquiring about, <hi>viz.</hi> Notoriously ungodly. To evidence this, Observ. 1. That they had holy, excellent Teachers, <hi>Moses, Aaron,</hi> &amp;c. and God among them in signs and wonders. 2. They were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally zealous in their way of Religiousness, which was very cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and laborious in comparison of what is now commonly done. 3. That they had most strict Laws, prohibiting all uncleanness; yea even Ceremonial, to teach them the evil of the greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uncleanness. 4. They are oft called a Holy and peculiar people: and God frequently chargeth them to hold to it, and remember that he was a Holy and Jealous God. 5. There were more severe penalties then, and less indulgence to Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders then is under the Gospel. 6. Even <hi>Balaam</hi> testifieth for them, that God saw not iniquity in <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor transgression in <hi>Israel</hi>; that is no such Idolatry or ungodliness as was among the Heathen. 7. Note that the visible sins which they are most at that time accused of, and destroyed for, seem to be but either some particular Facts under Temptation, or some sad discoveries of their Mutabil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet I must desire that none here mistake me, as if I would free the <hi>Israelites</hi> from any charge that God layeth on them by his Prophets: I speak not now of their times of greatest Apostacy and Rebellion: And I know that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when the Princes and Rulers were evil or negligent, then the Church must needs be defiled, and the Laws of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>executed.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:107958:178"/>
And perhaps I may mis-interpret some texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to a more gentle sense then others do, or then is meet: Of this let every man judge as he please: its no time now to call all such texts to account. If any be offended at my charitable thoughts of the body of the Jews (Gods only peculiar people on earth) let them blot out these fore going considerations, or take them as <hi>non dicta</hi>; for I lay not the stress of my Cause up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. But the Principal thing which I would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served is this. That by Gods Political Law of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, all <hi>Notorious ungodly</hi> persons were to be put to death; yea, and many far short of that degree. I know it is a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie among Divines, what is meant by all those places, that speak of [<hi>Cutting off from his people.</hi>] Mr. <hi>Gilespie</hi> with others think it is meant of Excommunication. Others think it is meant of the Magistrates punishing them with death, or Gods doing it extraordinarily if the Magistrate should be negligent. The main reason brought against this Exposition, is, that it seems too bloody. But it must be considered how terrible the Law was, and how God designed in it the manifestation of his Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, Holiness and hatred of sin. If every man that did ought presumptuously might be cut off from the Church, why not from the Living? The Apostle in <hi>Acts</hi> 3.23. reciting that of <hi>Moses,</hi> saith, [<hi>He that will not hear that Prophet shall be destroyed from the People.</hi>] However let that phrase mean what it will, we have proof enough beside, that not only all notorious Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ones, but also many Godly ones that fell into gross sin, were all to be put to death. From whence I argue thus:</p>
            <p>If it was the Law of God that all such persons should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently put to death, then was it not the will of God, that their Infants should have Right to Circumcision for their sakes, no nor on any other account: But the Antecedent is true, therefore the Consequent.</p>
            <p>The Reason of the Consequence is this: Either th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se mens children were born before the parents turned ungodly, or after. If before then were they circumcised the eighth day, as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Godly. If after, then it was against Gods Law, that they should be born, much less circumcised. For if Gods Law had been fulfilled, the parents had been put to death, (we speak
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:107958:178"/>
of both parents) and then how could they have had a child?</p>
            <p>All the doubt then lying in the Antecedent, I shall from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture put it is past doubt. Let us look over all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and see whether Death were not to be inflicted for the gross breach of them, except the last, which is secret in the heart.</p>
            <p>For the first Commandment, see <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. <hi>If a Prophet wrought wonders to entice to worship strange Gods, or if the nearest</hi> kinsman secretly enticed them to it [<hi>to thrust them out of the way which the Lord commanded them to walk in,</hi> ver. 5.] <hi>he must be put to death.</hi> If a City be withdrawn by such, they are all to be put to death; Children, Cattle, and Goods were to be destroyed and consumed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.18. They were not to save alive any person, no not Infants, of the Cities that God delivered them to dwell in, <hi>Lest they teach them to do according to their abominations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Exod. 22.20. <hi>He that sacrificeth to any God, save the Lord on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, shall utterly be destroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The breach of the second Commandment is punished with Death, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.26.27, 28. The Priests of <hi>Baal</hi> are slain, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.40. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 10.21.22, to 29. &amp; 23.5, 19, 20. Yea, in one word, he that would not be Godly positively, was put to death, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.12, 13. It is spoken in their commendations, that they <hi>entered into a Covenant, to seek the Lord God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with all their heart, and with all their soul; that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel, should be put to death, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther small or great, whether man or woman.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Lev. 24.15, 16. <hi>Whosoever blasphemeth the name of the Lord, was to be put to death</hi>: So ver. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Every one that did any work on the sabbath, or defiled it, was to be put to death,</hi> Exod. 31.14, 15. &amp; 35.2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that smitteth or curseth his Father or Mother, must be put to death,</hi> Exod, 21.15.</p>
            <p>Murderers, Man-stealers, Incestuous, Sodomites, Adulteres, Wizards were to be put to death, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. yea and those that turn after Wizards. Any Prophet that shall presume to speak a word in Gods name, which he hath not commanded him to speak, or that speaketh in the name of other Gods,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:107958:179"/>
must die, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.20. In some cases Fornicators must die, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. Every man that forsook God and broke his Covenant was to be stoned to death, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Many the like passages might be cited; but I will conclude with two or three of chief note for this purpose.</p>
            <p>Deut. 21.18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voyce of his father, or the voyce of his mother, and that when they have chastened him will not hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the Elders of his City, and to the Gate of his place: and they shall say unto the Elders of his City, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voyce, he is a Glutton and a Drunkard: And all the men of his City shall stone him with stones that he die: So shall you put away evil from among you, and all Israel shall hear and fear.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Here I suppose it will be granted, that it is the Parents duty to restrain their children from all ungodliness; and that Gluttony and Drunkenness are but instanced in, as part, in stead of all the rest. And if all children must be put to death that will not be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for good by their Parents, then when they are dead they will beget no children who may claim Right to Circumcision for their sakes.</p>
            <p>But if any say, that this extendeth not to those that are from under their Parents tutorage or Government, I answer, First, Sure the same sin deserveth the same punishment afterward from the Magistrate, if they are obstinate against his pious precepts. Secondly, but to put the case out of doubt, see <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.12. <hi>And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the Priest, that standeth to minister there before the Lord thy God, or unto the Judge, even that man shall die, and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel, and all the people shall hear and fear, and do no more p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>esumptuously.</hi>] To these <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19, 20. From all which it is evident, that as Impenitency or Obstinacy in sin is the great cause of Excommunication now, so was it then to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Death; and consequently that the evident discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of a state of Ungodliness (and many more) were then punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Death according to Gods Law.</p>
            <p>And then it must needs follow, that no child of a man Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:107958:179"/>
ungodly, born of his procreation in that condition, had right to Circumcision: For dead men do not procreate.</p>
            <p>And whether [<hi>Cutting off from his people</hi>] be meant of capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal punishment, such places as <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.14, 15. would make one doubt: [<hi>Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it, shall surely be put to death: for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever doth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from amongst his people.</hi>] See also <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.17, 18.</p>
            <p>And if it be meant of Excommunication, if the parent be [<hi>cut off from his people,</hi>] then cannot his son for any Interest of his, be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nnumerated to that people, and entred among them.</p>
            <p>The first Observation and this last laid together, clear the whole Cause, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Magistrate was not to force any barely to be Circumcised, but to enter into Gods Covenant, and so to be circumcised: and therefore was he not to force any out of the Covenant to be circumcised: and then, that he was to cut off the Covenant-breakers, or notoriously ungodly ones.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The next Observation that I would give towards the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering of this Objection, is, that it could not be expected that any Magistrate, Priest, or other in Power, should hinder any <hi>Israëlite</hi> from circumcising his children. For to circumcise them was every mans Duty, and to baptize them is every mans Duty in the world now: that is, to give up himself and his child in sincere Covenant to God, and seal it, as he hath appointed: but not dissemblingly to use the sign, without the Covenanting and Resignation on his part. Now if any <hi>Israëlite</hi> were unfit for this Ordinance, it being the Magistrates duty to put him to death, or cut him off, he could not judge him unfit, and so forbid him the Ordinance, without condemning himself. The first thing that lay upon him was, to cut him off for the sin which caused his unfitness.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Note also that Circumcision much differed from Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism in this, that it was not the Priests work but Parents to circumcise his children: this being so, no wonder if there were not the scruples about the persons fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ness and worthiness, and the childrens right, as now there is in Baptism. For what man is so prone to scruple or question his own Right or his childrens, as another may be? And the same reason that
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:107958:180"/>
should move a Parent to question his Right, would move him also to Repent and Recover his Right. No wonder therefore if the Execution answered not Gods Institution.</p>
            <p>To all this it is objected, that we read not that any Infants were kept back, or that God blamed them for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I have given sufficient Reasons. 2. God would rather blame them for that sin which caused their unfitness, it being not the Circumcising then, in the Baptism now, that he is against directly, but the ungodliness; and therefore would not have the ordinances forborn, but on supposition that the sin will not be forborn: tha's the disease that he would have them heal both then and now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. Joshua</hi> is commanded by God to Circumcise them, and accordingly he doth Circumcise all the people: yet no doubt many of them were Notoriously ungodly. <hi>Josh.</hi> 5. <hi>Answer</hi> 1. <hi>Joshuah</hi> did but command it to be done. 2. I have given the reason why all should be Circumcised. 3. It is unproved that any one of them were know to <hi>Joshuah</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. To clear this further, I will add two more obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Note that all those that were charged with Murmuring, Unbelief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the wilderness, were all destroyed there, and also that for 40 years their Children had been uncircumcised. Only <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi> were left. So that those of 40 or 30 or 20 years of age must be Circumcised on the account of their own Covenanting, and not plead the right of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Note also, that the very examples of Gods Judgements do intimate that Notorious Ungodliness was not so common among them as some imagine. Multitudes are thought very Godly now, that murmur in lesser straits than they were then in, and that are palpably guilty of much unbelief, or less tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All Israel was put to the worse for the sake of one <hi>Achan,</hi> that plundred no man unjustly, but only thought to rescue some desirable treasures from the flames: I wish that no soldiers would now do worse that are reputed extraordinarily Godly, and are never blemished by such actions in their own eyes or any others. I will not stand to add more, because I have been so long.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:107958:180"/>If any man Judge that all this is no sufficient answer to their Argument from Circumcision, I further add. 2. Though this be my own thoughts, yet it is not a few of those Divines that are Godly and Learned, that give one of these two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing answers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That External and Ceremonial Purity was then most openly looked at, which was but a Type of the spiritual purity under the Gospel: and therefore no wonder if God that then permitted <hi>Polygamie</hi> without reproof, permitted the circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Jews, yea encouraged it, seeing that the Body of that People were Gods visible Heritage, as a Type of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick visible Church now. The Magistrates therefore might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them as Jews to be Circumcised, but so may not ours compell us as Englishmen.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Circumcision was not only appointed to be the seal of the Covenant of grace, but also a peculiar Covenant annexed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed: and that not all, but those only that were to possess the land of <hi>Canaan</hi>: And therefore as it was not all the people that God had on earth that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to possess the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but only the Israelites, and those proselites that came over to inhabite among them; so neither was Circumcision commanded to all, nor was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them: but to a Jew it was necessary as a Jew, how ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly soever.</p>
            <p>Though this be none of my answer, yet among many Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable opinions, I see not but the <hi>Thesis</hi> which I deny, is much more improbable than this is; and therefore if I needs must hold one, I see not but that I should rather hold this.</p>
            <p>Nor will this weaken our Argument for Infant-Baptism, fetcht from the Infant Church-membership of the Jews (which is the great objection) as long as the whole <hi>species</hi> of Infants are of distinct consideration from a Jews Infant, as such; and as long as the grand Covenant of grace, and the peculiar promise to the Jews, are so distinct; yea and Church-membership, and Circumcision so distinct as they are, Let them leave us to make good our Arguments in this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> 2. We may lawfully Baptize the Infants of any Church-members.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:107958:181"/>
Notoriously ungodly persons are Church-members, therefore we may lawfully Baptize their Infants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I deny the <hi>Major.</hi> Because some Church-members are in such a condition as that the first thing you are bound to do with them, is to cast them out, (or suspend them till then) When you are bound presently to cast him out, you are not at the same time to give him the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, nor his Infants on his account the Sacrament of Baptism.</p>
            <p>Indeed if they had <hi>Right</hi> to Church-membership, their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants might have so too.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Prove the Antecedent. 2. The question is not what men mis-judged them, but how God esteemed or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them. 3. God would not have them to be Church-members, while such, whom he commanded the Magistrate to put to death. But, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Obj</hi> They were not to be excommunicate or put away from the Passover. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. He that is stoned to death is excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate and put away from the Passover. He that is cut off from the living, is put out of the Church on earth. 2. I will not waste time to prove Jewish excommunication, till I know of some tolerable answer given to that which Mr, <hi>Gilespie</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side many others) hath written so largely already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Infants in Covenant have right to Baptism The Infants of Notorious Ungodly Parents are in Covenant. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I have in my account to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> told you so fully, how far they are in Covenant, and how far not, that I must refer you thither, and not here recite it. I deny that God is actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to them in the covenant of Grace, which Baptism sealeth; but conditionally only, and so he is to Infidels that persecute
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:107958:181"/>
it. Though they may be engaged more to God by their own Verbal covenant to him; but that altereth not the case.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> 4. Dogmatical faith giveth Right to Baptism. Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ungodly Parents have a Dogmatical faith. <hi>Ergo.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I have said so much to Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> on this, that I need not now to add any more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obje. Simon Magus</hi> had a faith which gave him right to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. But <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was then a Notorious ungodly man; therefore a Notorious ungodly man may have a faith that may entitle him and his to baptism. <hi>Ans.</hi> See what is said to this in the place before cited. Further 1. I yield that <hi>Simon</hi> had a faith of superficial Assent, such as the Devils have in a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: and that he professed more than he had; and that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Apostle was warranted to baptize him. 2. But I deny the Minor that he was then notoriously ungodly. Consider well of <hi>Psalm.</hi> 50.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> 5. <hi>Josiah</hi> was lawfully Circumcised upon the Right of <hi>Manasseh</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi>; but <hi>Manasseh</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> were Notoriously ungodly: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans</hi> Either <hi>Josiah</hi> was born before his Father <hi>Ammon</hi> proved Notoriously ungodly, or after. If before, then he received not his right from a Notoriously ungodly Parent. If after, 1. Then was it contrary to Gods Laws, and so could be no true Right. For by Gods Laws <hi>Manasseh</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> should have been put to death. And if it be said that these Laws were not to be executed on the Soveraign; I answer, the want of a power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution doth not hinder, but that they notoriously lost their Right, though they kept possession, and therefore could convey no Right. It follows therefore that either <hi>Josiah</hi> was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed without Right (if it be first proved that his father was such at the time of his birth): or else that he had his right some other way, intimated in the General answer to the Jews case. And to them that think the former a hard saying, I shall anon shew that the rule holds good in this case that <hi>Quod fieri non debet, factum valet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24 16. The Children shall not be put to death for the Fathers sin; and we read not that Ecclesiastical censure should be more severe. The child of a Thief is not
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:107958:182"/>
committed with him to prison; and I see no reason that he is committed with him to Sathan: therefore there is right to Baptism in the child of an excommunicate person.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The question is not of excommunicating a child, or committing him to Satan, but of addmitting him into the Church at first: The Parent cannot convey to the child the Right whith he hath lost; we speak only of the Children born after the Parents are excommunicated <hi>vel sententiâ vel ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Jure.</hi> But of this enough (I think) before: the state of the question is by these Arguers strangely over-lookt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> 7. Those that the Apostles Baptized had been ungodly immediately before, only at the present they did profess Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: And so do many of these that you call Notoriously un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If it be a probably serious and credible profession (fit for that name) then are they not Notoriously ungodly. 2. According both to Scripture, and Reason, and common use, a mans first or second profession may be credited. But if he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently break his word, his credit is lost: he is not capable at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of covenanting again, till he have by actual Reformation recovered his credit.

            <p>The truth is, had we Magistrates that would so severely punish notorious ungodliness, as (I think) they should do according to Gods Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that most of this Controversie would be ended: and instead of driving men from Gods Ordinances, they should be driven from such ungodliness. But when Magistrates are so tender of hurting mens Bodies, that they let their souls perish, or are so much against formality and outside Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they had rather men were Heathens, and openly wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and sinned with Body and Soul too, than with the Soul alone; this puts us upon a necessity of doing the more in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration by Church power, than else we should do.</p>

               <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. If no Children of notorious ungodly parents have Right to Baptism, 1. then is their Baptism Null. 2. And then ours is Null which we received, on supposition of the Right of such parents. And 3. then must many be baptized again; For if Ministers had no power to do it, it must needs be Null. The determination of this Question about the nullity of Baptism, depends upon the true definition of Baptism: some only put Gods part and the Ministers into the definition, and not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers act of profession, covenanting or self-resigning to Christ; taking him to be no Agent in the Essentials of the Ordinance, but a recipient; and that the Acts on his part are only Integrals, or Duties necessary to his participation of the benefits of the Covenant. If this definition hold (most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with our Divines) then the resolution is most easie. For the Minister performed all that was essentiall to Baptism: And therefore that which is undone, is only the mans duty on his own or childs behalf: that which was well done (as to the act) is not to be done again, that is, the Ministerial Baptism (though sinfully misapplyed;) but that which was undone; that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. the persons duty; 2. and thereupon Gods Grant (actually) of the benefits. According to this definition of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, if through error a Pagan be baptized in the true form, it is not Null as to that form of the Ordinance, nor to be done again when he is converted; but only his own duty was Null, and to be done again For example; if one that cannot speak
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:107958:183"/>
our Language should be thought to profess faith in Christ by signs, and be baptized thereupon, and it after appear that it was no such profession, but contrary: so if we should mistake a Pagans child for a Christians. I pretend not to decide the Question, Whether this be the rightest definition of Baptism, or best Answer to the present Doubt; but if this hold (as it is common) all is clear against the pretended Nullity or re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it hold not, let the Objectors answer themselves, who say that a <hi>Dogmatical</hi> faith gives right to Baptism: We have abundance of people that have not so much as a <hi>Dogmatical</hi> Faith; that know not who Christ is, nor what he hath done; nor are they in most places (since the Directory was in use) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to profess their faith when they offer their children to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; Are the children of these persons to be re-baptized? or themselves, if it were their case? or is the Administration of the Lords Supper to such a Nullity, or only unprofitable? I have had the aged here, that have said, Christ the Son of God was the Sun in the Firmament: yet they have had both Sacraments. Answer this for your selves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But suppose the persons covenanting be essential to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, let us so far advantage the Objectors as to deal with them on that ground.</p>

I distinguish between [the <hi>Nullity</hi> of the <hi>external</hi> part, commonly called, Baptism, containing the Ministerial Administration, and the persons Reception of the Water and Washing, with his profession, or external covenant to God;] And [the <hi>Nullity</hi> of Gods Engagement or Covenant to the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner actually; and so of the sinners Reception of the Benefits of Baptism] Among which Benefits I distinguish, [the special and spiritual, as pardon, Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] from the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and external, such as are [the external Priviledges of the Visible Church.] Whereupon I answer first to the Matter in these following Propositions: and then to the Argument, as in form.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Son, and Holy Ghost, (at least implicitely, if not by full Verbal expression) If the party use but the bare name of God, while he professeth, or openly discovereth that it is not indeed God the Father, Son or Holy Ghost that he meaneth. If he openly put in any exception against any essential part of the Christian Faith or Covenant; as to say, I will only be pardoned by Christ, but not sanctified; then, I conceive, it is no Baptism. But if there be all the exterior Essentials, there the exterior Baptism is not Null nor to be repeated. 2. The foresaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Baptism is effectual to the engaging or obliging of the person so baptized: And so his own part of the Covenant is not Null. A Dissembling promise bindeth the Promiser in Law: for his dissimulation cannot hinder his own Obligation, though it may anothers. <hi>Nemini debetur commodum ex proprio delicto</hi>; 3. But if there be not sincerity in the Covenanter, beyond all this, his Baptism is not available to the pardon of his sin, or to convey to him a R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght from God in any of the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits (directly as given to him) common or special. 4. Nor should the Minister or People believe this man, if by Notorious Ungodliness he give them reason to take his present Profession to be false, and himself now to dissemble. 5. But yet seeing a Natural Profession it is, though false; and the falshood is not declared by him at that time in the Ordinance, but disclaimed, but only is declared before he comes thither, therefore it seems to me, that there is the whole external Essence of Baptism, and therefore it is not Null, nor to be Repeated: But if that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son do afterward come to the sense of his own Dissimulation, and of the want of Truth in his Profession and Covenanting, he is to do then that which he did <hi>omit</hi> before, that is, to Covenant Truly; but not that which he did <hi>perform</hi> before, that is, to be externally Baptized. Such a person therefore should in the <hi>face of the Congregation,</hi> when he comes to <hi>Repentance,</hi> bewail (with the rest of the sins of his life) that falseness in the Baptismal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and there unfeignedly renew it: To which end, among others, in the antient Churches, it was usual in Confirmation to renew the Covenant more solemnly, where any flaw was found in the Baptism, which yet did not prove a Nullity. 6. And for external Church Priviledges, I conceive, that as God doth not
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:107958:184"/>
by Covenant give this person a right to them, so it is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Peoples Duty to deny them to the Parent himself, while he continueth notoriously ungodly: and the Error of wrong baptizing him, (or continuing him in the Church till now) will not oblige them to continue communion with him. But yet being admitted by Baptism, he should be solemnly cast out. But if the Guides of the Church be faulty and will not cast him out, then must the people distingu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, and therefore it is but a Physical and not a Moral communion that they have with him. Fourthly, because they are bound to hold communion with the Church in the use of Ordinances.</p>
            <p>And as for the Infant on that account baptized, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is so few acts of communion that an Infant is capable of, that the question seems to be of no great moment, how far we should have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them. But I conceive, we should take them as bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized persons externally, and so far members of the Church, though wrongfully admitted.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To which purpose, it is not altogether inconsiderable, that the Minister being by Office the Baptizer, and so the Judge of his own Actions, whom he ought to Baptize, and whom not; the action is not Null, though he mistake in his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and apply the Ordinance to one that he should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused. For he doth but an act belonging to his Office, though he do it amiss, or on a wrong subject. As if a Judge do pass sentence mistakingly, yet may it be valid, as to some execution; For though he have no power given him directly to pass a wrong Judgement, yet in order to passing a right Judgement, he hath power to follow his own discretion, and to pass such a
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:107958:184"/>
Judgement as shall (at least <hi>in tantum</hi>) stand, though it prove wrong. I confess the Ministerial Power somewhat differeth from a strict Decisive Judicial power; but yet there is so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance as may serve to illustrate the matter in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Then if a Minister Baptize a Heathen, it is not Null, because he is Judge whom to baptize.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. On the grounds we now go on, it it a contradiction to baptize a Heathen, that by a present profession is such. For Baptizing essentially containeth the persons external Covenant, or Profession of Believing in, and Dedication to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. If there be not by the person and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister such a Dedication, it is not Baptism: for if the bare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Washing were Baptism, then we were every day bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Now he that is Baptized into the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, doth thereby renounce Heathenism so far: Though whether his Profession shall be credited, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the probability of its verity or falsity. But on the first mentioned Definition of Baptism, it will be granted you, that Baptizing a Heathen is not a Nullity, as to the outward Baptism, though it be unprofitable and sinful. But to go on former grounds, I further answer, 2. It is one thing for a Judge to mis-judge a Cause that belongeth to his Judgement; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to mis-judge a cause that is wholly exempted from his Judgement, and belongeth not to him. In the former, his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may stand, in divers cases, because he was made Judge. In the later it is wholly Null, for he is but a Private man, and hath nothing to do in the business: and therefore whether he judge right or wrong, it is Null; As if a Judge go to another Bench, or into another Circuit, which is out of his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So here, where a man layeth claim to Baptism, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth himself a Christian the Minister is to judge whether he do it <hi>truly,</hi> or <hi>falsly;</hi> and therefore though he mistake, the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is not Null; For though the man be <hi>notoriously ungodly</hi> yet it is supposed that the Notoriousness is not absolutely unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable, and that the person doth not profess it when he comes to Baptism, but deny it, by professing Faith and Repentance; and so though the Church have sufficient ground to discredit that profession, by reason of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s contradicting Life, yet a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:107958:185"/>
it is, while the person claims a Right in Baptism for his child; and being a Controversie, the Pastor is judge. But if he baptize a Heathen that makes No Profession of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, true or false, then he medleth in a matter exempted from his Power, and out of his Commission, and contrary to it, and that which can be no Controversie fit for his determination: and therefore it is Null, and indeed no Baptism.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If the Pastor be thus Judge, how can you say as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That the Notoriously Ungodly are <hi>ipso Jure</hi> Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Ministers are limited in their judgement by the Law of God, which telleth how far they may or may not Judge, and how far it shall or shall not be effectual. The people are not absolutely tied to follow their judgement when they err. 2. God hath directed his Precepts for the avoiding of notorious ungodly ones to every Christian directly; and not only to the Pastors directly, and to the people only from them; so that if a Pastor command us to have communion and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with such, we are yet to avoid them (as far as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expressed) for all that, because Gods command is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Pastors. And the Law openly declareth that such are not true Christians (or Believers;) and therefore a Pastors sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence cannot make them such: His erring judgement may do more to bring a man into the Church than to keep him in; and in keeping him in as to possession, it may do more to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of those Priviledges which are to come meerly from his own hands and administration, than those wherein the people are to be instruments: Because he is more the Determiner of his own Actions, such as are baptizing, administring the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than of theirs: For his own Erring Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may <hi>ligare, etsi non obligare,</hi> entangle him in a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of sinning, till that Judgement be changed; but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tye them, nor so necessitate them to sin, though it may bring them under some inconveniences; and for Order and the Peace of the Church, they must quietly, peaceably, and submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively dissent. By the Law of the Land, the Kings Judges in his Courts and Assizes; were the lawfull Judges of a Traitor that was brought before them; and yet in some notorious Cases I
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:107958:185"/>
suppose he is condemned <hi>ipso Jure,</hi> and any man that can come at him might lawfully stab him without Judgement, yea is bound to do it: as if they had stood by and seen the Kings Person as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted, as the Lord Major of <hi>London</hi> did by <hi>Wat Tyler:</hi> Or if it were not in defence, but in avenging of the Treason, if hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous; and in several Cases they might kill them in a forcible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension if they resist, as they did by the Powder-Traitors here neer us at <hi>Holbetch</hi> House. But what need I mention these things, when it is so commonly known that in several Cases the Law enableth us for to Execute without Judgement, and yet this is no denial of the Authority of a Judge. So much to the matter of this Argument.</p>
            <p>And now in Sum to the Argument as in Form, 1. I deny the first Consequence, if it speak of the Nullity of the External Baptism, and not only of the Effect, and of Gods Engagement to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And consequently I deny the two later Consequences.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yea if our Parents Infant-Baptism were null, it followeth not that so is their childrens, which they had on their account. For our Parents might get a Personal Right in Christ and the Covenant after their Baptism, before they presented us in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism, though themselves had not been Baptized. 4. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will be no easie matter to prove that our Parents (any, or many at least) were notoriously ungodly at our birth. 5. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if all this satisfie not, but any man will yet needs believe, that it is an unavoidable consequence of our Doctrine, that [The Baptism of the Infants of Notoriously Ungodly Parents is null] though I am not of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s minde, yet I think it is a less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous opinion, and less improbable then theirs whom we now oppose. I know no such great ill effects it would have, if a man that mistakingly did suppose his Baptism Null, to satisfie his Conscience were baptized again, without denying the baptism of Infants, or any unpeaceable disturbing of the Church in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement thereof. I confess I never had any Damning or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating thoughts in my mind against <hi>Cyprian, Firmilian,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>African</hi> Bishops and Churches, who rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed those that were baptized by Hereticks, and in Council deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it necessary, and were so zealous for it. And, though
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:107958:186"/>
while I captivated my judgement to a Party and to admired Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, I embraced the new Exposition of <hi>Acts</hi> 19. which <hi>Beza</hi> thankfully professeth to have received from <hi>Marúixius,</hi> who as some say was the first Inventer of it; yet I must confess, that both before I knew what other men held, and since I better know who expound it otherwise, and on what grounds, I can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger think that is the meaning of the Text, especially when I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially peruse the words themselves. <hi>Calvin</hi> did not think that the 5th vers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was <hi>Paul</hi>'s words of <hi>John</hi>'s Hearers, but <hi>Luke</hi>'s words of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Hearers: and had no way to avoid the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which admitted their rebaptizing, but by supposing that <hi>Paul</hi> did not Baptize them again with Water, but with the Holy Ghost only. (and that of that, the fifth verse is meant.) I never read that <hi>John Baptist</hi> did Baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus expresly and denominatively, but only as <hi>Paul</hi> here speaks, that they should believe on him that should come after, whom <hi>Paul</hi> here Expositorily denominateth the Lord Jesus. And the words [<hi>When they heard this</hi>] seem to me plainly to refer to <hi>Paul</hi>'s say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the thing which they heard. Also the Connexion of the fifth verse to the sixth shews it: For else there is no reason given of <hi>Pauls</hi> proceeding to that Imposition of Hands, nor any satisfaction to the doubt at which he stuck, or which he propounded. And I confess, if I must be swayed by men, I had rather think well of the judgment of the Fathers, and Church of all Ages, who, for ought I find, do all (that have wrote of it) with one consent place a greater difference then we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>John's</hi> Baptism and Christs, and did expound this Text so as to assert that these 12 Disciples were baptized again by <hi>Paul,</hi> or on his Preaching. And for that great and unanswerable Argument wherewith <hi>Beza</hi> and others do seek to maintain the necessity of their sense, I confess it rather perswades me to the contrary: For whereas they imagine it intolerable for us to conclude or think that Christ was not Baptized with Christian Baptism, which himself did institute or command, I must needs say, I think it much more probable that he was not, seeing the Christ an Baptism is Essentially a Covenanting and Sealing of our Covenant with God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as our Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier, and appointed to be
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:107958:186"/>
Gods Seal of his washing away our sins by Christs blood; all which I know Christ was not capable of; And I suppose it more credible that Christ himself should be the Instituter of such an Evangelical Ordinance than <hi>John</hi>; and that he came to fulfill all Legal Righteousness, rather than that Evangelical Righteousness which consisteth in obeying himself, by doing those things which he hath appointed to redeemed sinners as such for their recovery. But of this let every man judge as he is illuminated. If I err, my danger and deserved reproach, I think, is no greater than the Ancient Fathers and the Church for so many hundred years that were of the same mind: Even they that were nearer to that Age when these matters of Fact were done.</p>
            <p>But for our case, its apparent there's no need of Re-baptizing; for there is no Nullity.</p>
            <p>I have done with the Argument, but yet there is one Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more that may not be passed over, though but on the by; and that is, Whether the Baptism of all those persons be not Null, and they to be Re-baptized, who were baptized by such as were <hi>Notoriously</hi> or <hi>Secretly</hi> unordained men, and no true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters? To which I only say in brief, No: 1. If they were not known to be no Ministers, it was no fault of ours: we wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Gods appointed way for his Ordinances; and therefore though they were sins to them, they are valid blessings to us, that were not guilty. 2. If they were Notoriously no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, though it might be our Parents sin that we were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to such for Baptism, yet it is not Null: For in these Relations these Instruments are not Essential to the Relation, nor to the Ordinance at all; Though I would be loth, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Papists did, to allow a Lay person (yea a woman saith <hi>Tertullian)</hi> to baptize in case of Necessity: yet should I not be very hasty to Re-baptize such, supposinig that they had all the substance of the Ordinance, as being baptized into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> I grant the Conclusion: It is every mans duty on earth that hears the Gospel, to be baptized, and give up his children (if he have any) to Christ in Baptism: that is to believe and consent to the Covenant of Grace, and so to be baptized. But it followeth not that it is their Duty to be Externally Baptized without Faith and such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Note also that this Argument as well proves that all the Children of persecuting Heathens should be baptized, as ungodly pretended Christians: For it is their Duty too.</p>

It is a duty to intend to relieve the poor, and perhaps to express it by promise, but to promise without any intent to perform it, is to lye, and so to sin. The tongue must not go before and without the heart, because the action of both is a duty. It were better say nothing at all. 2. The Sacrament of Baptism is not appointed to be affixed to every kind of duty, but to our dedication to God, and Gods acceptance of us.</p>

And it signifieth Gods action of washing the soul by the blood of Christ.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:107958:187"/>
and therefore am not bound to believe it, Secondly, They in <hi>N. England,</hi> as we hear do refuse to baptize all that are not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the members of their own Churches; but so do not we: they baptize not the members of the Universal Church, unless they be in a particular Church; but we do otherwise. And its reported that they requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>red positive proof of Conversion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a profession of faith and Repentance; but so do not we. Thirdly, Mens obstinacy in sin, and proceeding worse, will not warrant us to take an unlawful course in pretence to do them good. Fourthly, Do you give us any reason to believe that a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious ungodly person in your Church is in any better a state than an Infidel? Nay, that they are not in a state much worse? It is they therefore that should chiefly move you to compassion. Can you so lament the estate of the less miserable, and not of the more miserable?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it is good that at least in words they confess Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Either you speak of a <hi>Good</hi> of <hi>Duty,</hi> or a <hi>Good</hi> of <hi>Means</hi>: For the first, it is a Duty, and so good to confess Christ with heart and tongue; but if with the tongue alone, it is a sin, and no duty; Indeed the tongue conjunct with the heart doth part of the duty; but separated, it loseth the <hi>Goodness.</hi> And as a means, First, to their own salvation, it is not good, but rather condemneth them. Secondly, As to Gods honor, if he make it a means in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence thereto, thats no thanks to them.</p>
            <p>And if you did not now speak of the Notoriously Ungodly, but should suppose men to be near to the Kingdom of God, it doth not follow that therefore they must be baptized, because they have some good in them, (for some good must go before the nearest aptitude) nor yet that this good is the effect of Baptism in the unlawfully baptized; or if it were occasioned by Baptism, it followeth not that therefore unmeet persons should in hope of it be baptized. Use Gods means to his appointed Ends, and do not frame a course of means of your own heads for Gods ends. For it is the means of his appointment and blessing that must succeed.</p>
            <p>Though I have done with the Ques<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion it self, yet I suppose
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:107958:188"/>
it is not the least matter; in reference to our practice, that is yet behind, though I shall dispatch it in brief.</p>
            <p>What the better are we to know that we may not baptize the children of the Notoriously ungodly, till we know who these are; Let us therefore answer this Question, <hi>Whom must we take for Notoriously ungodly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As in all that is gone before, I doubt not but I shall be thought too rigid; so in this which followeth I as little question, but I shall be censured as too loose in my Doctrine, and charitable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the warrant of reason. But Truth is Truth, which I will search after as well as I can.</p>
            <p>And first on the Negative, I lay down these Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proposition.</hi> 1. In General, We are not <hi>Certain</hi> of every mans ungodliness, whom we probably, strongly, and groundedly <hi>sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi> to be ungodly. We may have more reason of fear than of hope concerning them, and yet not be able to conclude that they are certainly ungodly. Secondly, In General, It is not easie judging of the certainty of mens ungodliness at a distance, nor by some actual gross sins, till we have spoke to them, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished them, and discern what degree of obstinacy, and impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and wilfulness they are guilty of, or till we understand this certainly by those that have admonished them, and heard their Answers. Thirdly, It is hard judging of the certainty of a mans ungodliness by one, or two, or a few Actions, without knowing the course and scope of a mans life. Fourthly, I think it is few among a thousand of the common people that we can say are certainly ungodly, though we have reason to think that the most by far are so. More particularly Fifthly, A man must be guilty of more sin than <hi>Noah</hi> was, than <hi>Peter</hi> was in denying and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing Christ, that is notoriously ungodly: Yea than <hi>Lot</hi> was, who was drunk two nights together, and committed Incest with his own Daughters twice, &amp; that after the miraculous destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sodom,</hi> of his own Wife &amp; his own miraculous deliverance.</p>
            <p>The Opinion of most of our Divines, is, that a man that is Notoriously Ungodly (in the sense in hand) or unsanctified, must be a greater sinner than <hi>Solomon</hi> was, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. <hi>He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:107958:188"/>
many strange women of the Nations which God forbad the Israelites to joyn with</hi> (such as <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es seven hundred Wives: When he was old his Wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not perfect with the Lord, as</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids <hi>was. He went after</hi> Ashtoreth <hi>the goddess of the Sidonians, and after</hi> Milcom <hi>the abomination of the Amonites; and he did evil in the sight of the Lord. He built an high place for</hi> Chemosh <hi>the abomination of</hi> Moab <hi>in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for</hi> Molech <hi>the abomination of the children of Ammon. And likewise did he for all his strange Wives, which burnt Incense, and sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to their gods. And the Lord was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gry with him, because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel, which appeared to him twice, and had commanded him that he should not go after other gods, but he kept not that which the Lord commanded: he kept not the Covenant nor Statutes of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps you will Object, If this be not Notorious ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, what is? The sin was more hainous than Drunkenness, Fornication, yea or Murder it self; to be an Idolater, and to set it up to defile the Land: and it was a sin lived in who knows how long? besides his fleshly life, in having three hundred Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines and seven hundred wives: If all this may stand with Godliness, then we cannot know any man to be ungodly, &amp; then you will harden all the wicked in their presumption. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If I should but look on it as a thing uncertain whether <hi>Solomon</hi> had true grace at that time, or whether any intercision were made in his Justification and true Sanctification, I should incur the heavy censure of many Divines. If I question not the certainty of his grace and perseverance, then I am supposed to make every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon scandalous sinner to be fit for the reputation of a Saint, and to contradict the Apostle, who saith, <hi>If ye live after the flesh ye shall die</hi>; and <hi>neither Whoremonger, nor Idolater shall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> What is to be done in this strait? I will tell you plainly what I think safest, and let men think what they please. 1. It is not improbable that <hi>Solomon</hi> committed much of this sin meerly under temptation to please his Wives. 2. And that more of it lay in tolerating their Idolatry, than in his own committing it. 3. And that he did in other things continue his worship of the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:107958:189"/>
true God. 4. And that he repented and wrote the Book <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> on his Repentance, though the Historie make no mention of it. 5. Yet because the Holy Ghost doth so expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charge him with having <hi>his own heart turned after other gods, and going after them, and building high places to them, and his heart. turning from the Lord</hi>] and because the very setting up of so many Idols for others (his 700 Wives) is it self so hainous, I think it is undeniable that he was an Idolater, and lived in that sin, besides his living with 300 Concubines, and taking so fully the pleasure of his flesh, as in <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> he doth confess. We are certain that all these are hainous sins, and hazardous to a mans salvation.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If the Devil tempt any wicked man upon the consideration of this Example, to presume that he is in a state of Grace, and to think with himself [why may not I live in whoredom, or drunkenness, or worldliness, and yet be in a justified estate, as well as <hi>Solomon,</hi> who did worse,] he may do well to bethink himself that 1. It is certain that he that liveth after the flesh shall die, and that such gross sinners shall not enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. But we are not certain whether <hi>Solomon</hi> were justified and in a state of salvation at that time: it is a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie among wise godly learned men; and many of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers thought that he was not. 3. And therefore any prudent man will take heed of venturing his salvation upon such uncertainty; and will look more at the certainty which is on the other side, of perishing if he live in such sins. 4. And he may do well to consider, that though Godliness be the same in all Ages in the main, and equally necessary, yet some sins may be more damning at some time than other. In those daies of <hi>Solomon</hi> God had for some just reasons permitted or connived at the multiplicity of Wives, and little is said against Concubines: he had in his promises to his people made the most full and express mention of temporal blessings, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, long Life, prosperity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in his threatnings most expresly mentioned temporal evils: Spiritual and Eternal things were mentioned more obscurely and sparingly. This Honor was reserved to Christ and the Gospel, to bring Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalty (more) to light, and to promise Spiritual and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:107958:189"/>
blessings, and threaten Spiritual and Eternal misery, more expresly and fully: And consequently some sins of the flesh might not then be so certain marks of ungodliness as now: and as it is a greater measure of spiritual refining and purity that is promised and justly expected under the Gospel, so a greater measure must be looked after, by every man in himself, and by the Guides of the Church in its members; and we must go directly to Jesus Christ for our Direction in such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. So much to prevent the hurt of the wicked by this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>Yet I thought it necessary to make mention of it, 1. because it is objected by the opposers of Discipline, whose Objections must be answered. 2. and because there is something in it (at least <hi>ad hominem</hi>) that the over-censorious have reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of, as to the point in hand. How far we must take notice of such Examples in Discipline, we shall further shew anon. The rest of our propositions for the Negative shall be introduced by way of Answer to some Questions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 7. May we not take a man for Notoriously Ungodly, that hath been oft drunk, or oft committed fornication? <hi>Answ.</hi> The Practice is ungodly, and his Case sad; but we cannot certainly say he is graceless on that account alone, unless he live in it impenitently. <hi>Lot</hi> was twice drunk and incestuous: And it is not possible for us to say just how oft a man may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such a sin, and yet have true grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 8. May we not be certain that he is graceless or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, that is a frequent Swearer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is a very dangerous case; but simply considered, no certain evidence of the point in question. For 1. We know many that we see great signs of Grace in, and that are well repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of as eminent for Godliness, that do frequently commit as great sins as some kind of rash swearing seems to be: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, it is too rare to meet with a person so conscionable that will not frequently backbite, and with some malice or envie speak evil of those that differ from them in Judgement, or that they take to be against them, or that they are fallen out with: They will ordinarily censure them unjustly, and secretly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to disgrace them, and take away their good name, and love
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:107958:190"/>
those that joyn with them in it: So how many Professors will rashly rail and lye in their passions? How few will take well a Reproof, but rather defend their sin? How many in these times that we doubt not to be godly, have been guilty of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Guides, and of Schism, and doing much to the hurt of the Church: A very great sin. 2. <hi>Peter, Lot,</hi> and its like <hi>David,</hi> did oft commit greater sins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 9. But what if they live many years in Sweating, or the like sin, is not that a certain sign of Ungodliness?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is very sinfull and dangerous. But. 1. we know not what information or Conviction they have had of it, which much varies the Case. In some countries, where some oaths are grown customarie, and of no great ill repute, it is possible for a godly man to be long guilty of them, as it is known that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny well reputed of for Godliness, are in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reputation doth much with many even that are Godly, to make sin seem great or small: with us now a Swearer is reputed so great a sinner, that he is reckoned with Adulterers, and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards; but Censoriousness, Backbiting, Church-division, diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying those that rule over us in the Lord, spiritual Pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are greater then some swearing, do not so brand a man, nor make him odious with us. But God judgeth not of sin thus by the custom of Countries, but according to the nature of the thing. In <hi>England</hi> a Sabbath-breaker is taken for a sin incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Grace: In the Low-Countries, <hi>Helvetia, France</hi> and most other of the Reformed Churches, much of it taken for no sin at all, but we are censured for superstitious herein. Every one is not ungodly there that lives and dies in that sin, without particular Repentance. Men that have not heard much of the evil of some petty oaths, may not understand the evil of them; and custom may do much. And it is not inconsiderable, as to the extenuation of some mens sin, that its not a little doubtfull whether it be indeed swearing, if a man do use those words which are the ordinary matter of an oath, and doth not know it to be an oath, nor intend the form of an oath in it: As if one use the terms of an oath in Latine or another Language which he understandeth not, he is not formally a Swearer: And if men do know it, and yet do not at that time intend
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:107958:190"/>
any such thing as a calling any creature to witness, or appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them as sufficient to avenge a lye, but only use a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomarie term inobservantly, it is a sin; but whether formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly swearing, may be questioned. But if it be the Name of God that they abuse in swearing, or if they indeed put any creature in his stead, appealing to it as the Avenger of a lye or perjurie, that is a hainous sin, and cannot easily be done in ignorance. 2. It is judged by Divines that <hi>David</hi> lay a twelve moneth in his sin of Adulterie and Murder unrepented of: Certain it is that he was long contriving and executing that horrid murder of <hi>Vriah,</hi> that his own shame might be covered, and he might enjoy his wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How long <hi>Asah</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> sinned we know not: Nor can any man possibly determine just how long a man may live in the practice of such a sin, and yet have true special Grace, and a state of Justification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 10. But what if they are Neglecters of Gods Worship, as Prayer in their families, or the keeping of the Sabbath, or publike hearing the Word, or godly discourse; is it possible that in such there should be saving Grace? They that love God will seek him in his Worship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is not enough for the certain knowledge of a mans ungodliness, or gracelesness, to know that he neglecteth this duty of outward worship, unless it be known with what mind, and on what reasons he neglecteth it. For example, Many a man neglecteth Prayer in his Family, as supposing himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to perform it; and that this alone is not a certain sign of gracelesness, appeareth thus. 1. God hath not said that all that neglect it are graceless, or shall perish: As for the Text of <hi>Jer. [Pour out thy wrath on the Heathens tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> know thee not, and the Families that call not on thy name</hi>] Its past question that by Families is meant Tribes or Nations, and calling on Gods name, is put for [Owning and Worshipping the true God] without any mention of the special sort of prayer in a Familie (though I believe the dueness of that may be hence gathered.) 2. Many that we have reason to hope are godly, have of late years given over Familie prayer, as supposing (though very blindly) that it is not a duty required by God. 3. Many godly people do as much neglect Teaching their Families as some of these in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:107958:191"/>
do Praying in their Families, and yet it is more expresly commanded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6 &amp; 11, &amp;c. And for the Observation of the Sabbath, I answered before, that most of the Godly in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches (as far as I can learn by their Writings, or by Report) are against it in strictness: And therfore I suppose that sin is consistent with godliness And for [<hi>Godly Discourse</hi>] I would no godly people were not so neglective of it, that their company becomes too unprofitable thereby. Some are much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to good discourse by natural impediments, as Bashfulness, &amp;c. want of words through ill Education, and disuse may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der much. It is only those that privately live and converse with people, that will be able to judge of them certainly on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and not all such neither.</p>
            <p>And Lastly, For hearing the Word, it will not alone make a certain discovery: For 1. we know not what may keep a man away till we speak with him. 2. Its possible for a godly man to be of the opinion of the Separatists, that think it unlawful to hear our Ministers, or in our Assemblies, and having, no other to joyn with, may hear none at all; as I have known it the case of some in the Bishops times. So that the Certainty of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness is not discernable by this alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 11. But there are some that will scorn and deride or revile the Godly, yea and persecute them, where they have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Is not that a certain Note of one Graceless?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is one thing to scorn or persecute a <hi>Godly man,</hi> and another to scorn at <hi>Godliness</hi>: Or, it is one thing to persecute and scorn a man <hi>as</hi> he is Godly, directly on that account, and another thing to scorn and persecute him for something else; as upon some personal falling out, or for some sin, or false opinion, or the like cause. The later can be no certain discovery of an Ungodly man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 12. But what if they deride and persecute <hi>Godliness it self,</hi> or a man <hi>because</hi> he is Godly?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is certainly a heinous sin: But we must distinguish between the deriding of a man for the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or for Godliness, as such; and deriding him for some do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or practice of Godliness, which is not <hi>essential</hi>: also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>known</hi> Truth and Duty, and an <hi>unknown.</hi> It is too pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:107958:191"/>
for a Godly man to persecute and deride the Godly for some Truths which he took to be Errors, or some Duties which he mistook to be Sins, or to be no Duties; or for the manner of some Duties which he took to be wrong. Alas I how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is it for the Separatists and Anabaptists (many of them) to deride our Ministry, Assembles and Duties: and many among us to deride theirs? And they are the bitterest taunts and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions that come from blinde zeal. These times have by sad experience convinc't us, that men seeming otherwise Godly may both scorn (in press and pulpit) persecute and kill each other. As one Godly man may persecute another for some Truths and Duties, which he knows not to be such; so in particular, it is possible that such may imagine that private Meetings tend to schism or proud singularity, and so may deride them: Or he may by strangeness to them entertain some false report of the stricter Professors of Religion, as if they were proud, humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, schismaticks, disobedient, and differed only in these things, and not in true piety from others. And I believe I have known some in former times that were such; who had such thoughts as these of all the Godly that were not <hi>conformable,</hi> and of others that used any private Meetings, living where they had little acquaintance with any of them, save two or three that by scandals increased their prejudice, and hearing no better lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of them, these persons would reproach them as bitterly as most that ever I heard, and yet themselves lived not only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly to men, but so piously, that they seemed to hate all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faness, and spent more time in secret prayer and reading, then most I have known. It is not therefore all scorn or persecution of Godly persons, Doctrines, or Duties that will prove a man to be Notoriously Graceless or Ungodly.</p>
            <p>But again, left any Ungodly person take occasion of presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from all this, let me add this much more: 1. Though another cannot know such to be <hi>certainly</hi> ungodly, yet they may know it by themselves; who know their own ends and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons better then we can do. And (alas!) the souls of such are never the safer, because we are bound to judge charitably of them. This is but to prevent our wronging them, but it will not prevent their damnation. 2. Though we know them not
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:107958:192"/>
to be certainly ungodly, yet <hi>God</hi> doth: and it is he that must judge them. And therefore he will put many a thousand out of heaven, whom we may not put out of the Church. When the Tares and Wheat are so mixed, that we cannot pluck up the Tares without plucking up the Wheat (that is, in doubtfull inevident cases) there we must let both grow till the time of harvest (both in forbearing persecution by the sword, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication:) but then God will sever the wicked from the just, and gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them that work iniquity, and cast them out into the lake of fire. 3. And our selves may see cause enough to bewail the misery of many as too probable, whom yet we cannot certainly conclude to be miserable: yea, we have cause to call them out of our communion: of which more anon. I must therefore intreat two sorts of Readers that they do not mis-interpret these fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going passages. First, The <hi>Vngodly</hi> are desired to beware that they pervert not this to their own delusion nor to the opening of their mouths against the teachings and censures of the Church. I cannot but fore-see that such will be prone to draw venom out of necessary truths; and to say, I may be godly and be saved, though I pray not in my family, though I swear, or be drunk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But such must know, 1. That [they cannot be saved, if in the bent of their lives they live after the flesh, and if God be not dearer to them than all the world, and if their hearts be not more on heaven than on earth, and if the main aim and business of their lives be not for God and the life to come; nor can they be Godly or saved unless they truly hate their sin, and long to be rid of it, and are willing to be at the cost and labour of using Gods means by which they may be rid of it; unless in the bent of their lives they overcome gross sin, and live not in it, and groan under their infirmities desiring to be rid of them feeling the need of a Saviour, and flying to his blood for pardon, and to his word and spirit for cure.] All this must be in every one at age, that will be saved. Now though we may be uncertain of a mans ungodliness by one or more such fals as <hi>Peters</hi> or <hi>Davids</hi> were, when the bent of his life appeareth to be holy; yet if the bent of your lives be carnal, and you have not all this that I have now mentioned,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:107958:192"/>
then you may be sure that you are Graceless, though you never commit any scandalous sin; much more when you live in them. 2. And remember that you may know your own hearts and secret lives, when we cannot. Its no comfort to you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that a Minister is not certain of your Gracelesness, if you be indeed Graceless: what if we must hope the best, who know not the worst? alas this will be no relief to your souls.</p>
            <p>Nor should you be offended, if Ministers in preaching and personal reproof, do speak terror to you for all this: For 1. they preach to you as described in a graceless state and not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. 2. They must tell you what every sin deserves, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it leads, and tell you of the sad probabilites of your dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable state, though they have not a certainty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I foresee also that some Godly people will think that these passages, though true, may accidentally harden the wicked in their sin, and therefore that this will do more harm than good. To whom I say, 1. That the wicked will draw evil from the most certain truths, and all must not be concealed which they will abuse. 2. Yet I must confess, that my own heart made this Objection; which caused me to think this Paper my self unfit to be published; and so I did this two years lay it by: And had I not understood that from the Coppy which I sent one friend, so many are communicated, and at such a distance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of strangers, and that somewhat defective, and had I not been acquainted that they will print it, if I will not, it might have yielded still to this Objection for ought I know: for had I been left to my own choice, I should have laid it in the dark.</p>
            <p>Now for the Affirmative, I will shew you, whom we may take for Notoriously ungodly: and then I will shew you whom we must judge probably to be godly, and whether we must not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude some persons, and refuse their Infants, who yet are not Notoriously ungodly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A man that (not inconsiderately, or in a Temptation but) deliberately and obstinately denieth any fundamental Article of the Christian faith, is notoriously ungodly: for he cannot have a godly heart, that excludeth the necessary principles of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:107958:193"/>
Godliness from his head. I mean those Truths without which there is no salvation; for surely without them there can be no Grace. He that denieth thus the God head, or the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Wisdom, or Power of God; or the Incarnation, Holiness, Death, Ransom of man thereby, Resurrection, Rule, or Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Jesus Christ, or the everlasting life that he giveth to Believers, or the necessity of our holiness and Obedience to him: He that denieth the Holy Ghost, the Truth of his Miracles by which he sealed Christs Doctrine, or the necessity of his Sanctification: this man is Notoriously ungodly, if he Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously deny these: for he professeth ungodliness it self; So doth he that denieth Christ hath any Church on earth, and that denieth to have communion with his Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That man is notoriously ungodly, that is notoriously ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignorant of God and his son Jesus Christ, of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Wisdom or Power of God; of the Incarnation, Death and Resurection of Christ, and his Redemption of us hereby: of the necessity of Faith and Holiness, and of the evil of sin, and of the everlasting blessedness that is promised to the Saints. I will now only say, (excluding not the rest) that the Ignorance of any one of these is inconsistent with true Godliness. But I must tell you anon, that there is need of much wariness in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such Ignorance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All those are Notoriously ungodly, that do Notoriously, upon Deliberation, and with Obstinacy, profess that they will not take God for their God and Governour; or that they will not take Christ for their Redeemer and Lord, nor be Ruled by him, nor Trust in him for pardon and salvation; or that they will not believe his word, nor will be sanctified by his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All those are Notoriously ungodly, that deliberately, and ordinarily, when they are themselves, do Notoriously profess that they set more by the Pleasures, Profits, or Honors of this world, than by the promised Blessedness in the life to come: and that they will not part with these for the hopes of that Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All those are such also, who, though in the general they will say, that they will be Ruled by God, saved by Christ, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the Holy Ghost, and guided by Gods Laws, yet when
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:107958:193"/>
it come's to particulars, do deliberately in their ordinary frame profess that they will not part with their known sins, at the command of God, but resolve to displease him rather than obey.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Such also are all those, that though in general they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to prefer Heaven before Earth, yet when it comes to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and trial, do Notoriously, and deliberately in their Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated frame profess, that they will not let go particular known sins for the hopes of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Such also are all they, who living in gross sin, and being convinced of it, will not promise a sincere endeavour to reform: nor will remove from or put away the removeable occasions which draw them to sin: nor will be perswaded to use those known means which God hath commanded for the curing of their sin; as to hear the Word, to change their Company, to confess their sin, and take shame to themselves, and profess Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. They that Notoriously thus refuse Reformation, when by Ministers or discreet Christians they are urged to it, or that refuse Gods means which they are convinced he requireth of them, and this obstinately, are notoriously ungodly, though they do not profess it in words: For though it be exceeding hard to determine how great, many, or long, the sins of a true Believer may be, yet we are certain that he cannot mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest such a Love to them, or Habituated unwillingness to be cured of them. For that will not stand with true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p n="8">8. All those are Notoriously ungodly, that profess or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press notoriously a Hatred of those that would draw them from their sins, (not for their harsh or indiscreet management of a reproof, nor upon a meer mistaken conceit that the Reprover oweth him ill will, but) on that very account, because they would draw them from known sin. For this is Notorious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, and shews a Love of sin, and the Reign of it in the Will.</p>
            <p n="9">9. All those are Notoriously ungodly, who do by Scorns, Threatnings, Persecutions, or otherwise Notoriously express a Deliberate, Habituated Hatred prevailing in their hearts, against God, Christ, the Spirit, the Scripture, or Godly men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:107958:194"/>
they are godly, that is, because they do Believe, love God, and live a Holy life, and obey God in those things which they are convinced that he commandeth. For this shews that Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness prevaileth in the heart.</p>
            <p n="10">10. All those are Notoriously ungodly, that being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that its a Duty to pray, to hear the Word, to mind the Life to come, and prefer it before this, and to live a holy Life, do yet so far dislike all this, or any of this, that they profess themselves resolved never to practice it, and that they will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their souls, come on't what will, rather than they will make so much ado, or live such a life; yea, though they will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess this, yet if they will not on the contrary be perswaded to profess that they resolve to live such a life, and will not be drawn actually to the practice of it in their endeavours; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by manifesting that it is not so much for want of Ability, as from a predominant unwillingness to be Holy in Heart and Life: I say, if this be Notorious, then is it Notorious that these people are ungodly: and accordingly to be judged and used by the Church.</p>
            <p>Though I understand that many think that it is too rigid to go so far as I have already done in maintaining the Negative of the former Question; yet I think it necessary to go further, and to determine, that [<hi>It is our Duty to refuse to baptize the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the Notoriously Vngodly.</hi>]</p>
            <p>If you would know who else it is that we must exclude or refuse, remember that before I told you of Excommunication from 1. A particular Church; for some reason proper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to or to some more, but not common to all. 2. From all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated Congregations, as such. 3. From the society of Christians, as such: and that this last is either for a time because of the scandalousness of the sin, and the credit of the Gospel with those without, though we may yet see signs of Repentance in the sinner. 2. Or for the Infectiousness of the sin as a Leprosie: As if a man take himself bound to perswade all men to some greater and dangerous Error, which yet may stand with Grace and Salvation, but makes it very difficult and much hindereth it; and if no means can convince this man of his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, nor take him off; this is a kind of a Heretick, who must
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:107958:194"/>
be excluded from all Christian Communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but is not certainly and notoriously graceless. 3. There is also exclusion from the society of all Christians, upon an evident Proof that the man is no true Christian; that is, that he is Notoriously an Unbeliever or Ungodly person: This I have spoke to all this while. 4. But then there is also an exclusion upon a <hi>violent</hi> Presumption, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strong Probability, though short of a Certainty that such a man is graceless or ungodly.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I lay down what I take to be the Truth, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proposition</hi> 1. I may not deny the right of the Infant to Baptism meerly because the Parents are excluded from one or more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches: because Baptism doth necessarily and directly enter them among the number of Christians, but not into any one particular Church. And therefore I will not forbid or disswade the baptizing of such.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>position</hi> 2. Yet do I take it to be no duty of mine to baptize any such more than any other Ministers, further than I have a special Call or Reason: For Example: Here live some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds in this Parish, that upon publike Proposal, Whether they take me for their Pastor, and themselves for members of this Church? do disown it, or not own it, when they are told that their owning or declaring it shall be taken as the sign to know it; I take my self no more bound to baptize their children than any strangers else: For I cannot be their Pastor whether they will or not; nor can I take them for any special charge of mine, that will not take themselves to be so, nor take me for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor. Therefore they can no more blame me than any stranger, if I refuse to baptize their children: Though yet I deny not their right to Baptism.</p>
            <p>I am not bound to baptize all the children in the Countrey; and therefore not theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proposition</hi> 3. It ordinarily falls out that a Minister hath more work to do in his own special charge than five men are able to do: So that he cannot bestow so much time as to Baptize the children of others and to take an account of them concerning their Faith or Profession (such as is more necessary from stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and refusers of Discipline, than others) without neglecting
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:107958:195"/>
some duty to his own Charge the while: While I am speaking to them, there are twenty poor souls of my own Charge that call for my help. And I am more strictly tied to those of my special charge than to others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proposition</hi> 4. Yet in case that, for the avoiding of offence, or for an advantage to win them to a better temper, or the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I see any special cause for it, I doubt not but I must rather omit a lesser duty to my own Charge, than a greater to others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proposition</hi> 5. If a man reject Church-communion, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himself from one Church upon a reason common to all Churches as Incorporated, (as for Example, because he will not be under any Discipline) he gives us reason to question his very Christianity: And therefore we must call him to account on what grounds he doth this: And if the grounds are found such as are consistent with Christianity, we may not deny the right of his Infants to Baptism: though our selves may have no Call to baptize them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proposition</hi> 6. If the Parents do either produce no Title to the baptizing of their child, that is, do not seem Christians or Godly; Or if they give us grounds of a violent presumption that their profession is false and counterfeit, in either of these cases, as we are to exclude them from Christian communion, so are we to refuse the baptizing of their children, that is, to suspend both, till such a Title be shewed, or till the grounds of that strong presumption be removed: Although we may not declare such persons to be no members of the universal Church, nor absolutely deny their children to have any Right in the Covenant, or fundamentally and remotely to Baptism; as not being certain, that their Parents are in a Graceless ungodly state.</p>
            <p>This last Proposition is it that I am now to give my Reasons of. For indeed it is a matter of such exceeding difficulty, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude another man to be certainly graceless, that it is not one of multitudes, nay, it is but few of the commonly scandalous gross sinners that we should be able to prove it by (which I desire the Cesorious well to consider of.) But yet a strong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption we may have of more that they are graceless, and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:107958:195"/>
thereupon may suspend them and their Children, as is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If the Parent have given just cause for us to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Christianity, and Right to Christian communion thereupon, then hath he given us sufficient cause to question his childs right to Baptism: (and so to suspend the baptizing it:) But the Antecedent is confessed: For our dissenting Brethren in this case will suspend, yea excommunicate the Parent. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reason of the Consequence is clear, in that the Right of the Infant to Baptism is meerly on the Parents account, and on supposition of his Right to Membership of the Universal Church. If therefore his Right be justly questioned, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e suspended, then the Infants Right must be questioned, and it suspended on the same ground. For Baptism Sealeth a right of Union, and putteth into actual communion of the Body Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. We ought not to dispense Gods Seals and Church-Priviledges to any without a produced Title: (Else we must give them to all, that we can.) But for the baptism of such mens children, as are aforementioned, there can be, or is, no Title pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major,</hi> is further clear, in that <hi>Non esse &amp; non Apparere,</hi> are to us all one: For it must be discernable to us by some evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. or else it is naturally impossible for us to know it.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Minor,</hi> its clear that if the Parents Title to member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship be questionable the Infants is so too: because the ground is the same, and it is from the Parent that the Infant must derive it: and no man can give that which he hath not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum</hi> 3. In civil Administrations, and according to the Rules of right Reason, a very high probability, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Violenta Praesumptio,</hi> sufficeth to sentence and execution: especially when it is but in the withdrawing or suspending of a Priviledge. Therefore it must be so here. Because 1. here is no reason to put a difference. 2. Because our distance from other mens hearts, doth in most cases make us uncapable of more. Impenitency and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nfidelity lie within: and we cannot know them but by their signs and fruits. And 3. It is their fault in
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:107958:196"/>
giving occasion of such presumption, and in being so like the ungodly, if we deny them the Priviledges of the Godly; and not our fault. The Antecedent is clearly known. If a man be known to bear another malice, and be found standing by him with a bloody sword, the person being murdered, the Judge will justly condemn him for the murder; though yet it be not absolutely certain that he did it. If a man be found <hi>nudus in lecto cum nuda,</hi> he shall be judged a Fornicator or Adulterer, though it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. So in other cases.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. If such violent presumption must not stand for sufficient proof for such suspension of parent and child, then all Discipline (and all civil justice, if it be not so there) will be elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For then, (as no vice almost, or but few, will be punished among men, nor few men have right) so, almost no ungodly or scandalous sinners, or few that ought, will be excluded or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended: And the fruit of Discipline, its like, will be judged scarce worth the trouble, so few causes will be brought, as will bring it to be strange.</p>
            <p>But Discipline must not be so eluded. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Christ telleth us, that by their Fruits we should know them: therefore by fruits of Godliness or ungodliness we must judge of men as Godly or Ungodly, as to these acts of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration and communion. We must judge that to be a Vine which hath Grapes, and that to be no Thistle that hath Figgs. We judge not usually of the certainty of mens Impenitency, or Infidelity, but of the strong probability. Its possible a mans own words may be false.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. We must admit of a weak presumption, or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for admitting men to Priviledges: therefore we may admit of strong presumption for denying them. If we must take a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in one, then in the other: only allowing the difference, as aforesaid, that we must have a stronger presumption for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than for granting is necessary. For we must be content with less evidence for a man, than against a man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. But what is that we may take for a sufficient reason of a mans claim? And. 2 <hi>Quest</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What must we take for a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent presumption, of the unsoundness of his claim?</p>
            <p>To the first I say in brief; 1. If a Heathen that yesterday was
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:107958:196"/>
guilty of the grossest sin, do come to me this day, and with seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sorrow confess his fault, and with seeming seriousness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to believe in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; that is, to believe all the essential Articles of Christian Religion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess his consent to take God for his only God, and portion; Christ for his only Redeemer, and the Holy Ghost for his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier, renouncing the World, Flesh, and Devil; I shall take this Verbal profession for a sufficient Reason of his claim, unless any just Bar of exception be put in against him to invalidate it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The same Title I shall take for valid for the Baptism of his Infants.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If a man have made the same profession, and after long continuance in the Church doth offer his Child to Christ in Baptism, and offer to renew that profession, and enter his child into the same Covenant, I shall suppose his claim just, till some sufficient reason be brought to prove it unjust.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I find that the Apostles took such a profession as a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proof of the justice of the claim, at the Parents own baptism: Not as being it self the Condition (called by many, the Title) but as being such an evidence of the Title to us, as we are bound to accept. 2. In equity and reason if the condition of a mans interest (or his Title, as they call it) do lie in the heart, out of mans reach, we must take his own profession as evidence suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, unless he give himself the lye, and give us other reason to discredit him. If a man say he is a Believer, and profess him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a godly man, that is, a Lover and Honorer of God; I will take him for a Believer, and a godly man, till I can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his profession. I am not not bound to believe an evident Lye: but I am bound to believe a man till the falshood of his speeches be evident. Charity believeth all (such) things; and thinketh not evil without sufficient evidence. I need not go to a mans life for his evidence of his first Title. And for his Right to after-communion and priviledges; though other mens Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a Godly conversation be a good confirmation, yet I am not alwaies bound to seek or require that, nor yet to have a personal knowledge of it: But if any from his life will bring a
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:107958:197"/>
cross evidence to disprove his own verbal profession of faith and obedience, I will take it into consideration.</p>
            <p>And I could wish that all Christians would proceed according to this Rule, and call no man ungodly when they cannot prove h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m to be such, at least, so far as to a strong presumption: But that they would take all for Godly that say they are Godly, till they can disprove them. I know they will say, then you will miscall men, and call those Godly that are not, and then you must not difference the Precious from the Vile: this is large cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity indeed. To which I answer 1. We call them but what they seem; and 2. what God warranteth us to call them, the Apostles telling such themselves, that they [were all the Sons of God by faith, heirs, saints, justified, &amp;c.] <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. &amp; 6.2. We difference as far as we have evidence to lead us; and further we must not. As I said before, we must imitate God in this: where the mixture is such that the Tares cannot be pulled up without pulling up the Corn, both must grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till the Harvest: we must not think to difference so exactly, and search and sift so neer to the bran, as God will then do. If the case be so uncertain and inevident, that we may on such Grounds condemn the Righteous with the wicked, we must let Righteous and wicked go together as if all were Righteous, and call the whole field a Corn field, for all the Tares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Then must we judge falsly, for we must judge men to be what they are not. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If it were so, it is no sin in you, but in them that profess falsly. When ever you judge the most glorious hypocrite to be Godly, you judge falsly; but not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: for every mistake is not our sin. 2. But I say you are not to judg falsly neither. For you are not to judge that it is certain that these are Godly men, but only that its probable. And note well, that there is a difference to be made within the Church, between the better and worser Members, as well as between the Church and those without. And observe, that there are divers degrees of this probability of mens sincerity: some do so fully second their profession by a Godly life, that we have a very strong confidence of their sincerity (though not a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty). Some do give us some good hopes, but not so strong a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion.
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:107958:197"/>
Some are so dull and negligent, and faultie in their lives, that we have much fear of their perdition, though we are bound because of their profession, to keep up some hopes of them, as being not without some probability of their honesty. I doubt the common sort of Christians are but such as these. And therefore we may even in the Church preach for mens Conversion and Regeneration: because though we know not certainly who they be that are unregenerate, yet we know that many such there are that profess Religion, and have great cause of fear and jealousie concerning many in particular. So that we must place a great difference between those whom we must permit in the same Church-communion and must administer the same Sacraments to: we rejoyce in our hopes of some: we have much fear of the condemnation of others. Yet if it come not to a strong or violent presumption grounded on sufficient evidence, we may not suspend or cast them out.</p>
            <p>In a word, it is a verbal profession seemingly serious, and not again contradicted by a cross profession of word or action, that is the evidence of mens Interest in Church-Priviledges, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the Baptism of their Infants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What take you for a sufficient disproof of a verbal profession? or a ground for such a violent presumption that a man doth lye and dissemble, and is no Christian?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I mentioned you ten particulars before, on which we may judge men Notoriously ungodly. Look over those again, and ye may see what to take for a violent presumption.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A man that denyeth any Essential part of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though we are uncertain whether he do it resolvedly and deliberately, yet if he will not upon sufficient invitation, reverse that denial, and profess Repentance of it; Or if upon a just call a man refuse to profess his Belief of the Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stian faith; It is ground of a violent presumption that he is no Christian or godly man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Those that are not only unable to give any account of their knowledge of the Essentials of Religion, but also do by their contrary answers (when we put them but to affirm or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) shew that they understand them not, and this often, though its possible they may be amazed, or oblivious, yet its a violent
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:107958:198"/>
presumption that they are utterly ignorant of the Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</p>
            <p>And here I advise all to be very tender how they exclude people on point of meer ignorance, if they 1. are but able in private, to those that they are familiar with, to give a tolerable account of essentials. 2. Or if they answer truly with a [yea] or a [Nay] when you contrive the matter into your question. 3. And if they be diligent in the use of means, and willing to Learn and live uprightly. And to this purpose consider of these things following. 1 Fundamentals or essentials are but few. 2. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor people are of such natural bashfulness, or hesitancy, that they cannot speak what they know. 3. Specially when Rustical education increaseth it. 4. And especially when it is in publike, or to a Minister whom they reverence. 5. There are indigested ruder Conceptions, which may be found, and yet not formed ready for expression, even in some that can speak well. We see some Ministers in Examinations too deficient: And the best find sometime a light which they cannot utter: and the force of a reason in their minds, which is no whit rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the tongue. 6. Scripture examples in this point obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved would moderate us. What did the Apostles require? 7. He that gives a true [Yea] or a [Nay] shews that he believes the Truth. 8. He that in his life seeks heaven before earth, shews that he knows it to be better than earth. I speak these things but to moderate some men. I add 9. It is commonly as much the Ministers fault, that he hath not a satisfactory Answer, as the persons. I have noted it, that most Ministers, either speak roughly or indiscreetly, discouragingly, provokingly, or of things not essential; and that it is a matter requiring great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wisdom than most have, to draw out the minds of the most ignorant sort of our people. 10. And if they know not the essentials, may we not help them to a tolerable knowledge of them at the present, before we part with them? At least, we should trie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. While men do wilfully delay upon a sufficient Call to profess their Consent to the matters in the third Article (fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned) <hi>viz.</hi> to take God for their God, Christ for their Saviour, the Spirit for their Sanctifier, the Word for their
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:107958:198"/>
Rule, we must delay our using them as Godly.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He that professeth to esteem this world more than that to come, add reverseth it not, though we know not certainly whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he spoke it deliberately, must be presumed ungodly till he reverse it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He that professeth not to leave his known sins, but rather to venture on Gods displeasure, though its possible he may speak it hastily in a temptation, yet is to be presumed ungodly till he manifest Repentance, that he is now of another mind.</p>
            <p n="6">6. So they that profess that they will venture or lose their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Heaven, rather than forsake their sins, till they repent manifestly of this, are to be presumed to be ungodly.</p>
            <p n="7">7. So they that live constantly in the commission of gross sins, though they profess Repentance, and promise Reformation, yet have over and over broke their promises, and still continue in the sin, such mens words are not any more to be credited (else all Discipline may be eluded) till they actually reform: And though we cannot certainly tell just how much gross sin may stand with Grace: yet because we must judge by probable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the Apostle telleth us that such shall not inherite the Kingdom of God, and that if we live after the Flesh we shall die, we must presume that men are what they appear to be. Had we such a man as <hi>Solomon</hi> in his sin to deal with, we ought to use him as an ungodl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> man, I think. So those that have lately committed scandalous Notorious sin, and will not on sufficient perswasion manifest any satisfactory repentance for it: we must presume them ungodly till they will manifest repentance: For we know, except they repent they shall perish; and an undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered repentance is to us as none. And our Divines at <hi>Dort</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that though a Godly man lose not his Justification by gross sinning, yet he contracts such an incapacity of coming to heaven in that state that must be removed by repentance, or else he could not be saved.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Those that will not hearken to them that would admonish them, but refuse to obey their counsel for the forsaking of known sin, and also despise and abuse them meerly for that: Though its possible this may be as <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> did in a temptation, yet we must presume till he repenteth, that he is ungodly; for we
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:107958:199"/>
know, that he that being oft reproved hardeneth his neck, shall be destroyed without remedy: specially when it is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of acknowledged sobriety and authority that doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; and the Reproof hath nothing in it that should seem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Those that do deride or slander or persecute the generality of Godly men about them, for their apparent Godly practices, in matters of weight in Religion: though its possible in a Temptation they may do it upon some mis-reports and mis-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, yet till they manifest repentance, we have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reason to presume that they are ungodly men. So for those that evidently endeavour the disgracing or extirpation of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Those that either profess to take a godly life as an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, or that being convinced, or having full evidence which might convince them, do yet refuse to hear the word, to pray at all, to seek heaven in the first place, to hold communion with any Christian Church, or to be guided by the Ministers of Christ according to his Word, while they refuse to perform these ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary parts of Christian duty, after due admonition, and give no tolerable reason of their refusal, are groundedly to be presumed to be persons ungodly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But (I know some dissenting Brethren will say) what a Labyrinth do you bring the Church into on your grounds? while we must judge of mens sincerity, we are left at uncertainty; and who knows among al these difficulties whom to judge godly, and whom ungodly? Thus Ministers are made Lords of the Consciences of men, or enabled to tyrannize.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Where the case is most Notorious, there needeth no Judge. Where the Probabilities are such as require a Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner, it is the Ministers Office: and a main part of his work, of necessity to the Church, and not to be called or accounted Tyranny. 2. But, it is an easie matter to cavil at large against al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most any cause; Destructive arguing is the easiest. But <hi>incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum non solvit Argumentum.</hi> The thing I would see is a better way. Do our Brethrens Grounds afford us any better footing? <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Will you take any verbal profession as a title, or not? If any whatsoever; then if a man tell you I will come such a day,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:107958:199"/>
and in scorn to Christ profess Christianity, or if he tell you when he hath done, I did but dissemble, for fear or favour, or if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride while he doth it, or contradict it in other words, you will take it for good. Or if a man come drunk to present his child in Baptism (as they have done to me to require it) Or if he fall a swearing and cursing at the Ordinance: Or say, I will never be ruled by Christ or Scripture: If any profession must serve, then these; But I hope not so. If not any whatever; Then, 1. Tell us how you will distinguish; will you not reject all that is apparently lying? How will you difference between Truth and a lye? what cross evidence will you take for currant? tell us that we may also know. If only words, than what if a man worship actively the Sun or Moon, while verbally he makes the Christian profession? will it not disable and discredit his profession with you? what if he have for twenty years (O that I had none such neer me) been drunk, once a week or fortnight, and sometime thrice a week, and still confess it and promise amendment? Is his word to be taken? 2. If you were to baptize an Aged man, that comes new into Christianity would not you be the judges whether his profession seemed serious or not? and proceed on meer probabilities, as well as we? 3. Do you not in admitting persons to the Lords Supper, make your selves judges whether his profession be serious, yea and take in his conversation for evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? and are you not put in all this upon the same uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to the use of probabilities as we? 4. So you do, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in excommunication for impenitency: Or at least, in case of absolution of the penitent, will not you be judges on probable grounds, whether his Repentance seem serious? and take a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent presumption as ground for some determinations? Yet I hope in all this you are no tyrants. There is a necessity of a standing Ministry to decide such matters, and rule the Church: therefore are such matters to be decided by them.</p>

            <head>The fourth Disputation. Whether any besides Regenerate Believers have a Right to the Sacraments given them by God, and may thereupon require them and receive them.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E take it for granted, that the Right of Infants is upon the account of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Faith, and Dedication of themselves and theirs to God; and that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable themselves of requiring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: And therefore we shall make but little mention of them in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; but manage it with special respect to the Adult, seeing the Case of Infants will be that way best resolved.</p>
            <p>We mention [Regenerate Believers] to signifie those men who perform that Faith which is the condition of the Gospel-Promise; commonly called justifying or saving Faith.</p>
            <p>By Sacraments we mean Baptism, or the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>The principal thing that needeth Explication, is the word [Right.] And it signifieth divers things according to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Objects and Acts to which it is related. 1. A man may give Right to a <hi>Benefit,</hi> and another receive it divers waies. Either by a Premiant Law, if he be a Superiour in Rule; or by a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, Promise, or other Donation or Deed of Gift; or by Sale, Exchange, or other contract by way of commutation.

               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:107958:201"/>
The last is nothing to our case, as the Right is made over to us; for we could not purchase it, though the Right that Christ hath to convey it, may be fitly said to be due in Commutative Justice, as being purchased by him. The Right which we have to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits from God, is alwayes by free Donation (for we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of no other;) and by a Donation that partaketh of the natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of a Law: This Deed of Gift is called a Promise, Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Scripture (for the single promise of God, is oft called a Covenant) the Nature of this <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi> consisteth in the <hi>Debitum habendi,</hi> the Dueness of them to the person from another.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Right</hi> is said to be <hi>Given,</hi> because it is it self a <hi>Benefit,</hi> as being <hi>Right to a Benefit</hi>; and the Party is said to have it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another kind of <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Benefit,</hi> is that which acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and indirectly ariseth from another mans Duty: As <hi>e. g.</hi> the Physician of an Hospital, commandeth his Apothecary to give so much of such a precious Cordial to every one of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s who fainteth or falls into a Lipothymie, but not to the rest: Some of the Patients that they may partake of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, pretend to faint or swoun: The Apothecary doth his best to discern whether they dissemble, and cannot discern it: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is his duty to give it these as well as to others, because he that commanded the Administration intended not that he should know the heart, or be infallible, but should proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his best skill and judgement, or else he must do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: So that <hi>esse &amp; apparere, &amp; non esse &amp; non apparere,</hi> is all one to him. The dissembling of the Patient doth accidentally occasion, or cause it to be his duty to give him the Cordial: And when it is become his duty to <hi>Give</hi> it, the Patient may so far be said to have <hi>Right</hi> to it, as that he may justifie his demand before any Physitians that are unacquainted with his dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and the Apothecary had truly a Right or Power to give it, and may justifie it before any. Yet this is but improperly called <hi>A Right to the Cordial,</hi> and properly it is but to be the Object of the <hi>Just Action</hi> of the Administer. For though the Apothecary had warrant to administer it upon a <hi>claim,</hi> though <hi>wrong,</hi> yet the Patient had no <hi>Right</hi> to warrant his <hi>claim</hi>; and
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:107958:201"/>
therefore his claim it self being unjust for want of Antecedent <hi>Right,</hi> it could not give him a proper subsequent <hi>Right,</hi> though in the common judgement of undiscerning men, he had Right.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A kind of <hi>Right</hi> in a <hi>Benefit</hi> may be conveyed by Actual Physical Application, without moral conveyance of Title: As if I cast a Garment over a mad man that strips himself naked, while it is on him, he may (but improperly) be said to have Right in it: which is but properly <hi>non inju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t him. But this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our present Case. 1. Because it is not an Antecedent Right <hi>to the thing,</hi> but a subsequent Right <hi>in the thing</hi> when they have it; and is no ground of claim before hand, the partie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Antecedent <hi>Title</hi>: But our Case concerneth an Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Title; or else the question would be only whether Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be <hi>Null</hi> to such when they have them. 2. Because this is not proper Right. 3. Because even this <hi>non injustè possidere,</hi> never falls out to be the Case of the unsanctified unbelieving Soul; because it is not bare providential disposal that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth Sacraments upon him like the rain from Heaven, but it is his own unjust claim and seeking that antecedeth and caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his possession, so that we may dismiss this from our further enquiry. And there is (that I remember) no other way of conveying Right to Benefits which can possibly concern our Case, than these above-mentioned: and therefore I may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that here is a sufficient Enumeration. If any would make a Contract or mutu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l Covenant to be a different way, they are deceived: For as our covenanting Act conferreth not the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, but is only a condition of Gods Collation, (else a man should give it to himself.) so the covenanting act on Gods part is by the fore-described free Donation; and it is only by the standing promise, which is not altered when we consent, though only then it become effectual, because that consent is the condition of its efficacy.</p>
            <p>So much concerning the <hi>Right to Benefits,</hi> and the <hi>debitum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendi,</hi> or antecedent Title.</p>
            <p>The next kind of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ght</hi> is that which respecteth not Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, but our own <hi>Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons.</hi> And this <hi>Right</hi> or Justness of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:107958:202"/>
is 1. Of the <hi>Actions</hi> of an Officer or <hi>Administrator,</hi> which is <hi>Autoritas agendi,</hi> and proceedeth from a <hi>Commission,</hi> or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which is equivalent. 2. The <hi>Actions of a subject as such</hi> in Obeying; which is <hi>Officium, or Debitum agendi,</hi> commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Duty.</hi> This resulteth from the preceptive part of every Law. And so every man hath a Right to do his Duty; which strictly is but to say, It is right that he do it, or it is due from him to God, or he is obliged to it. 3. The third sort of Actions are such as are <hi>neither commanded nor forbidden,</hi> but either the Law medleth not with them, and so <hi>negatively permitteth</hi> them, or else it expresly maketh them indifferent, and so <hi>positively permitteth</hi> them, such we say a man may rightfully do; which is indeed neither necessarily, nor sinfully; but only the things are <hi>Licita,</hi> such as may be done.</p>
            <p>To apply these to our present Case; It is evident that none of these are meant in our present Question. For 1. the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not, whether it be lawful to a Minister to give the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to any that is unregenerate: For, supposing that they require it, this is out of doubt; and we may justly (though with due limitations and conditions) excite them to desire it, while we know them not to be unregenerate, or perswade them to do it with Faith and Repentance. 2. Nor yet is it any of our Question, whether the Action of Receiving be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to any that are unregenerate, and so be his Duty? Though this Question being as necessary to our <hi>End,</hi> as that propounded, I shall also speak anon to the decision of it. 3. Nor is it any of our question, whether Sacramental Reception be meerly <hi>quid licitum,</hi> or an indifferent thing to them: For this is not pretended.</p>
            <p>Our Question is then 1. of the <hi>Benefit</hi> directly, and of the <hi>Duty</hi> but consequentially. 2 and of the <hi>Debitum habendi</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, and but consequently of the <hi>Debitum agendi.</hi> 3. and of the Title which is the foundation of Right, or of an Antecedent Right to the benefit, even a Right that may warrant before God a claim; and not of a meer subsequent Right <hi>in</hi> it; much less of a Possession without proper Right, or of a being an Object of the just Action of another. 4. It is of a Right given by God,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:107958:202"/>
and not of any thing which they may call a Right that cometh another way.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the Negative of the Question, which I shall maintain, I shall lay down what is easily granted the Opponent in these few Propositions following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. God hath bestowed Christ with his Benefits, Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Adoption, Sanctification, and Right to Sacraments; <hi>Conditionally</hi> upon all (at least, that hear that word:) Even In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, Heathens, Persecutors of Christianity, that never had a thought of accepting Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. Ministers may and must give the Sacraments to many Professors of saving Faith and Repentance, who have not the Faith or Repentance which they profess, supposing that these shall require the Sacraments at their hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. These Hypocrites may have right to the Sacraments <hi>in foro Ecclesiae</hi>; that is, <hi>Ecclesiâ Judice:</hi> which is no more than this, that their <hi>pretence</hi> of a true Right before God, is such as the Church cannot judge to be false, and therefore is bound to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the Sacraments to them, as to men who seem to have that proper right, as far as they can judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. If it shall after be discovered that the party had no proper right, but that the Church was mistaken in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will not follow that therefore the external Baptism was or is Null, or to be re-administred, though it reacheth not its main ends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. Infidels, Heathens, Turks, are obliged to seek to be baptized, and to receive the Lords Supper; that is, to become true Believers, and then to seek and receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 6. When the Church administreth Sacraments to Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, as they do but their duty, so God approveth their action, as knowing they do their duty: And therefore so far as that comes to the improper Right <hi>Coram Ecclesià,</hi> is also <hi>Coram Deo.</hi> As in the foresaid Comparison: If the Physitian knew his P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tient to dissemble, that he might have his Cordial, and the Apothecary did not know it, the Physitian will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie his Apothecary in his Administration. So will God justifie the foresaid Administration of his Sacraments, and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:107958:203"/>
acknowledge the Hypocrite to be the Object of our just tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For the Negative; <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. God hath not given by promise, Testament, or any other Deed of Gift, a proper Title to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to any that have not saving Faith and Repentance (and their seed) which <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> will warrant them to require and receive them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. God hath not commanded or allowed any that have not saving faith, to seek or receive the Sacraments, in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but hath made it the order of their Duty, first to Repent and Believe, and then to seek and receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>These two Propositions I shall now briefly, but sufficiently prove. The first hath in it three parts, 1. That God hath not made any Deed of Gift of Sacraments or right to Sacraments to any that are short of saving Faith, (save the seed of the faithful) 2. That therefore such have no title to Sacraments <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> that can properly be so called. 3. That therefore they cannot lawfully Claim and Receive them (though if they claim them we may lawfully Administer them) To avoid confusion, I shall take these distinctly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God hath made no Promise or Deed of Gift of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments or Right to them, to any that are short of saving faith, or on any lower <hi>Condition</hi> than saving Faith, I prove:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. There is none such to be found in Scripture. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath made none such. We have long expected the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of any such Gift or Promise; and yet none is produced: Which is likely would have been if it could have been found. And if it be not in Scripture, it is nowhere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If the Promise or grant of Right to Sacraments be made on any Condition besides saving faith, then 1. either on the Condition of the <hi>Profession</hi> of that Faith; 2. or on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a real inferiour faith; or 3. on Condition of the <hi>Profession</hi> of that inferiour faith. But none of these three. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Enumeration will be acknowledged sufficient by them that we have now to deal with. And 1. That the bare profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of saving Faith is never made the condition of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:107958:203"/>
or Deed of Gift, by which a Title to Baptism is conveyed, appeareth, 1. In that none such are found in all the Scripture: God nowhere saith, <hi>If thou wilt but profess or say th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest, thou shalt be baptized, or have Right to Sacraments</hi> (though the Church must administer them on that Profession) 2. Else God should command a man to lye, or justifie him in it, and make a lye the condition of his mercies. Though every duty be not the condition of Justification, yet every such condition is a duty, and every duty is commanded; and God doth not <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> any man to lye, or to profess to be what he is not, or do what he doth not, or have what he hath not. Much less will he make this the condition of his promises.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> God commandeth both Believing and Profession; therefore Profession is part of their duty; and their sin is not that <hi>they Profess,</hi> but that they do <hi>not Believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But God so connexeth these duties together, that the later is a sin, and no duty, if it keep not its place, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without the former. If a man tell a lye by speaking any good which he never thought, its true that God would have had him both think it and speak it, and then it would have been no lye; but he would not have him <hi>speak</hi> it before he <hi>think</hi> it; for then its a lye: And you cannot say that his sin is only in <hi>not thinking</hi> it, and not in speaking it, which was part of his duty: For it was both his sin, <hi>Not to think it, and to speak it when he did not think it</hi>; and <hi>spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>king it</hi> was not his duty, save upon presupposal that he think it, or it was not in any other order to be performed. The same is here the case between <hi>Believing</hi> and <hi>professing</hi> to Believe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God maketh nothing the matter of Duty, or the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Gifts, but what hath some moral worth in it which may shew it fit to be well pleasing to him. But the bare verbal Profession of that which is not in the heart, hath no such Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral worth in it as may make it pleasing in his eyes. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And then for an Inferiour Faith, that this is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Gods Promise, I have fully proved in another Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: Moreover, 1. No such promise can be produced out of the Word of God: If it could, its l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke we should have had

it ere now. 2. The promises are expresly made on the condition of saving faith; therefore not of any other. Of this more in the following Arguments. Only here I add, that as to the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Seals, no man can know the sincerity or reality of an inferior kind of Faith any more than of a saving Faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And then for the third, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Profession</hi> of a <hi>Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> or other inferior Faith, it can be no condition. 1. Because the faith it self professed is none; therefore the profession of it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> none. 2. The profession of a saving faith is none: Much less of a lower faith.</p>
            <p>Observe in all this, that when I mention a <hi>Dogmatical</hi> Faith, I take it in Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s sense, and the sense that its commonly taken in, <hi>viz.</hi> for an assent that comes short of that which justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth; and not as some of the Ancients did, who called justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith by the name of <hi>Dogmatical</hi> Faith, as dist not from Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Faith, because they ordinarily placed Justifying Faith in Assent: So <hi>Cyril, and John Hierosol.

               <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. It is one and the same Covenant, Testament, or Deed of Gift, by which God bestoweth Christ, and Right to Sacraments, and that on the same conditions. But the Covenant or Testament bestoweth himself only on the condition of saving Faith. Therefore it bestoweth right to Sacraments only on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of saving Faith.</p>
            <p>That there is any Covenant distinct from that one Covenant of Grace, Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> disowneth as <hi>a fancy that never entred into his thoughts:</hi> pag. 125. That this one Covenant or Testament gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Right to Christ and to Sacraments upon the condition of one and the same faith, is evident: 1. Because the word distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth not; therefore in this case we may not distinguish. It offereth Christ and Sacraments to men on these terms, <hi>if they will believe</hi>; but it doth not give us the least hint that by <hi>believing</hi> is meant two several sorts of faith, whereof one is of necessity to right in Christ, &amp; the other to right to Sacraments. Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> that
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:107958:204"/>
so <hi>abhorreth</hi> the imputing of equivocal terms to the Scripture, I hope will not feign them to speak so equivocally. If the Word had ever said, It <hi>is such a kind of faith</hi> that is the condition of Right to Christ; and <hi>such a different kind</hi> of Faith that is the condition of Right to Sacraments; then we might have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably so distinguished our selves; but there is no such thing. Yea, the Scripture maketh it plain that it is saving faith which it meaneth, that is pre-requisite to Baptism, as is already manifest from <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30, 31, 32, 33. &amp; 16 14, 15. &amp; 15 7, 8, 9. &amp; 8.37.2.38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44 <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which add <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Go ye therefore and Disciple me all Nations, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them in the name</hi> &amp;c. Those and only those that are Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, must be baptized. But none are Discipled Internally but true Believers, nor visibly but the professors of a true (saving) belief (and their seed) Therefore no others should be baptized.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> (which only requireth proof) is thus proved. None are Disciples but those that take or profess to take Christ for their chief Teacher and Saviour. But all that do so heartily, or profess to do so, have or profess to have saving faith: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none but those that have or profess to have saving faith, are Disciples.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is undeniable. The <hi>Minor</hi> is clear. If he that heartily takes Christ for his chief Teacher and Saviour, have not saving Faith, there is no such thing. It is he that <hi>will not hear the Prophet that shall be cut off</hi>; and he that will hear him that shall live. And he that heartily takes him for his chief Teacher, is willing to hear him and learn of him: And he will give rest to the souls of all that will come to him, and that learn of him, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28, 29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. God giveth Right to Sacraments to none but those to whom he giveth Right to Remission of sin. But he giveth Right to Remission of sin to none but true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: Therefore he giveth (p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oper) Right to Sacraments to none other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> wonders at, that all men should have right to the End or Fruit of the Ordinance, who have right to the Ordinance; when it is the right use and Improvement of Ordinances that must give right to the End. But 1. the form
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:107958:205"/>
of a Sacrament is Relative, and the nearest end essential to it; and therefore all ends are not separable, and at a distance. 2. God giveth no man Right to use Sacraments contrary to his Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: But the ends to which the Sacraments are instituted, is to seal up Remission of sin already given him by the promise: therefore he giveth Right to Sacraments to none but those to whom he giveth Right to Remission of sin. The <hi>Major</hi> is proved in the former Disputation. <hi>Object.</hi> But our Divines say that Baptism is not only for the Remission of sins past, but of future sins. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. True: but still including sins past. 2. It is the review or consideration of Baptism which they say is for the strengthening of our faith concerning the Remission of sin, daily as we commit it. 3. If any of them do make Baptism to be effectual to the Remission of sin hereafter, when present sin is not remitted, they suppose this to be by accident, when contrary to the intent and Institution of God, it is misused at the present, but rightly considered of in believing reviews.</p>
            <p>He that hath not Right to be baptized for the obsignation of Remission of sin, hath no Right given him by God to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. For God hath appointed no other Baptism. There are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed certain distant benefits of the Sacraments which are suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a distant improvement of them. But a saving partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in Christ and pardon of sin is a present benefit, which the person must be qualified for the obsignation of before he have Title by Gods gift to that Sacrament.</p>

               <hi>Ar.</hi> 5. <hi>Ad homine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> It is but few Protestants that I know of, that seem adversaries to our present Assertion; and those few also do grant it: Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saith <hi>pa.</hi> 124 of Sacraments: [<q>so that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit no promise of these ordinances made to such a faith but an actual investiture of every such believer in them.</q>] And when I supposed that he had thought there was a distinct promise of Church Priviledges upon condition of a faith not justifying, or saving, he tels us of some body (I know not who) that said I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>feigned this of him, then found it in him,</hi> and himself addeth [<q>
                  <hi>And I profess I know no man whose brain ever hatched or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such a crotchet</hi>] we are therefore here secure (or should be one would think) from Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> opposition.</q> If this much se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us not, see him <hi>p.</hi> 122. where (having thrown by my distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:107958:205"/>
as confusion, <hi>pag.</hi> 120. and my positions as not looking toward the business, (<hi>i. e.</hi> for ought he could see) and having confuted me by my own words, <hi>pag.</hi> 121. before he understood them) he brings me in thus stating the Question [<q>Whether these men be in Covenant with God, as to Gods actual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to them; so far as that Gods Promise is in force for conveying actual Right to them as to the promised Blessings? And so whether it be a mutual Covenant; and both parties be actually obliged? And thus I say, that wicked men are not in Covenant with God; that is, God is not in Covenant with them, neither have they any Right to the main Blessings given by the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ, Pardon, Justification, Adoption, Glory.] To this I annexed, (which he leaves out) Nor to the common Blessings of this Covenant; for they are given by the same Covenant, and on the same conditions as the special Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings: so that though they may <hi>have Right</hi> to them at present on the Ground of Gods present collation, or trusting them with them (as a servant hath in his Masters stock,) yet have they no Right by Covenant—] Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> replyeth.</q> 1. That he knoweth no man that hath spoke so much to prove the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative as I. But where? He will tell us Logically thus. [<q>So long as they break not the Covenant Engagement in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth they have obliged themselves, God stands engaged to them for the greatest spiritual blessings. But according to him they break not Covenant till they arrive at final impenitency and unbelief.</q>] <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. I said in another book, that as the new Law of faith is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods Covenant, so no man but final unbelievers, doth so break that Covenant, as to be the subject of its proper actual commination, <hi>i.e.</hi> penal censure; or that its penalty should thereby become his due (the penalty being a peremptory remediless ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion from all hope). And what doth Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> but make me say in an unexplained general, [<hi>that they break not Covenant till they arrive at final unbelief &amp;c</hi>] 2. I said over and over that they broke their own covenant engagements, though they did not so far vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Gods Covenant as to incur the foresaid curse: And what doth Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> but intimate that I teach [<hi>that they break not the Covenant engagement, in which they oblige themselves.</hi>] Yet he stops when he should have repeated these words in his <hi>Minor,</hi>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:107958:206"/>
perceiving it a cleanlier way to let the Reader infer them. Ah sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tempter that could procure such a volume of so worthy a man, to abound with so many passages of this nature, that are such strangers and enemies, not only to truth, and common equity, but even to that Ingenuity that should be manifested to an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But this on the by. His second answer is, [<q>That therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned which he cals the great Question between him and me, is no question at all! It were madness to affirm that which with those limits he thus denies.</q>] See Reader, though I was so <hi>Mad</hi> as to prove the Affirmative of this Question which I deny, yet Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> is not. And may I not now venture to conclude that thus far we are agreed.</p>
            <p>Well then, if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> never dreamed of a promise of God, made to a dogmatical faith, giving them right to Sacraments, nor thus actually engaging God to them, let us stay a little here to enquire what it is then that in his Judgement gives them Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Right. <hi>pag.</hi> 141. he brings me in saying, [<hi>But if you speak only of Covenant. Right to Baptism</hi> coram Deo, <hi>by his gift of Covenant, then I make them of the same extent.</hi> And he answereth, <hi>I cannot tell what other Covenant-Right to speak of,</hi> &amp;c.] So oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he saith that they have a Right or Title from God by his Covenant. What should the sence of this mysterie be? Doth Gods Covenant give it them, and yet is there no Promise of it to such as they? Nor is God actually obliged to give them the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of the Covenant? Certainly this cannot be. For 1. God hath no Covenant-act on his own part, but that which we commonly call his Promise or Testament. He saith [<hi>he that believeth shall be saved,</hi> &amp;c.] and [<hi>If thou believe thou shalt be saved: If thou receive Christ thou shalt have power to be the Son of God</hi>] And when the Soul consenteth it is a mutual Covenant, without any further deed of Gift from God: so that it is this same Promise which is conditional, and whose condition is our acceptance of the gift, which gives right to the Benefit when the condition (our acceptance) is performed; that is, when our hearts consent. And so God hath no Covenant act on his part to convey a Title, but his Promise: therefore if there be no Promise of Title to Sacraments, there is sure no Covenant-gift from God of such a Title, when they are the same. Can Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> shew a Covenant
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:107958:206"/>
of God <hi>ex parte sui</hi> distinct from this Promise? Why then is it not done?</p>
            <p>But <hi>p.</hi> 122. <hi>Did ever a man speak of an absolute tie in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional covenant, whether the conditions are performed or no</hi>] It seems then that it is but a conditional tie that he speaks of all this while. But whats that to the conveying of Right? The efficacy is sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended while the condition is unperformed: or else it were not a Condition. If God had conditionally by his Covenant given Title to Sacraments, that Covenant could give no Title, till the condition were performed. So that it is not a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Promise or covenant, till performance of the condition, that can give right. And yet Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> oft saith, that God giveth a Covenant-Right to such as (he seems to maintain himself) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not the condition. 2. But for all this, I still say our very faith or acceptance of Christ in the Covenant of God is our performing the condition. And therefore (which its sad should be an egregious affected piece of nonsence in the eyes of any Divines) our very heart covenanting, is our performance of the condition of the covenant of God, that is, God offereth to be our God, and Christ our Saviour, if we will accept him by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Our hearts consent and say, Lord I am willing. And this is our heart covenanting; that ties the marriage knot: and this was the condition of Gods Promise, or part in the Covenant. And therefore every true sincere Covenanter or Believer, as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth by consenting the condition of his first right and Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so he hath immediately the said Right and Possession: A marriage Covenant is such a performance also, as giveth present Title and Right. We are members of Christ, Pardoned, Adopted, as soon as ever we consent to the terms of the Covenant, that is, do believe. Its a poor put off for Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> to tell me, that [<hi>we are ofter said to be espoused to Christ, then married to him.</hi>] For what although the solemnization of the Nuptials with all the Church in one body be reserved to the last day, doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that each particular soul is not married to Christ before? Doth not Scripture expresly affirm it? Do any Divines deny to question it? What matter is it then which is oftner mentioned, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le both are mentioned, and both true?</p>
            <p>But yet it cannot be his meaning that a conditional promise
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:107958:207"/>
gives Right to Baptism: At least to men of his inferior faith For he expresly saith, that he [conceits no Promise of these Or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinances made to such a faith]. He doth therefore sure conceive (for all the former words) that there is some other way of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Title by Gods Covenant, or by God another way than by Covenant. And <hi>pag.</hi> 124. He expresseth it thus. [<hi>But an actual investiture of every such Believer in them</hi>]. Surely if we can but understand these words, we have his sence. I would not fall a rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this word <hi>Investiture,</hi> to make it confess its signification, if I knew where or which way else, besides in this one poor word, in all his two Volums to find his meaning. But if it must lie in one word, and that not obvious to all understandings, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth us to enquire what that word doth signifie. The word <hi>Investiture</hi> applyed to meer Physical subjects, signifieth but a meerly Physical alteration, and that can give no Title or Right: and therefore no doubt, that is none of his meaning. When the word is taken in a <hi>civil</hi> sense, it is usually <hi>forma concedendi feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> but sometime applied to other benefits, and it is commonly distinguished into that which is <hi>Ceremonial, Abusive, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,</hi> and that which is <hi>Natural and Proper.</hi> The former is preparatory to Actual Possession of the Benefit: and is said by Lawyers to be equal to, or much like to the Judges De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing a mans Possession, which is not a corporal putting him into possession: and the form usually runs thus, <hi>Investio te hoc annulo, ense, &amp;c.</hi> Here the thing that he is <hi>invested by,</hi> is the <hi>ring, sword, &amp;c.</hi> but the thing that he is <hi>invested of,</hi> is not them, but the Benefit which they signifie, and that but preparatorily, as to corporal possession of the thing it self: and this is used to be done in the face of a Court, or some eminent witnesses. This is Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>abusivè sic dicta.</hi> 2. The latter (<hi>Investitura vera &amp; propriè dicta)</hi> is the very delivery of Possession of the Benefit it self, which is done (say the <hi>Civilians</hi>) many wayes. As 1. When the foresaid Ceremonial Investiture is not at a distance as before, but <hi>in ipso feudo, vel oculis subjecto.</hi> 2. <hi>Si Dominus propriè investiendo utatur verbo tradendi, potest Vasallus propriâ autoritate ingredi pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessionem vacuam.</hi> 3. <hi>Si Dominus coram paribus Curiae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>juberet beneficiariam ingredi possessionem feudi.</hi> 4. <hi>Si beneficiarius per Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum ipsum aut jussu ejus per alium introducatur in possessionem feudi.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:107958:207"/>Now which of these is it that Master <hi>Blake</hi> here meaneth?</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Sacrament of Baptism delivered upon Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand upon the ground of his preceding Promise, is his true, proper <hi>Investiture</hi> of the Believer in the pardon of sin, and Membership of Christ and his Church. These therefore being <hi>quoad ipsam possessionem,</hi> delivered up by this sacred sign, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that it is only those that have antecedent Title to these Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits (Christ and Pardon) that can receive the Investing sign to that use and end, and to no other separated uses is it instituted by God. And as to the distant Benefits (the Kingdom of Glory, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> The Sacraments are a ceremonial Investiture as to them, and therefore should be applyed to none that hath not a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Title to those distant benefits, <hi>Ecclesià judice</hi>; or should be claimed and received by no other. Nor is it proper to call that an <hi>Investitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> of the sign it self, which is it self an Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of another thing. We use to say, <hi>by this</hi> Ring, Sword, &amp;c. <hi>I invest thee of that Benefit,</hi> but not <hi>by this</hi> Ring <hi>I invest thee of this</hi> Ring.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Question now in hand being not of an Investiture of the signified Benefit, but of a Title to the sign it self, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that it cannot be the first sort of Investiture, <hi>viz.</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial: For then it must be by some other Ceremony that we are invested of this Ceremony. And what that other Ceremony is by which God doth invest men of Baptism, no man can tell, nor I think hath gone about to tell.</p>

It must be therefore the latter sort of <hi>Investiture,</hi> or none, <hi>viz.</hi> the Natural and true: but that presupposeth a Title by some antecedent Promise or Gift: and is but the means of delivering possession of that which men had right to before; or of giving the <hi>jus in re,</hi> to them that had the <hi>jus ad rem.</hi> Now our Question is not of Possession, but of <hi>Title,</hi> or the <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to Investiture, and may warrant a claim.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And if you should say that this Investiture doth of it self confer Title to it self, you would speak a contradiction, the Title being antecedent to the right (as being its foundation) and the right <hi>(ad rem</hi>) antecedent to the Proffession which the Investiture gives. Or if you feign an immediate donation to be conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant with the Investiture, or closely antecedent, you must
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:107958:208"/>
prove it, and shew what it is. It is most certain that it must be somewhat, that is, <hi>Signum voluntatis Divinae de Debito habendi,</hi> that must confer on us a Title: a meer providential disposal is no such thing; for that is no civil, but a Physical Investiture, and signifieth not the will of God <hi>de Debito,</hi> but only <hi>de Eventu,</hi> and therefore of it self is no Title: (Of which see the <hi>Lancashire</hi> Ministers against the engagement, at large.) It must then be a Testament or some Deed of Gift, which in the Gospel goeth under the name of the Promise, which before this possession must give the Title: But a Promise in the present case, as made to the dogmatical Believer, is denyed by the Opponent. A new immediate donation concurrent with the Investiture (so called) there is none. God doth neither then say, <hi>I give thee Title to this Sacrament,</hi> Or <hi>I deliver it to thee</hi> absolutely; but only hath long ago in his Promise said, that which is equivalent, conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; so that he hath no new donation but only the old one of his Promise, newly applyed by his Minister; and the condition of that Promise is a saving faith, and, not another sort of faith.</p>
            <p>There remaineth therefore but two acts or wayes of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Investiture, which can be pretended: And that is 1. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to them to take Possession (which is not pretended) or to claim it of the Minister. 2. And a command to the Minister as Gods Agent to deliver it to such a man. And for the first, it will fall under our further consideration anon, where we shall shew that there is no such command. Nor can any command give Title to a Benefit, but what hath the nature of Gift, as well as a command. If then there be no Promise or Gift, there is no right to the benefit: commands as such do only oblige to duty. And as for the command to Ministers to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Sacraments. 1. It is in Scripture commanded them that they baptize them that Repent and Believe (and their seed) but no others: Therefore whereas by Reason and Scripture-exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and general Rules, it is made their duty to baptize, or give the Lords Supper to <hi>Professors,</hi> that is as they <hi>seem Believers</hi>; seeing God never intended to make us the searchers of hearts, therefore we must follow the common Rule of humane converse, to take mens words about the secrets of their hearts,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:107958:208"/>
till they utterly forfeit the credit of their words. But to them that profess not truly to believe, we may not give them. 2. Nor may we give them as from God to men under the bare notion of Professors but as Believers. I mean, that in our invitation and offer, we may not tell men [<hi>All that profess to believe, come to this Sacrament, for its Gods will that you have title to it,</hi>] nor may we manage the ordinance in the terms of our prayers or Delivery, as to meer Professors, but as to Believers, and so must we call them, as in probability, and from their profession esteeming them such.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As it is only true Believers that we must <hi>Call</hi> to receive them, so if any other come they come contrary to our <hi>Call,</hi> and so contrary to the word that God put into our mouths, and to his Will; and therefore they have hereby no Title. Its true that it becomes our duty to deliver them the Sacrament, but that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally, on supposition of their unjust claim, and hyhocritical or false profession: &amp; <hi>ex propria calpa nemini debetur commodum.</hi> God imployeth not heart searchers in his Administrations; but he offereth his Ordinances only to heart-searchers and on heart-conditions: And therefore the Pretenders of such conditions may warrant our delivery; but they can never warrant or justifie their own claim, or false pretence in order thereto: And therefore they being not the people that God offered his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to, and called to receive them (unless by turning true Believers) it follows that they have not Gods consent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; and therefore there is no <hi>Gift</hi> from him. As the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister doth in the Word, so doth he in the Sacraments: In the Word we are to offer Jesus Christ to all that will accept him by a living faith, that is, to offer him to all that he may be so accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and on condition of such Acceptance, may be theirs. But if some unsound Professors shall in their way, lay hold of him, and say, he is theirs, it is they that make the false appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and not either God or we. So if we are to comfort any afflicted conscience, we are no heart-searchers, and therefore cannot say to any, <hi>Thou art a Believer, and therefore this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort belongs to thee</hi>; but we can only deliver them this <hi>Major</hi> Proposition [<hi>This Comfort belongeth to all true Believers</hi>] and this conditional conclusion [<hi>If thou be a true Believer, it belongs to thee</hi>:] But it is the person himself that must affirm [<hi>I am a true
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:107958:209"/>
believer</hi>] and so must make the conclusion absolute. And then if the Assumption be untrue, it is his own, and not Gods or ours. So we are to offer the Sacraments (and Christ in the Sacraments) to all true penitent Believers. This is our Duty. If any now will step forth and take the Lords Supper among the faithful, it is himself that maketh the sinful application: And if any will say [<hi>Baptize me, for I do heartily repent and believe,</hi>] If this be false, it is he that makes the false Application. And therefore here is no Divine donation can be proved; nor any consent of God to his claim; though we are justifiable for the actual giving it upon that claim. So that here is no such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture that can be proved which conveyeth any Title, or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranteth any claim: There is only a command to us to offer it to true Believers, and to give it by actual delivery to such Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and to believe them that say they are such Believers, till we have just cause to discredit them, or can sufficiently disprove them. So that actual delivery upon such a false profession of theirs, is morally no Gift, nor Investiure, but only such as is meerly Physical, as to any collation of Right, the application being by themselves, who can give themselves no Right, and not by God, who never gave consent to the claim.</p>
            <p>And thus I have proved and vindicated the first part of my first Proposition, concerning the Sacraments considered as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits [that <hi>God hath not made any gift of them to any but true Believers.</hi>] The two next I need to say less to, because enough is said on the by, in vindicating the former.</p>
            <p>The second was, that [<hi>seeing God hath given no Title, therefore they may not lawfully claim them.</hi>] And this is clear from the common Laws of Propriety, that no man may lay claim to that which he hath no Title to. He that would not be questioned as an Usurper, must look to his Right before he take possession or use.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> What another is commanded to give me, that I may lawfully claim as my Right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He is commanded to give it Believers, and to you if you will profess that you are a Believer; but withall you are forbidden to profess it if it be false, and therefore that is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Bar against your claim, <hi>Coram Deo</hi> in the Judgement of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:107958:209"/>
God; though its true that <hi>Ecclesia Judice,</hi> your claim is such even upon a false profession which they cannot deny. If they be commanded to give it you if you claim, and you not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and warranted to claim it, then their duty of giving it upon such claim, will prove no title in you before God.</p>
            <p>The next part of my Proposition doth so clearly follow from what is said, that I need not say any more to prove it, It is your sin to claim and receive that Sacrament, which the Minister may deliver to you upon your claim without sin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you must judge by heart-evidence, but the Minister cannot.</p>
            <p>But whereas Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth make it so strange that a Minister may lawfully administer that Sacraments to a man which <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> he hath no right to (against which he is so confident) I would demand of him whether <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> or <hi>Deo Judice,</hi> a man have true title to Sacraments without any faith at all, I mean a downright Infidel or Heathen? If he say, No; then he yieldeth all the cause. For if this Heathen will so far play the Hypocrite as to profess a Dogmatical Faith (as he saith) or a saving faith (as the Church saith) then he will confess that it is the Ministers duty to give him the Sacrament upon his claim; and so he must give it to a man that <hi>Deo Judice</hi> hath no true right to it. But if he say that such an Heathen hath right to it <hi>Deo Judice,</hi> I shall not stand now any further to confute him, then 1. to challenge him to prove his Title: And 2. to advise him to be cautelous how he undertaketh to justifie his title and claim at the barr of God when the reckoning comes, and these matters must be reviewed.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the first Proposition, which speaks of Sacraments <hi>ut Beneficia,</hi> and proved that God hath not given, by Promise, Testament, or any Deed of Gift, a proper title to Sacraments to any but sound believers (and their seed) which will warrant them to claim and receive them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next thing to be done, is to speak of the Receiving of Sacraments as it is <hi>Officium,</hi> a Duty, constituted by some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God; and the Proposition is that [<hi>God hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or allowed any that have not saving faith to claim and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacraments in that condition, but hath made it the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:107958:210"/>
order of their duty, first to repent and believe, and then to claim and receive the Sacraments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If no man is commanded or warranted to receive the Sacraments without a <hi>Profession</hi> of true faith and repentance, then not without that faith and repentance it self. But the antecedent is true; therefore so is the consequent.</p>
            <p>The Antecedent is proved in the other Disputations. The Consequence is plain: For no man is commanded or warranted to lye, or make a false profession: But to profess that Faith and Repentance which they have not, is to lye, or make a false profession (at least if it be not a profession limited) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I have proved before that such a Profession is not only pre-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to Sacraments, but also that the very reception of them doth contain it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. No command can be produced in Scripture, which will warrant a man to seek and receive the Sacraments without a saving faith: Therefore there is no such command. I shall pass by all other Arguments (because they may be gathered from what I have said already) and shall only enquire into the commands which are pretended, because the proof lieth on them.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>Every Jew and his children were commanded to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised: Therefore the impenitent, hypocrites, &amp;c. are commanded to receive the Sacraments.</hi> As Gen. 17.14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. They were not commanded to be circumcised whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they consented to the Covenant or not, but Circumcision was the token of the Covenant, and a seal of the righteousness of that faith which they had or professed to have, being yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. That is, the Parent for himself and his child professed a true consent to the Covenant. And this Consent I have before proved to be saving faith, or inseparable from it. And so Covenanting was then as strictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as Circumcision.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But every male was to be cut off that was not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I shall not now stand to enquire into the meaning of that cutting off: But whatever it was, it is certain that there
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:107958:210"/>
is as much threatned to them that did not covenant with the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But that cannot import a sincere Covenanting in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith; For then how great a part of the people must be cut off?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It plainly speaks of the profession of sincerity in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.12 13. <hi>And they entred into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their Fathers with all their heart, and with all their soul, that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But (saith Mr. <hi>Blake)</hi> though they covenant to believe savingly, yet they do not profess that they do so; and it is not covenanting that proves men in a state of justification and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but keeping the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He that covenanteth from that time forward to take the Lord for his God sincerely, doth by that Covenant at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent express that he consenteth to have the Lord for his God, (upon the Covenant terms:) but he that professeth such a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> doth <hi>eo nomine</hi> profess saving faith, which is nothing else but <hi>Assent,</hi> and that consent producing affiance. There is no act proper to saving faith, if <hi>Consent</hi> be not. 2. As therefore faith, which is (or is inseparably joyned with, as others confess) the hearts <hi>consent</hi> doth justifie a man before he express it in works of actual obedience, so it is but the same thing which we say, that heart-covenanting, or consent, doth justifie, or prove a man ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, before he do any further keep that Covenant by any positive effects of it. For it is the performance of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods promise that first prove us justified; and God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth Christ and Justification with him to all that believe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ, or accept him as offered. And this receiving, or accepting, is the same thing with <hi>consent</hi> or <hi>heart-covenanting.</hi> So that all that we oblige our selves to for the future in our sincere covenanting with Christ, are not any means of our Justification as begun, but only of the continuance or not losing of it. 3. Yet still we easily grant that or all covenanting without the hearts consent will save none.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Is it credible that all Israel must be forced to profess themselves true believers, when many were not?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:107958:211"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> God required them first to <hi>be such,</hi> and upon pain of damnation, and then to <hi>profess</hi> themselves such, and seal it by his Sacrament. He warranteth no man to profess a falshood, but that they truly consent and then profess it. Though <hi>Asa</hi> and the other Rulers could search no deeper then an External Profession or Covenant and their practice in <hi>seeking</hi> God, because they did not know the heart. And that it was indeed no other then that which then was saving faith which was professed (and so required) in that Covenant, doth appear in the terms of it. It was to take God, to be their only God, and to give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be his people; and the mention of their deliverance from the Egyptian bondage, and the nature of Circumcision shew that it was <hi>in Deum Misericordem &amp; Redemptorem,</hi> they that professed to believe, with such respect to the blood of the Messiah as those darker times required. The terms in <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.16, 17, 18. do plainly express that faith which then was proper to the saved [<hi>The Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgements; thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul: Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his wayes, and keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgements, and to hearken to his voice: And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, &amp;c.</hi>] Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to take the Lord for our God is the sum of all Religion, and the very nature of Sanctification. For it is not the bare <hi>Name</hi> of God, but <hi>God</hi> himself that is here meant. And this can be no less in any tolerable sense, then to take him by Assent and Consent, for our absolute Lord and Soveraign, and chief Good, or End.</p>
            <p>And that the Jews themselves thus understood the Covenant of Circumcision, <hi>Ainsworth</hi> on <hi>Gen</hi> 17. sheweth out of their Rabbies in these words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ex lib. Zohar.</hi> 
               <q>At what time a man is sealed with this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed seal of this sign, thenceforth he seeth the holy blessed God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and the holy soul is united with him. If he be not worthy that he keepeth not this sign, what is written? <hi>By the breath of God they perish,</hi> Job 4.9.

"[By three things did Israel enter into the Covenant, by Circumcision, and Baptism, and Sacrifice, &amp;c. And so in all ages when an Ethnick is willing to enter into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and gather himself under the wing of the Majesty of God, and take upon him the yoke of the Law, he must be circumcised, and baptized, and bring a Sacrifice, &amp;c. When a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cometh to joyn a Proselite, they make diligent enquiry after such, lest they come to get themselves under the Law, for some riches that they should receive, or for dignity that they should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or for fear. If he be a man, they enquire whether he have not set his affection on some Jewish woman; or a woman her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection on some young man of Israel. If no such like occasion be found in them, they make known unto them the weightiness of the yoke of the Law, and the toil that is in the doing of it, above that which people of other Lands have, to see if they will leave off. If they take them upon them, and withdraw not, and they see them that they come of love, then they receive them; as it is written, When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.18. Therefore the Judges received no Proselites all the dayes of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> Not in <hi>David</hi>'s dayes, left they should have come of fear: Nor in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, lest they should have come because of the Kingdom and great prosperity which Israel then had. For who so cometh from the Heathens, for any thing of the vanities of this world, he is no righteous Proselite. Notwithstanding there were many Proselites, which in <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s days, joyned themselves in the presence of private persons, and the Judges of the great Synedron had a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Ob. 2. <hi>If none but the Regenerate or sincere Believers have Title to Baptism and the Lords Supper, then none can seek or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, till they have Assurance of their sincerity, which would exclude abundance of upright Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. God layeth his commands upon us conjunctly, and our casting off one, will not authorize us to cast off another. Upright Christians are obliged both to judge themselves to be
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:107958:212"/>
what they are, and to receive the Seals of the Covenant: And if they judge themselves not to be upright when they are, or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion their integrity as a thing to be doubted of, this is their sin, and cannot be done inculpably. And this sin will not justifie them in forbearing the Sacraments: For one sin will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse another. The thing therefore that such are bound to, is, first to use right means to know themselves, and then to judge of themselves as they are, and then to seek and receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And if he say, [I have tried, and yet I cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, or I fear I am unfound] yet that will not free him from the blame of mis-judging, nor from the obligation of judging more justly of himself.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a true discerning of a man's own faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which is far below a strict Assurance; and he that truly discerneth that he repenteth and believeth, hath a clear ground to profess it, though he have much doubting and fear of the contrary. The judgement of few or none is in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> but it swayeth and determineth either to judge that they are sincere, or that they are not. If it judge that they are not, when they are, their duty is to rectifie that judgement out of hand. If they judge that they are sincere, though they attain not a full Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, they have reason to act according to that judgement. Mans heart is a dark piece, and much unacquainted with it self; and if Mr <hi>Blake,</hi> or any of his opinion, will prove that a man must suspend all his Actions which are not guided by a certain assured judgement, he will evacuate most of Gods service in the Church. I doubt not but he will confess that it is only the penitent that should profess themselves penitent (in that Condition) and only they that truly desire Christ and Grace, that should say they desire them; and only they that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived saving grace that should give God thanks for it as a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved benefit. And yet if no one should confess sin with profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of penitence but they that have full assurance that they are truly penitent; if no one should beg grace with profession that he desireth it, till he have full assurance of the truth of those desires; and if no one should give thanks to God for Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption (in the special sense) and effectual Vocation, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and Justification, Adoption, Reconciliation, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:107958:212"/>
&amp;c. but those that have a full assurance that they have received these, I doubt God would have little Confession, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or Thanksgiving of this sort from his people. Is it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to say [<hi>Lord I believe</hi>] as long as we have any <hi>Vnbelief</hi> to be removed? When <hi>Peter</hi> knew not but that he might short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny Christ with cursing and swearing, yet might he law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully confess his belief in him. A man may warrantably speak and profess the Truth which he is not fully certain of, as long as he doth it <hi>bona fide,</hi> and really meaneth what he speaketh, and uttereth his very heart so far as he knoweth it. 2. And as long as he is not negligent in his endeavors to know it, but faithfully labors to be acquainted with it. All such ordinary Professions do imply this limitation [<hi>This is the truth, so far as I know my own heart.</hi>] And if it were not lawful to go on this ground, I must give up almost all my duties. For I finde so great darkness in my own heart, and strangeness to my self, that it is few things that I say of my own heart, which I can speak with such assurance as this. When Christ commanded me, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.24. to [<hi>Leave my gift before the Altar, and go my way, and first be reconciled to my Brother, and then come and offer my gift</hi>;] as I am uncertain when my Brother's minde is reconciled to me, so if I should never offer my gift till I had full assurance that my own minde is sincerely reconciled to him, perhaps I might sometime be put upon a long forberance. For many a one that can say, [<hi>I know nothing by my self</hi>] is yet so conscious of the falsness of his heart, that he is forced to add [<hi>yet am I not thereby justified</hi>] and [<hi>I judge not my own self,</hi> &amp;c.] Christ hath told us that God will not forgive us, unless we truly repent and believe, and from our heart forgive one another. If none may thank God for remitting their sins, till they have undoubting assurance of all this, God would have little thanks for forgiveness. Then the scruples of those that reject singing Psalms, would turn off al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all. Who durst say or sing <hi>Psal</hi> 116.1. [<hi>I love the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.10. [<hi>with my whole heart have I sought thee,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Psal.</hi> 138.1. &amp; 91. &amp; 111.1. [<hi>I will praise thee O Lord with my whole heart,</hi> &amp;c.] unless so few as would make but small melody. Many particulars might be instanced in, to shew that this ground would evacuate most duties.</p>

               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:107958:213"/>3. As Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> is uncertain of every one of his hearers that seeketh Sacraments, whether he have indeed a Dogmatical faith or not, so I doubt he would Baptize but few Children in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of what he doth, if none should seek it but those Parents which are undoubtingly certain that they do truly Believe with that Dogmatical faith. 1. Certain I am upon much sad tryal that a great number of the Parishioners that have long been our constant hearers, and have presented many Children to Baptism, have not a Dogmatical faith it self as to the essentials of the Christian Religion; For many tell me that they Believe not that the Son or the Holy Ghost is God, or that any one hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us, or made satisfaction for our sins, and that they trust only in Gods mercy and their praying, and amendment for Pardon. 2. I meet with the most humble, Godly, learned and judicious men of my acquaintance, who manifest more doubtfulness about the Dogmatical part, or Assenting Act of their faith, then any other, or at least, their doubt of the rest is most here grounded, because they doubt of their truth in this. And though they are comforted in this consideration, that even Assent is imperfect in the Saints on earth, and mixt with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and that they lament their infidelity and doubting, and have so much Belief of the truth of Scripture, as prevaileth with them to resolve to trust their everlasting happiness only on that bottom, though with the forsaking of all earthly things, yet are they far short of a full assurance or certainty of the truth of the Gospel, and are principally in doubt of the sincerity of this act of their faith. Now I would know what Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> would have these Godly persons do that are not assured of their Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical faith, but are oft ready to say, [I shall one day perish by this Unbelief.] If he would have them receive the Sacraments without assurance of a Dogmatical faith, we have reason to think that they may receive them without assurance of a justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, though we make this the condition of their Title as they do the other. 3. It is a great controversie among the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Divines, whether an unconverted man can have that faith which we call Dogmatical. I know but two or three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines to be of Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s opinion (though its like enough there may be more) And one of them thinks that the nature
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:107958:213"/>
of justifying faith lieth only in Assent, another I have heard in conference maintain that wicked men (or the unconverted) do not indeed Believe God; nor that the word of God is true. And if this be so, then sure a Dogmatical faith is a justifying faith, and he that must be sure of the one, must be sure of the other, when it is not really another but the same, or an essential part of the same. This also is the judgement of many Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, as Bishop <hi>Downam, Camero,</hi> and his followers, and many more, <hi>viz.</hi> that faith lieth in Assent or a perswasion of the truth of the word; and the common opinion of Protestants is, that this Assent is one essential part of justifying faith, and that it is in the understanding as well as the will, (I remember scarce any of note besides <hi>Amesius</hi> that placeth it in the will only, and make the act of the Intellect to be but Integral or preparatory.) And if there be any such thing as Grace, or Holiness and Rectitude in the Intellect, I do not yet conceive wherein it can consist, if not in Light, procuring knowledge of, and Assent to the truth. And how much of this (<hi>jure vel injuria)</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> yields to the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, see him on <hi>sacr. pag.</hi> 179. As in these words. [<q>And therefore though the wicked match the Regenerate in assent in their understandings, it will not follow that their understandings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are truly sanctified] <hi>I am far from believing that the wicked do match the Regenerate in assent in their understandings:</hi>
               </q> But if he can prove this, I would fain know what the Rectitude or Sanctity of the understanding is, seeing he supposeth that this is not it. He that with a deep habitual assent doth Believe that God is the chief good, and that for him, and that Heaven is more desirable than earth, and that there is no salvation but by Christ received as our Priest, Prophet, and King, &amp;c. I think he hath a sanctified understanding, or else I know not who hath, nor what it is. But in such great points as this, if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> have made any new discovery of the nature of sanctity or rectitude in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect as a thing differing from assent, he might have dealt chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to have told us what it is, and not to have left the world at a loss.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And I still think, that (at best) if the wicked have a true Dogmatical Belief of the essentials of Religion, it is as hard or harder for them to attain assurance of the truth of that Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:107958:214"/>
Belief in its kinde, as it is for the Regenerate to attain assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the truth of saving faith in its kind. Therefore if the wicked may lawfully claim a Right in both Sacraments without assurance that they are sincere in <hi>their kind</hi> of faith, why may not the Godly claim a Right without assurance of sincerity in <hi>their kind</hi> of faith? And if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> will say that neither <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> nor <hi>perswasion,</hi> that we have either the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other,</hi> is necessary to a claim or Right, but only a promise of them for the future, then Heathens and Infidels have right, and may lay a claim. For they can promise to be Christians, and yet remain Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
            <p>Obj. 3. <hi>If you take none to have such a right as may warrant their claim and receiving but only sound Believers, then you make electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the covenant and seals to by commensurate: which is not to be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The terms are ambiguous, Supposing that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand each other as to the sence of the word [Election,] I say of the word [Covenant] that it may mean three differing things. 1. If you mean the conditional promise of Christ and life to all that will Believe, I say that this is not commensurate with Election: For as to the <hi>tenor</hi> it belongs to all the world, and as to the promulgation, to all that hear it. This is sometime called a covenant in the sense as all Divine constitutions be, about our life: and sometime as it is the offer of a mutual covenant; and sometime as it is seemingly accepted: But still God is but condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally obliged: And this is no sufficient Title to the seal: For then it were due to open Infidels, if not to all. 2. If by the word [Covenant] you mean, mans own promise to God, or consent to his offer, so I say it is either sincere or not sincere. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere consent to Gods offer is commensurate with election (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you can prove that such fall away totally and finally.) But unsincere consent (as when it only to half) the offer or unsin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere promising (with the tongue, without the sincere consent of the heart) is not commensurate with election; nor doth it warrant the Hypocrite to claim the Sacraments, though it may warrant me to give them if he claim them. 3. If by the [Covenant] you mean. Gods actual obligation, which followeth mans ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, which is the performance of the condition of Gods
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:107958:214"/>
promise; then I say, it is commensurate with election (unless you could prove the foresaid doctrine of Apostacy) For when God hath promised us Christ and life on condition of our accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or consent, and we hereupon do sincerely consent, then Gods promise doth induce on him (as we may speak after our manner) an actual obligation, and give us an actual Right to the benefits, and is equivalent (as to that present benefit) to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute promise. And it is only this that will warrant our claim to any of the benefits.</p>
            <p>Obj. 4. Saith Mr. <hi>Blake, pag.</hi> 121. [<hi>And whereas he so peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily determines, that though wicked men oblige themselves, yet God still remaineth disobliged, let him consider, whether God be not some way obliged to all that he voucheth to be his people? If this be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there will be found no great happiness to a people, to have the Lord for their God; But God avoucheth these to be his people,</hi> Deut. 26.17. <hi>who are yet in an unregenerate state.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> By [some way obliged] you mean either <hi>conditionally</hi> (and so he is obliged to all the present living Infidels that ever heard the word, if not to all the world) or absolutely, or actually: and for the later let Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> on the next page answer Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> on this page: his words are [<q>Did ever man speak of an absolute tye in a conditional covenant, whether the conditions be kept or no? that therefore before mentioned which he calls the great question, is no question at all. It were madness to affirm that which with these limits he thus denies.</q>] The <hi>Condition</hi> suspendeth the <hi>Actual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,</hi> or at least the Right given beyond all controversie. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if the stipulation were only <hi>in diem,</hi> and not <hi>conditionally,</hi> then the thing promised were presently <hi>Due,</hi> that is, <hi>to be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter received</hi>: and the promissary had <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> though not <hi>statim possidendi &amp; statim crederet dies, etsi non statim veniret dies.</hi> For in a stipulation <hi>in diem crescit dies, quia statim debetur: sed nondum venit, quia non efficaciter peti potest.</hi> But in a promise conditional, there is no right, in the promissary, nor proper actual obligation on the promiser, till the condition be performed.</p>
            <p>And if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> deny this, he should have told us what it is that God is actually obliged to do, on mens bare profession or common sort of believing. But this he could not do without contradicting himself and the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:107958:215"/>And for Gods avouching Israel to be his people] I answer, 1. He avouched them all to be what they were, that is, a people that had actually made an open profession of consenting to his covenant, and had <hi>ore tenus</hi> taken him for their God. 2. He avouched them to be his people also, because that very many (how many Gods knows) were sincere in this covenant; and the whole may be denominated from the better part (especially if also the greater)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as our Divines use to tell the separatists, that as a field that hath much Tares is called a Corn-field, not from the Tares, but the Corn, which is the better and valued part; so the Church is so denominated (say they) from the sincere Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. 3. He avouched them to be his people, in regard of his peculiar choice of Israels seed to those temporal Mercies and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, which they had a promise of above other Nations of the earth; as many such are known. What benefits the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites had shall be enquired into anon.</p>
            <p>Ob. 5. <hi>The Jews had much advantage, and the Circumcision much profit every way,</hi> Rom. 3.1, 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The great advantages of the whole Nation, were principally for the sake of the Elect, as the third verse following sheweth; and many mercies the rest had by being among them, which were not by a Moral Donation given particularly to those Professors, but to the Nation, denominated from the better part.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Unbelievers or Ungodly had much advantage by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential disposals (planting the spiritual Church among them, &amp;c.) of which they had themselves no proper grant by donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to which they could lay no claim that was justifiable before God. And they had much accidentally from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Commission, as is before explained. And thus the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may have still, both Word and Sacraments, and outward Communion with the Church, and much of Gods protection and blessing for the sake of the godly, to whom they joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by outward profession. But this is formerly answered, and so are all the rest of the material Objections that I remember in my Apologie to Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>; and therefore I shall, to avoid further tediousness, refer the Reader thither; and if he have read that and this, I think he will not need more words (if he
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:107958:215"/>
read not in the dark) to save himself from being deceived by any of the rest of Mr. <hi>Blake's</hi> Replies. Only one or two of his Summaries I shall examine, as I finde them set together, <hi>pag</hi> 141, 142. and <hi>pag.</hi> 551.</p>
            <p>Ob. 6. Saith Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> pag. 141. [<hi>My third Argument to prove that a Faith short of Justifying may give Title to Baptism, is, [to make the visible seal of Baptism which is the priviledge of the Church visible to be of equal latitude with the seal of the Spirit, which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to invisible members, is a Paradox.</hi>] When I put him to prove that this Paradox is mine, in the generality here exprest, he proves it from my own words; where I say, We give the seal of Baptism to all that <hi>seem</hi> sound Believers, and their seed; and we say the seal of the sanctifying spirit is only theirs that <hi>are</hi> such believers.] I am convinct beyond denial, <hi>viz.</hi> To <hi>seem</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and to <hi>be</hi> believers, is all one and <hi>seeming</hi> believers and <hi>real</hi> believers are terms of equal latitude. And thus I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> useth to confute me; no doubt, to the full satisfaction of some of his Readers.</p>
            <p>The Visible Seal may be said to be <hi>of equal latitude,</hi> 1. Either in regard of a Title by Moral Donation which <hi>Coram Deo</hi> will warrant a Claim and Reception; and so I say that saving faith and such a Title to Sacraments (with the adult) are of equal latitude. 2. Or in regard of the justifiableness of a Ministers Administration, and the persons claim <hi>Ecclesia judice</hi>; and so they are not of equal latitude.</p>
            <p>But saith Mr. <hi>Blake [For his distinction which he hints here, and plainly delivers elsewhere, of Right</hi> in foro Dei, <hi>and</hi> in foro Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae, <hi>both to Covenant and Baptism; I suppose considerate men will pause upon it, before they receive it, especially in the sense which he puts upon it.</hi>]</p>
            <p>I like considerate <hi>pausing</hi> Readers. But lets hear your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. (Saith Mr. <hi>Blake) they may press him with his own Rule,</hi> Ubi lex non distinguit, non est distinguendum; <hi>such a Right to visible Ordinances before men never granted of God, I would fain learn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But I know not what Teacher you would fain learn of. Far be it from me to imagine that I can teach you in any thing. But yet I may presume to tell you (though not to teach
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:107958:216"/>
you) 1. That (as is often manifested) such an improper right may result from the Precept or Ministerial Commission (to give the Sacrament to Believers, or Professors of Faith that claim them) without a Donation of Title to themselves to warrant that claim. 2. That the nature of things must be distinguished from those Morals which the Law must constitute. I am of opinion that we need not go to the distinctions of the Law, to prove either that God, and the Church are not all one, but are really distinct, or that the Understanding and Judgement of God and of the Church are not all one; or that Gods Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Justification, or Condemnation, is really distinct from mans.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are some necessary Distinctions afforded us by that Doctrine which treats <hi>de legibus in Genere,</hi> which we may receive without recourse to the Law of God <hi>in Specie.</hi> Without Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it may be known that a Precept is not the same thing with a Promise or Deed of Gift; and that a Power of Administring to one that demandeth, is different from a Power to demand it, or any just Title that may warrant a claim.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If this will not serve you, I add, <hi>Lex distinguit, ergò di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguendum est.</hi> 1. You confess that a Dogmatical Faith is necessary to our Title. And what is that equally <hi>Coram Deo &amp; Exclesiâ?</hi> If a Jew say, [I will go and deride Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>; I will tell him to day that I believe in Christ, and I will be Baptized by him, and tomorrow I will scorn Christ to his face,] will you say that this man hath equall Right <hi>Deo judice,</hi> as he hath <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia judice?</hi> I will not be too confident of my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your minde, but upon consideration, I think you will not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. and <hi>Luke.</hi> 14. The servants had power to bring in (by perswasion) that person that had not on the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment (though they were to perswade him to come as a meet guest, and so with that garment, yet the performance they left to himself:) But yet he had no warrant for his access in that condition, and he meets there with a judgement of God, which was distinct from that of the Church, which with a [<hi>Friend, how camest thou in hither</hi>] &amp;c. left him speechless; Nor would it have saved him to have said, [<hi>Lord I was taught by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:107958:216"/>
Divines that there is no</hi> Forum Dei <hi>to judge of my Right to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, besides the</hi> Forum Ecclesiae: <hi>and I had Right in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, and therefore so I have in thine.</hi>] And thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands will finde this Plea prove uneffectual, if they shall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to use and trust to it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31, 32. I think there is a judgement of the Lord mentioned against unworthy receivers, that is not the same with the judgement of the Church: Nor is it my opinion that it was the Churches judgement which laid some of them in sickness, some in weakness, and some asleep. God took cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance of mens not examining themselves, and eating, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unworthily, which was an eating and drinking damnation to themselves; and of their not discerning the Lords Body; and that further then the Church did.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It hath till now been taken for granted that there is a twofold <hi>forum</hi> or judgement exprest in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18. Where binding on earth and binding in heaven are distinguished, and loosing on earth and loosing in heaven. The Treatisers that have wrote of the power of the Keyes, and the Expositors upon this Text, have not thought that these two were but one, nor did offer so injuriously (that I say not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully) to expound Christs words. If you say that [though they be not the same yet they agree, for that shall be bound or loosed in heaven, which is bound or loosed on earth] I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; that is, <hi>quando clavis non errat.</hi> When the Church judgeth justly, as the truth is. For God will not judge erroneously or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly because man doth so. Yea though the Churches error be inculpable (as if they absolve or excommunicate a man upon the full testimony of false witness, &amp;c.) yet God will not therefore judge as they. Though he will justifie their act of judging, yet he will not censure the true Title of the person to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on accordingly, nor binde or loose in heaven according to any mistaking sentence. Many other Texts do sufficiently evidence this distinction.</p>
            <p>But because Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth <hi>pag.</hi> 187. and often so perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily renounce this distinction in this controversie, I shall yet add one or two Reasons to shew the necessity of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If the judgment of God, &amp; the judgment of the Church
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:107958:217"/>
concerning mens Right and claim here be all one, then either the Churches judgement is infallible in this matter, or Gods judgement is fallible. But neither is the Churches judgement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, nor Gods judgement fallible. Therefore they are not both one.</p>
            <p>The force of the consequence is evident. And for the <hi>Minor,</hi> 1. To say Gods judgement is fallible, even that which he doth himself immediately exercise (of which we speak) is to Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme. 2. To say that mans judgement here is infallible, is to speak, 1. That which cannot be proved. 2. More than the Papists, yea more than the Italian Papists say of the Popes: For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself will confess him fallible about such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal causes as these; whether such a mans cause be good or bad, &amp;c. 3. If the judgement of man be in this case infallible, then no man was ever wrongfully admitted by the Church, and so the argument would hold <hi>à facto ad jus,</hi> such a one was admitted: therefore he had Right to claim and Receive: But the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is intolerable. For 1. It hindereth all hypocrites in the world (that should believe it) from repenting of their unjust claim and Receiving, and justifieth them all <hi>Coram Deo</hi>; but sure it will prove an uneffectual justification. 2. The same it doth by all Ministers that ever administred the Sacraments: It teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to justifie themselves as infallible, and to disclaim Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for any mistake: He that dare tell all the Ministers in the world that they never gave a man a Sacrament without Right <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> or all the Receivers in the world, that they never received it without such Right as will warrant their claim and Receiving, will shew whether the weakness even of good mens arguings may seduce.</p>
            <p>Moreover if the Minister be infallible in this case, then either by an ordinary ability of discerning, or by extraordinary pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge; The latter is not pretended by any, Protestants or Papists, that I know of: The former cannot be said, unless it be also said, 1. That all other men as wise be Infallible as well as they. 2. And that therefore the case hath such evidence that no Minister can possibly be mistaken in it. But this cannot reasonably be said. For 1. If an Infidel or Pagan come in scorn to be Baptized, and profess a Dogmatical faith when he hath
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:107958:217"/>
it not, the Minister cannot know his heart. 2. And if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> will say that the very scornful words of such a Professing Pagan, are a sufficient title <hi>coram Deo,</hi> yet the Minister may possibly mistake his words, and think he saith [<hi>I do believe,</hi>] when he saith [<hi>I do not believe.</hi>] 3. Or the Minister may easily mistake the extent and nature of Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Dogmatical faith, and think that the Infidel doth profess that Dogmatical faith, when it is but some faith yet lower than it, or but part of it.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if Ministers be thus infallible, then none of their Acts can be Nullities: but the contrary is true, and hath been the Judgement of the Church expressed in many Councils <hi>(de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizandis non legitime baptizatis quoad essentiam baptismi.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this would put us hard to the enquiry, Which is the Church that hath this Infallibility? Unless we say that all have it that call themselves the Church; against which many Councils have Judged, when they required the rebaptizing of all that were baptized by the <hi>Paulianists,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In a word, all the Arguments which we use against the Papal Infallibility, might be here taken up, and Voluminously managed against this.</p>
            <p>And if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> disown this Infallibility, there is no way left, but either to say that God hath no Judgement of this Case but what is fallible (which I hope he will not); or that God hath one Judgement of it, and the Church another; and then we have that we seek. If he say that God hath no immediate Judgement at all of it, but only the Churches, which is mediately his: I answer, 1. The Churches is not mediately his, when it is sinfully errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. 2. If God have a knowledge and observance of it, then he hath a Judgement of it. But to deny Gods knowledge or obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of it, is intolerable: therefore. 3. And I must say, that since I have observed in Scripture, both the use that God makes of good Angels and of evil, about the sons of men, and what appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances they make before him, <hi>Job</hi> 1. and how the faithful have their Angels beholding Gods face; how they have charge of us, and bear us up, and are ministring spirits for our good, and how the Excommunicate are delivered up to Satan, with much more of the like, I easily believe that God may well be said to have a <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and pass his sentences on the sons of men before his Angels,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:107958:218"/>
were it but by committing his will to Execution by them: For so far as they are Executioners, they must have a Commission for Execution, which containeth or implieth the sentence. And so there is a Justification and a Condemnation now before them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. If God have no other Judgement about Right to Ordinances, but the Churches Judgement, then Hypocrites have equal Right before God and before the Church, (or <hi>Judice Deo &amp; Judice Ecclesia</hi>;) yea it is the <hi>same Right</hi> which is more than <hi>equal Right.</hi> But the Consequent is false: therefore so is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent.</p>
            <p>A Jew that would make a jest of Christ and Baptism by a feigned Profession, hath such a Right <hi>Ecclesia Judice,</hi> as that the Church cannot contradict it: But God can contradict it. The Church cannot find any imperfection in it but God can. <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia Judice,</hi> his Right is as good as the soundest Believers: but God will not say so. He may charge the Church with doing him wrong, if they deny him the Sacrament: but so he cannot charge God, if he hinder or prohibit it.

            <p>Instead of arguing such a Cause any further, I shall lament the case of the Church among us, that any should be found among its Reverend, Pious Guides, that shall so confidently publish, or so easily entertain (as some seem to do) so strange a point as this which we oppose: For how far may they yet be led, that can so easily be led to this.

            <p>Having said thus much to Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> denyal of the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods judgement and the Churches in this case, I proceed to that which followeth in his book. <hi>pag.</hi> 141.</p>
            <p>[Mr. Blake. 3. <q>They may tell him of the necessity that is put upon Ministers to prophane this Divine Ordinance, in putting this seal ordinarily and unavoidably to meer blank paper: which is a most contumelious abuse of it.</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> They may sooner <hi>tell it,</hi> than <hi>prove it,</hi> to be any <hi>propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> or <hi>contumelious abuse.</hi> Big words, may be bad arguments. Its the Claimer that is the Prophaner, whom you encourage by telling him that he hath a Title: but it is not the Minister; who was never made a searcher of hearts, no not to know the truth of a Dogmatical faith: and therefore may justly set the seal to a blank paper, when the Receiver is made judge whether it be blank or not, or at least, is to give us the evidence that we must proceed upon. I would you would before this have told us whether one that dissemblingly pretendeth your Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical faith, be a blank paper or not, or one that as a Parrat is taught to say [I believe in God, &amp;c. [when he understandeth not what he saith. If not, it seemes a Dogmatical faith is not the Title then in your account. If yea, then doth the Minister prophane the Ordinance in giving it such; and hath not Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> sealed to many such blanks, and contumeliously abused the Ordinance?</p>
            <p>[Mr. Blake. <q>They may tell him that poor souls are thus misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly cheated, in bearing them in hand, that these great priviledges, and consequently all further Church priviledges are theirs, when the conveyance is meer fraudulent that casts it upon them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:107958:220"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Alas poor souls! Alas miserable cheaters! But who are they? They that bear them in hand that these priviledges are theirs by conveyance: which is not 1. Let Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> answer for himself. 2. It was a gentler passage than this, that caused Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> presently to inferr. [<hi>It seems he hath met with a company of cheaters.</hi>] 3. But to call his brethren cheaters, is nothing so dangerous as to call the conveyance fraudulent. That do not I do: for I say that there is no such conveyance, (unless you take the word improperly.)</p>
            <p>[Mr. Blake <q>They may yet tell him that a door is here opened to Anabaptism, or multiplication of Baptism. A new door, of which either nothing, or very little, hath ever been spoken.</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. They may tell me so: but how will you prove that they tell me true? I see by you, that <hi>telling</hi> is easier then <hi>prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and commoner then truth. 2. Your making this a door to Anabaptism, doth give them that which you cannot warrant them, and advantage the Anabaptists more under pretence of renouncing their advantages, than you desire: the common suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of passionate oppositions. 3. Your feigning this to be new, and never or little spoken of before, in my understanding, importeth one of these consequences; either as if you had said [<hi>All Historie is false; believe nothing that ever you read in them; nay trust not your eyes and ears, that see and hear the contrary to what I say</hi>;] or else as if you had proclaimed. [<hi>Take heed how you credit even Godly Divines in the heat of their contention, even in the most palpable matters of fact.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Mr. Blake. <q>When discovery shall be made that the Title when Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism was administred was barely seeming, then all was Null <hi>ab initio</hi> in such proceedings: and as such persons alwaies were in the eyes of God, so now in the eye of men they are unbaptized persons.</q>] <hi>Ans.</hi> What proof of all this? but you say so? 1. Baptism is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken for the meer external Ordinance: sometime for that conjunct with the grace signified, or with the effects. As to the actual conveyance of pardon and life, I affirm that Sacraments are uneffectual to unbelievers; and so do you; If that be a Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, call them Null. But how prove you that the external Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is a Nullity where there was no Title? The Title indeed was Null <hi>ab initio,</hi> but prove that the Ordinance was so too?
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:107958:221"/>
well! this must be proved from <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and from <hi>Titius</hi>: [<q>If <hi>Titius</hi> got possessions presumed to be his due inheritance, and afterwards it be made appear that it never pertained to him, but to <hi>Sempronius,</hi> all is to be judged invalid.</q>] <hi>Ans.</hi> But if this pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session was delivered by a sealed instrument, as possession of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is to a Traytor or Malefactor (where right and possession are co-incident,) and the Tenor of this instrument be, that only those that are returned to loyalty shall have the benefit, (<hi>e. g.</hi> pardon) and a messenger is sent to deliver these instruments to all that profess Loyaltie; here if any Traytor shall profess that Loyalty, and seek to kill his soveraign the next day, though all be Null as to the effect of pardoning him, yet the external acts of sealing and delivery are not themselves Nullities. And if it be the will of the Prince that this act shall be effectual to its end, when the person shall return to his Loyalty, without the sealing the instrument anew, it may even to the effect be valid afterward, that through his fault was not so before.</p>
            <p>But if the Anabaptists must have this news that I am turned so far to them as to open them a new door, let them take alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and make merry that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and I are turned so far Anabaptists together, and then there may be hope that while we two hold open the door, more may come in ere long. He oft tells us that it is a Dogmatical faith, or a faith short of justifying, that entitleth to Baptism: <hi>England</hi> swarms with people that have not a Dogmatical faith, and yet they receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and their Children are Baptized (and what faith their ancestors had, who knoweth?) There's scarce a week but I hear one or other tell me, that Christ is God and not Man, or Man and not God, or that they do not think any one hath been our surety, or made any satisfaction to God, or suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our sins.] If all these Baptisms and other administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be Nullities, and if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> will but teach that all should be rebaptized, whose parents are now discovered to want the Title of a Dogmatical faith, I much fear, he will yet have more rebaptized persons in one County than now is in Ten, at least.</p>
            <p>If the Minister be commissioned to deliver the Sacrament on an unjust claim, this justifieth his act, and as he did his duty,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:107958:221"/>
so he hath no Scripture for the repeating it.</p>
            <p>I before instanced in the case of a scornful Jew, that purposely comes to Baptism to deride Christ, or to be in a capacity to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief his cause or people. Hath this man a Title by Gods Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Church-membership, seals, and all the blessed priviledges of the visible Church, which Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> sets forth? If he have, then malicious wickedness is the condition of Gods great mercies. And when shall we see the Donation that conveyed this Title to him?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi> [6. "<hi>They may tell you that that Scripture distinction of Circumcision in the flesh, and Circumcision in the heart, is hereby overthrown.] Ans.</hi> 1. They may tell it me twice, before I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them once. 2. They may tell it you as well as me. Was it not possible for a Jew upon mistake to Circumcise a man that had no Right to it, and yet upon some kind of misunderstood professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Resolve whether that were a Nullity first for your self, and then I will study a further answer.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi> [7. <q>They may tell him that this principle stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all persons dying unregenerate, die unbaptized; yea all that were baptized in infancy and after converted remain still unbaptized.</q>] <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. What! if I saw them Baptized with mine eyes? many such tales I know I may hear, and I will believe them as I see cause. 2. I suppose by this that you seem your self to judge, that all that are without a Dogmatical Faith are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi> [8. <q>That it is much to be feared, if not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be concluded that the Major part by far of <hi>Worcester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> combination consists of unbaptized persons, there being I doubt no good evidence of true conversion in the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable part of them — I am sure it is voiced that the most prophane where the Minister carrieth any authority, are as forward for subscription as any.</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. As to your bold censure of so many persons whose faces you never saw, and whose names you never heard, it shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us what you dare do. You might more safely have learnt of Christ [<hi>Judge not that ye be not Judged,</hi>] and have hearkened to <hi>Paul [Who art thou that Judgest another mans servant?</hi>] 2. Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when your censure is founded upon lying fame, as it is.
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:107958:222"/>
This is the way to discredit all history, when Godly men dare publish that of so many in a County, which the whole Country almost, that are capable of understanding such marters, do know to be false. 3. Have we groaned, and prayed, and suffered so long in hope of Discipline, and yet are there Godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters among us, that have the hearts to calumniate and reproach the attempts of it, where they never had the face to acquaint us with the least mistake or miscarriage in our way? Ah what wonder if the poor Church consume away in its corruptions and divisions, when this is the friendship and assistance of its guides! But of this before.</p>
            <p>The other summary of Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> oppositions, is <hi>pag.</hi> 550, 551. in his introduction, where he thus declares his minde.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> [<q>And truly (Sir!) if I should have a thought of changing my opinion, I know not how to look to the end of the danger that will follow. I must first necessarily engage my self in an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Schism, being not able to find out a Church in the world of any interest, in which I shall dare in this account to hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> O the power of prejudice! What Church in all the world was ever of your Judgement? And would you have sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from all the Churches in the world? But lets hear the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of your fear.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi> [<q>I shall see in many members too clear symptoms of non-Regeneration and Vnbelief. —</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Do not those persons profess a Justifying faith? 2. Or is it <hi>Infallible</hi> symptoms of the contrary which you mean, or which are sufficient to nullifie or invalidate that Profession? if not, you say nothing: if so, then 3. Dare you hold communion with no Church that hath some members that in your own Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are unfit to be there? How oft hath this opinion been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed in the Separatists? But you add your reason.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi> [<q>Though this will not bear a separation, yet this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of their non-baptism will necessarily enforce it.—</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Enemy of the Church needs no hands to do a great part of his work, but our own. The Anabaptists take us to be all unbaptized, and thence infer a necessity of Separation. Their Separation troubleth the Church much more than their
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:107958:222"/>
opinion for re-baptizing. Our endeavour is, at least to bring them to this, that being re-baptized they would rest satisfied, and live in peaceable communion with the Church. Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> steps in and confirmeth them in their consequence, on supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Antecedent which we cannot satisfie them in; and so frustrateth all our labour, and gives them the day, in that, and considereth not I fear the danger of promoting such a schism. But he would do well first to answer the many Reasons that Mr. <hi>John Goodwin</hi> hath brought against that opinion, and take his work clean before him. If I knew a Church or whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men that thought verily they were truly baptized, and I thought that it was not so, if yet they profest true Faith and Holiness, I durst not separate from them. 2. But how irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som must it needs be to your Judicious Readers, to have such conclusions tost up and down with meer confidence, upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, which you disdain (or deign not) to prove? One Argument to have proved that our Principles infer the Nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Baptism of the Unregenerate, had been more worth than all this kind of talk. I say that <hi>Deo Judice</hi> such men have no Title by any Grant or Gift of God to claim or receive the Sacraments, though the Minister have Commission to give it to some unjust claimers. This opinion professeth the Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Title which is denyed. Do you prove that it also inferreth the Nullity of the external Baptism it self, which was justly administred, though unjustly demanded. Its tedious to read voluminous Disputes, where that which requireth proof is still taken for granted.</p>
            <p>But if all this were so, I think you must still be a Separatist on your own Principles. For where would you find a Church (among us) where there be not many that have not a Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal faith, which you say must give them Title to Baptism?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi> [<q>And if I be holpen out (as indeed I utterly despair) by any distinction of <hi>forum Dei</hi> and <hi>forum Ecclesiae,</hi> Vnivocal and Equivocal, what thought then shall I entertain of the Holy Scripture?</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I cannot tell what thoughts you will have of it, but I can partly tell what thoughts you should have of it. Will you deny that the Scripture most commonly speaks of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:107958:223"/>
himself in equivocal terms? I hope you will not: And how should it speak otherwise to mans understanding? And yet what thoughts will you entertain of the Scripture? You will not I hope take on you to know no difference between Jesuitical dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling equivocation, which is to deceive, and the use of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal terms, either necessarily for want of other words in being, or Rhetorically for ornament, or when custome of Speech hath made them the most apt? Will you so far equivocate with equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal terms, as to confound the culpable equivocation with the laudable, and then say, [What thoughts shall I have of the holy Scriptures?] this doth not beseem an Expositor of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And whereas you next add the many titles given to the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, I have answered it before, and more may do in the next Dispute, besides what you had even now from Mr. <hi>Rutherford.</hi> These titles were never given to any of your Professors of a faith short of that which Justifyeth. And yet there is no passage in your Book that amazeth me more than your frequent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Assertions of the contrary, and pretenses of the common Judgement of the Church to be on your side.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 116, 117. When I had said that Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> would not have found a second to undertake his cause, you say, [<q>How this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage fell from his pen, may well be to very intelligent Reader mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of admiration — that a man of such multiplicity of reading should think that <hi>Dr. Ward</hi> in this opinion would not have found a second, when if he had perused our approved Authors about the question, especially since it came to a punctual just debate, he may soon see that he hath almost every one to appear for him, if this which he mentions be his opinion: unless perhaps he hath been so held in reading the Fathers and other Writers for the first thirteen or fourteen hundred years (in which few will I think come out and vie with him,) that he hath not regarded what hath been said this 1500 years in this corner of the world.</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Your groundless insipid scorn, about reading the Fathers of the first 1400 years, doth no whit clear the Truth, nor strengthen your Cause, nor (I think) tend to the pleasing of God. 2. One of us have certainly exposed our selves to the Readers, —when we stand wondering thus at each
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:107958:223"/>
other, and profess our understanding to be at so great a distance about a matter of open fact. I must still say, that I hoped Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> would not have found a Second to undertake that Cause. But this doth not intimate either that I never read that any was of his minde before, or that I expected not that any should be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward: Its one thing to be of that Opinion, and another thing <hi>as his Second to undertake it.</hi> But I will now say more than that which you wonder at. I must profess that I do not know of any one Protestant Divine, reputed Orthodox, of that Judgement, before Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> and you: though some Papists and Arminians I knew of that minde: and since I finde Sir <hi>Hen. Vane</hi> maintain it; and one <hi>John Timson,</hi> in his Defence of M. <hi>Humphrey</hi>; and now newly M. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> in his second Vindication of Free Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. Let all Readers now come and wonder at your wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mine, or at least the vast disagreement of our Judgements, in such a point of fact. All that ever open the books of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, come and judge betwixt Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and me. Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> and he do maitain [<hi>That a certain kinde of faith which is short of Justifying faith, giveth title to Baptism even before God</hi>] I say, [<hi>that only true Justifying faith is the condition of our Title before God, as given by him, and warranting our claim; but that the bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of that Justifying faith (but of no lower) doth make us such whom the Minister must give the Sacraments to if we claim them, and so by it we have a Right to them before the Church, and so far before God as he is the approver of the Churches act.</hi>] Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saith, almost every one of our late Writers appear for him: I say, I remember none of the Reformed Divines for them. Nor do I finde that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> himself hath produced any to that end, but by meer abusing them, Certain I am, that the common doctrine of Reformed Divines is, [<hi>that sound believers are members of the mystical Church, and that professors of that belief are members of the visible Church, to whom we must give Sacraments.</hi>] But as for your third sort, who believe with another kinde of faith, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess so to do, it is not their use to take these as members of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or such as have right to Sacraments.</p>
            <p>One more Objection I finde much stood upon (which I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most forgot) viz, <hi>The Sacraments are appointed for the visible Church: therefore all that are of the visible Church have Right to them.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:107958:224"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> the word [appointed] is ambiguous. If it mean on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Ministers are appointed to deliver it to men upon an outward Profession and Claim, this we still grant. But if the meaning be, that Hypocritical or Unregenerate Professors have any Moral Donation or Promise of them, or any command to claim and receive them, in their present state, this is but a bare affirming of the thing in question; and so their Consequent is the same with the Antecedent. What Mr. <hi>Galespie</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> and many other Divines have said against it, you have seen before; as also by what Scripture-Evidence it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But tis said of the Jews, that to them pertained the Adoption, and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the Service of God, and the Promises.] <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Yet will it not follow that all these pertain to all the Visible Church, and therefore not to the Church as Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Glory, that is, the Ark, and other signs of some Glorious Presence, and the giving of the Law here mentioned, with other Priviledges expressed in the next words, were proper to the Jews. 2. The Jewish Nation contained some that were truly sanctified, and some that were not. To the later sort was given the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Covenants, Promises, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> providentially, and by way of Offer: God so ordered it, that among them these excellent mercies should abide, and to them they should be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; and if they had heartily accepted them, they might have had a proper Title to the Benefits of the Covenant it self. And it fell out that the seals were actually applied to them upon their pretended acceptance of the offer, and upon their claim. But to the former belonged the Covenants and Promises as the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods Donation, whereby he conveyed to them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Right to the Benefits: But so it did not to the latter (unless we speak of some particular promise made to this or that indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all person, or some temporal promises to the Jews as Jews, and not as a Visible Church) Yet may it well be said that to the Jews in general the Covenants, Promises, &amp;c. belonged; not only because the Regenerate were Jews, and the whole Nation was denominated from the better part sometime, but also (which
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:107958:224"/>
is <hi>Pauls</hi> sence in that Text) because it is not the foresaid proper Right that is here spoken of, but the actual sending of this Light among them, and the tendering of it to them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing it with them, together with the success of it so far as that some were sanctified by it, and others seemingly consented to it. And thus we may say of <hi>England</hi> now in the general, that it enjoyeth the Gospel, and Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in that they are among us, and all men that are truly willing may have a saving title to them, and the rest that pretend to be willing and are not, do actually partake of the External Ordinance, though to their own condemnation, through their own default. But this is no affirming that the unregenerate have a proper Title given them, which may warrant their claim in that estate; I mean, to the Sacraments, which are special Ordinances.</p>
            <p>The Reverend <hi>Vindicator of Free Admission,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Second Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, <hi>pag.</hi> 6, 7, 8.</note> layeth down 13 Reasons to prove that [<hi>the Covenant in the general Grace and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Administration of the Ordinances belongs to the whole Church as Visible, and to the several members alike</hi>] To which I say, 1. that it [belongs] to them, is too large a word without distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to use in a profitable discourse. I have elsewhere shewed that Covenant and Seals do belong to them in some sence, and in other not; and how far such are in Covenant. 2. Note on the by, that if this were granted, its nothing to Mr. <hi>Blake's</hi> main cause against me, that [a Faith short of justifying gives Right] For no man was ever a member for a Faith short of justifying; but only for a saving faith, or the profession of a saving faith. 3. Note that the stress of the Controversie is not [Whether it belong to them at all?] but whether (as he affirmeth) to all <hi>alike</hi>? Enough is said before for the solving of his Arguments. More particularly.</p>
            <p>To the first. <hi>Pag.</hi> 6. How the whole Nation of the Jews were in Covenant, is before declared, (more than which is yet unproved:) and also how little this makes for his End.</p>
            <p>To the Second: We easily grant that the Gentiles are graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed into the same Olive, and are as much in the Covenant of Grace as the Jews were (so many of the Gentiles as profess
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:107958:225"/>
Christianitie.) And because it is no more, it is nothing to their purpose.</p>
            <p>To the Third: I Answer: There's no doubt but the promise belongs to all that God shall call; that is, the bare offer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all them that are called uneffectually, and still remain in unbelief: And the worst of them are invited to Repent and Believe, which when they do, they have Title in that same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to Remission and the Seals of it: And when they profess to Repent and Believe, and so require the Seals, they have such a Right <hi>Coram Ecclesiâ,</hi> as that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we must admit of them. But more than this here is yet no proof of.</p>
            <p>To the Fourth: <hi>The Called</hi> some of them obey not at all: some of them obey <hi>ore tenus,</hi> and as to some faith short of justifying: and some of them obey the Call sincerely. You mean the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: Of whom I say, 1. Prove if you can that any called ones may have the Sacraments, that profess not saving Faith. 2. And prove that they who barely profess it, have the Title which is in controversie between us, which will justifie their claim, as well as our giving it on that claim. The saying that they are called is no proof. As for your phrase of [an outward being in Covenant] you know I affirmed it long ago <hi>ex parte hominis,</hi> they outwardly covenant with God, and oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But if you mean it <hi>ex parte Dei,</hi> that he hath any such meer outside promises when he meaneth not as he speaks, or that he is actually obliged as a Covenanter to them, yea but for outward things, I have long waited from others for the proof in vain. As to the phrase [Equivocal] you shall have more of it, God willing, in due place.</p>
            <p>To the Fifth: There's difference between the Jews then and the World: 1. In that one part of the Jews were sincere in the Covenant, and that in great numbers; in whom, as it were, the life of the Church did abide. 2. In that the rest of them (as to the main body) professed that true faith which others had. 3. And in that such bare professors were thereupon admitted into that Societie, and into those Ordinances, which tended to help them to that sinceritie which they wanted; some of which Ordinances they were immediately bound to use, and
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:107958:225"/>
others of them but in order after their Conversion: and though they used them unjustly before Conversion, the thing was a mercy in it self, though mis-received by them. 4. And then they had many temporal promises which no other Nation had: nor have we. I think heres a difference from the Gentile world. Prove more, if you affirm it.</p>
            <p>To the Sixth: I have answered it over and over before. They are commanded to be circumcised but as a sign and seal of the Covenant: Therefore they are bound first in order to consent in heart to the Covenant: And if they do the former without the later, it may shew that they have by outward covenanting obliged themselves to God, and so are annumerated with his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted souldiers by the Church: But it proveth not that God is in actual obligation to them, except only as to any of those mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that were absolutely promised to the Israelites, and belong not to us.</p>
            <p>To the Seventh: The weak unworthy Author of the book of <hi>Infant Baptism,</hi> whom you are pleased to load with a Title which his conscience doth disown, doth heartily persist in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that the conditional Covenant is made to more than the Elect, even to all, at least that hear it; and that this is the effect of Christs blood; and that the entrance into covenant, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the terms of it, <hi>ore tenus,</hi> or not sincerely and unreser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, is common to Elect and Reprobate.] But all this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the present business.</p>
            <p>To the Eighth: It is a strange consequence that such [Must renounce their profession, and never come to ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.] Must</hi> importeth Duty. And their duty is sincerely to Repent, and Believe, and Profess, and not to renounce profession, but only to lament the falshood and hypocrisie in professing what they did not do. Nor is any bound to stay from Ordinances sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but to repent, believe, and so come; as <hi>Peter</hi> hid <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> Repent and Pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if he will profess falsly, and come without Repentance, let him do it at his peril, and not think God is obliged to bless him in it; which would lead hard up to the Papists <hi>Opus operatum,</hi> though I know how much this is disclaimed by Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi> For when you liberally give such men a
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:107958:226"/>
a Title <hi>Coram Deo</hi> to the Seals, what can be that Title but the <hi>Opus operatum</hi> of a verbal profession: For though a Faith short of Justifying be talkt of, none of you all can tell who hath it, and who hath it not; and yet I find not so much openness as to speak out and tell us whether indeed all the Hypocrites that have not so much as the Dogmatical Faith which they profess, have indeed a Title before God to the Seals, on the <hi>Opus opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> of profession or not: Though by consequence it appeareth that you must say so, or cast all your cause away.</p>
            <p>To the ninth I Answer: If you know him not a dissembler, he is to you what he professeth to be: If therefore he profess that the Foundation is laid, when it is not, you must endeavour to build him up. But if you know him to dissemble, I suppose you will rather help to lay the Foundation before you go any further. But 2. If you can say as much to prove that I may not teach any but Disciples the observable commands of Christ <hi>(in sensu activo</hi>; that is, do my best to teach them) as I have done to prove that wicked men have no Title to the Sacraments which will warrant them <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> to claim them, you will do much towards the changing of my minde.</p>
            <p>To the Tenth I answer: This confusion marrs all. I have oft told you, unregenerate men are really in covenant as to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal engaging act; and this they may break. But doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that they cannot violate their own promise, unless God be actually obliged by promise to them.</p>
            <p>To the Eleventh. I will not stand now to search whether <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was one of them that was bid Eat, and Drink: But supposing it granted, it is most certain that he was commanded as much to take and feed on Christ by faith: and that he was offered the Sacrament as a Sacrament, that is, a sealing and professing sign, as I have before explained. Now if he had so received it as it was offered, and in the nature of a Sacrament, as Christ bid him; Take, Eat, Drink, then certainly he had done it in faith. And if he did not so (as he did not) he did not what he was commanded. And therefore you cannot hence prove a Right in <hi>Judas</hi> by any grant, to the separated sign, while he was destitute of the faith which by his action was professed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:107958:226"/>
the Sacrament as a Sacrament is an actual profession o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> faith: And you can never prove that Christ commanded <hi>Juda</hi> to lye, by professing the faith which he had not; but only that he commanded him at once to Believe and thus profess it. He that will have men compelled to come in (to the Church) intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they must bring a wedding garment: or else they shall hear, how camest thou hither?</p>
            <p>You apprehend <hi>John Timpsons</hi> words to be apposite, which imply a contradiction, or touch not the point: If the right Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject be really believed (even that which is the full Object of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith) that very belief is saving, and proveth the holiness of the person.</p>
            <p>To the Twelfth I answer. General and special Grace, I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly maintain. But when will you prove that it is a part of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Grace to have a proper Title given by God to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which seal up the pardon of sin actually where there is such Title? To have the universal conditional promise (or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>ex parte Dei</hi>) enacted, and promulgate and offered the world, with many incitements to entertain it, is General Grace: But so is not either our actual heart-covenanting, the Remission of our sin, nor such a proper Title to the sign of both.</p>
            <p>When you tell us of the <hi>Worlds Potential,</hi> and the <hi>visible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches actual Interest in General Grace,</hi> you give us (pardon the truth) a meer sound of words that signifie nothing, or nothing to purpose. You cannot call it <hi>General Grace Objectively</hi>; as if the Saints had a particular Objective Grace, the rest a General: For Generals exist not but in the individuals. It is therefore the General conditional promise or gift, which you must mean by General Grace: This is to the world (without) indeed but an offer: But is it any more to any of the unbelievers or unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate within? what can be the meaning of [an actual Interest in a conditional promise] which all the hearers have not, and yet is short of the true actual Interest of them that perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? I feel no substance in this notion, nor see any light in it. I confess there is a certain possession that one such man may have more then others; but as that is nothing to proper Title, so it is not the thing that Sacraments are to seal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:107958:227"/>I have not Mr. <hi>Hudsons</hi> book now by me: but your solution by the two sives had need of some sifting. Its one thing to ask what is the end of Sacraments <hi>quoad intentionem praecepti:</hi> and another thing to tell what eventually they produce. I do not believe that the sive that brings men into a state of Grace is in the hands of God only, so as if he used not Ministers thereto. Ministers are said in Scripture to convert and heal, and deliver and save men.</p>
            <p>To your 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and last, I answer. That we easily confess that the covenant under the new Testament is better than the old: but this makes nothing for you, nor do you prove that it doth: the force of the first section of your book, as it may be the matter of an Objection, I have answered before. As to your Authorities I say, 1. Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> saith nothing which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth any approbation of your opinion: whether Mr. <hi>Burgess</hi> do, I leave to himself, for I know not certainly. All that I know of, since Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> is Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> and <hi>John Timpson</hi>; and <hi>John Timpson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi> Your 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Sections need no more answer I think than what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given. You needed not these pillars to support that point which is the design of your Treatise.</p>
            <p>To these I find you add another, the greatest of all, <hi>pag.</hi> 611. which you say sinks deep into you: but if reason will do it, I will pluck it up by the roots; partly by desiring you to peruse what I have twice or thrice before answered to it, and partly by adding as followeth; That 1. If a man by mistaken doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings shall keep himself away from a Sacrament, that doth not destroy his Title to it or the Grace signified, nor is it any ones fault but his own. I therefore deny your <hi>Minor</hi>: It is not this doctrine that cuts off doubting Christians from the Sacrament, but themselves that do culpably withdraw. To your Prosyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism; I deny the <hi>Major:</hi> that doctrine which concludes it sin in the doubtful Christian to Receive, doth not cut him off: For it concludeth it not his sin to Receive in it self, but to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive doubtingly: so that it is not Receiving, but Doubting, that is properly his sin: and withall we say, that it is his Duty to Receive, and his greater Sin not to
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:107958:227"/>
Receive than to Receive. And though an erring Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth alwaies ensnare, and so create a necessity of sinning which way soever we go, till it be rectified, yet its a greater sin to trespass against a plain precept, than against an erring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in many cases. But the main stress lyeth on your proof, which is from <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. [<hi>Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</hi>] But I could wish you would consider it better, before you press home that Text to the same sence against all other duties as you do against this, lest you leave God but little service from the Church. 1. It is one thing to doubt about <hi>indifferent</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, such as <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, as eating, &amp;c. For there he is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned if he eat</hi>; because he is sure it is lawful to forbear; but not sure that it is lawful to eat. But press not this upon us in case of necessary duty. If God command me to pray, praise or communicate, my doubt will not justifie my forbearance; and though it entangle me in sin, it cannot disoblige me from duty; but I shall sin more if I forbear.</p>
            <p>You say [<hi>If it be sin for the unregenerate to Receive, then cannot the doubting Christian be perswaded, and consequently sinneth.] Ans.</hi> True: but thats not long of the doctrine, but of his error: and it is the case of all practical errors; which will not therefore justifie you in blaming the doctrine: its the unavoidable effect of an erring Conscience. And again I say, he sinneth more in forbearing.</p>
            <p>Whereas you conclude this Argument <hi>to be convincing,</hi> I have told you before why it convinceth not me: but to your selves I would ask, whether it do not also convince you that your own doctrine is as <hi>unsufferable</hi>? For I am past doubt that not only most Christians, but even most doubting Christians have more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they have true justifying faith, than the rest of the world have, that they have true Dogmatical faith. Though the wicked doubt less, because they believe and regard it less, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they have not only far more cause to doubt of the truth of their Dogmatical faith, but have less true knowledge of it. At least many of them its thus with, when so many true Christians do as much doubt of their Dogmatical faith, as of any. Now what will you do with all these? If you take their
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:107958:228"/>
faith it self (though common) to be their Title, then they must according to you, all keep a way, while they doubt of it: And if it be but the verbal profession of that Dogmatical faith that is their Title, before God, and their own Conscience, then any infidel may make himself a Title at pleasure by a lye, and the bare <hi>opus operatum</hi> of speaking the words which he never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but derideth the sence while he uttereth the terms. As you will save your own Communicants from condemning themselves then for want of Assurance of their Lower faith, so shall you direct us to do by ours.</p>
            <p>I will only add this Question, What Description must that man give of the faith short of Justifying, which entitles to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, who takes Justifying faith it self to lie but in Assent? You know my meaning: It will be certainly another kinde of faith, than Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> describeth that such a man must require.</p>
            <p>I had thought I had done with you at this time: and this day I received a Book of Mr. <hi>Prins</hi> writing, containing the fruit of your Doctrine; and therein I finde a passage of yours cited from <hi>pag.</hi> 125. which makes me think it may deserve further consideration than I thought to have taken of it.</p>
            <p>You say [<q>Giving and Receiving being <hi>Relata,</hi> all those Texts that prove it the duty of any to Receive the Sacrament, doth <hi>eo nomine</hi> oblige the Minister to deliver it to them, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them; because <hi>posito uno Relatorum, ponitur alterum.</hi>
               </q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Must Logick do the deed at last? If so, it will give us leave to distinguish between <hi>Relata secundùm dici &amp; secundùm esse; simplices &amp; duplices relationes, &amp;c. Ponitur autem hoc unum Relatorum vel in esse, vel in debito</hi>: If you speak of the former, then you know 1. that our <hi>Giving</hi> is not effectual <hi>Giving,</hi> but <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> when it goes before Receiving: and 2. that as <hi>scibile</hi> may be <hi>sine scientiâ,</hi> as existent; so Offering may be without Receiving, though not Receiving in our present sense without Offering: therefore one of these may be put without the other. But I suppose it is <hi>Debitum offerendi, &amp; recipiendi,</hi> which you think are thus related. But 1. here the <hi>debitum offerendi</hi> goes first, and the <hi>debitum recipiendi</hi> comes after, and is but conditional and not actual, till the very act of oblation. You may be bound to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:107958:228"/>
your people the Sacrament, and not perform your duty: they are not bound to Receive it, when you are bound to Offer it; but only on condition or supposition that you actually do Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it: so that it is not <hi>your duty</hi> and <hi>theirs</hi> that are connexed as <hi>Relata</hi>: else they should be bound to Receive that which is not offered them; for you may neglect your duty. Nor is it your actual Offering and their actual Receiving that are inseparably connexed as perfect Relates; for you may offer it, when it shall be refused.</p>
            <p>But you'l say, [<q>At least the thing intended stands good; that <hi>posito recipiendi debito ponitur etiam debitum offerendi.</hi>
               </q>] I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: Not alwaies so neither, unless you take the Duty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to be actual and absolute, and not conditional: For you may be bound to Receive on supposition that I offer: both this and many other things which I am not bound to offer: Much less am I <hi>eo nomine</hi> (as you strongly say) obliged to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to you. You may be obliged to give me Thanks, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing I bestow a <hi>Benefit</hi> on you: and your thanks hath relation to my Benefit: and yet I do not yet understand that I am <hi>eo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> obliged to give you that Benefit, because you must be thankful if I do. Your Obligation to receive, is plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequential and hypothetical, supposing I actually offer it: and that cannot so necessarily infer the duty of Offering. For I make little doubt to prove, that in many Cases when the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster sinneth in his Offer, it is yet the Peoples duty to receive it if he do offer it. The Scribes and Pharisees might unjustly usurp the Chair of <hi>Moses,</hi> and yet it may be the peoples duty to hear them. The Priests may usurp their place, and yet the cleansed Leper may be bound to shew himself to them. <hi>Nero</hi> may sin by asking Tribute, when it may be my duty to give it him if he ask it. If Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> had thought that your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would justifie a Thief in taking his purse by the high way, I do not think he would have cited it. <hi>Giving</hi> and <hi>Taking</hi> here are Relatives too: If a Thief demand your purse, resolving to kill you if you deny it, it may be your duty to Give it, to save your life; when in my opinion it is not <hi>eo nomine</hi> his duty to Demand or Take it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:107958:229"/>Well! but this is not the chief part of my answer to you. If you had laid better grounds for it, and well limited it, I might well grant you, that when the People are bound to Receive, it implyeth the Ministers duty to offer it them. But then you must take duty as you finde it entirely, at least essentially, and you must not cut off a piece of a duty; yea, leave out the essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and turn it into a sin. God commandeth people first to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and Believe, and then to profess it by words and sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal actions, and therewith receive the seals of his special grace. This is your Duty: Perform your duty so far as is antecedent to mine, and I shall confess that mine will follow, and I must offer you the Sacraments. But if you will refuse to repent or Believe, or to profess that you do so, in a credible sort, or will by word or life profess that you do not so, and yet will demand the Sacrament, you do not your duty, and so I am not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Prove that it is a mans duty to receive the Sacraments without Faith and Repentance (yea or a credible Profession of them,) or to profess by that Reception that he Takes Christ and Believeth in him, when it is a lie, and then you say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what. All men are bound <hi>mediately</hi> to receive the Sacrament; that is, first to seek after the Word, and then to hear it, and then to believe and repent, and then to seek the Sacraments: but it followeth not that they may do the last first, and receive before they repent.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as the Receiver is bound <hi>ad ordinem &amp; modum,</hi> and not simply and any how to receive: so I am bound <hi>ad ordinom &amp; modum,</hi> and not any how to give. And therefore I must first know my call to it as a Pastor, and I must do my best to help the people to a due preparation, and I must do it Decently, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to Edification: and the miss of one of these may turn the duty into a sin. I am not therefore of your opinion, as you next express it, that [<hi>there is as many Scripture precepts and presidents to deliver the Sacrament to all, as to any, supposing them within the Church, and neither unintelligent or excommunicate.</hi>] If this were true, then 1. If any of the Parish will say, Sir! I am none of your Flock; I renounce your Pastoral over sight; but yet I will have the Sacrament from you; it seems I must be
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:107958:229"/>
forced to do the office of that Relation where it is disclaimed: And if all the Anabaptists or Separatists of some neighbour-Church demand it of me, I must give them all the Sacrament: or if all the Parishes about stock in to me, or a thousand strangers, I must give it them all; or if the Parishioners will refuse to speak to me, and to be personally instructed, and one will have it leaping, and singing, and laughing; and others will have me bring it them from house to house, I must give it to them all; and why not, if they swear and curse when they demand it, or profess to take it meerly to ensnare me? For none of these are supposed <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligent</hi> or <hi>excommunicate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I find you take up this Reason before in another sort, <hi>sect.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 5. Having given a touch about <hi>Arminius</hi> so doubly defective of ingenuity, as shews you to be but a man, (of which more in due place) you add [<q>This doctrine enforceth them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between what gives Right, as to a mans own part, to Church-membership and Ordinances, and that which gives Right to be admitted: whereas the truth is, these are <hi>Relata, quorum posito &amp; sublato uno ponitur &amp; tollitur alterum.</hi> Besides, there is this great inconvenience it runs down right into, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster shall be bound to administer the Ordinances (particularly the Sacrament) unto people, when they are bound upon pain of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to take them.</q>]</p>
            <p>To all this I answer: 1. I do not think you ever read such a distinction as you here frame: at least not from him, whom (you know) I have reason to think you intend. Doubtless, he that hath <hi>Right to be admitted,</hi> hath also <hi>in eodem foro</hi> a Right on his own part to Ordinances. This is not fairly done: Indeed a Right of Admission may be in the Minister, (who is another subject) when yet the party hath no Right (of the same sort) to be admitted, or to seek or Receive.</p>
            <p>But we must once more consider your Canon <hi>de relatis.</hi> And to what is said before, let me deal plainlier with you, and tell you that the things in question are not <hi>Relata</hi>: For though actual Giving and Receiving have some kind of Relation, yet several <hi>Rights, viz.</hi> the <hi>Jus dandi, &amp; Jus accipiendi,</hi> are not Relates. Shew us if you can, how <hi>Jus ad Jus refertur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="410" facs="tcp:107958:230"/>Moreover, the Distinction which is used by those whom you here oppose, is (not as you feign it, but) between [a Right <hi>Coram Deo</hi> to claim and receive the Sacraments] and [a Right or Duty of the Minister to give it upon claim or demand.] Now the former Right is actual and positive; the later but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positive: Demanding or seeking is supposed to go before my giving, and my right and duty to give: And I think (according to my small skill in Logick) Demanding and Giving are no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable Relates; and I am content that any beggar at your door be Judge: This or nothing you must prove to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And if you prove it, I may the next time I see you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all your Estate and Learning; and what will you do then? And (with submission to the Judgement of better Lawyers, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the Learned Citer of your words) I conceive that [a Right of delivering on supposition of a demand or claim] doth not so necessarily suppose a Right to demand and claim, as one Relate supposeth its Correlate. If a man demand your coat (upon terms of violence) you may give him your cloak also; and yet no more justifie his demand, than you justifie his smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you by turning the other cheek. But if I should be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in these Law-matters, I must remember Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> that when ever he delivereth to souldiers the key of his house to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the breaking open the doors, or delivereth them his Arms or moneys to save his life, or a contribution to save the rest, he justifieth their Right to claim all this. And by the same rule when ever he went to prison at their command, he justified their right of commanding him: For <hi>Commanding</hi> and <hi>Obeying</hi> are as much Relates, as <hi>Demanding</hi> and <hi>Delivering</hi> are.</p>
            <p>By this time you may see what is become of the [<hi>Grievous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience</hi>] which you dreamed we were <hi>running downright into.</hi> I hope you would not perswade the World that ever we taught, that it is our duty to give <hi>Effectively,</hi> which ever causeth a reception, nor yet to deliver the Sacraments, but on supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their claim or seeking, to any such men; nor yet to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to claim or seek them <hi>in statu quo,</hi> in their present unbelief and impenitency, with a false profession of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:107958:230"/>
And then do you indeed count it so grievous an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that we should be bound [to give it to an unjust claimer on supposition he demand it, on a lying profession of Faith and Repentance, which yet is credible to me] and yet that he deserveth damnation for his lying profession and unjust claim and receiving. If the <hi>Iliaca passio</hi> were common in <hi>London,</hi> and this <hi>miserere</hi> provoked some rich Physitian to so much compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to deliver to his servant a gold bullet to swallow for the Cure (which is reputed so good a medicine) and many come for them that are really sick, and swallow the bullet, and it saves their lives; but many others counterfeit the disease through co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness of the gold, and the servant believing them, dilivereth them the bullets; do you think here the servant did more than his duty, when he is not able to judge who dissembleth, and the Physitian thus leaveth it to him? Or do you think that the covetous dissemblers had <hi>coram donatore</hi> a just claim, supposing him to be able to discern their deceit? Or is here such a <hi>Grievous inconvenience</hi> as you imagined? I think not.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>inextricable difficulties</hi> which you think this leads into, another may see the way out of them, when you do not; and he may as confidently conceive that the difficulties and inconveniences of your way are far more.</p>
            <p>As for that part of your Book which owneth Church-Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and the power of the Keys, I give you thanks for it, and assure you if we could but see it practised, even less rigorously than the ancient Churches have practised it, when there was no coersive power of violence to enforce it, but rather the sword of persecutors to discountenance it, we should not trouble you with Contests for any other suspension, For my part I blame many of the suspenders as heartily as you do; but it is not for doing too much, but for doing too little, and in disorder. And I hope you that are for Excommunicating where others do but suspend, (though Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> can tell you that even that is [in truth an actual Excommunication, without any precedent cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, articles, legal proceeding, hearing, sentence, <hi>&amp;c.] Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.)</hi> will do more than they, and not less, according to this principle. And if you will needs believe that you are not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:107958:231"/>
to do it (a ready way in this age to put off some trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome work) I hope you will seek to them that you think have Authority: If it be in a meeting of Ministers, make use of them: If in a Bishop, use him if you have one, if not, procure one. For me thinks men that own the necessity of Discipline, should do their best to procure the exercise of it.</p>
            <p>And as for that Book of Mr. <hi>Prins,</hi> which occasioned me to say the more to you on these passages, though I highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Author's name, and disown the way of his Vicar <hi>A.</hi> against whose way he principally intendeth it; yet I must say that his writing shews me, as well as his Icon, that <q>All flesh is grass: the best men vanity —</q> And what the Church and World must suffer, if the best men had the ruling of it. That all ministers who will not give the Sacraments to all their Parishioners (legally qualified and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the same) <hi>p.</hi> 4. should be used as he directeth, <hi>viz.</hi> their Tithes withheld by the people, themselves imprisoned, and eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I cannot wish; especially if I consider what the legal qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification is, and if I believe him (here) that no Ordinance can be made without the consent of King, Lords, and Commons, and that the Ordinances wanting these are meer Nullities in Law. These evils which I foresee, go not down so easily with me as with that pious Author: 1. That hereby the greatest part of the ablest godly Ministers in <hi>England</hi> (as far as I am able to learn) must be turned out and imprisoned: 2. And then the Churches either left destitute, or possessed by ignorant, drunken, scondalous men; there being not worthy men of his judgement to supply them. 3. And how many thousand souls may perish ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly? 4. And Gods worship be abused, and his name dishonoured through the Land. 5. And the great hopes of godly people frustrate concerning the prosperity of the Church as to posterity; and their joy turned into sorrow. 6. And the enemies have their ends. 7. And would be able to tell us that where the Bishops cast out one able Minister, they have cast out many. 8. That even the men whom Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> most intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:107958:231"/>
should have so much to say for their former resistance and usage of such men as he; as to say [You see now what men these are, and what desolating cruel works they would make, if it had fallen to their Lot to govern.] 9. That even the multitude of sober Godly men, should have such a temptation, to rejoyce at that which once they lamented, even that such as Mr. P. are kept from power, and that they have escaped so great a calamity as he here designeth them. 10. That indeed such a spirit of violence should be found in so good a man, that hath tasted of so much persecution himself, as to endeavour to imprison and eject all the Ministers in <hi>England,</hi> that think the Law of God is stricter then the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> (stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as heretofore) in point of Qualification of Receivers whom we must admit. 11. That the Quakers, who are now crying down Tithes, should be so much furthered in their design, as to have the people taught to detain them by Law; and they that are crying down the Ministry, should be so far directed to eject them. 12. And that the multitude of obstinate, rebellious people, that will scorn to come to a Minister, or hear him speak to them personally, or will live in many notorious Vices (which the Law enabled us not to use Discipline against) or the ignorant that know not who Christ is, God or man, nor will be accountable to us of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the Essentials of Religion, but watch all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to defame their Ministers, and hinder their doctrine, and detain their maintenance, and get them out; I say, that these should have now directions put into their hands, for non-payment of Tithes, and for imprisoning and ejecting them: All these things I confess are grievous to me; though I believe that the principal intention of the Author was, to direct some better men, that might be wronged by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much rigor of some Minister, that was guilty of unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table separation: But good meanings will not warrant such attempts. Were I of Mr. <hi>Prin's</hi> Judgement against suspension from Sacraments, I think yet I should rather choose to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in another sort my self, than be guilty of Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Ejecting all the Ministers in <hi>England,</hi> that gave not
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:107958:232"/>
the Sacraments to all their Parishioners, according to the Laws which never were repealed by the threefold consent of Kings, Lords, and Commons.</p>
            <p>And herein I see what one bad opinion or principle in practicals will do, even in the best and most experienced men; and what actions must be expected from the best man, if his Judgement be mistaken: And I see also whether the Doctrine of Common Admission leadeth.</p>

               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:107958:235"/>necessary to say somewhat to the point: which I shall do with as much brevity as I can, without injury to the Cause.</p>
            <p>Because here are several Titles commonly given to unsound Professors, which the Question doth take in, and we cannot speak to them all at once, I shall begin at the first, and then the rest may easily be dispatcht: yea, the most that needs to be said concerning them, will fall in, in order to the handling of the first.</p>
            <p>But what shall we do for a Judge or Rule for the determining of our Controversie? Custom is the Master of Language: and if any one will pretend to so much reason as to tell the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of words from the bare Etymologie, contrary to Customs interpretation, the world will but laugh at him: For how well soever he plaies his part, he will but tell us how such words <hi>should</hi> be used, and not how they are used; and therefore he will help us to the right understanding of no mans words or writings thereby. Its Custom therefore, and not Etymologie, that we must be judged by: But Custom is here double-tongued. The world is not agreed of the sense of <hi>Analoga,</hi> nor well of aequivocals and univocals. I must crave of the Reader that he will suppose here what I have already written about these terms to Dr. <hi>Kendall</hi>; that I need not to repeat what is there. The Controversie, though but nominal, is old between the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and the Protestants; and the Protestants have commonly maintained all along since the Reformation, that Hypocrites or meer Professors are but Aequivocally called Members of the Church: The Papists have resisted them in this: and yet been forced in the opposition to cut the throat of their own Cause. Though it be the Defence of the old Protestant Cause here that is finally my Business, yet it is the late opposition made against it by two Protestant Divines that is the occasion of my underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; to wit, Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> and (since him) Mr. <hi>Humphrey.</hi> And yet with them I need not have much ado: For, if we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, we know not well the state of our difference; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have happily made our selves uncapable of following it far by Controversie, as being in the dark. In my writing to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> I use to say that such men are [Church-members, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Equivocally or Analogically,] as being
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:107958:235"/>
willing to avoid all needless Controversie about words; but sometime (supposing that Assertion) I use the common language of the Protestants, and mention <hi>equivocally</hi> only. I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth affirm that such men and true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are univocally called Church-members, Covenanters, Christians, &amp;c. nor yet that he denieth it: so that I know not what he is for; but what he is against I partly know: For the term [E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal] here, he tells us that he <hi>abhors:</hi> But he would take it as tolerable, if I had used the term [Analogical.] And if that might reconcile us, it is but his more heedfull reading of my words, and he will finde that I do ordinarily use it. As pag. 62. lin. 4, 5. [<q>It is an imperfect Consent, Analogically or Equivocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Covenanting, &amp;c.] <hi>And after at the bottom of the page,</hi> [and therefore such are said, as to the Faith, Consent and Covenant so required, but Equivocally or Analogically to Consent Covenant or Believe, &amp;c.] <hi>And pag.</hi> 64. <hi>lin.</hi> 6, 7. [these men in proper strict sense are no true Christians, but Analogically only.] <hi>And pag.</hi> 65.

Well! but yet the term [Equivocal] he abhors: If so; then he must either judge that they are Univocally called Church-members, Saints, &amp;c. or else that there is a third, between Univocal and Equivocal. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer he speaks not out: the later (I suppose) he knoweth is denied by many Philosophers with so much reason, as that it deserveth his pains for a better proof. Its like he hath read it <hi>inter leges Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocorum,</hi> in the Logicks commonly read in the Schools, that <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Analogum est Aequivocum,</hi> (as <hi>Fascic. Log.</hi> pag. 21. <hi>&amp; alii.)</hi> Its agreed on, that <hi>Vnivoca vel Synonyma</hi> are sometimes taken so strictly for <hi>Paronyma,</hi> and sometime so largely as to comprehend the <hi>paronyma, si careant homonymia:</hi> and thus it is that we have to do with the term. <hi>Burgersdicius</hi> divideth <hi>Genus in synonymum sive univocum, &amp; homonymum sive aequivocum, and</hi> makes all that is spoken <hi>inequaliter de speciebus suis</hi> to be <hi>Genus aequivocum.</hi> But then he meaneth not by <hi>inaequaliter</hi> that meer inequality in the Degree of Excellency in the several <hi>species,</hi> (on which some Scotists affirm, that <hi>Animal</hi> is <hi>Genus Analogum quoad hominem &amp; brutum,</hi> because man is <hi>prastantius animal</hi>:) but <hi>cùm

            <p>I know other Schoolmen are of another minde; and indeed they are of so many minds about the very sense of the word <hi>Analogum,</hi> and the true nature of <hi>Analogy,</hi> that it may well make us despair of a fair end of this Controversie. They are not so much agreed wherein it is that <hi>Analogy</hi> doth consist: some say that it consisteth <hi>in dependentia</hi>: and some (as <hi>Petr. Hurtado de Mendoza, Disput. Logic.</hi> 9. <hi>sect.</hi> 4. <hi>subject.</hi> 5.) <hi>in transcendentia, &amp;c.</hi> Read but <hi>Hurtado</hi> himself of this, <hi>Disput.</hi> 9. from <hi>pag.</hi> 111. to 124. and see whether there be not opinions enough about <hi>Analogy,</hi> to warrant us to despair of a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of this Controversie, from the Consent of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Should I but tell you out of <hi>Tartaretus in</hi> 1. <hi>sent. dist.</hi> 3. <hi>qu.</hi> 3. and <hi>Rada,</hi> and others, of the threefold Univocation, Logical, Physical and Metaphysical, and the Description of each, and out of <hi>Francis. de Marchia</hi> of the four several degrees of Univocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and many more distinctions which must be taken in, if we would exactly discuss this point, you will think before we have done that the Matter is not worth our pains. In a word, seeing our Controversie (as is said) is <hi>de nomine</hi>; and the Custom of Artists is the only Judge that can determine such Controversies, and they are here all in pieces among themselves, as much as about almost any one word in use with them, as far as I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, it followeth that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and I must stay for a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion till our Judges are agreed, what <hi>Analogy</hi> is.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I make so small account of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, that where the term [Equivocal] offendeth any, as it doth Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> I am very willing to let it alone, and to use the term [Analogical] which they can more patiently hear: I am loth we should quarrel about so small a matter. But because I am on the Defense, I shall yet briefly tell you, what Reasons I had to use the term [Equivocal] as well as [Analogical.]</p>

               </gap>sp. 9. §. 1. But as he further noteth, They that hold that we do <hi>uno actu plura ut dissimilia cognoscere,</hi> must say also that, <hi>praeter nomen conceptus formalis est idem aequivocis, &amp; differt ab univocis, quòd univoca habent eundem conceptum objectivum similem; secus verò aequivoca, quae habent plures dissimiles; item differunt in conceptu formali, quia aequivocus aequivalet pluribus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>These things about the nature of Equivocals being supposed, I must next consider of the several terms now in question, and examine them hereby, as applyed to the Godly and the Wicked.</p>
            <p>And first the Word [Church] in its general sense is not the thing that we have now in question: Otherwise I should soon confess that in all Assemblies there is something common: a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> of materials is common to them all. And thus it may as well be said that the word <hi>Ecclesia</hi> is univocally spoken of a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous confused tumult, <hi>Act,</hi> 19.32, 39, 40. or any other common Assembly; as of an Assembly of meer Professors. But it is a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church</hi> than we are speaking of; which being <hi>Coetus Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, vel Christianorum,</hi> is differenced from other societies by the Matter, and by the End. And for the first: If bare Professors are but equivocally called Christians or believers in Christ, then they are but equivocally Church-members, nor a Church as consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such, but equivocally a Church. But the antecedent is true, therefore so is the Consequent. The Consequence is undeniable, because it is not a Congregation or Society in general, but the Christian Church thus specified by its Matter and End, which we speak of, as is said. The Antecedent I prove, reducing the <hi>Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyma</hi> into the Abstracts; and first of the term Believers: If Faith
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:107958:238"/>
be but equivocally attributed to the bare Professors and the true Believers, then they are equivocally called Believers. But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent is true, as I prove thus: If the name of faith be the same, and the <hi>ratio substantiae secundum illud nomen,</hi> be divers, then faith ascribed to bare Professors and to true Believers is an <hi>aequivocum.</hi> But the Antecedent is true, as is most apparent: For that its the same name [Faith, Belief, Believers] we are agreed: And that it is not the thing in both that is thus named, I think we are also agreed. For in one sort, it is a true saving Faith, that is called by the name of [Faith]: and in the other, it is no faith at all, but the bare verbal Profession of that faith which they have not. And I hope we are agreed, that faith, and the Profession of Faith, are not the same thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But though this hold as to bare Professors, or meer Hypocrites that have no faith, yet it will not hold of these that have a faith short of Justifying.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It cannot be denied that bare Professors of saving Faith are visible members of the Church, though they have no faith at all; therefore it must be granted of all them, that they are but equivocally Believers, and of them is our question.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I have before proved, that it is this profession of a saving faith, that constituteth a visible member; and therefore all such and only such (with their seed) are visible members; and that it is not the reality of any faith (special or common,) that consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuteth a visible member. For that which makes visible, must it self be visible: But so is neither a special nor a common faith: for no man knoweth it in another. So that <hi>à quatenus ad omne, à forma ad nomen,</hi> it is plain that all Professors and none but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors are visible Members, and that if any have the Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed (special or common) that makes them not visible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but the profession of Faith whether they have it or not. So that it plainly followeth, that a visible Member, <hi>qua talis,</hi> is denominated a Believer only equivocally.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And if they be denominated Believers <hi>ab ipsa fide, scil.</hi> that which is short of Justifying, yet its plain that this <hi>faith</hi> it self is not the same with that of sound Believers; no not of the same <hi>species,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> himself being Judge, who so keenly girds me for making saving and common faith to differ but in degree,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:107958:238"/>
when in the very writings that he must fetch the slander from, I again and again profess that they differ morally in <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecie.</hi>) If then his lower faith and saving faith do so much differ, then there is not the same <hi>ratio substantiae secundum illud nomen</hi>: For I have not yet found that it is a Generical Nature common to both, which he supposeth signified by the word [faith] in our Question; much less that Church-membership is constituted by such a thing; But if he should come to that, I must first desire him to describe that Generical nature, and no more to lay it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the specifical nature either of Dogmatical or Justifying faith; and when he hath so done, I doubt not to bring many more <hi>species</hi> that shall on as fair pretences put in for a place as partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant in that generical nature, as his Dogmatical faith hath done.</p>
            <p>So that by this it is evident, that not only the thing which constituteth men visible Church-members, (which is alwaies in the Adult, a Profession and not the Faith professed) is but equivocally called Faith; but also that the lower faith is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally called the Christian Faith. But the first alone sufficeth us to prove that visible Members as visible, are but equivocally called Church-members, because the <hi>ratio substantiae</hi> is divers, <hi>secundum illud nomen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And it is as plain that bare Professors are but equivocally called <hi>Christians.</hi> For the <hi>Ratio nominis</hi> in found Christians is true Faith in Christ as Christ: but in the other it is only the Profession of such a faith: and these are certainly divers. And If you again carry the Question to Dogmatical Believers, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer as before; both 1. That they are not the persons in our Question; 2. That as such, they are not members visible (no nor mystical.) 3. That even as to them the <hi>Ratio substantiae</hi> is so divers, as makes the name apparently equivocal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The same also may be said of the word [Saints] <hi>Holiness</hi> in the Regenerate is the hearty Devotedness and Separation of the Person to God as God. Holiness in bare professors (who are visible Members,) is but the verbal Devotion and extrinsick Separation; And Holiness in the common Believer, is but a half Devotedness and Separation, and wanteth the Essentials which the Regenerate have So that it is not the same thing that is called Holiness in these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="450" facs="tcp:107958:239"/>4. The same also I say of Regeneration: The true Believeer is called Regenerate, because he is so changed by the spirit, as to be as it were born again, not of flesh, nor of the wiil of man, but of God, and is become a new creature: but the bare Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor is called Regenerate, only because he is baptized, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth Regeneration, and is entered extrinsecally into a new so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. And the lower sort of Believers is said to be regenerate, but only because he hath some common work of another <hi>species</hi>: so that Regeneration is equivocally spoken of these.</p>
            <p n="5">5. So also is Justification: Its clear that it is not the same thing that is called Justification in the one sort and in the other, as I suppose will be confessed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The same also I may say of Adoption as is undeniable.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And the same I may say of being in Covenant with God. For 1. <hi>ex parte Dei,</hi> with the Regenerate God is actually in Covenant, that is, as it were obliged to them: but to the rest it is but conditionally, which will induce no actual Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or <hi>Debitum,</hi> till the Condition be performed. 2. And on their own part, the regenerate are said to Covenant with God, principally because they consent to his terms, and heartily Accept his Covenant, as it is; which Scripture calleth sometime their <hi>Believing,</hi> (If thou <hi>believe</hi> in thy heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and sometime their <hi>Willing</hi>: (whosoever <hi>will,</hi> let him drink of the waters of Life freely): so that the Regenerate mans Covenating is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with the <hi>Heart,)</hi> and comprehendeth all the Essentials); and sometime with the <hi>Mouth</hi> also: But the bare Professors Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting is but with the <hi>mouth</hi> alone; and the lower Believers is wanting in the internal Essentials: so that it is plain, that it is not the same thing that is called [Covenanting] in them: and therefore the word is equivocal.</p>
            <p>And then by this it is put out of doubt that they are equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally called Church members: Because the things forementioned that constitute their Church-membership are not the same.</p>
            <p>If any Papist should here set in, and with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> plead, that it is Profession and Engagement to Church Politie that constituteth all Members, and that the Church in its first notion signifieth only the visible Body, and that Faith and Holiness, or any thing intrinsick is not necessary to make a Member, but

               </gap>vines, <hi>Amesius, Whitaker,</hi> and abundance more, have said already to shew the vanity of this, yea and its self-contradiction. 2. Were it not done by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny already, I would shew such from many Scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that the word [<hi>Church</hi>] in our Christian sense doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally signifie the number that are cordially congregate unto Christ, and united to him. 3. But whomsoever the word is first applyed to, it is certain if it be applyed to both, that it is equivocal: unless you will say, that it signifieth some Generical nature in common to both: which cannot be as is aforesaid; and if it were granted, 1. It would exclude the spiritual aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to Christ to be the <hi>Ratio nominis,</hi> contrary to Scripture; and 2. It would exclude all Saints that have not the opportunity of a visible profession and conjunction with the Visible Body, from being of the Church, and so from Salvation; Or 3. It would make two Churches specifically distinct, which both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Protestants do so vehemently disavow.</p>
            <p>Having thus given my Reasons from the common description of Equivocals, and the nature of the things, why I say that meer Professors, and consequently visible Members as such, are but equivocally called Believers, Christians, Saints, Members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I shall next come to Authority, and enquire what is the Custom of Divines in this case, seeing that Custom is so much the master of Speech: and it is only Protestant Divines that I shall alledge, because it is for the sake of Protestants that I write, to disswade them from siding with the Papists in this point: For between them and us it is so antient and well known a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, that with men that are exercised in such Writings, my allegations will be needless: but for the sake of some confident men, that have derided the common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ssertions of Protestant; against Papists, as if they were singularly mine I shall annex some of the words of our most esteemed Writers by which these men may discern the minds of the rest; wishing that such men would rather have been at the pains to have read the Authors themselves, than to suffer their passions and tongues to over-run their understandings.</p>

            <p>I know the answer to all this must be, that Dr. <hi>Sutlive</hi> speaks all this only of the Catholick mystical Church, and not of the Visible Church. To which I Reply, 1.

And that this one is called Invisible from its essence, and Visible from an adjunct, which is so. 3. And therefore that where there is Profession without true faith, and so men that have only that which denominateth it Visible, without that which denominateth it Invisible, these are only equivocally and not truly members.</p>

            <p>By what hath been said it is evident that it is the judgement of the Protestants that reprobates and wicked men are not properly members of the Church, but only Equivocally, and that the Church, is but one, which in some respect is visible, and some invisible, and that it is denominated Invisible because its Essential form is Invisible; and denominated visible only from an External Accidental form; and therefore that those mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that are only visible, or have only the Accidental form of Members, or are only of the Church as visible, are but Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally members of the Church properly so called, as from its essential form.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake p.</hi> 150. [<q>Then it seems there is no Reality in such separations! <hi>Camero</hi> tells us otherwise, that there is a Reality in this Saintship by separation.</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is the first time that ever I heard that Equivocal terms express not Realityes. Is there no Reality in a picture or a corps? It sufficeth that the Reality is not the same that in a man, and a corps is expressed by the same word [Man] <hi>Camero's judgement of our controversie is declared before in his own words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> [<q>And it seems the Scripture is still under the charge of Equivocal speeches all over.</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This anger flyes too high. I beseech you make not the undeniable Equivocal terms which you finde in Scripture the Matter of [<hi>a Charge</hi>:] Its is ill judging the Law that must Judge us. Is there a Divine on earth that will deny that there are Equivocal terms in Scripture? or that there are hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, if not thousand numerical words that are such. And do you not fear to make these the Grounds of [<hi>a charge</hi>?] Scripture shall not go <hi>uncharged</hi> except it speak so as to please us! In the highest matters about the Attributes and Works of God, how common are Equivocal terms? <hi>But</hi> do you indeed think that all Equivocal terms are Culpable? yea or unnecessary? or not intelligible? I pray you distinguish between Jesuitical dissembling Equivocation, and the laudable yea necessary use of Equivocal words, when either the transcendencie of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the incapacity of men, the paucity of terms, the custom of speech, &amp;c. hath made them fit or needfull: Let God have the forbearance and justice in your interpretations, as every writer
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:107958:251"/>
and Speaker is allowed without any accusation; the Scripture hath accusers enow already.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> [<q>I would know for my learning what advantage or profit a dead corps is in capacity to enjoy. I think none at all: but these have much every way.</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Thus you argue, (or you say nothing:) [If unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Saints, Church-members &amp;c, have much advantage, and a corps have no advantage, then they are not Equivocally called Saints, Church-members, &amp;c. as a corps is called a man: But &amp;c. The consequence is not only false, but too gross. <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi> or <hi>disadvantage</hi> are nothing to the nature of Equivocals.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In its kinde a Corps may have advantage; It may be stuck with flowers, perfumed, emblamed, and kept from stinking, as ungodly men are by their common Gifts, for the sake of those with whom they do converse. 3. An Ape is capable of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and yet if you call him a man it is a more Catachresticall Equivocation, than to call a corps so: An <hi>embryo</hi> or rude begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a mans body before it receive the soul, it is capable of advanatage, in order to Manhood, and yet is but Equivocally called a man.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi> 
               <q>If such Equivocation be found in the word [Saint] then the like is to be affirmed of the word Believer; and Believers having their denomination from their faith, that is equivocall in like manner, and so the common Division of faith into Dogmatical or Historical, temporary, miraculous, and justifying is but a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of an <hi>Aequivocum in sua Aequivocata,</hi> which I should think no man should affirm, much less Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who makes common and special grace to differ only gradually; and then as cold in a remiss degree may grow to that which is intense; so one <hi>Aequivocatum</hi> may rise up to the Nature of another: <hi>animal terrestre,</hi> may become <hi>Sydus Coeleste.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Its no good consequence: because the word [<hi>Saint</hi>] is Equivocal, therefore the word [<hi>Believer</hi>] is so. 2. Our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is not about the sence of the word [<hi>Faith</hi>] or [<hi>Believer</hi>] in <hi>General</hi>: but about the [<hi>Christian Faith</hi>] in special, from whence a man is to be properly called a Christian, and upon the profession whereof he is to be baptized; for I told you once already, that as Faith is taken in General, so your lower
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:107958:252"/>
sort of faith is truly and properly <hi>Faith</hi>; and so is believing in <hi>Mahomet</hi>: To distinguish <hi>Faith</hi> into Divine and Humane, and into Christian and Mahometan &amp;c, is not <hi>aequivoci in sua aequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata divisio</hi>: But to distinguish the <hi>Christian Faith which entituleth to Baptism,</hi> into <hi>saving Faith,</hi> and that <hi>which is short of it,</hi> is <hi>aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voci in sua aequivocata.</hi> 3. If you thought <hi>No man</hi> had been guilty of this conceit, whether that <hi>thought</hi> do more disparage the said assertion, or your self, I must not be judge; but I take it as if you had said, [I thought no man had written against <hi>Bellarmines</hi> definition of the Church] 4. As to your [<hi>No Man; much less</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>] as I know not the reason of your <hi>thought,</hi> unless you indeed take me not only to be <hi>No Man,</hi> but to be somewhat distinct both from <hi>a man</hi> and <hi>no man</hi>; so I am as little satisfied with the Reason which you alledg: For 1. It is a <hi>Gross untruth</hi> unworthy a Divine and a Brother, that I <hi>hold common and special Grace to differ only gradually.</hi> And that this should be deliberately published, even after I had given the world in print so full an account of the mistake of this accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from another, once and again, this is yet less ingenuous, and doth but tell us what we must expect from Brethren when passion is <hi>predominant.</hi> I never affirmed any more than this, [that there is a Moral specifick difference, between special and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Graces founded in a Natural Gradual difference.] I manifested in print that Dr. <hi>Kendall</hi> who writeth against me on this occasion, doth not only say the same thing, but profess that others differ not from me, and resolveth his dispute into a reprehension of me for pretending a difference. Yet after all these writings my reverend Brother Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> sticks not to affirm to this and future Ages in print that I hold [<hi>Only a Gradual difference,</hi>] without any more ado. And of such deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I may say his Book is too full. 5. Your reason is no reason; I hope you think not either that your <hi>Animal terrest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e &amp; Sydus caeleste</hi> differ but Gradually; nor yet that there are no Equivocals that differ only in Natural degrees: who knows not that in many hundred cases a Degree may vary the species?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> [<q>If Juda's faith was only Equivocal, then the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean spirits were Equivocal likewise.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="477" facs="tcp:107958:252"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> A consequence as well fortified with proof of Reason as much more of your book is. Yet I take the boldness to deny it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> [<q>I shall never believe that an Equivocal faith can cast out a reall devil.</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. You are not able to make good your word: for you have not wholly the Command of your own belief. I am as confident that you will believe it. 2. But if you will not that's no good argument to us that the thing is false. 3. An Equivocal faith is a Real faith; why then may it not cast out a Real Devil (that is, be a <hi>Causa sine qua non?</hi> for no faith doth properly effect it.) I hope you will believe that [<hi>the finger of God</hi>] can cast out a real devil; and yet I hope you think that Gods Power is but Equivocally called [<hi>His finger.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> [<q>The Apostle tells us of Faith to the removal of mountaines, void of Charity: if this were Equivocal faith, those must be Equivocal mountaines.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Still the like proof! you may as well say [If it be Equivocally called Gods finger, then it must Equivocally be called a devil that is ejected. We need better proof.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> pag. 153. bringeth <hi>Du-Plessis, Wollebius, Gomar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Hudson, Paraeus, Ames,</hi> saying that <hi>good and bad are in the visible Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Have you to do with any man that denyeth it? But you know, they distinguish between <hi>In</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Of</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and 2. that they Judge not of the visible as you do. And therefore you do but fraudenly <hi>pag.</hi> 156. make it my opinion as joyning with <hi>Bellarmines</hi> unjust charge, <hi>that the visible Church is no true Church, but Equivocally so called, and that there are two Churches &amp;c.</hi> Do but you quit your self of the charge of making two Churches as well as all, and we shall do well enough for that. And for the other part of your charge, our Divines say that there are in the visible Church, 1. those that belong to it as Invisible. 2 hypocrites and reprobates: the former say they are properly members of the Church in its proper sense, the latter are only seeming members: and the Church visible is called [a Church] in respect to the former: And the visible is denominated but from an Accidental and not the essential form. Their words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited shew this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="478" facs="tcp:107958:253"/>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> [<q>And whereas <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> saith that other Divines generally plead that Hypocrites are not true members of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church, but as a wooden leg to the body: I am almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that in turning over all his bookes, he can produce but few such testimonies,] Had he said [the Catholick Church] instead of [the universal] I believe he might have found many — I think that scarce any man will deny that the universal Church is visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble—yet <hi>Whitaker</hi> as largely makes good that the Catholick Church is invisible: If I be now sent to my Dictionary, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholick and Vniversal be both one —the one a Greek word, the other a Latine; I confess it is so in Grammer, but not in their use of it that handle the question of the Church Catholick in this manner — &amp;c.</q>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Readers, take warning by Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and me, and for our sakes be not over credulous, no not in the most palpable matters of fact. You hear Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> confidence, and now you shall hear mine. Whether I can cite many such testimonies is partly apparent already. <hi>Melancthon, Calvin, Beza, Vrsine, Polanus, Paraeus, Piscator, Zanchy, Junius,</hi> and I think I may add an hundred more, do promiscuously use the terms [<hi>Catholick</hi>] and [<hi>Vniversal</hi>] here: and commonly joyn them thus [<hi>Ecclesia Catholica seu Vniversalis.</hi>] I profess, I mention that which mine eyes have many a time punctually observed: and I further profess that I never to this day (to my best remembrance) did read one Author (nor hear of one till M. <hi>Blake</hi> here speaks it) that did distinguish between the [Catholick and Universal Church;] and though I may not say that no man ever did so, as having not read all, yet I will say, I do not believe that ever one reputed, wise and Orthodox did so, and I think Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> would have proved it from some one if he could. I take this therefore to be a most injurious reproach to our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. Name us one man if you can that ever was guilty of this ridiculous distinction: yea or one Papist that had the front to charge them with such a thing. It is well known that our elder Reformers use to plead against the Papist that particular Churches are visible, but that <hi>Ecclesia Catholica seu Vniversalis</hi> is invisible (though you stick not to say that scarce any man will deny the Universal Church to be visible;) and that our latter
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:107958:253"/>
Divines do speak more cautelously, and say, that both particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and Universal Church are <hi>quoad formam externam</hi> visible: and yet both are well reconcileable in sence: but your dinstinction I never met with before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 156. I must profess that in perusing all Mr. <hi>Blake's</hi> book, I found but one place, that at the first reading might seem to an impartial man (of intellectuals no stronger than mine,) to be a successful confutation of any one of my Arguments, and that is the next, where repeating my Argument (that the distribution of the Church into visible and invisible, is but of a subject into diverse adjuncts; therefore the members that are meerly visible, are indeed no part &amp;c, because adjuncts are no part of the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: he answers [<q>The consequence might as fairly have bin that these members which are invisible, are no parts &amp;c.</q>] I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess at the first view its a pausible answer, but open it, and the inside is no better than the rest. For my argument takes the adjunct as conjunct with the reason of the denomination, and <hi>Invisible</hi> is not a real adjunct, but a negative denomination; and so the argument is thus [The Church is called <hi>Invisible</hi> from its internal essential form, which is invisible; and its called <hi>visible</hi> but from its external accidental form which is visible: therefore those Members that are meerly visible (note; I said, Meerly,) are but Equivocally called members of the Church, because they participate only of the accidental form, and not at all of the essential. Thus argue the Protestants ordinarily against <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> And now where is Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> splendid answer, Invisibility is but an adjunct, no more than visibility; true; and not so much neither. But the Reason of the denomination, or the thing denominated <hi>Invisible,</hi> is that which Protestants call the essence, and that called visible is but an Accident in their account.</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>pag.</hi> 157. you take the Church to be an <hi>integrum,</hi> and that the meerly visible Members are parts, yea and the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be the Church most properly, it is notorious that you side with the Papists therein against the stream of Protestant Divines: Though the thing it self I shall not now debate, it being meerly a Controversie <hi>de nomine</hi> that we have in hand, and I mention the words of Divines, because that custom is the Master of
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:107958:254"/>
speech; and therefore have no better meanes that I know of to decide such kind of Controversies.</p>
            <p>As to what you say <hi>pag.</hi> 132. I reply again; that which is Real, may have an equivocal name; and men will know this, yea and Children too, when you have talkt your utmost.</p>
            <p>And as to what you say <hi>page</hi> 139.140. about <hi>Equivocal Covenanting,</hi> I say as I did of Faith: Take Covenanting in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and so a wicked man doth properly Covenant <hi>ex parte sui</hi> with his tongue: But take it for the Christian Covenanting which entitleth to baptism and denominateth us Christians, which is [a consent to Gods terms on which he offers Christ and life,] and so all the covenantings, of the ungodly are but equivocally called [Covenanting with God in Christ] If you will not believe me; at least regard Dr. <hi>Kendals</hi> long dispute on such a point in his second volume, on a mistake, intended against me; and answer him before you persevere. And as for Gods act of Covenanting with them, I say, He is not actually in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them or obliged to them; but only still doth offer them his Covenant.</p>
            <p>Reader, I suppose I should do but an unnecessary and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired work, if I should thus give a particular Reply to all the rest of such passages as the forementioned in Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> book. And therefore having enough of such work already, I shall forbear, and here dismiss thee.</p>
            <p>An account of my Reasons why I make no answer to Mr <hi>Robertson,</hi> nor a more particular Reply to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Owens</hi> appendix, as they were given heretofore in a Letter to a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Friend.</p>
            <p>Though most of my Reverend Brethren that have written to me of that subject, do advise me to forbear particular Replies to the words of others, because the matter is so much obscured or disadvantaged through the verbal quarrels, and they only desire me to handle the point of Title to Sacraments in some just Disputations, and to take in that of Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> which best deserveth a Reply, (whom I have obeyed in these Disputations,) yet because some few others are of a contrary minde, I shall lay
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:107958:254"/>
down my reasons why I do not yield to their desires; which is, not only because it is impossible to please men of contrary expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, and because they are the fewer, but also because to me their reasons seem less weighty, and the work which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire is less grateful, and will be less profitable.</p>
            <p>And first for Mr. <hi>Robertson,</hi> he that thinks such a book doth need a Reply, is like to profit little by any of mine, and so I leave him to be of what opinion the winde and tide shall drive him to. I have read over a M. S. Book of Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> which is his vindication against Mr. <hi>Robertson</hi>; wherein he hath suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and easily done a needless work. To reciprocate gain-say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with that kinde of men, is an unprofitable and unpleasing thing: The sons of contention in their greatest darkness, are more zealous and unwearied in their generation and work, than the Children of light and peace in theirs. Its not desirable to match them in violence, in selfconceitedness, in rashness, or false accusations, in scorns, or lowdness, or length of speech. And as peaceable Readers are grieved with such disputes, so usually the Antagonist is more hardened in his mistakes. If you have a friend that erreth, whose recovery you desire, be sure that you write not a confutation of his errors: for ordinarily thats the way to fasten him in them, and make him worse. Some will think this a hard censure, to pass on learned godly men, whose hearts should be devoted to truth, and who pretend to love the light that doth disclose it: But there's no reasoning against common unquestionable experience. Who will doubt whether it can be so, when he sees it is so? Of all the Cart-loads of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal writings that swarm in the world, how many can you name that convinced the Antagonist, and brought him to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation? Bethink your selves how many you can name. Nay how many that did not provoke and harden them? By secret explications, and loving debate, the mindes of many have been changed; and many by positive Asserting and proving the truth; and I confess some by controversal writings that were written against others (els I would never meddle that way) but how few by those that are written in confutation of themselves? As soon as you speak to men in the hearing of the world, they presently apprehend their reputation to be so engaged, that they
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:107958:255"/>
are excieted to defend it with all their might; and instead of an impartial consideration of your arguments, and a ready entertainment of the truth, they bend their wits to study how to make good what once they have delivered, and to prove that true that once hath past their pens, that the world may not think them so weak as to have mistaken. Nay when they do profess to love the truth as truth, and to be willing to receive it; yet this <hi>Self</hi> is so neer them, and so potent with them, that they cannot easily suspect that which is their own; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they have espoused it with any extraordinary endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: It hath still a lovely aspect in their eyes, and they think so intentively what may be said for it, that they have scarce leisure or room or life to apprehend the force of that which is said against it. The first eyes which they cast on your writings, is with a desire to finde some such weaknesses in them, which may be matter of reproach, or insulting for them; and their endeavours are suited to their first intentions; and thus are they byassed in their reading from end to end. You therefore mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply their temptations to err, when you discover their error: For now you so involve the interest of their error with their own, that they see they cannot confess but with some disgrace, nor receive the truth without being so base as to confess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves overcome: And therefore they muster up all their forces to maintain their opinions for the maintenance of their honour. It must be therefore for other mens sakes more then for their own, that you must enterprise such works: Unless you meet with those eminently humble self-denying Divines (they say there are some such in the world) that are most jealous of their own, through consciousness of their darkness, and take it for the greatest victory to be conquered by the truth. I doubt not but there are some such humble souls, where the window stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth open to the light, though pride and prejudice shut it with the most. Of whom if you please to esteem me one, I shall not much contradict you, but shall thence suppose that you will rather permit me to speak plainly against the sin, because I have suffered by it my self.</p>
            <p>And as to those other Reverend persons, Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> whose displeasure hath been so much kindled against me,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:107958:255"/>
I shall give you a brief account of my Reasons, from the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their writings, why I think that it is not to be done, at least by any particular examination of their words.</p>
            <p>By the effects of what hath been said to them already, you may strongly conjecture what good it would do them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted again. In the former writings there appeared so much calmness, that one would have thought they had been men that could have endured a Reply: But for their second, they so much differ from the first as if the men were not the same. If you judged by the storms that arise in these writings, would you not think that I had somewhere reproached their persons, or done some hainous thing against them? But whether it be so, I am content that the indifferent judge. For the former (Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>) I desire that any of his tenderest friends will peruse those few lines in which I contradicted him, and if they can finde a word that is uncivil or abusive, I shall be ready to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own it, and to profess that I was guilty of provoking him to such an impatient entertainment. If I can understand my self and him, and may judge by his complaints and by the complexion of his dispute, the hainous injury that I have done him is that I have gain-said him; And I had thought that half the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which some of his professions of himself do intimate that he is possessed of, would have caused a man to have judged this a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable fault. As long as his person is not once medled with, but onely his words examined, and cause set against cause, and reason against reason, what harm is done to him? what bone is broken? or what one feather is plucked from his plume? Nay rather it hath occasioned the reparation of his honor with some; For some that before judged that he meant as he spoke, do now begin to believe that he meant better; since he so earnestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth that he meant as the Orthodox, and seems to disclaim the Absolution of Unbelievers. And I must confess I do somwhat the less repent of those disputes that so much offend men, when they have so good an issue for the matter, though some accidental evils are occasioned by them. When a bad cause is disowned, I have the thing that I intended: And though it be very angrily that we agree, and close with somewhat a sharp collision, yet its well that we agree: Though I must say that
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:107958:256"/>
it is so usual for men to love those of their own opinions, that I marvailed to finde a man with such high indignation endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to prove himself of his Opponents minde; and that we should agree more passionately then we seemed to differ. As I little thought that Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> had been of the same minde with my self and others in this point; But Mr. <hi>Iessop</hi> hath pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably and temperately proved it: and I therein rejoyce: so I less thought that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> had been of the same minde; but he hath hotly and haughtily proved it; and therein also I rejoyce. As long as we come neerer, and error goeth away with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, we may the better bear the displeasure of the Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>As for the great pains he hath taken about my Person (for the cause found him not work enough) to prove from my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that I am so hypocritically proud, I know not well what return to make him that will be acceptable. Should I as faithfully admonish him, it would seem but a recrimination; and its like he hath those that are nearer him that do it, who need not take their ground from fame, and whose words may meet with less indignation: Should I tell him that a Minister is not to be prodigal of his reputation, because it is not his own, and that a man that is voluminously slandered, and that is Calumniated by the off-spring which such Reverend men as he hath mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wived into the world, may possibly open his mouth against the Calumniator, and clear his innocency and the truth without a predominant degree of pride, I should probably incurr the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of being yet more proud, by denying any thing that is charged upon me; though it were that Heresie it self which his parallel doth seem to his Readers to accuse me of. If I should tell him that I do unfeignedly confess the truth of his accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that I was aware of Pride and Hypocrisie in my heart before he told me of them, and that the subduing of them is the business of my desires and care, its ten to one but I shall be proud in seeming so humble as to confess my pride, and that these (as he speaks) are but good words to cover it. But yet confess it I must and will, how proud soever I be in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
            <p>One evidence of it which I have heard from the apprehension
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:107958:256"/>
of others, <hi>viz.</hi> because I gave him not his due Titles of honour, is no whit cogent with me that know the case: and I think my justification is unanswerable: <hi>viz.</hi> that when my papers were written he was not Doctor, though he was when they came out of the press.</p>
            <p>Whether it be not harder measure that I have met with at his hand, I desire you to judge by two or three particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though I did purposely again and again profess that I reckoned not all to be <hi>Antinomians</hi> that held only some one or few of their opinions, that are not the worst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in particular, not all that held the very same opinion against which I argued with him, and withall entitle him [The most sober and learned man that I know of that writes that way] even for that opinion; yet doth he think meet to publish to the world that I [enroll him into the Troop of <hi>Antinomians,</hi>] when he is unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a syllable of mine that hath such a signification. I think this dealing is not fair.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He untruly chargeth me with [traducing him for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and giving countenance to the Propositions which I mentioned <hi>pag.</hi> 189.] on his <hi>pag.</hi> 9. and 3. and thereupon groundeth his tragical exclamations. I mentioned him as the author of these particular words which I annexed to his name, which I judged indeed unsound; but will it thence follow that I fasten on him all the errors that I mention in the precedent or subsequent pages? Having read my words inconsiderately, he exclaims against supposed injuries, which were caused by the mistakes of his own imagination, and are not to be found in any of my expressions. A stranger that reads his passionate scorns upon such occasions, and had not read the words which did offend him, would little think that so learned a man should make such a stir upon the pretence of a charge that was never brought against him, but only against others, a leaf before the mention of his name. If he ask, Why then did I there mention his name? I answer; As he defendeth that particular opinion which his words express, and not as defending all that other men are charged with: and I mentioned his, because it is too like to theirs, and they are encouraged by it, as Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations may evince.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="486" facs="tcp:107958:257"/>3. When in the close of my confession <hi>pag.</hi> 462. I called so large a recital of other mens words, [a spending of much time to little purpose,] even to satisfie those that look too much at the names of men, he feigneth me to speak this in reference to the matter and manner of the Book.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His splendid fiction of the terrible conditions which I put upon my answerer, and his insultings thereupon, are only the effects of his inadvertency and mistakes <hi>(pag.</hi> 45.) as I shall shew anon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. His pretended knowledge of me, as if it were upon much acquaintance and experience, doth argue much sagacity. I think I have seen him as oft as he hath seen me, and yet my knowledge of him is very small.</p>
            <p>In his anatomizing of my pride <hi>pag.</hi> 6 he playes the after-game more plausibly than his Brethren played the fore-game. They go before, (and partly by his help) and publish abundance of Calumnies of me to the world, telling them not only that I am a Papist, but what books they were that made me a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, and what Emissaries I have in all parts of the Land, with much more of the like. When my discovery of their abuse did frustrate much of their design, this Learned man comes after them, and at last will prove me proud for contradicting them; forsooth for talking so much of my self. As if one of the Doctors friends should accuse me of theft, or murder at the Assize, and when I have justified my innocency, the Doctor should come after him, and tell how much I had spoken for my self, and prove me thereby to be proud and selfish. The truth is, I am conscious of so much of these sins, and so far believe the odiousness and danger of them, that I take such books as this Doctors for a great mercy; as knowing that strong corruptions must have something that is strong to work the cure, and a hard knot must have a sharp wedge; a <hi>Shimei</hi> may be sent of God for good; and how unrighteous soever the monitor may be, I am abundantly beholden to God that doth permit it; I had rather have a Messenger of Satan to buffet me, than be exalted above measure. I confess my pride needs sharper reprehensions than friends have ever used about me; and therefore they are better from any body than from no body. But I must say, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:107958:257"/>
of speaking, writing or doing any thing so exactly, but that ingenious malice may plausibly put it into as odious a dress as this Reverend man (I hope with a better mind) hath there cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed the passages with, which he refers to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 7. His passion quite conquereth his ingenuity, while he is not contented to ease his spleen on me alone, but must fall upon the <hi>Worcestershire</hi> profession of faith, and therein pick quarrels with the plainest passages, contrary to the sence that I had told him in my explication we took the words in; and can find that [in sundry particulars therein we give too great a countenance to the Socinian abominations] when we have professed that we believe in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and then that we consent to take this God for our God and chief Good, this Christ for our only Saviour, &amp;c. he can find us directly answering Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> and distinguishing the Lord Jesus our Redeemer as our Lord from that one true God] as if we did not include the three persons in the first Article of our consent, and in the second respect the office of Christ rather than the pure Godhead considered in it self, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h was expressed before! Or as if we had not plainly prevented such exceptions! As God is offered, so is he to be accepted; and therefore our consent must respect the benefits and offices, and not only the persons in the Trinity as such. And did this Reverend man forget how oft <hi>Paul</hi> hath given him the very same cause to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his words of countenancing Socinianism (excepting the difference of the authors) as we have done; I mean, how oft he doth as plainly distinguish as we here do! But because such eyes will not look at an explication in the distant leaves, we have since tryed a further remedy against such Calumniations, by putting our exposition in the margent, that he that will see the words themselves, may see them. But when all is done, you see what dealing you must expect. I look not to scape the fangs of such excepters, if I say that I believe in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; for no doubt but some of them can find heresie or somewhat that countenanceth it in this.</p>
            <p>But the hardest measure of all that I have from him is in his Socinian parallel in 11. Articles, <hi>page</hi> 11.12. &amp;c. I never met with Reader but understood without doubt, that he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:107958:258"/>
the words in the English Letter as mine: But he was wiser than to say so, much more to quote the places where they are all found. Indeed part of them are the common Protestant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and part of them never fell from my pen, nor came into my thoughts with any approbation. Yet hath he so prudently managed the business, that his Readers shall generally think he chargeth them on me (and who will not believe him rather then search he knows not where to disprove him?) and yet he may deny it when ever he is blamed for it.</p>
            <p>Having thus given you an account of the quality of that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, I hope you see sufficient Reason why I should forbear a more particular Reply. Nor will I vie with him in poetical shreds and adages, though a <hi>Polyanthea</hi> or <hi>Erasmus</hi> Apopthegms would furnish me without any further travel.</p>
            <p>And next as to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> I find more cause in his last wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to deter me from all Disputations where pious men may think themselves concerned, than to encourage me to proceed in the justest defence. And I confess it repenteth me for his own sake that ever I defended my self against his accusations, and that I did not silently suffer him to say what he would: though yet I am willing that the equity of the Reasons which I gave for my Replying to him in that Apologie, be censured by any impartial man: even those that I have expressed in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to that Book. But I could not then see the consequents as to himself.</p>
            <p>I am heartily sorry that I have become by my defence, an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion or temptation of so much offence, and of so much distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and injustice to a man whom I so much love and honour; should I speak any further for that which I am confident is the truth of God, how much more might I offend and tempt him? I well hoped that he that made the assault on his Brother would have patiently heard an answer; and have been glad of such a collation of our several thoughts as might tend in any measure to beat out the truth. As he thought it was for God that he assaulted me, so I as verily think it was for God and his certain truth that I wrote my defence. And if I be mistaken, why should he be so angry at it? when I know he takes not himself to be infallible. When I wrote <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Index the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:107958:258"/>
of one section, thus [<hi>whether it be virtually written in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that</hi> Mr. Blake <hi>is justified? and whether it is</hi> de fide,] he saith (<hi>pag.</hi> 336.) that [<hi>he did not without trembling of spirit read, nor without tears think upon this thus put to the question.</hi>] And whats the reason? why saith he [<hi>Who would not believe that I had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly asserted it, or made some unsavooy vaunts about it?</hi>] Truly, no man would believe it from these words, that knows what an Index is; but would understand that it tels him the matter that is contained in the page that it referreth him to, and not the matter directly asserted by another. And must we not dispute against that also which is <hi>indirectly</hi> asserted? I profess it never came into my thoughts that the most render passionate man, that was not melancholy, could have so much matter of offence in those words as to <hi>tremble</hi> or <hi>weep</hi> at them. It is a case wherein I must speak of some individual, or I could not speake to the purpose. For its granted that it is not every mans justification that is <hi>de fide,</hi> nor every justified mans, and yet some mens was. Had I instanced in <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> it had been nothing to out business: For I confess that Scripture declareth them to be justified. <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Sompronius</hi> I knew not, and therefore could not instance in them. Should I have instanced in my self, he might have taken it for sophistical: For the disproof of my own certainty of justification, is no disproof of another mans; whom then could I more reasonably and fitly instance in than the Opponent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? especially being a man of whose sincerity I am so confident. It never entered into my apprehension that this was any more wrong to him, than it would have been to have put this question, <hi>Whether</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake's Soul be in loco,</hi> if I had been disputing with him <hi>whether anima humana sit in loco?</hi> I profess if it were to do again, I know not how more fitly to express it. But if I have not skill enough to draw the index of a Section, without so great sin or offence as shall cast so Reverend a man into <hi>trembling and tears</hi> (no doubt, in compassion of me) I think its time to lay by this kinde of work.</p>
            <p>I have been (it seems) also a temptation to him to tell the world such stories of my self, as I little thought such a man would have reported. As Mr. <hi>Robertson</hi> talks so confidently of his discourses with Mr. <hi>Hothkis</hi> who professes he never saw
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:107958:259"/>
him or spoke a word to him; so doth my dear friend Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> tell the world as truly, once on the credit of his Informer, but again absolutely without such limitation, that I have given out that I have made some body my Convert, who professeth now to be satisfied in his Book: Whereas he might as truly have told them, that I take my self to be King of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain.</hi> If he will bring his tale-carriers face to face, and prove by any faithful witness that I ever boasted of any man as my Convert, or ever said of one man living that I had made him my Convert, in any matter of such opinions, I will give you leave to spit in my face and call me lyar.</p>
            <p>As fairly doth he cast his censures on the credit of his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers at the <hi>Wocestershire</hi> combination (as he termeth it) [<hi>that the most prophane, where the Minister carries any Authority, are as forward as any</hi>] with more of the like: whereas if he had been unsatisfied in their proceedings, there are many Reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren there that would have readily given him an account of them, and a better information: And he was publickly told by them and me, that we were not gathering Churches or taking in members, and therefore not discerning who were meet; but only discerning who did account themselves as such, and profess themselves such already.</p>
            <p>And as fairly doth he report that he hears I [<hi>bring in the name of Reverend</hi> Mr. Ball <hi>to give honor to this, that the Doctrine of the Church of Rome and the reformed Churches is one and the same, or inconsiderably differing in this of justification</hi>;] And then tels us that he heard it himself and told Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> of it, and that he disclaimed it. Whereas 1. It was not half this much that I spake. 2. And do not know that ever I spake it to three men, or more. 3. And I must profess to the world that the man I had it from was Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> himself, and only him, and that at too seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, once mentioning the Papists doctrine, and the other time the Arminians about justification; and that he repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the neerness of us to them, as Mr. <hi>Ball's</hi> saying, but never told me with it one word of his disowning it. 4. And I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver spake this my self, as approving the conceit, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and we did so inconsiderably differ herein. And now let the equity of Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> dealing be judged of, whether he
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:107958:259"/>
were a fit man publickly to accuse me of this crime, who was my only Author. I would never have mentioned these things, if he had not thus necessitated me. Though I am in doubt that he will take it ill, that in all these things I deny his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations, and do not by my silence interpretatively belye my self.</p>
            <p>And as to the main <hi>bulk</hi> of his Disputes against me, I must needs say that there is such ordinary mistaking the sence, or quite overlooking the drift of my Arguments and Answers, and obscuring the matter with meer shifts and confusions, that if I should give a punctual answer to such a book, I think the perusal of it would be ungratefull to the Reader. For what profit can it be to any man to be convinced at so dear a rate, how much Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath miscaried in his arguing? I know my censures of his labors are like to be provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: But who can help that? Had I thought him in the right, I had never contradicted him. Or could I yet see that I have erred, I must needs approve that light which did reveal it: And if I be in the wrong, it is no news for an erring man to think that he doth not err; and if he think not so, he doth not err in minde, but in word. But if I prove in the right, if it will not excuse me that I do but ward off the blow that he giveth me, not that I plead for Gods truth, at least let it excuse me that some evidence is cogent, and some light so constraining that I cannot chuse but think as I do think, till I have better evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the contrary than doth appear in Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Reply. And so little is my understanding at the disposal of my will, that if my life lay on it, I could not choose but be perswaded in my heart, that Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Reply is so full of mistakes, and built upon such misunderstanding of the words that he Reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to, that it tendeth more to darken the truth than to clear it, and to pervert the inconsiderate that will take things on trust, or think his cause best that hath the last word to colour it, and put a gloss upon it: and that there needs no more with the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader that is willing to try before he trust, and thinks the truth is worth his labour, than impartially to read over the words that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth Reply to, for the manifesting of the insufficiency of his Reply, as to the main of the cause. He will
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:107958:260"/>
think this is great confidence; but what Remedy? I think he is neer as confident: though both be not in the right. And I doubt not but Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> can see the height of my Pride in this confidence. But certainly when ever I come to be so humble as to believe all that such Reverend Brethren say, I must needs be so Proud as to disbelieve those that contradict them; For I see it a matter not to hoped for, that ever they that are so offended with me, should come to an agreement among themselves. As Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> are against me; so Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and I are against Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and so its runs round. And if I should be so humible as to agree with one of them, what shall I do for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconsistent humilitie, to make me of the others minde that is against him?</p>
            <p>I must confess that there is one part of the contest between Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and me at least, that I think well worthy a review, and that is the question about the nature of that faith which gives Right to Sacraments: For as it is a matter that comes so frequently into practice, and of such moment to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to Ministers and to the welfare of the Church, so I do not know of any that hath said so much for that cause which I yet account so bad, as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath done; and indeed he hath put a fairer gloss on this than on any of the rest. And yet in my judgement he hath left it so naked, that a little diligence and impartially may do much to discover his opinions to be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent (if reduced into practice) with the Purity of the Church, and such as is unworthy the patronage of Godly learned men. Yet in this I perceive his writings have success: For I hear that some Reverend Godly men of his acquaintance are so confident that he is in the right, that they marvel that ever I should hold the contrary, and blame me as defending a principal point in the Independent cause. The Lord enlighten us, and pardon it to us, which soever of us it be that is mistaken, and doth wrong the Church of God.</p>
            <p>There are four several Titles that are or may be produced to Baptism: The first is sincere Saving Faith: The second is the profession of such sincere Faith: The third is a Dogmatical Faith, short of Justifying Faith: The fourth is a profession of that Dogmatical Faith. I say, that only they that have the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:107958:260"/>
Faith, have a Promise-Right to Baptism, properly so called; which I called a Right <hi>Coram Deo:</hi> but that the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of such a Faith and their seed have an Analogical Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential Right which followeth on Gods Precept to a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to Baptize them. This I called Right <hi>Coram Ecclesiâ,</hi> and is less properly a Right. And that the bare word <hi>Right</hi> might be no occasion of quarrel, I distinguished of Right; and shewed how far I affirmed or denyed it: But such distinctions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions are nothing to the business with Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>; but fittest to be passed by. I conclude in a word that every professor of a Justifying Faith (that doth not invalidate his own professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) hath such a claim to Baptism for himself (if unbaptized) and his seed, as the Church must admit: But only the sincere Believer hath a Right from the Promise, and shall be taken by God for one to whom he is actually, as it were, obliged by his Covenant. But for the two later pretended Titles, <hi>viz. A Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Faith not Justifying, and the Profession of such a Faith,</hi> I say, they are no just Titles at all. Not but that a man who hath meerly a Dogmatical Faith within, may have a Title in <hi>Foro Ecclesiae</hi>; but this Faith is not his Title, but the profession of a Saving Faith: so that if he profess only his Dogmatical Faith, and not a Saving Faith, the Minister ought not to Baptize him. This is the brief of the state of the Controversie between Master <hi>Blake</hi> and me: And did I think that any such Reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren would ever have approved his Judgement in such a cause? Yea and some of them plead from the same effectual <hi>mediums,</hi> which are alone sufficient to prove the contrary; Its the course of <hi>Hilary</hi> and others against the <hi>Arrians; Hierome, Augustine,</hi> and many more against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and other hereticks, to call them to the constant practice of the Church in Baptizing, for the proving of the nature of that Belief that we are Baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and the quality of the subject. I appeal to Christs institution of Baptism, and the uninterrupted practice of all Churches that ever I read of on the face of the earth to this day, and to the continued practice of the Churches in <hi>England,</hi> and all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed parties, and all the rest of the Christian world, If they do not generally, <hi>Ethiopians, Greeks, Papists, Protestants</hi> with one consent require the profession of a Justifying Faith, I will quit
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:107958:261"/>
this cause, and tell Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> that I have been mistaken, and cry him mercy. Nay if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> himself do not require the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of a Justifying Faith in the Parent of all that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to Baptism, I shall think him the only singular man I know alive in this business: But if he practice contrary to all his confident Argumentations, which shall we have respect to, his opinion or his practice? Where is the Church on earth that doth not Baptize into the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and require in the adult, or the Parent of Infants, that they profess themselves at present to Believe in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and to renounce the World, the Flesh and the Devil? And therefore they commonly cause them to profess the Articles of the ancient Creed before they do Baptize them (which though it hath been lately disused by some, I gladly heard some Reverend Ministers in <hi>London</hi> yet use) which Creed (as <hi>Parker de Descensu,</hi> hath learnedly shewed) is the exposition of the words of the Baptismal Institution; and the sum of it is, I Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost I think not only <hi>Perkins</hi> but our Divines commonly against the Papists have proved sufficiently that the words [I Believe in God the Father, in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, in the Holy Ghost, do signifie Affiance, as well as Assent. And I should hope that I need not be put to maintain it, that [to Believe with Assent and Affiance, in God the Father, Christ the Redeemer, the Holy Ghost, the witness and Sanctifier, renouncing the Devil, the World and the Flesh] is certainly Justifying Faith, at least. If they that say they thus Believe, do so indeed, I dare not be he that shall tell them they are yet condemned, and deny them to be the justifyed members of Christ. If they will not so much as profess thus to Believe, (yea and to Repent) I will never Baptize them, or theirs upon the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r account. Will Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> himself Baptize them, that will not thus profess? would ever the Church of Christ Baptize any but such? and yet some Reverend Brethren tell us, that the Church universally hath gone Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> way, against that which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on. Now the Lord have mercy upon all our infirmities, and pity his poor Church, and bring his servants to so much Unity, that the universal practice of the Church in all ages and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even among our selves, which we daily hear, and see, and
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:107958:261"/>
our own selves practise, may not be among us a matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie; for then, what are we likely to be agreed in?</p>
            <p>Again I must crave pardon of this confidence: but if it seem to them to come from self-conceitedness and pride of my own judgement, or a loathness to let go what I have once received; as I willingly confess that I find such sins within me, and am no Christian, if I blame them not and hate them not in my self; so I will be bold to tell Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and the world the very truth in this business,: which is, that the partiality that I have felt in the study of this point hath been for Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> opinion against my own; and I had rather a great while (till the light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me) have found his opinion true, than my own. As I knew I should be taken for a defender of the Independants (which is a censure that I little regard) so I thought that I should the better comply with some Texts of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> much urgeth, and some other reasons did cause Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> opinion sometime so far to smile upon me, that I strove against the contrary truth, and studied all that I could to have confuted the Arguments for it, and was very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have found the truth on Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> side: but it was too hard for me, and overcame me after some such reluctancy. For besides many other Reasons which I have mentioned, I find that there is no footing for a man in his way. He that will not take up with the bare name of a Dogmatical Faith, knows not (for ought I can find) what to take up with. I despair of ever prevailing with Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> let him write never so much more on the subject, to give us a true Definition or Description of that Faith short of Justifying, which entitleth to Baptism, and to prove it from Gods word, or to agree with himself. Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he calls it a Dogmatical Faith: one would think now you might know the truth by this plain Name: but when I tell him that if it be meerly Dogmatical, then it is only in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings Assent, and importeth no consent of the Will, and that this is in the Devils, and may be in those that say, [We will not have this man reign over us, nor be our Saviour, because he will not let us have our lusts] (And would he Baptize those that should say so?) Hereupon Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> will take some consent of the Will, or else it cannot become a covenanting: but
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:107958:262"/>
sometime he only describes it negatively (that it is not such as comes up to Justifying Faith): but who knows by this what it is? though he tell us what it is not: sometime he makes the expression of it to contain those two parts: 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the necessity of justifying Faith: 2. An engagement or promise to Believe with a Justifying Faith. But when I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret this promise to be [that he will so believe <hi>de futuro</hi>] he asketh me [how comes <hi>de futuro</hi> in?] as if every promise were not <hi>de futuro</hi>; Is it <hi>de praesenti?</hi> Doth he promise that he doth at the present so believe? why this is not to promise, but to profess: and is the thing that I plead for as necessary, which Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> resisteth: sure then it is <hi>de futuro,</hi> or it is not intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible by common capacities. Well, if it must be <hi>de futuro,</hi> either its at the next moment, or some time at longer distance. To say, I consent not now, but I will the next moment, or tomorrow, is ridiculous: partly because as I have proved to him, such a person is not capable of making such a promise, so as should be rationally accepted in a covenant, and partly because we may end the controversie by forbearing his Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing one moment longer, or one day till he do indeed Believe and consent as he promiseth. But what time soever it be, as I told him, upon these terms, a man may say, [I believe the Creed and Scripture to be true, but because I know that I cannot serve God and Mammon, nor have Christ to justifie me, and live in my sins, I will not yet have God for my God, or Christ for my Lord and Saviour, nor the Holy Ghost for my Sanctifier, because I will not yet leave my sins, but hereafter I will,] would Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> Baptize such a man as this? In answer to such a question, he saith <hi>pag.</hi> 133. [<hi>I think it will be nothing hard for any honest Christian to say, that a man not justified may believe every funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Article, as to Assent, and that he may be convinced of the necessity of such Repentance, and accordingly to make profession of it, as</hi> Johns <hi>Converts were Baptized into &amp;c.</hi>] And <hi>pag.</hi> 147. he saith [<hi>Seeing Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>calls upon me further to declare my self fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this thing, I do believe and profess to hold, that he that upon hearing the Gospel preach't, and the truth of it published and opened, shall professedly abjure all other opposite waies whatsoever, and choose the Christian way for Salvation, promising to follow the Rules of it, is
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:107958:262"/>
to be Baptized and his seed, &amp;c.</hi>] And are these Descrptions of his Dogmatical faith the same with the former? Is not Repentance ever concomitant with Faith? <hi>John's</hi> Baptism was the Baptism of Repentance for Remission of sins; and if our Divines mistake not when they maintain to be the same with Christs, sure Faith was to go with that Repentance, and that Repentance which is for Remission of sins is not common, but saving and special. If therefore saving Repentance must not only be promised <hi>de futuro,</hi> but professed <hi>de praesenti,</hi> then doubtless so must that Faith which is inseparable. 2. And would Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> have us so Censorious as to say, that those men that [Abjure all other waies whatsoever, and choose the Christian way for Salvation, promising to follow the Rules of it,] if they do this sincerely, are not yet justified, or have not justifying faith? and that if they do it not sincerely, that is not yet justifying faith which they profess? For my part I am past doubt of it. If this be Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Dogmatical Faith, he and I are not much at distance about the Qualification of the Baptized, but about the nature of justifying Faith. For thats justifying in my judgement, which is but Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical in his. Christ is the way to Salvation; the Sanctifying work of the Spirit, and the holy Love and Obedience of the Saints in this way, in subserviency to Christ, all these are the Gospel way to Salvation: the false belief of Erroneous men, and the many by-paths of the unregenerate, are the contrary which Satan perswades them to, and makes them believe may serve the turn. That man that Abjureth all other waies than that are opposite to the Christian way, and doth choose the Christian way for Salvation, is certainly a true Penitent and believeth to justification: or else I can have no hopes of being saved. Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is that term by which <hi>Amesius</hi> will needs express the proper formal act of justifying Faith. Not one of all these acts that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> mentions, either 1. To Abjure all other opposite waies whatsoever. 2. To choose the Christian way of Salvation. 3. To promise to follow the Rules thereof. I say, not one of these can be uprightly and unfeignedly done by the unregenerate; by any that hath not true Repentance and justifying saith: Much less altogether. Judge then whether the profession of this, be not the profession of saving faith? and whether Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>
               <pb n="498" facs="tcp:107958:263"/>
know where to fix himself, and how to describe his Dogmatical faith? and whether he do not yield the cause that I am maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p>And whereas he takes it for [<hi>an egregious piece of affected non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, to say that Justifying faith is a promise</hi>] and still saith [<hi>that Justifying faith with him is the thing promised, or the thing whereto we do restipulate] pag.</hi> 171. I say, that he can never prove that the Church of Christ did know such a Baptismal covenant, wherein the first justifying faith was the thing promised (though the continuance may): And should I so Baptize any person, at age, (or an Infant in respect of the Parents Faith, which is his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Title) I should think I made a new covenant and a new Baptism; I mean, If I Baptized any without the present professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of justifying faith and Repentance, upon a promise that they will begin to Repent and Believe savingly for the time to come. Indeed the first faith and Repentance unto life, are so much above corrupted nature, and so much the special gifts of God, (which he hath given no man assurance of in particular, that hath them not already) that we must stay till men have them, before they are meet to be admitted upon promise that they will perform them.</p>
            <p>It hath pleased some of the great Calumniators agents, to censure me as an <hi>Arminian,</hi> or half one, because I run not so far on the other hand as they. But its a hard case that I am in, who must needs be an <hi>Arminian,</hi> and yet must be forced to dissent from so dear a friend as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> for fear of becoming one. I am confident that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> in those points is Orthodox; but so could not I be, if I should entertain his opinion. For if I did believe that upon the acts of common Grace men have cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or promise-right given them by God to be Baptized, I must needs believe that they had Right to Remission of sin in Christs blood; seeing God appointed no Baptism but what is for the Remission of sin; upon which account I have mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly displeased some Reverend friends that before over-valued me, who are favourers of the <hi>Arminian</hi> way, meerly because I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> in this point.</p>
            <p>For my part, I still take faith to be the very internal covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God in Christ, and not a condition of our own cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:107958:263"/>
though it be the condition of Gods covenant or promise: and so that condition of Gods covenant, and our own actual covenanting are one and the same thing: our very first cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with him, or consent to his terms, is that faith on which he promiseth us Justification: though there be a further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance required to our Salvation. It is all one, in my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to believe in Christ, and to become a Christian: and Baptism (commonly called our Christening) is not to engage us to begin to be Christians hereafter: but it is the solemnizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Christian contract or marriage between Christ and the Soul, which is supposed to be made in heart before: so that they are then actually Christians inaugurated or publickly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested. And (for all that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath said to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) he that professeth any faith only, that is short of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, is not a Christian in the covenant-sence, but is only Equivocally or Analogically so called. And whereas Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> makes it more tolerable if I had used the word [<hi>Analogically</hi>] then to use the word [<hi>Equivocally,</hi>] if he had pleased to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, I frequently put them together as here, [Equivocally or Analogically:] so that if that will satisfie him, he might have been satisfied sooner. Yet I take the Scotists controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to be yet undecided, whether some terms be not both Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical and Univocal, and some both Analogical and Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; (which they handle on the Question, <hi>Vtrum Ens dicatur Vnivocè de Deo &amp; Creaturâ)</hi> or rather that the later clause is past doubt; and therefore in our ease it is both. Nor am I yet perswaded that his old Testament covenanters, (which are the great moving instance) did profess only such a faith as was short of Justifying: and they that lived in such scandal as was inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent Notoriously with their profession, were by the law to be put to death: and then they were past begetting Children to plead a right in Circumcision.</p>
            <p>And whereas he is so confident that according to my opinion, the Baptism of the unjustifyed is a Nullity, and that they must be Baptized again, and saith, that [<hi>its much to be feared, if not certainly to be concluded, that the Major part by far of the</hi> Worcestershire <hi>combination consists of unbaptized persons, &amp;c.] pag.</hi> 142, 143. I answer 1. it is a meer naked unproved assertion,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:107958:264"/>
that any such consequent doth follow on these grounds: Nor can he ever prove it. If the outward ordinance were rightly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, and the inward covenanting of the heart were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, it is not that which was well done that must be done again, but that must be done which was at first omitted, even sincere internal covenanting or believing. 2. But it is much more disputable according to his principles, whether all that he should so Baptize, must not be rebaptized? For as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Councils which were against <hi>Cyprians</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Rebaptizing, did yet decree that all should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized that were Baptized by the <hi>Paulionists</hi> (not that they allowed really of twice Baptizing, but that the first was but Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism Equivocally so called) because they Baptized not into the Name of the Trinity; so if we should upon the new Doctrine take up a new Baptism, upon a meer Dogmatical faith, which is not a believing in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, but only a Believing that there is a Father, Son and Holy Ghost, (and add, if you will, a Promise to believe in them hereafter) I should be hardly put to it to prove these persons truly Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and, that it being a Nullity, all were not to be done again: and yet some Brethren of Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> minde think, that my Judgement opens the way to Rebaptizing; when I doubt it will be hard to avoid it, as to every person, in the way that he disputeth for. Not that I think that any one should be rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed that is Baptized by Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> or any of them. For I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that neither he, nor they did ever practice their own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, nor ever Baptized one person but upon the profession of justifying faith it self.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But why do they not see, that on their own grounds ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their own Baptizings would be Nullities, and the persons be Rebaptized. If a Dogmatical faith it self be of necessity to the Being of Baptism, then what shall be done with those many hundred Children among us, whose Parents discover to us that they have not that Dogmatical faith? How many have we oft occasion to speak with, that marvail when we tell them what Christ is, and hath done and suffered for us, as if they had never hard it before, when yet they sit under our teaching day by day? like Dr. <hi>John White's</hi> Catechumene, that being asked what
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:107958:264"/>
Jesus Christ was? answered that [she did not know; she was never taught so far; but sure enough it is some good thing, or it should never have been put into the Creed.] Would Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> have the Children of all these rebaptized, or not? If yea, then he is more than I for rebaptizing: if not, then how will it follow any more from my judgement that the Children of the unjustifyed must be Rebaptized? I cannot conceive what he can say (without going to the right of remote ancestors, or the Church which is no more for him than for me,) but only that it is the profession of a Dogmatical Faith, and not the Faith it self that is necessary to give this Right. But a man would think that if it be not enough for an evidence in our case of an Analogical Right <hi>Coram Ecclesiâ,</hi> that a man subscribe the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God (of which Mr. <hi>Blake pag.</hi> 143.) then it can be no good evidence in his cause of a Right <hi>Coram Deo &amp; Ecclesiâ,</hi> that a man subscribe or speak that which he never understood: or if his Profession of Dogmatical Faith without the Faith itself be a good Title, then the Profession of a justifying Faith without the Faith it self, may so far serve turn as to justifie the Baptizing, and to prohibite rebaptizing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And to Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> censure (which I will not censure as it deserves) of the Major part by far of the <hi>Worcestershire</hi> combination (as he speakes) whether it be that he know them better than I (which is unlikely when he professeth to conjecture on reports) or whether I be more charitable, or less rigorous in judging of mens sincerity or what ever else makes the difference of our censures, I will be bold to say, that I know not one person of all the <hi>Worcestershire</hi> combination (as he calls them) whom I know to be an unjustified unsanctified person, that I can remember: though I confess I have no small doubts and fears of many: Nay more; I have more hopes than fears, (I mean I rather think that they are truly Godly, than that they are not) of the far greatest part of them that I know, even of many to one; and more comparatively then I will now mention.</p>
            <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth instead of answering cast aside above twenty of my Arguments as not concerning him, and so put them off with a wet finger; I say, that's too easie a way of
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:107958:265"/>
answering to satisfie me, how ever it may do by those that are more easily satisfied? and with a word I shall restore and reen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them, as with a word he puts them by.</p>
            <p>It is one thing to ask, whether the profession of justifying Faith be a duty to all that come to be Baptized? Another, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be so necessary, that they ought not to come nor we to admit them without it? and a third, whether Baptism without it be a Nullity? Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> general assertion did in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sence express the first. And thereupon, because I took his words as he spoke them, he better expoundeth them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that justifying Faith is a duty prerequisite to Baptism, but not such a duty, without which Baptism is Null, or we may not Baptize: and therefore he puts off above twenty Arguments at once, and saith that they make nothing against him. But I restore them all or most at once (though one is enough) by telling him, that they prove that the profession of a Faith that is justifying, must be expected by the Church and found in all that are admitted to Baptism, and that none ought to be Baptized upon the profession of any lower Faith. This they prove: and this is the controversie.</p>
            <p>In conclusion I will add but these two things, (and I should think such two might serve the turn.) 1. Consider when the Right that I denyed is a Promise-right, whether Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> after all his pains do not yield up the cause, when he expresly saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 124. [<hi>So that I conceit no promise of these ordinances made to such a faith, but an actual investiture of every such believer in them.</hi>] What means this if it yield not the cause, and unsay not the rest: if no promise, then no Right by promise, and I seek no more. What is the actual investiture, but actual Baptizing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Lords Supper; and he knows that I did not deny that they actually received it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Me thinks Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and my Reverend Brethren of his minde, that marvail at my maintaining of this cause, should bear some reverence to <hi>Augustine</hi> who so diligently defendeth it. Besides what he saith in <hi>Enchirid. ad Laurent.</hi> cap. 67, 68. he hath a well known treatise purposely on this very subject, or on that doth not considerably differ. There were some voluptuous persons especially at Rome, that kept concubines, and yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:107958:265"/>
to be Believers, and would have been baptized, but would not yet put away their concubines: whereupon when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters denyed them baptism, some lay-men that desired the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the Church, and misunderstood the doctrine of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith only, did plead that because by faith only we are justified, and works are to follow as the fruits of faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these persons upon their believing might be baptized, and afterward they should be dealt with for the reforming of their lives. Whereupon <hi>Augustine</hi> writes that Treatise <hi>de fide &amp; ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> to prove the contrary, that they cannot be justified or saved by any faith but that which works by love, and that they must not be baptized, till they actually put away their Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines and other the like sins, and promise also to forsake them for the future; so that as it was not any presbyters, but lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that, raised this doubt, so both they and <hi>Agustine</hi> seem agreed, that the same faith that is saving is requisite to baptism (or as to the Church, the Profession of it.) And therefore <hi>Austin</hi> thus repeats the occasion in his <hi>Retractions, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 38. <hi>pag.</hi> (Edit. Paris.) [<hi>Missa sunt mihi nonnulla, quae ità distinguerent à bonis operibus Christianorum fidem, ut sine hâc non posse, sine illis autem perveniri suaderetur ad aeternam vitam. Quibus respondens librum scripsi, cujus nomen est, de Fide &amp; Operibus, in quo disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi, non solùm quemadmodum vivere debeant gratiâ Dei regenerati, verùm etiam quales ad lavacrum regenerationis admitti.</hi>] If I cited but a line or leaf you might say I dismembered it, and left behind me the sence, but when the whole book is to this very purpose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no such thing can be said: see especially <hi>cap.</hi> 21. so that if I err, I have no worse a man then <hi>Augustine</hi> to lead me the way.</p>
            <p>As for Mr. <hi>Blak's</hi> impotent accusations of my owning the cause of the Papists, against the Protestant cause in the matter of Justification, because I misliked the by extream opinions of some men; as if all had agreed in these opinions, or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant difference with the Papists in the matter of Justification did lye either only or principally in these, I look upon it as such dealing as must be expected from angry men, and as Children of the same Father do sometime use against one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when they fall out. It was doubtless my sin that I was no
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:107958:266"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of provoking him, as it is his to be carryed to such injustice by his passions, as that and many other passages do contain. But I am confident he forgiveth me, and I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I forgive him, and I am perswaded the Lord whom we most offend, in the abundance of his Grace doth forgive us both. I must confess that when I think I have a call to dispute, I do withall think that I am called to lay open the nakedness of the cause which I oppose to the utmost; and being perswaded that I speak against that which is against God, me thinks if I do not effectually manifest its falshood, I do nothing, whereupon I finde, that what is spoken against the cause is taken as a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the person, and he takes himself to be wounded or wronged by it, when I never touch the person at all: so that if I do but once name the Imposture of a common distinction, Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> comes on, as if <hi>I had called all those learned men cheators or impostors</hi> that use that distinction (between <hi>fides, qua, &amp; quâ</hi>) yea even those that condescended privately to write to me; and so parrallels me with Mr. <hi>Craudon</hi> herein. Mr. <hi>Craudon</hi> spoke of persons, and I speak of distinctions and reasons: Is not this a meer violence, as if it were to raise an <hi>odium,</hi> and set men together by the ears? When I mention the weakness of his own arguing, he tells me, I must not answer a fool according to his folly, and marvails I will set my wit against such a ones. Is not such dealing a sufficient prohibition to dispute? If I shew not the weakness of an Argument I do nothing: If I do, I make the Author a fool. If I shew that an Argument is unsound, or a conclusion false: I make him false; If I shew that some common distinction hath unobservedly deceived many, I make all the Learned that use it impostors, even my friends that privately vouchsafe me their writings. Well I am satisfied, and take the prohibition. This book of Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> I proclaim unanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. These are too hard and unjust terms for me to dispute up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Especially when the main issue of a large volume, must be but to reckon up a Dear and Reverend Brothers mistakes.</p>
            <p>Yet I must confess that the controversies about the object of Justifying Faith (whether Christ as Lord) and the object of
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:107958:266"/>
Baptism, do seem to me of so great weight and use to the Church, to be well discust, that I will not peremptorily resolve against medling so far with his book, if any more judicious do convince me it is my duty.</p>
            <p>But I have run much beyond my first intention: I thought but to give you some reasons, why I should not write any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder to these learned Reverend men Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robertson</hi> or Mr. <hi>Blake:</hi> and giving you my Reasons, I find I have done some of that, which those Reasons were brought against, and from which I intended to excuse myself.</p>
            <p>But having run so far with the other, I shall say the less of Mr. <hi>Robertson</hi>: his dealing with me is like others that have gone before him and do accompany him: and I am now so used to it, that I the less marvail at it. Of this zealous <hi>Brutus</hi> I must needs say. <hi>Nescio quid juvenis iste vult; sed quicquid vult, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter vult.</hi> Its enough to make us admire Gods patience and mercy, that will forbear and pardon such things to the Sons of men; and its a sad discovery of the lamentable case of the Church on earth, that Grace should have so much corruption with it, and that the Church must make use of such sinful guides as we are, in the way to glory. For though the Scripture saith that a false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that telleth Lyes shall not escape; and that Railors shall not enter into the kingdom of God; yet I hope they may have Grace that do it in a mistaken zeal for God, though Self may have too much hand in it. But we may see in our miscarriages that it is not for nothing that God hath let loose such Judgements upon Professors, and such floods of reproach upon us our selves that serve at his Altar, as lately he hath done. I dare say that many a Heathen would have scorned to have given out against his greatest Enemy such volumes of notorious impudent falshoods and imprudent railings as Mr. <hi>Robertson,</hi> and other of his spirit have lately done against one that was none of their enemy. Might I but have truth from them, I care not (for my own part) for the worst of their words. But who knows how to confute such volumes, whose very substance is compounded of gross falshoods and calumnies: Either the Reader of Mr. <hi>Robertsons</hi>
               <pb n="506" facs="tcp:107958:267"/>
Book, and his associates, will also read mine, or they will not. If they will not, let them take their course, and believe what they list, and not what is true: for how can I help it, if I write again what likelyhood that they will read it, that will not read that which is written already. If they lose by it no more then I, what cause have I to care? But if they will but read the book which Mr. <hi>Robertson</hi> opens his mouth against, I desire no more; if that will not satisfie them, and make them lament over the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this man, I have no more to say to them, they are none of the men for whom I write. But Mr. <hi>Robertson</hi> hath little cause to say that I am for Justification by Works, when I hope that such men as he are justified, whose works are such, as I once hoped no man had been so guilty of, that had the least fear of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes. I profess I marvail whats the matter that the wasps of the Nation are gathered about my ears, I cannot but hope yet, that there are few more such in <hi>England,</hi> as those that I have had to deal with.</p>
            <p>His first assault of me is about the Inception of Gods imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent acts. But never had I such a confuter before; no not Mr. <hi>Craudon</hi> himself. He bestows a whole Epistle, (on part of his book) to tell the Reader how he detests my Blasphemy: and thats my confutation. Not a line of my Book doth he cite and confute. But in general tells me that I affirm new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent acts in God: and then cryes out upon the blasphemy. Must we write confutations of such men as these? No: they that will believe them, let them take that they get by it; its nothing to me, that cannot remedy it. What if twenty men will swear that I have written there is no God? must I write against them all? I laid down my mind in the case that I am thus dealt with about, in several propositions as plain as I could speak: the sum of the chief part of them was this; that the substance of the Act (as commonly called) that is the Essence of God, is neither multiplyed nor beginneth nor endeth; but the Relations and extrinsick denominations are many, and may begin and end. Yet would I not presume to determine (with <hi>Pet. Hertado. de Mendoza</hi> and others) that the Relations are <hi>ex parte Dei,</hi> but only took what the Thomists grant that they are <hi>ex parte creatura,</hi> whence arise the denominations of God; and

doth not this Brother know that the highest <hi>Antiarminians</hi> on earth do grant this, and none that I know of did ever deny it. Yet doth this judicious Pedagogue, (before he understandeth what I have said, and while Dr. <hi>Kendal</hi> himself contradicteth him in print) fall on with such words as these, pag. 7. [<q>I never did abhor with greater detestation and indignation the Principles of any man, and the defence of them than I did that one most blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Principle of yours and your defence of it about the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent acts of God in his knowledge and will as if they were or could be <hi>de novo,</hi> &amp;c.</q>] All the rest is but to prepare the way for this sentence; and to attend it, and this is his Epistle.</p>
            <p>And that you may see what impossibility there is of pleasing all men, see what he saith of my Apologie against Mr <hi>Blake,</hi> which cost so much on the other side; p. 4, 5. [<q>Though in the first three or four hours reading that morning, of the first part, of your Apologie to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> I was very much taken with so much of a profound, deep &amp; rational Judgement, with such a clear and solid understanding, &amp; with so great a height of a piercing wit, as I did apprehend in some of your reasonings &amp; explications of some points by you holden forth there, &amp;c.</q>] And so he goes on to shew that in the afternoons Reading against Dr. <hi>Kendall,</hi> I struck down all the milk that I had given in the morning. Many men, many minds. Even fair fall you Sir, for I see you are a kind man when the fit comes on you; and when I please you, your commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons swell over the banks of common discretion. But what shall I give you to make Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> of your opinion? Or to teach me how I may please you both, with the rest of the offended?</p>
            <p>Another part of Mr. <hi>Robertson</hi>'s task, is to satisfie the world how ignorant Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> and I are of the Hebrew, and careless of it aswel as ignorant. <q>And I may undo the man if I should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him here: for he hath bound himself in a most solemn Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, <hi>p.</hi> 82. that if he [do not make it good what here is chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, against all the four eyes of us both, (that both of us have no eies at all to see with of our own, &amp; therefore see nothing at all with our own eye in those points, but all the dim sight we have, its only by seeing with other mens eyes, &amp;c.) then he promises to shut &amp; turn away both his own eyes from ever looking upon a book again whilest he breaths, even the Bible it self, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> yet he would not do for a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:107958:268"/>
or his Life.</q>] And should I be so unmerciful now as to confute this man, if I could do it? No, let Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what he hath done in doing it himself. He hath left him under little less then a solemn Vow, never to read the Bible or any Book more. Doth not this man think himself very wise in his zeal? [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.] Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> saith, he had read over the Hebre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Bible before Mr. <hi>Robertson</hi> was born.</p>
            <p>And is it not (think you) an honest and sober dispute upon which he brings out his Hebrew, when I had so fully explained myself in my Confession, of which he is pleased to take no notice? I still maintain that Punishment properly so called, hath (at least) two <hi>species,</hi> Paradeigmatical and strictly Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive, and Nouthetical or Castigatory: and so that Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is truly and properly called punishment; but not of the same <hi>species,</hi> with the former vindictive or destructive punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now what doth this Learned Brother but over and over again, so far lay by the ninth Commandement and the fear of God, as to face down me, and assure his Reader, that I affirm and maintain the sufferings of the Godly to be not only Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but proper Punishments, yea Revenging Punishments for the satisfaction of God as a Judge? And what should one say to such a man as this? and how is he to be dealt with? Proper Punishments (I say) they are; because I maintain that Castigations are proper paternal punishments. And are not all the Philosophers that ever defined punishment, (so far as I know) agreed in it? But is this to say, They are vindictive, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to Justice, or more than chastisements?</p>
            <p>If this good man would have made ostentation of his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, or called for Scholars to his School, let any indifferent man be Judge, whether it had not been a more innocent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest course to have done as the Montebanks and Lozenge-makers do, to have put it into some weekly News-book, that in such a street, at such a sign, there is a famous Hebrew School-master, &amp;c. than to do he knows not what? For Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> and me
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:107958:268"/>
the matter's not great: but he trode under foot Modesty, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, Truth, the Credit of his Profession, the famous Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Bible (egregiously befriending <hi>Gregory Martin</hi> and his Rhemists): and I wish he have not degraded the far greater part of the godly Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> for want of Hebrew as well as us: Nay how many can he name from the Apostles daies, till a few hundred years ago, that are not degraded by him, in almost all the Church. The <hi>Origens</hi> and <hi>Hieroms</hi> were so few, that wo to the Church if it had no more: And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be in it to cut the comb of a <hi>Paedagogues</hi> insolency, that those that were best at Translations, were so bad Divines for all that, as to the sense. We had been sure all marrd if the degraded <hi>Augustines</hi> that were ignorant of the Hebrew, had not been better Divines than <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> were. But what! hath God bid or permitted this man to speak all this for nought? No: I hope that some will be stirred up by his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to a more diligent study of the Hebrew Text; and that this good end may by the over-ruling providence be attained by it.</p>
            <p>But me thinks he should not trust so much to his great Argument, that [<hi>he is unworthy to be Christs Messenger that takes the signification of the words upon trust:</hi>] For how doth Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertson</hi> with all his Hebrew know the signification of one Hebrew word, but upon trust? How knows he it, but on the word of his Master that tells him so? and what other way is there of knowing the signification of any Language whatsoever?</p>
            <p>As for that about [Mental Remission] which he makes such a stir with, I shall add this to what is said. There are two things among men that are called by some <hi>Mental</hi> Remission: 1. A pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to forgive a fault, (even before it is committed) when it is done. 2. The actual turning of the minde from Anger and thoughts of Punishing, to Reconciliation and Acceptance, and the Remitting those former thoughts of Punishment. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is not properly pardon at all, and is in God from Eternity. The latter is not properly in God at all: For he changeth not his minde, nor Remitteth any Punishing, Purpose, or secret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, or thoughts which he had before: and if he did, that
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:107958:269"/>
would not dissolve the Guilt, that is, the obligation to Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without an outgoing word from God. But yet after the manner of weak man this last sort of Mental Pardon, may from the Effect to the Affect be ascribed Denominatively, to God: But then as it is but Denominatively, so that Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination must then begin, when the Law of Grace or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise doth Pardon and Absolve, for then only doth the ground of that Denomination begin, though nothing Real do begin in God.</p>
            <p>And it is worth the noting also, how angerly this man doth tell us, that neither Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> nor any that ever was taught or Catechized understandingly in the Church, will deny, or is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of this kinde of Pardon or Justification in Law-sense which we maintain? And yet that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of any such thing to this day, but disputeth confidently against that, which we are so chidden by Mr. <hi>Robertson</hi> for ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that any well Catechized will deny. Again tell me, what a man should do to be of every learned good mans minde, or to escape their censures?</p>
            <p>And as these Brethren deal in the Press, so do some others privately by words and Manuscripts. The last week I received a creeping Paper, against my directions for Peace of Conscience, written by a Minister about the midway between Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and me (Though a Neighbour; I know not that I ever heard his name before, but once about 16 years ago;) who with the spirit and pen of Mr. <hi>Robertson</hi> and his like, doth furiously fall on me, to conjure out of me the Devil of Pelagianism; because I say to doubting souls, that, [<hi>If Christ be not yet theirs, he maybe when they will</hi>] or [<hi>they may have him when they will</hi>:] whereupon to his Councils and Fathers he goes against Free-will. This is a Minister of the Gospel: and yet knows not that this is a Truth that almost all the world of Christians are agreed on; and that <hi>Austine</hi> purposely defendeth; and if it be not true, what a case is the world in? And his Reproaches are cast in the face of the Scripture that saith the same, [<hi>Whoever will, let him take the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Life freely,</hi> Rev. 22.17.] And Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> maintains it at large, that <hi>velle Credere</hi> is <hi>Credere</hi>: but doubtless <hi>velle Christum
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:107958:269"/>
oblatum</hi> is a great act of saving Faith. And this man might read that I add withall, as <hi>Austine</hi> doth, that, Though whoever will have Christ as offered may have him, yet no man will so have him, but by the work of special Grace. But is it not a sad case, when the Preachers of the Gospel shall defame and reproach the very substance of the Gospel, as zealously as if mens salvation lay upon it?</p>
            <p>I have given you now (I think) reasons enough to excuse me from wording it with such inconsiderate men. To which I will add one other: I am conscious of so much frailty in my self, that I am likely to be drawn also to injure some of them: And also, I am not able to speak so cautelously, but some words will be very liable to misunderstanding, on which they may plausibly fasten their accusations. To give you one instance: In the Preface to my Confession, I noted a sort of empty men that will not speak to men, nor give them any reasons to convince them, but only se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly behind their backs, will carry it abroad that such or such a man is erroneous, half an Arminian, a dangerous man: and if they speak to us, we shall hear but these general charges of Error: To these I said, I might expect they should be more Judicious, studied, impartial, illuminate, sincere, or at lest the chief of these, before I should value their bare Judgements and Censures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Reasons: professing withall that as I doubted not but there are multitudes of Labourers in Gods harvest, with whom in these respects I am unworthy to be named, so the Judgement of these I would value; that is, so far as to suspect anything which they are against, and silence it at least, till Evidence be very cogent. So that I never mentioned the Qualifications of men that <hi>write</hi> or <hi>dispute</hi> against me, but only of those that <hi>look I should be swayed by their Censures without Arguments.</hi> This was my very mind, of which I desire you to observe the words themselves. But no where doth Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> so take me up as here; mistakingly supposing that I spoke of those that should Write or Argue against me; and that I require all these Qualifications in them. No, I will hear Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from a Childe, but I will not be swayed by the Judgement and Censures of a Childe. Yet here the one of them talks of
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:107958:270"/>
the <hi>terrible conditions that I impose upon my Answerer</hi>; and the other (Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>) comes on with intimations, as if my words implyed that I take my self for more judicious, experienced, holy, &amp;c. than all those from whom I manifest my dissent, the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and I know not how many, (feigning me do dissent from men even contrary to my profession.) These answers will seem as good to Readers that will not by collation make trial, as if they were as good as any.</p>
            <p>So will his citations out of the Fathers; when among the several points in difference I desired one line from one Ancient to prove that his opinion was ever known to the ancient Church: and for one of them (the instrumental efficacy of Faith to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification) he doth perform it at large: but how? By a bare citation of Passages from others gathered up, and that without the words, and that only affirming that we are justified by Faith and not by Works: So that if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> bring testmonies of the Ancients sense, that [<hi>we are Justified by Faith and not by Works,</hi>] he will take these as testimonies that the Ancients speak for the <hi>Instrumental Efficiency of Faith in Justification.</hi> And by such consequences he may make them say many things more, that they never said indeed. But we have shewed him a <hi>tertium,</hi> another sense in which a man may be said to be justified by Faith without Works. Sure I am that if I should maintain [such a Justification by Faith without Works] as many of those Fathers whom he quote's do assert, (in terms and sense,) even in the words before and after and in the places cited, I should be more clamorously called a Papist than yet I have been, at least there were more shew of reason for it.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the very naming of untrue Reports and Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, would be offensive to the guilty. As <hi>pag.</hi> 664. he saith that I say [<hi>Obedience is (only) the modification of Faith in the first act of Justification,</hi>] when I never spoke or thought such a thing, but deny it to be existent (as its distinct from Faith) in that first act of Justification.</p>
            <p>So <hi>pag.</hi> 453. he affirmeth, that [<hi>in my opinion (an infant) is uncapable of any real change by the spirit</hi>] With many such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions, which I never uttered, nor believed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="513" facs="tcp:107958:270"/>And when I told him of such a passage in his former Book, (about <hi>making Sincerity the Rule)</hi> rather then he will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the visible mistake, he again replyeth, as if I wronged him to charge it on him. And why so? Because he named me not? when yet it is as plainly manifest that its me that he chargeth it on, as the rest before and after, which he denyeth not. But again I must recall my self, and draw to an end.</p>
            <p>Upon all these considerations I must be excused from the foresaid unprofitable Works: But if it appear necessary to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate any particular Truth in another way, I shall not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, while I am able to do it. As I find that the very Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men doth provoke, so when the Cause of God doth not require it, I can believe that I am among those that are to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.9. not contradicting or answering again, as servants must be to their Masters; much less should I <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, but imitate that blessed pattern, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. which O that I could more do!</p>
            <p>Yet would I not disswade any from a necessary Defence of Truth: for I know that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and that we must <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>But for my part, I see not yet any Call to such a Work: and if I err, I desire that no man by me may be drawn into Error; and if I be in the right, I know not how to importune men to my opinions, if they do not very nearly concern their salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: If their stomacks be against them, I am not good at drench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or cramming. The Lord pardon all our miscarriages, and direct you and succeed you in your labours for his Church. I remain,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the review I observe that the mixture of some passages of some late Papists, with the judgement of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the most, doth make <hi>pag.</hi> 50, 51 of the second <hi>Disput.</hi> less clear. To remove the obscurity observe, that there are divers Questions conjoyned: 1. What is necessary to make a man a true Member of the Catholick Church? And in that they mostly agree with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> as cited, that no inward grace is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Question is, what is the Common effect of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism on all that Receive it? And that they say, is the imprinting of a certain Character on the mind. What this Character is, they are not agreed: commonly they think either as <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that it is a certain qualitative power reducible to the second <hi>species</hi> of quality, that is, a spiritual power <hi>ordinata ad ea quae sunt Divini cultus, ut</hi> 3. <hi>Qu.</hi> 93. <hi>ar.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> Or as <hi>Durandus</hi> and many others of them, that it is but a Relation; or as <hi>Estius</hi> and others, that it is such a moral power as is <hi>Jus Civitatis,</hi> and so is a power of receiving the common priviledges of the Church. All the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: But if they should <hi>fictè recipere</hi> as to the Sacrament it self, they receive not so much as the Character; nay, saith <hi>Aquinas,</hi> are to be Baptized again when they Repent. But the grace of
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:107958:273"/>
justification, and Remission of sin, they say is not common to all that are Baptized; but only to those that are duely disposed for Baptism. Saith <hi>Aquinas.</hi> 3. <hi>Qu.</hi> 63. <hi>ar.</hi> 3. <hi>c. Character pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priè est signaculum quoddam quo aliquid insignitur, &amp;c.

So that let them come never so sinfully to it, yet it puts them in a fair way to justification. <hi>(vid Viguerium cap.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>fol.</hi> 154.) And it hath this advantage that the grace is delible, but the Character indelible. Now those Papists that I spoke of in the place I refer to (<hi>pag.</hi> 50.51.) do think that all should come to Baptism, that have but an historical Belief of the points, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary, that so they may receive this Character, and then they have the Church-Priviledges, which being unbaptized they have not: and though yet they have not Charity or Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, yet when by Pennance they are brought to the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they wanted the foregoing Baptism will be effectual to do away all the sins that were at the time of Baptism: &amp; Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance will put away the rest that were since committed. Though yet <hi>quoad officium</hi> they say that men ought to come to Baptism with the due preparations. These requisites they say are, I. A Right belief, say some, explicite of the Essentials, and implicite of the rest: say others, it must be <hi>rectae fides saltem in communi, ut scilicet Credant quod Ecclesia Credit (Viguer. Just. c.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. §. 1.) 2. That he repent of his forepast life, and die to sin. 3. That he have an intention of Receiving the Sacrament as the Church delivereth it, and Christ hath appointed. And if this intention, and a Right belief be wanting, the party is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized (<hi>Viguerius ubi sup.</hi>) But what this Belief is, and what this Repentance is, they are not all agreed. But though some few may require Contrition, yet their commonest opinion is, that Attrition is a sufficient disposition, together with a <hi>fides informis,</hi> a right Belief without Charity. But yet they require that the will must be towards that Contrition and Charity,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:107958:273"/>
or <hi>fides formata,</hi> which yet it hath not, for it must <hi>amplecti Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptismum &amp; Baptismi effectum,</hi> saith <hi>Thom.</hi> 3. <hi>Qu.</hi> 69. <hi>a.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> that's the common measure: And Charity and Iustification are these effects. So that whoever comes with Attrition and a right Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief without Charity, shall certainly there receive Charity, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, Remission of guilt and punishment <hi>(poenarum sed non poenalitatum)</hi> both <hi>in foro Dei &amp; Ecclesiae, sed non in foro munda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>: And this because that this disposition doth. <hi>ex congruo</hi> merit Justification in the use of Baptism. And for all the rest that come without Attrition or a purpose to leave sin, (and saith <hi>Aquin.</hi> without Belief too. 3. <hi>Qu.</hi> 68. <hi>a.</hi> 8. <hi>c.)</hi> they receive the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which putteth them in so fair a way to Iustification by Pennance as aforesaid, <hi>recedente fictione de debitâ dispositione.</hi> But yet I must say, that it is but few that I hear of, or read of, that will say that wicked men may come to Baptism for these advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages: But the most Learned of them conclude that no man ought to come that hath not a purpose to forsake all his mortal sins, at least, and that they are not to be Baptized that profess not this; and that others get into the Church <hi>praeter intentionem Ecclesiae</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith: so that in this, the chief of their Doctors own the cause that I maintain. <hi>Aquin.</hi> 3. <hi>Qu.</hi> 68. <hi>ar.</hi> 4. doth purposely dispute it, <hi>Vtrùm peccatores sint Baptizandi?</hi> And resolves it negatively, that though <hi>Peccator, quoad reatum,</hi> may be Baptized; yet not <hi>Peccator ex voluntate peccandi &amp; proposito persistendi in peccato:</hi> &amp; he gives three good Reasons. 1. Because such are unmeet to be incorporated into Christ, which Baptism doth. 2. Because Baptism with them cannot attain its end, to take away their sin: and in the works of God and the Church nothing must be done in vain, or that cannot reach the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted end. 3. Because else there would be falshood in the sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal signs, which must not be.

Add also what <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith <hi>sup. Qu.</hi> 2. <hi>a.</hi> 3. <hi>c.

               <hi>Per fidem applicatur nobis passio Christi ad percipiendum fructum ipsius— Fides autem per quam à peccato mundamur non est fides informis, quae potest esse etiam cum peccato; sed est fides formata per Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, ut sic passio Christi nobis applicetur, non solùm quantum ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectum sed etiam quantum ad effectum.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Yet I know they here confound themselves by their sophistry, telling us that Contrition is before Charity materially, and after it effectively, and that <hi>Contritio se habet ut ultima dispositio ad gratiam consequendam</hi>; and that <hi>Poenitentia quae est sacramentum,</hi> is before <hi>Poenitentia q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> est virtus,</hi> and is the instrument of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting it; as though a dissembling Ceremony, or false profession would work grace; so that there is no hold of them, at the best; for they have lost themselves in contradictions. I know also that they make the Sacrament of Baptism to justifie and sanctifie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly all Infants that are offered by the Church, on their allowed Titles, let the Parent be never so bad; because they think the Churches Faith may serve instead of the Parents, as the Churches Intention may serve instead both of the Ministers (saith <hi>Aquinas)</hi> and the Infants; yea and the Church it self need not lend an Infant any Contrition: for they are agreed, that neither other mens sins, nor our own Original sin (which is all
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:107958:274"/>
that the Infant hath) are the Object of Contrition; but only our own actual sin.</p>
            <p>Yet one would think that the ordinary doctrine, that the <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum vel propositum</hi> may save without Baptism, should imply that before Baptism the desires of it are supposed to have Charity or special Grace: The Roman Catechism saith, <hi>Par.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 142. <hi>Baptismi suscipiendi propositum atque consilium, &amp; malae acta vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>enitentia, satis futura sit ad gratiam &amp; justitiam, si repentinus aliquis Casus impediat, quò minùs solutari aquâ ablui possint.</hi>] And they confess that none can be saved without Charity; therefore those that die before Baptism must be supposed to have Charity.</p>
            <p>But ordinarily they make Attrition sufficient, and by the Sacrament give to the attrite, justification; and so Charity is conferred: And thus by an outward act a man that hath but common grace may get special grace. Yea if they Counterfeit Attrition it self, yet they receive the foresaid indelible Character which gives them the <hi>jura Ecclesiae,</hi> and as the Roman Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism saith, <hi>Par.</hi> 2. <hi>qu.</hi> 19. <hi>pag.</hi> 125. by this Character, <hi>ad alia sacramenta percipienda redduntur idonei</hi>: And then the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, at least by the help of Attrition, will sure justifie and save them. And thus they make a common grace sufficient to let them into the Church by Baptism, yea the meer Baptism it self without any grace at all; and so make their Character and Church-state the way to justification; which is the thing I charge them with, <hi>Pag.</hi> 50, 51.</p>
            <p>And those that do seem exceedingly to comfort and encourage their proselytes, by telling them of the certain efficacy of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and that they surely put away all sin and guilt &amp; open heaven to them, so that one would think there were assurance of Salvation or exceeding comfort reached forth; yet they take it all away again, and do but Tantalize and delude the people. For they that (with us) require <hi>Contrition</hi> before the Sacrament, do withall tell us, that no man can know by any ordinary means (but only by Revelation) whether he be Contrite or not, and consequently, whether he shall be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, pardoned, or saved ever the more for all the Sacraments: And those that take up with <hi>Attrition,</hi> do both confound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:107958:275"/>
and their followers with their many degrees of Attrition, and quarrels about it, and also assure them that they cannot know whether they have the necessary degree; and so after all Sacraments, they cannot tell whether they be justified.</p>
            <p>This much I thought meet to add, for further explication of the Papists doctrine, and the state of our Controversies with them herein.

            <head>The second Postscript.</head>
            <p>SInce the foregoing Disputations were Printed off, I had occasion to observe, how much some lay the stress of their cause on the supposition of <hi>Judas</hi> his receiving the Lords Supper; And thereupon apprehended, that such would think my foregoing answer to the Objection to be too short. I have thought meet therefore to add these few words for the enlargement of it.</p>
            <p>The example of <hi>Judas</hi> is urged to several ends: 1. Some urge it to prove that such as <hi>Judas,</hi> yea known wicked men may not be kept away from the Sacrament. 2. Some urge it to prove that such may not be excommunicate. 3. Also it may be urged, to prove that it is not as a sign of the thing professed, that we are to require profession, but simply for it self: because Christ know that <hi>Judas</hi> was an hypocrite. 4 And it will be urged by others to prove that such as <hi>Judas</hi> have a Right <hi>coram Deo</hi> to the Sacrament which may warrant their demanding and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it.</p>
            <p>I shall first prove that if <hi>Judas</hi> had received the Sacrament, it would not warrant any one of these conclusions, and then I shall prove that <hi>Judas</hi> did not receive the Sacrament: or at least, that it is a thing that no man can prove, and that the contrary is much more probable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And (to begin with the last) that it proveth not <hi>Iudas</hi> right I prove thus. 1. If <hi>Iudas</hi> had such a right to the Sacrament, then Christ could not have denyed it him, or excluded him: For he may not deny him his right: But that Christ might nor haved denyed it him or excluded him, I have met with none that do affirm.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If <hi>Iudas</hi> his right be hence proved, either it is from
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:107958:276"/>
Christs delivering the Sacrament to him, or from his permitting him to take it; but from neither of these: therefore.</p>
            <p>Not from Christs delivery: 1. Because he only offered it, and that in its true Sacramental Nature, and to its proper ends, and propoundeth both internal and external duties to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in their order: He offereth himself to the soul, by the representation and under the signs of bread and wine. He offereth not bread and wine alone to any without himself as signified and represented by him. If he say to <hi>Judas</hi> [take me as thy Saviour and a sacrifice for sin, and in token thereof, take, eat and drink this.] He doth not hereby give him any true right before God, to take the bread and wine without taking Christ. For Christ is first to be taken by believing, and this duty is first in the command, and the bread and wine is not to be taken but in signification, that thus we take Christ, and if we do not so, our taking the bread and wine is a lye. Now if Christ offer himself first, and the elements as signs, and require <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> to take himself first and the elements but as signs; then if <hi>Iudas</hi> will separate what God hath conjoyned, and will take the sign and not the thing signified, and will by this taking the sign profess that he taketh the thing signified when he doth not; this giveth him no right before God to the sign alone, no more than it warranteth him to make a lying profession: nor is there any shew of such a thing. An offer is but a Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Gift, and not an Actuall; and therefore giveth no actuall right till the Condition be performed: The Condition is Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance. The Acceptance must be according to the offer. 1. Of the whole gift, (Christ and the signs) and not of the shell only 2. Of the thing signified first, and of the sign but consequentially. He therefore that takes the sign alone, takes that which this offer giveth him no right to.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Moreover, Christ did not offer it to <hi>Iudas</hi> particularly; but to the Disciples in general; not applying it to each one, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to themselves to make the application, as is granted and past doubt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And as Christs offer proved not <hi>Iudas</hi> right, so neither did his Permission of his Reception. For Permission gives no Title. All the sins of the world are permitted physically, which
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:107958:276"/>
makes them not to be no sin. And for a Morall permission, <hi>Iudas</hi> had none. To permit, is <hi>non impedire,</hi> not to hinder. Hinderance is morall by Prohibition. Thus <hi>Iudas</hi> was hindered: For God had a standing Law against lying and dissembling. 2. Or it is Physical, by Natural means: And thus <hi>Iudas</hi> was not hindred, either from Receiving what he received, or from betraying his Master: but it justified neither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But at least, <hi>Iudas</hi> had right to that standing in the Church, by which he was numbered with those to whom the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was to be offered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It will not prove that he had any proper right (by promise or grant which might warrant his claim) to Church-membership, or Apostleship it self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Christ chose him, and called him, and sent him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Christs Choosing him, was no more but his Calling him out of many that were passed by. His Calling him was not either to Preach, 1. Only. 2. Or in the first place. But it was first to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him and so to preach that which he did believe. If he had answered Christs call, he had done both: But if he will preach what he believeth not, he doth no more answer Christs call, than if he should speak a lye, or dissemble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But when Christ knew that he believed not, yet he sent him to preach.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Never to preach before or without believing. Though Christ knew that he did not actually believe, yet he knew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that he lay under the Command and Obligation to believe, and that in order before preaching.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And for the next Conclusion, it cannot be proved by the Example of <hi>Iudas</hi> that we must take a Profession simply for it self, and not respectively as a sign of the thing Professed; and so that we must admit a man upon a Profession which is known to us to be false. For, if you argue from Christs exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and say, [Christ did so, therefore we must do so] I deny both the Antecedent and the Consequence. 1. As to the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent: Christ Commanded and Required <hi>Iudas</hi> his Profession as a sign of his mind and so of the thing professed; that is, as True<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And he neither Required nor Accepted any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: But only he Permitted him to remain in his famil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:107958:277"/>
though his profession was false, and not such as he required. 2. As to the Consequence: No man therefore can hence ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that we may Require or Accept a profession which is not a sign (apparent) of the thing professed; for that Christ did not; nor yet that we must permit a known false professor because Christ did. But this will be proved under the next points to which it leads us. The other two depending on the same grounds may be dispatcht together. And so I conclude, that it cannot be gathered from the example of <hi>Judas,</hi> that we must not excommunicate, or keep from the Lords Table, such as we can prove to the Church to be unregenerate, or to be such as <hi>Judas</hi> was. For 1. There may be Reasons to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the performance of that which ordinarily is to be done. And so Christ had special Reasons to forbear the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of <hi>Judas,</hi> till the last, because he was to be the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his suffering, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. When we are sure that we have as good a Reason to suspend an act of discipline, yet that will not be an excuse for our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary suspense, or a Rule for our ordinary practice. 2. The Lord Jesus would have Ministers lye under a double obligation, for their safe proceeding: The one is, to take seeming Believers and Penitent persons into the Church and to the Sacraments: The other is to take a Credible Profession for the Evidence of that Faith and Repentance. And accordingly he would teach us no more by his example. And therefore no wonder if he did not excommunicate <hi>Judas</hi> or keep him from the Sacrament: for it was by his Divine heart-searching power, and omniscience that Christ knew <hi>Judas</hi> to be an hypocrite: while he made a Profession that was Probable or Credible to a meer man. All therefore that can hence be gathered is, that if by heart-search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing omniscience we knew a man to be an Hypocrite, we might not keep him back or excommunicate him: and yet that will not be proved from the Text neither; till you can prove that Christ might not have cast out <hi>Judas,</hi> as well as that he did not; for, as is said, he might forbear him for some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Cause; Though I grant that on other grounds it may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be proved, that we might not do it, because we cannot communicate our evidence to the Church. But there is no place
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:107958:277"/>
for this arguing, till men are omniscient. Christ is our pattern as he acteth as a man, and not when he exerciseth Divine omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Christ knew what was in man, and need not that any man should tell him, <hi>John</hi> 2.25. And yet he questioned with men in humane Language; he asketh some whether they believed, and <hi>Peter,</hi> whether he loved him? Did he expect an answer from men, for the bare words sake? or as a sign of their mind? Did he oblige them to a true answer, or to a false? The case is not doubtfull. And if by his omniscience he knew that many of these answers were lyes, (and yet he silently permitted the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer to seem a Disciple) it will not hence follow, that we must accept a profession simply for it self, and when it is not credible, that is, that we must believe a known lye, or that we must use those that we have no cause to believe as if we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And if their Argument were of any strength, it would not only prove that we must keep in the Church, and admit to the Sacrament those that we know to have the Devil in them, and to be Traytors to Christ, contriving the destruction of his Church (as <hi>Judas</hi> did of his person) and to be Thieves and Deceivers (as Christ knew <hi>Judas</hi> to be,) and so overthrow all Church Discipline, contrary to the Scripture Laws; but also that it is not Lawfull for a Master to put a known Thief and Traytor out of his Family, or to prohibit him familiarity with him at his Table, and dipping his morsels with him in the same dish. For Christ did this by <hi>Judas</hi> as well as the other. But it is contrary to <hi>Psalm</hi> 15. and 101. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. and many other Texts that we should hold such famila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with such men. But that we may not lawfully do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, is a Doctrine that I hope no wise Christian Ruler of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily will believe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The state of Christs Church being then but in gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ordering, was not so ripe for the execution of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication as after his Resurrection, and the ordering of the Churches.</p>
            <p>But though I have said all this on the supposition that Christ did give the Sacrament to <hi>Judas</hi>; yet I shall now proceed
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:107958:278"/>
to shew, that [<hi>it is either certain that</hi> Judas <hi>did not receive it, or not probable that he did.</hi>]</p>
            <p>My evidence is this, 1. There is the Concurrent Testimony of three Evangelists, that may assure us that <hi>Judas</hi> went out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacrament. <hi>Matthew</hi> dispatcheth Christs speeches to <hi>Judas</hi> before the Sacrament, and to those that remained and did partake of it, he saith, 1. That he will drink of the fruit of the Vine with them new in the Kingdom of his Father; which he neither did after his Resurrection, nor will do with <hi>Judas.</hi> 2. Its said, they went into the Mount of Olives: but so did not <hi>Judas.</hi> 3. He saith, all ye shall be offended because of me this night: But <hi>Judas</hi> was none of those All.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Mark</hi> doth punctually agree with <hi>Matthew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. doth clear both the other. For <hi>ver.</hi> 30. he saith that <hi>Judas</hi> having received the Sop, went immediately out. Now it is utterly improbable that this Sop was after the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Though it be controverted whether the meat which they then eat besides the Paschal Lamb, were before it, or after it, yet there's evidence enough that it was before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I know a Reverend Divine of ours in his Harmony of the Evangelists, thinks that the Supper <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. was not the same with that <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. and <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. When the Sacrament was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted. But his Reasons seem not cogent to me, but may well be answered; and there seems to be much evidence of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in the Text, (to say nothing of the singularity of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.) And as for the coincident controversies, whether Christ did eat a Supper without the Paschal Lamb, at the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his Sacrament, as <hi>Grotius</hi> thought, or whether he did eat the Paschal Lamb a day before the Jews, as <hi>Causabone, Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Capellus,</hi> &amp;c. think, Or on the same day with the Jews, as <hi>Baronius, Tolet, Clopenburgius,</hi> and the said Reverend Doctor think, I shall not need on this occasion to enquire; especially so much being written on it already. See <hi>Paul Burgens.</hi> in <hi>Lyr.</hi> and what <hi>Iansenius comment.</hi> hath <hi>ex Euthymio</hi> and other Greeks on that side: and the Testimony of <hi>Philo</hi> in <hi>Cappellus,</hi> and his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are considerable.</p>
            <p>The ancient Doctors were disagreed among themselves upon
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:107958:278"/>
the Question whether <hi>Iudas</hi> did partake of the Sacrament. Its commonly known that <hi>Hilary</hi> was for the Negative. And (saith <hi>Estius</hi> in <hi>differ. loc.</hi> in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.) <hi>Clemens</hi> in <hi>constit. Apostol.</hi> and <hi>Dionysius Arcopag.</hi> are of the same mind with others: And whoever were the Authors of those writings, the antiquity in this case is considerable. And of the many Doctors that are thought to be on the other side, some speak only <hi>de participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Coenae</hi>; and shew not that they mean the Sacrament, and some ground their opinion on a palpable error, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Sop given to <hi>Iudas</hi> was the Sacramental Bread: And <hi>Pellargus</hi> (in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.) saith that <hi>Theophylact</hi> mentioneth a Tradition, that <hi>Iudas</hi> took the Bread with him to the Priests, and said [see here, my Master saith, this is his body] and <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press against <hi>Iudas</hi> Receiving, and <hi>Ammonius, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Tacianus</hi> in their Harmonies seem to be against it; and <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact</hi> saith, divers were of that mind. <hi>Rupertus Tuitiensis</hi> is plain and large on it, as you may see in the Author in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. or in <hi>Musculus Loc. commun. pag. (mihi</hi>) 829. <hi>de Coen.</hi> where his words are cited at large.</p>
            <p>The Papists and <hi>Lutherans</hi> indeed are most on the other side: but yet they are divided, especially the Papist: Many Learned Protestants of the Reformed party have written large discourses to prove that <hi>Iudas</hi> received not the Sacrament: we have divers common in English: and the beyond sea Divines are many of this mind. <hi>Beza, Grotius, Piscator, Musculus, Deodat,</hi> (five of the most judicious commentators, I think, that ever wrote on the sacred Scriptures,) are against <hi>Iudas</hi> participation, (and <hi>Calvin</hi> thinks it uncertain:) besides <hi>Zanchius, Danaeus, Goma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Tossanus,</hi> and many more that are against it: Though I know that on the other side divers are for it.</p>
            <p>And what is there now on the other side to move us to think it probable that <hi>Iudas</hi> did Receive the Sacrament? The slight conjecture of a late learned Annotator I think not fit to trouble you with. I know but one Argument worth the mentioning or much regarding that is brought: and that is from the order of <hi>Lukes</hi> words, who after the mention of the Sacrament saith, [But behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the Table.] But to this I must say that I confess it moveth me

not to doubt of the matter, considering, 1. that as <hi>Grotius</hi> &amp; other expositors truly note, it is so usual with <hi>Luke</hi> to disregard the Order of things spoken, and to repeat sayings together as one continued speech which were spoken at great distance; and to put that before which was spoken after, and that after which was spoken before: Not by mistake, but because it was the Matter and not the Order that he there purposed to deliver. 2. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is certain that he doth thus even in the matter in hand, for saith <hi>Grotius</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Diversos Christi s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the reason of <hi>Luke</hi>'s men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning this after all, seems to be, because having begun to speak of Christs communicatory Action in the feast, he thought it meet to connex his communication of his Sacrament and so dispatch the history of those communicatory acts together; and then to mention the matter of <hi>Iudas</hi> altogether, though the words were not then spoken. 4.
