            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN Advertisement to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THe Reader is intreated to take notice. That much of this Discours was Written and Printed above two years before the rest: For this cause, in the First and Second Books, he may chance to find some Expressions that by reason of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of time may seem not well to agree with the last: But those having pass'd the Press so long ago, were out of my power of changing them; and therefore I will refer it to his kindness, to do it for me.</p>
            <p>I must also acquaint him, That in the Title of my Book I have taken a liberty, which may be liable to exception: I have call'd it a <hi>History of the Royal Society</hi>; whereas the First Part wholly Treats of the state of the <hi>Ancient Philosophy</hi>; and the Third chiefly contains a Defence and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of <hi>Experimental Knowledge</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:99266:9"/>
General: So that it is only the Second Book that peculiarly describes their Vndertaking. But for my excuse I may allege the Example of many of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> who have often from the Principal Part of their Works given Title to all the rest: In their imitation, though this Book does Treat of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Subjects that are not Historical, yet I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd to name the whole a <hi>History,</hi> because that was the main end of my Design.</p>
            <p>The Style perhaps in which it is written, is lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and more contentious than becomes that purity and shortness which are the chief beauties of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Writings: But the blame of this ought not so much to be laid upon me, as upon the Detractors of so noble an Institution: For their Objections and Cavils against it, did make it necessary for me to write of it, not altogether in the way of a <hi>plain History,</hi> but somtimes of an <hi>Apology.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall here present to the World,<note place="margin">Section 1. <hi>The Preface, and Design of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</hi>
               </note> an Account of the <hi>First Institution</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society</hi>; and of the <hi>Progress,</hi> which they have already made: in hope, that this Learned and Inquisitive Age, will either think their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, worthy of its <hi>Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>; or else will be thereby provok'd, to attempt some <hi>greater Enterprise</hi> (if any such can be found
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99266:10"/>
out) for the Benefit of humane life, by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of <hi>Real Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps this Task, which I have propos'd to my self, will incurr the Censure of many Judicious Men, who may think it an over-hasty, and presumptuous Attempt: and may object to me, that the <hi>History</hi> of an Assembly which begins with so great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, ought not to have been made publique so soon; till We could have produced very many considerable <hi>Experiments,</hi> which they had try'd, and so have given undenyable <hi>Proofs,</hi> of the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of their undertaking.</p>
            <p>In answer to this, I can plead for my self, that what I am here to say, will be far from preventing the labours of others in adorning so worthy a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: and is <hi>premis'd</hi> upon no other account, then as the noblest Buidings are first wont to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in a few <hi>Shadows,</hi> or small <hi>Models:</hi> which are not intended to be equal to the Chief Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture it self, but onely to shew in little, by what <hi>Materials,</hi> with what <hi>Charge,</hi> and by how <hi>many Hands,</hi> that is afterwards to be rais'd. Although therefore, I come to the performance of this work, with much less <hi>deliberation,</hi> and <hi>ability,</hi> then the <hi>weightiness</hi> of it requires: yet, I trust, that the <hi>Greatness</hi> of the <hi>Design</hi> it self, on which I am to speak, and the <hi>zeal</hi> which I have for the <hi>Honour</hi> of our <hi>Nation,</hi> which have been the chief reasons, that have mov'd me to this confidence of writing, will serve to make something for my <hi>Excuse.</hi> For what greater matter can any man desire, about which to employ his thoughts, then the Beginnings of an <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Company,</hi> which has already laid such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Foundations of so much good to <hi>Mankind?</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99266:10"/>
Or, what can be more delightful for an <hi>Englishman</hi> to consider, then that notwithstandng all the late miseries of his Country; it has been able in a short time so well to recover it self: as not onely to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the perfection of its <hi>former</hi> Civility, and Learning, but also to set on foot, a <hi>new</hi> way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Arts, as <hi>Great</hi> and as <hi>Beneficial</hi> (to say no more) as any the wittiest or the happiest Age has ever invented?</p>
            <p>But besides this, I can also add, in my Defence, that though the <hi>Society,</hi> of which I am to write, is not yet four years old, and has been of necessity hitherto chiefly taken up, about <hi>Preparatory Affairs:</hi> yet even in this time, they have not wholly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected their <hi>principal End</hi>; but have had Success, in the tryal of many remarkable things; of which I doubt not, but I shall be able, as I pass along, to give instances enough to satisfie the curiosity of all <hi>sober Inquirers</hi> into Truth. And in short, if for no other end, yet certainly for this, A Relation of their First Original ought to be expos'd to the view of Men: that by laying down, on what course of Discovery they intend to proceed, the <hi>Gentlemen of the Society,</hi> may be more solemnly engag'd, to <hi>prosecute</hi> the same. For now they will not be able, handsomely to draw back, and to forsake such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Intentions: when the World shall have taken notice, that so many prudent men have gone so farr, in a business of this Universal Importance, and have given such undoubted <hi>Pledges,</hi> of many admirable Inventions to follow.</p>

            <p>On the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Last</hi> of these Particulars, it is not needfull that I should long insist: because se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Great Men</hi> have already so much prevented me about them; that there is hardly any thing can be spoken, in which I shall not almost tread in their very <hi>Footsteps.</hi> But yet it is requisite, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be here said to that purpose, though it be onely in <hi>Repetition:</hi> because I perceive, that there is still much prejudice remaining on many mens minds, towards any <hi>now</hi> Discoveries in <hi>Natura</hi> Things.

in my <hi>weak hands,</hi> which were not able fully to prevail, when they were inforc'd by the Eloquence of those <hi>Excellent Men,</hi> who have gone before me in this Argument: But I rather trust to the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Age</hi> it self, wherein I write; which (if I mistake not) is farr more prepar'd to be perswaded to promote such Studies, then any other time that has gone before us.</p>
            <p>And first,<note place="margin">Sect. III. <hi>The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the East.</hi>
               </note> let us observe the Practice of the best, and the civilest Nations, amongst the <hi>Antients</hi>; and a little trace out the course which they followed, to inrich their Countries, by the introducing of <hi>Forein</hi> Arts, or a searching into <hi>New.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is evident, from the universal Testimony of <hi>History,</hi> that all Learning and Civility were deriv'd down to us, from the <hi>Eastern</hi> parts of the World. There it was, that Mankind arose: and there they first discovered the wayes of living, with safety, convenience, and delight. It is but just, that we should attribute the original of <hi>Astronomy, Geometry, Government,</hi> and many sorts of Manufactures, which we now enjoy, to the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians.</hi> And as to them we owe the <hi>Invention</hi>; so from them proceeded the first <hi>Corruption</hi> of knowledge. It was the custom of their Wise men, to wrap up their Observations on Nature, and the Manners of Men, in the dark Shadows of <hi>Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks</hi>; and to conceal them, as sacred <hi>Mysteries,</hi> from the apprehensions of the vulgar. This was a sure way to beget a Reverence in the Peoples Hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>themselves:</hi> but not to advance the true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy of <hi>Nature.</hi> That stands not in need of such Artifices to uphold its credit: but is then most likely
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99266:12"/>
to thrive, when the minds, and labours of men of all Conditions, are join'd to promote it, and when it becomes the care of united Nations.</p>
            <p>Into the <hi>East,</hi> the first Inquisitive Men amongst the <hi>Grecians</hi> traveled: By what they observed there, they ripened their own imperfect Conceptions, and so return'd to teach them at home. And that they might the better insinuate their opinions into their hearers minds, they set them off with the mixture of <hi>Fables,</hi> and the ornaments of <hi>Fancy.</hi> Hence it came to pass, that the first Masters of knowledge amongst them, were as well <hi>Poets,</hi> as <hi>Philosophers:</hi> For <hi>Orpheus, Linus, Musaeus,</hi> and <hi>Homer,</hi> first softned mens natural rudeness, and by the charms of their Numbers, allur'd them to be instructed by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer Doctrines, of <hi>Solon, Thales,</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> This was a course, that was useful at first, when men were to be delightfully deceiv'd to their own good: But perhaps it left some ill influence, on the whole Philosopy of their Successors; and gave the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> occasion ever after of exercising their wit, and their imagination, about the works of Nature, more then was consistent with a sincere Inquiry into them.</p>

               </note>When the fabulous Age was past: <hi>Philosophy</hi> took a little more courage; and ventured more to relye upon its own strength, without the Assistance of <hi>Poetry.</hi> Now they began to gather into Assemblies, and to increase their interest: and, according to the different temper of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> from the <hi>East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern</hi> Nations; so were their Arts propagated in a different way from theirs. The <hi>Greeks,</hi> being of a vigorous, and active humour, establish't their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99266:12"/>
in the <hi>Walks,</hi> and <hi>Porches,</hi> and <hi>Gardens,</hi> and such publick places about their Cities: whereas the Graver, and more reserv'd <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> had confin'd it to their <hi>Temples.</hi>

            <p>In <hi>Greece,</hi> the most considerable (and indeed almost the onely successful) Tryals, that were made in this way, were at <hi>Athens.</hi> The wit of whose Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, was ('tis true) admirably fit, for the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Philosophy into <hi>Method,</hi> and for the adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it with the noblest words; when once it had been before compleated in its substance: But yet their Genius was not so well made, for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going of the first <hi>drudgery</hi> and <hi>burden</hi> of <hi>Observation,</hi> which is needful for the <hi>Beginning</hi> of so difficult a work. This will appear, if we remember, that they were the Masters of the Arts of <hi>Speaking,</hi> to all their Neighbours: and so might well be inclin'd, rather to choose such opinions of Nature, which they might most elegantly express; then such, which were more useful, but could not so well be illustrated by the ornaments of Speech. Besides this, their <hi>City</hi> was the General <hi>Schole,</hi> and Seat of <hi>Education:</hi> and therefore the Epitome's of knowledge best served their turn, to make their Scholars, in a short time, finish the course of their Studies, and go home sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with a belief of their own Proficience, and their Teachers Wisdom. They were also common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as most of the other <hi>Grecians</hi>) men of hot, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and hasty minds: and so lov'd rather to make <hi>sudden</hi> Conclusions, and to convince their hearers by argument; then to <hi>delay</hi> long, before they fixt their judgments; or to attend with sufficient pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the labour of Experiments. But to say no more, they had but a <hi>narrow Territory</hi>; and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of those times, would not allow a very large commerce, with forein Nations: they were much exercis'd in the civil Affairs of their Country: they had almost a perpetual Warr, at home, or abroad: which kinds of busie, and active life, breed men up indeed for great Employments: but not so well for the diligent, private, and severe examination of those little and almost infinite Curiosities, on which the true Philosophy must be founded.</p>

               <note place="margin">Sect. V. <hi>The Original of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Sects.</hi>
               </note>In that City therefore, the knowledge of <hi>Nature</hi> had its Original, before either that of <hi>Discourse,</hi> or of <hi>humane Actions:</hi> but it was quickly forc'd to give way to them Both. For it was not yet come to a sufficient ripeness, in the time of <hi>Socrates.</hi> And he, by the authority of his admirable wit, made all parts of Philosophy to be taken off from a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of encreasing much farther, that they might be immediately serviceable to the affairs of men, and the uses of life. He was one of the first men, that began to draw into some order, the confus'd, and obscure imaginations, of those that went before him: and to make way for the composing of Arts, out of their scattered Observations. All these various Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the vastness of his Soul comprehended in his <hi>casual Disputations:</hi> but after his death they were divided amongst his Followers, according to their several inclinations. From him most of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>Sects</hi> descended: and though every one of them had its different principles, and rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouses: yet they all laid claim to this one common title of being <hi>his Disciples.</hi> By this means, there was a most specious appearance of the increase of Learning: all places were fill'd with Philosophical
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99266:13"/>
disputes: controversies were rais'd: Factions were made: many subtilties of confuting, and defending, were invented: but so insteed of joyning all their strength to overcome the Secrets of Nature (all which would have been little enough, though never so wisely manag'd) they onely did that, which has undone many such great attempts, before they had yet fully conquer'd her; they fell into an open dissension, to which of them, her spoyls did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, at the same time, some few men did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue an earnest, and laborious pursuit, after <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral causes, and effects</hi>: and took that course, which, if it had met with us much incouragement, as the others had, would without question have produc'd extraordinary things. But these Philosophers, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging deap, out of the sight of men; and studying more, how to <hi>conceive</hi> things <hi>aright,</hi> then how to <hi>set off,</hi> and persuade their conceptions, to others; were quickly almost quite overwhelm'd, by the more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and Talkative Sects.</p>
            <p>This was the success of that Famous Age of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Learning,<note place="margin">Sect. VI. <hi>The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy amongst the Romans.</hi>
               </note> in respect of Natural knowledge. They stay'd not for an information sufficient for such a noble Enterprise: They would not suffer their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, to have any share with them, in the honor of performing it: But too suddenly, for present use, they clap'd up an entire Building of Sciences: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not to be wonder'd, if the <hi>hasty Fabrick,</hi> which they rais'd, did not consist of the best ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls.</p>
            <p>But at last with their Empire, their Arts also were transported to <hi>Rome</hi>: the great spirit of their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99266:14"/>
and Philosophers, in course of time, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating into Rhetoricians, and wandring Teachers of the opinions, of their private Sects. Amongst the Romans, the studies of Nature met with little, or no entertainment. They scarce ever dream't of any other way of Philosophy, then only just redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing into New Method, and eloquently translating into their own Language, the Doctrines, which they had receiv'd from the Greeks. And it was a long time too, before even that could obtain any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance amongst them. For, in the first warlick and busie Ages of that State, they onely apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to a severity of Moral vertue; indeavor'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no other skill, then that of the Customes, and Laws of their Country, the Ceremonies of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Arts of Government: esteeming eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that came out of Greece, as an outlandish fashion, which would corrupt the manners of their Youth; and allure them, from that strictness of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline, and Integrity of Life, by which they had inlarg'd the Bounds of their Common-wealth. Till at length their power being increas'd, and their minds a little softned by the Greatness of their commands, and having tasted of the pleasures of the East; they were content too, by degrees, to admit their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy. And yet all the use, that they made of it at last, was onely, either that they might thereby make their speech more plentiful; or else, that when they were at leisure from Civil affairs, they might have that as a companion, and comfort of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements.<note place="margin">Sect.

            </p>
            <p>This was the condition of Philosophy, when the Christian Religion came into the World. That main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99266:14"/>
it self in its first Age, by the innocence, and miracles, and suff'rings of its Founder, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. But after their Deaths, when Christianity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to spread into the farthest Nations, and when the power of working wonders had ceas'd: it was thought necessary, for its increase, that its professors should be able to defend it, against the subtilties of the Hethens; by those same ways of arguing, which were then in use, among the Hethen Philosophers. It was therefore on this account, that the Fathers, and chief Doctors of our Church, apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Peripatetick, and Platonick Sects: But chiefly to the Platonick: Because that seem'd to speak plainer about the Divine Nature; and also, because the sweetness, and powerfulness of <hi>Plato's</hi> Writings, did serve as well to make them popular speakers, as disputers. Having thus provided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against their adversaries, they easily got the victory over them: and though the Idolatrous Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had kept the instruments of disputing, in their own hands, so many hundred years; yet they soon convinc'd them, of the ridiculousness of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, and the purity, and reasonableness of ours.</p>
            <p>But now the Christians having had so good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, against the Religions of the Heathens, by their own weapons; instead of laying them down when they had done, unfortunately fell to manage them one against another. So many subtile brains having been set on work, and warm'd against a Forein enemy: When that was over, and they had nothing else to do (like an Army that returns victorious, and is not presently disbanded) they began to spoyl, and quarrel amongst themselves. Hence that Religion, which at first appear'd so innocent, and peaceable,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99266:15"/>
and fitted for the benefit of humane Society; which consisted in the plain, and direct Rules, of good Life, and Charity, and the Belief in a redemption by one Savior, was miserably divided into a thousand intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate questions, which neither advance true Piety, nor good manners. Hence arose all the Heresies of those times Against these, besides the force of Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Church obtain'd the Arm of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate: and so at last by the help of many General Councils, got them extinguish'd, (if I may say they were extinguish'd, seeing in this age wherein we live, we have seen most of them unhappily reviv'd). But still by his means, there was no knowledge in request, but the Disputative Philosophy. For while things were in this posture, and so many great Wits ingag'd in the heats of controversie: it was not to be expected, that they should look out for further assistance, then the Arts, which were already prepar'd; or that they should make any considerable indeavors, about new inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the tedious tryal of Experiments. Nor can we much blame them for it: seeing in a time of War, every man will rather snatch up that armor which he finds ready made, then stay till men go to the Mine, and digge out new Ore, and refine, and harden it a better way; in hope to have his weapons of a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and nobler Metal at last.</p>
            <p>Nor was that Age unfit for such an enterprise, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the account of these Warrs of the Tongue: But also by reason of the miserable distempers of the civill affairs of the World, about that time: which were chiefly occasion'd by the Roman Armies usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Right of choosing Emperors, and by the invasions of Barbarous Nations, which overwhelm'd the greatest part of <hi>Europe.</hi> Amidst these distractions,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99266:15"/>
it was impossible for any thing of this Nature to have prosper'd: and in so vast in inundation of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, which carri'd away with it the very grown and aged Trees themselves (those parts of Learning which had taken root, so many generations past) it would have been in vain, to have committed any new plants to the ground. Such studies as these, as they must receive incouragement from the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Authority, so they must come up in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full time, when mens minds are at ease, and their imaginations not disturb'd, with the cares of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Lives, and Fortunes.</p>
            <p>To go on therefore with the matter of Fact:<note place="margin">Sect. VIII. <hi>The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy under the Church of</hi> Rome.</note> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left that dismall Bloody Age, we come into a Course of Time, which was indeed farr quieter: But it was like the quiet of the night, which is dark withall. The Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> taking the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the decay of the Roman Empire, had wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it so many privileges, as did at last wholly destroy it: and while it was gasping for life, forc'd it to make what Will, and Testament they pleas'd. Being thus establish'd, and making <hi>Rome,</hi> whose name was still venerable, the Seat of their Dominion, they soon obtain'd a Supremacy over the Western World. Under them for a long space together men lay in a profound sleep. Of the Universal igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of those times; let it suffice to take the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> one of our antient English Historians, who says, That even amongst the Priests themselves, he was a Miracle that could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Latine. Thus they continued; till at last, that Church adopted, and cherish'd, some of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick opinions, which the most ingenious of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99266:16"/>
Moncks, in their solitary, and idle course of life, had lighted upon. This Sect was excellently well made for their turn. For by hovering so much, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Terms, and Notions, it amusd mens minds, in things that had not much difficulty: and so the Laity being kept blind, were forc'd in all things to depend on the Lips of the <hi>Roman Clergy.</hi> From that time, even down to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of all these Countries, imploying themselves, chiefly in arms, and adventures abroad: and the Books of the <hi>antients,</hi> being either destroy'd by the <hi>Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandalls</hi>; or those which escap'd their fury, lying co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with dust in the Libraries of <hi>Monasteries</hi>: few or none regarded any of the Arts of Wit, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, besides the <hi>Church-men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I will take the boldness to say, must needs be very injurious to the increase of <hi>Generall Learning.</hi> For though I shall justly affirm, to the honor of that <hi>sacred profession,</hi> that all knowledge has been more search'd into, and promoted by <hi>them,</hi> then by any other <hi>order</hi> of men, even from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> times, (whose <hi>Priests</hi> in good part invented, or at least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, the Learning of the <hi>East</hi>) down to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age: yet I must also adde, that whenever all the studious spirits of a Nation, have been reduc'd within the Temples walls, that time is naturally ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this danger, of having its Genius more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, on the different opinions in <hi>Religion,</hi> and the Rites of Worship, then on the increase of any other <hi>Science.</hi> Of this I shall give two instances: one, from the <hi>Antients:</hi> the other, from <hi>our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is manifest, that amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> all the men of Letters still appli'd themselves to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of their <hi>Law</hi>: that being the publick way
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99266:16"/>
of preferment, to the highest places of Judicature and Authority in the State. For that many Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were erected, and (as I may call them) <hi>Iudaical Monast'ries</hi> constituted. Hence came all the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations on the Writings of their <hi>Great Lawgiver</hi>: which at last grew so numerous, and various amongst themselves, that <hi>Christ,</hi> when he came, could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find any thing of <hi>Moses his mind,</hi> in all they had writ: But perform'd more himself towards the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the <hi>Law,</hi> in <hi>two Chapters,</hi> then they had done in all their infinite Volumes. But while they were so excessively busie, about such sorts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, the other parts of Learning were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: Little or no footsteps of Philosophy remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amonst them, except onely the memory of that <hi>History of Plants,</hi> which was not written by any of <hi>Aarons</hi> family, but by their <hi>wisest King.</hi>

It cannot without injustice be deny'd, that they were men of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary strength of mind: they had a great quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of imagination, and subtilty of distinguishing: they very well understood the consequence of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions: their natural endowments were excellent: their industry commendable: But they lighted on a wrong path at first, and wanted matter to contrive: and so, like the <hi>Indians,</hi> onely express'd a wonderful
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99266:17"/>
Artifice, in the ordering of the same Feathers in a thousand varities of Figures. I will not insist long on the Barbarousness of their style: though that too might justly be censur'd: for all the <hi>antient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> though they labor'd not to be full, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd in their Speech: yet they always strove to be easie, naturall, and unaffected. <hi>Plato</hi> was allow'd by all to be the chief Master of <hi>speaking,</hi> as well as of <hi>thinking.</hi> And even <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself, whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone these men ador'd, however he has been since us'd by his <hi>Commentators,</hi> was so carefull about his words, that he was esteem'd one of the purest, and most polite Writers of his time. But the want of good Language, not being the <hi>Schole-mens</hi> worst defect, I shall pass it over: and rather stop a little, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the the <hi>matter</hi> itself, and <hi>order</hi> in which they proceeded.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Subjects</hi> about which they were most conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, were either some of those <hi>Arts,</hi> which <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> had drawn into Method, or the more specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive parts of our <hi>Divinity.</hi> These they commonly handled after this fashion. They began with some generall Definitions of the things themselves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their universal Natures: Then divided them into their parts, and drew them out into sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all propositions, which they layd down as Problems: these they controverted on both sides: and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nicities of Arguments, and citations of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, confuted their adversaries, and strengthned their own dictates. But though this Notional Warr had been carry'd on with farr more care, and calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness amongst them, then it was: yet it was never able to do any great good towards the enlargement of knowledge: Because it rely'd on <hi>generall Terms,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:99266:17"/>
which had not much foundation in <hi>Nature</hi>; and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they took no other course, but that of <hi>disputing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this insisting altogether on establish'd <hi>Axioms,</hi> is not the most usefull way, is not only cleer in such airy conceptions, which they manag'd: but also in those things, which lye before every mans observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which belong to the life, and passions, and manners of men; which, one would think, might be sooner reduc'd into standing Rules. As for example: To make a prudent man in the affairs of State, It is not enough, to be well vers'd in all the conclusions, which all the <hi>Politicians</hi> in the World have devis'd, or to be expert in the Nature of Government, and Laws, Obedience, and Rebellion, Peace, and War: Nay rather a man that relyes altogether on such uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal precepts, is almost certain to miscarry. But there must be a sagacity of judgement in particular things: a dexterity in discerning the advantages of occasions: a study of the humour, and interest of the people he is to govern: The same is to be found in <hi>Philosophy</hi>; a thousand fine Argumentations, and Fabricks in the mind, concerning the Nature of <hi>Body, Quantity, Motion,</hi> and the like, if they only hover a-loof, and are not squar'd to particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they may give an empty satisfaction, but no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and rather serve to <hi>swell,</hi> then <hi>fill</hi> the Soul.</p>
            <p>But besides this, the very way of <hi>disputing</hi> itself, and inferring one thing from another alone, is not at all proper for the spreading of knowledge. It serves admirably well indeed, in those Arts, where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between the propositions is necessary, as in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> in which a long train of <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> may be truly collected, from the certainty of the first foundation: But in things of probability onely,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99266:18"/>
it seldom or never happens, that after some little progress, the main subject is not left, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders fall not into other matters, that are nothing to the purpose: For if but one link in the whole chain be loose, they wander farr away, and seldom, or never recover their first ground again. In brief, <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting</hi> is a very good instrument, to sharpen mens wits, and to make them versatil, and wary defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Principles, which they already know: but it can never much augment the <hi>solid substance</hi> of <hi>Science</hi> itself: And me thinks compar'd to <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,</hi> it is like <hi>Exercise</hi> to the Body in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Meat</hi>: For running, walking, wrestling, shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other such active sports, will keep men in health, and breath, and a vigorous temper: but it must be a supply of new food that must make them grow: so it is in this case; much contention, and strife of argument, will serve well to explain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure things, and strengthen the weak, and give a good, sound, masculine colour, to the whole masse of knowledge: But it must be a continued addition of observations, which must nourish, and increase, and give new Blood, and flesh, to the <hi>Arts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>But this has been only hitherto spoken, against the <hi>Method</hi> of the <hi>Schole-men</hi> in General; on sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that they took the best course, that could be in that kind. I shall now come, to weigh that too. For it may easily be prov'd, that those very Theories, on which they built all their subtle webs, were not at all Collected, by a sufficient information from the things themselves. Which if it can be made out, I hope, it will be granted, that the force and vigour of their Wit did more hurt, then good: and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99266:18"/>
onely serv'd to carry them the faster out of the right way, when they were once going. The <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> themselves do all grant, that the first rise of knowledge must be from the <hi>Senses,</hi> and from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of their reports: Well then; how could the <hi>Schole-men</hi> be proper for such a business, who were ty'd by their Cloysterall life, to such a strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of hours, and had seldom any larger prospects of <hi>Nature,</hi> then the Gardens of their <hi>Monasteries?</hi> It is a common observation, that mens studies are various, according to the different courses of life, to which they apply themselves; or the tempers of the places, wherein they live. They who are bred up in <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> where the greatest affairs are manag'd by the violence of popular assemblies, and those govern'd by the most plausible speakers: bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie themselves chiefly about <hi>Eloquence</hi>; they who follow a <hi>Court,</hi> especially intend the ornament of Language, and <hi>Poetry,</hi> and such more delicate Arts, which are usually there in most request: they who retire from humane things, and shut themselves up in a narrow compass, keeping company with a very few, and that too in a solemne way, addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for the most part, to some melancholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, or to <hi>devotion,</hi> and the thoughts of another world. That therefore which was fittest for the <hi>Schole-mens</hi> way of life, we will allow them. But what sorry kinds of Philosophy must they needs produce, when it was a part of their <hi>Religion,</hi> to separate themselves, as much as they could, from the converse of mankind? when they were so farr from being able to discover the secrets of <hi>Nature,</hi> that they had scarce opportunity, to behold enough of its common works? If any shall be inclinable to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99266:19"/>
the directions of such men in Natural things, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then of those, who make it their employment: I shall believe, they will be irrational enough, to think, that a man may draw an exacter Description of <hi>England,</hi> who has never been here, then the most industrious Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> who had travell'd over every part of this Country, for that very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>Whoever shall soberly profess, to be willing to put their shoulders, under the burthen of so great an enterprise, as to represent to mankind, the whole Fabrick, the parts, the causes, the effects of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ought to have their eyes in all parts, and to receive information from every quarter of the earth: they ought to have a constant universall intelligence: all discoveries should be brought to them: the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suries of all former times should be laid open before them: the assistance of the present should be allow'd them: so farr are the narrow conceptions of a few private Writers, in a dark Age, from being equall to so vast a design. There are indeed some opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mind, which may be best perform'd by the simple strength of mens own particular thoughts; such are invention, and judgement, and disposition: For in them a security from noise, leaves the Soul at more liberty, to bring forth, order, and fashion the heap of matter, which had been before supply'd to its use. But there are other works also, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire as much aid, and as many hands, as can be found. And such is this of observation: Which is the great Foundation of Knowledge: Some must gather, some must bring, some separate, some examine: and (to use a Similitude, which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time of the year, and the ripe fields, that lye

before my eyes, suggest to me) it is in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> as in <hi>Husbandry:</hi> Wherein we see, that a few hands will serve to measure out, and fill into sacks, that Corn, which requires very many more laborers, to sow, and reap, and bind, and bring it into the Barn.</p>
            <p>But now it is time for me to dismiss this subtle ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Writers: whom I would not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted so farr, but that they are still esteem'd by some men, the onely Masters of Reason. If they would be content, with any thing less then an Empire in Learning, we would grant them very much. We would permit them to be great, and profound Wits, as <hi>Angelicall,</hi> and <hi>Seraphical,</hi> as they pleas'd: We would commend them, as we are wont to do <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>; we would confess, that they are admirable in comparison of the ignorance of their own Age: And, as Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> of him, we would say of them; that it is to be wonder'd, how they could see so cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then, and we can see no cleerer now: But that they should still be set before us, as the great Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of all Wit, we can never allow. Suppose, that I should grant, that they are most usefull in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies of our <hi>Church,</hi> to defend us against the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, and Schisms of our times: what will thence follow, but that they ought to be confin'd, within their own Bounds, and not be suffer'd to hinder the enlargement of the territories of other <hi>Sciences?</hi> Let them still prevail in the <hi>Scholes,</hi> and let them govern in disputations: But let them not over-spread all sorts of knowledge. That would be as ridiculous, as if, because we see, that Thorns, and Briers, by reason of their sharpness, are fit to stop a gap, and keep out wild Beasts; we should therefore think, they deserv'd to be planted all over every Field.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99266:20"/>
And yet I should not doubt, (if it were not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what improper to the present discourse) to prove, that even in <hi>Divinity</hi> itself, they are not so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as they are reputed to be: and that all, or most of our Religious controversies, may be as well deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by plain reason, and by considerations, which may be fetch'd from the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>mankind,</hi> the Nature of <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>humane Society,</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> itself, as by the multitudes of Authorities, and subtleties of disputes, which have been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in use.</p>

               <note place="margin">Sect X. <hi>The Restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </note>And now I am come to the time within our view, and to the <hi>third great Age</hi> of the <hi>flourishing</hi> of <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Whether this recovery of knowledge did hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by the benefit of <hi>Printing,</hi> invented about that time, which shew'd a very easie way of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mens thoughts one to another? or whether it came from the hatred, which was then generally conceiv'd against the blindness, and stupidity, of the <hi>Roman Fryers?</hi> or from the <hi>Reformation,</hi> which put men upon a stricter inquiry into the Truth of things? whatever the <hi>cause</hi> was, I will not take much pains to determine: But I will rather observe, what kinds of knowledge have most flourish'd upon it. If we compare this <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> with the <hi>two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>; we shall find, that this does far exceed both the other in its extent: there being a much larger plot of ground, sown with Arts, and civility at this time, then either when the <hi>Grecian,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires prevail'd. For then (especially under the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>) so many Nations being united under one <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi> and reduc'd into the Form of <hi>Provinces:</hi> that knowledge which they had was chiefly confin'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99266:20"/>
to the walls of the <hi>Imperial Cities</hi> themselves. But now (not to insist on the Learning of farr remote Countries, of which we have onely imperfect Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but to contract our observation to <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> alone) there being so many different <hi>States,</hi> and <hi>Governments</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> every Country sets up for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: almost in every place, the liberal Arts (as they are call'd) are cherish'd, and publick allowance is made for their support. And in this compass, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit numbers of Wits, which have appear'd so thick for these many years, have been chiefly taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout some of these three studies: either the <hi>Writings</hi> of the <hi>Antients</hi>: or <hi>Controversies</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi> or <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs</hi> of <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The First thing that was undertaken,<note place="margin">Sect. XI. <hi>The Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.</hi>
               </note> was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue the excellent works of former <hi>Writers</hi> from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity. To the better performing of this, many things contributed about that time. Amongst which, as to us in <hi>England,</hi> I may reckon (and that too, it may be, not the least, whatever the action was in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,) the dissolution of <hi>Abbyes:</hi> whereby their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries came forth into the light, and fell into indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Mens hands, who understood how to make more use of them, then their slothfull possessors had done. So that now the <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Tongues began to be in request; and all the ancient Authors, the <hi>Hethen Philosophers, Mathematicians, Orators, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, Poets,</hi> the various Copies, and Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> were produc'd. All these, by the severall Transcriptions, and the ignorance of the Transcribers had very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different readings, and many parts wholly lost; and by the distance of times, and change of customs,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99266:21"/>
were grown obscure. About the interpreting, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, supplying, commenting on these, almost all the first Wits were employed. A work of great use, and for which we ought to esteem our selves much beholding to them. For indeed, if they had not compleated that business, to our hands, we of this age, had not been so much at leisure, as now I hope we are, to prosecute new inventions. If they had not done it, we should: of which we ought not to doubt, seeing we behold, that even now, when the soyl of Criticism is almost quite Barren, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly another Crop will come, yet many Learned men cannot forbear spending their whole labour in toyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about it: what then should we have done, if all those Books had come down untouch'd to our hands?</p>
            <p>We cannot then, with any sobriety, detract from the <hi>Criticks,</hi> and <hi>Philologists,</hi> whose labors we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. But we ought rather to give them this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that they were men of admirable Diligence: and that the Collections, which they have made, out of the Monuments of the <hi>Antients,</hi> will be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully advantageous to us, if the right use be made of them: if they be not set before us, onely that we may spend our whole Lives, in their consideration, and to make the course of Learning more difficult: But if they be imploy'd, to direct us in the ways, that we ought to proceed, in knowledge for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; if by shewing us what has been already finish'd, they point out to us, the most probable means, to accomplish what is behind. For methinks, that wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which they fetch'd from the ashes of the dead, is something of the same nature, with Ashes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: which, if they are kept up in heaps together,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99266:21"/>
will be useless: But if they are scattred upon Living ground, they will make it more fertile, in the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of various sorts of Fruits. To these men then we are beholding, that we have a fairer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect about us: to them we owe, that we are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the times that are gone before us: which to be, is (as <hi>Tully</hi> says) <hi>to be always Children.</hi> All this, and much more, is to be acknowledg'd: But then we shall also desire of them, that they would content themselves, with what is their due: that by what they have discover'd, amongst the rubbish of the <hi>Antients,</hi> they would not contemn the Treasures, either lately found out, or still unknown: and that they would not prefer the <hi>Gold</hi> of <hi>Ophir,</hi> of which now there is no mention, but in Books, before the present Mountains of the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I pass over this sort of <hi>reviv'd Learning.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect XII. <hi>Religious controversies and Arts of Policy.</hi>
               </note> And now there comes into our view another remarkable occasion, of the hinderance of the growth of <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentall Philosophy,</hi> within the compass of this bright Age; and that is the great a-do which has been made, in raising, and confirming, and refuting so many different Sects, and opinions of the <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> For whatever other hurt or good comes, by such holy speculative Warrs (of which whether the benefit or mischief over-weighs, I will not now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine) yet certainly by this means, the knowledge of Nature has been very much retarded. And (to use that Metaphor, which an excellent <hi>Poet</hi> of our Nation, turns to another purpose) that showre has done very much injury by falling on the Sea, for which the Shepherd, and the Plough-man, call'd in vain: The Wit of men has been profusely powr'd out
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99266:22"/>
on <hi>Religion,</hi> which needed not its help, and which was onely thereby made more tempestuous: while it might have been more fruitfully spent, on some parts of Philosophy, which have been hitherto barren, and might soon have been made fertil.</p>
            <p>But besides this, there have been also several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>professions,</hi> which have drawn away the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, from prosecuting the naked, and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed Truth. And of these I shall chiefly name the <hi>affairs</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> the administration of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the execution of Laws. These by their fair dowry of gain, and honor, have always allur'd the greatest part of the men of Art, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to addict themselves to them: while the search into severer knowledge has been lookt on, as a study out of the way, fitter for a melancholy humorist, or a retir'd weak spirit, then to make men equal to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, or serviceable to their Country. And in this, methinks the <hi>Experimental Philosophy</hi> has met with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard usage: For it has commonly in Mens Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, undergone the imputation of those very faults, which it indeavors to correct in the <hi>Verbal.</hi> That indeed may be justly condemn'd for filling mens thoughts, with imaginary Ideas of conceptions, that are no way answerable to the practical ends of Life: But this on the other side (as I shall shortly make out) is the surest guide, against such Notional wandrings: opens our eyes to perceive all the realities of things: and cleers the brain, not onely from darkness, but false, or useless Light. This is certainly so, in the thing it self. But the greatest part of men, have still apprehended the contrary. If they can bring such Inquirers under the scornfull Titles of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> or <hi>Schollars,</hi> or <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> it is enough: They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99266:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conclude them, to be men of another World, onely fit companions for the shadow, and their own melancholy whimsies: looking on those who dig in the Mine of Nature, to be in as bad a condition, as the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spains</hi> slaves in <hi>Peru,</hi> condemn'd for ever to that drudgery, and never to be redeem'd to any other imployment. And is not this a very une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual proceeding? While some over-zealous <hi>Divines</hi> do reprobate Natural Philosophy, as a carnal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a too much minding worldly things: the men of the World, and business on the other side, esteem it meerly as an idle matter of Fancy, and as that which disables us, from taking right measures in humane affairs. Thus by the one party, it is cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd, for stooping too low; by the other, for soar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too high: so that methinks, it is a good ground to conclude, that it is guilty of neither of these faults, seeing it is alike condemn'd by both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams. But I shall have a fitter occasion, to examine this hereafter. However it be, it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, if men have not been very zealous about those studies, which have been so farr remov'd, from present benefit, and from the applause of men. For what should incite them, to bestow their time, and Art, in revealing to mankind, those Mysteries; for which, it may be, they would be onely despis'd at last? How few must there needs be, who will be willing, to be impoverish'd for the common good? which they shall see, all the rewards, which might give life to their Industry, passing by them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd on the deserts of easier studies? and while they for all their pains, and publick spirit, shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perhaps be serv'd as the poor man was in the <hi>Fable</hi>: who, while he went down into the well, in assurance,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99266:23"/>
that he should find a mighty Treasure there, was in the mean time robb'd by his companions, that stay'd above, of his Cloak, and all the Booty that he had before gotten?</p>

                  <hi>The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the Moderns.</hi>
               </note>And yet, notwithstanding all these unfortunate hinderances, there have been many commendable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts in this way, in the compass of our Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the Age before us. And though they have been for the most part carry'd on, by the private Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of some few Men, in the mid'st of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand difficulties, yet it will not be unprofitable to recount some of them: if it were onely to give a fair ground of hope, how much progress may be made by a form'd and Regular <hi>Assembly,</hi> seeing some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle hands, with so small incouragement, could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch so much of the work.</p>
            <p>There are Five <hi>new ways</hi> of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> that come into my observation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sect. XIII. <hi>Modern Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matists.</hi>
               </note>The First is, of those, who, out of a just disdain, that the <hi>Antients</hi> should still possess a Tyranny over our Judgements, began first to put off the reverence, that men had born to their memories; and handling them more familiarly, made an exact survey of their imperfections: But then having rejected them, they pursued their success too far, and straight fell to form and impose new Theories on Mens Reason, with an usurpation, as great as that of the others: An acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which we that live in this Age, may resemble to some things that we have seen acted on the Stage of the World: For we also have beheld the Pretenders to publick Liberty, turn the greatest <hi>Tyrants</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The first part of these mens performance is very much to the prais'd: They have made the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99266:23"/>
ground open, and cleer, for us: they have remov'd the rubbish; which, when one great Fabrick is to be pull'd down, and another to be erected in its stead, is always esteem'd well nigh half the whole work: Their adventure was bold, and hazardous: They touch'd mens minds in their tenderest part, when they strove to pluck off those opinions, which had, by long custom, been so closely twin'd about them: They freed our understandings from the Charms of vain apparitions, and a slavery to dead Mens names. And we may well ghess, that the absolute perfection of the <hi>True Philosophy,</hi> is not now far off, seeing this first great and necessary prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for its coming, is already taken off our hands. For methinks there is an agreement, between the growth of <hi>Learning,</hi> and of <hi>Civil Government.</hi> The Method of the rise and increase of that, was, this. At first in every Country, there prevail'd nothing, but Barbarism, and Rudeness: All places were ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible with <hi>Gyants,</hi> and enchantments, and insolent Usurpers: Against these there first arose some mighty <hi>Heroes,</hi> as <hi>Hercules, Theseus,</hi> and <hi>Iason</hi>: These scowr'd the World, redress'd injuries, destroy'd Monsters: and for this they were made <hi>Demi-gods.</hi> But then they gave over, and it was left to the great Men, who succeeded them, as <hi>Solon,</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the Work, to found Common-wealths, to give Laws, to put Justice in its course: And why may I not now presume (as many others have done before me) to reduce these stories to a Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal sence? First then, the Phantasms, and Fairies, and venerable Images of Antiquity, did long haunt the World: against these we have had our Champions; and without all question, they had the better of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99266:24"/>
cause: and now we have good ground to trust, that these Illusions being well over, the last finishing of this great Work, is nigh at hand, and is reserv'd for this undertaking.</p>
            <p>So then, thus farr they did well. But in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of their Enterprize, they themselves seem to me to have run into the same mistake, for which we chiefly complain'd against those <hi>Antients,</hi> whose Authority they destroy'd. The greatest occasion of our dissenting from the <hi>Greek Philosophers,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from <hi>Aristotle,</hi> was, that they made too much hast to seise on the prize, before they were at the end of the Race: that they fix'd, and determin'd their judgements, on general conclusions too soon, and so could not afterwards alter them, by any new appearances, which might represent themselves. And may we not suppose, that posterity will have the same quarrel at these mens labors? We do not fall foul upon Antiquity, out of any singularity of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or a presumptuous confidence of the strength of our Wits above theirs. We admire the men, but onely dislike the Method of their proceedings. And can we forbear murmuring, if we see our <hi>contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries</hi> disdain them, and yet imitate their failings? If we must constitute a Sovereignty over our Reasons; I know not, why we should not allow this Dominion to the <hi>Antients,</hi> rather then to any one of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns. They are all dead long since: and though we should be over-reach'd by them in some few false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, yet there is no danger, lest they should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease them upon us: whereas, if we once hang on the lips, of the wisest men now Living; we are still in their Power, and under their Discipline, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be led by all their Dictates for the future. It
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99266:24"/>
is true indeed, a diligent <hi>Inquirer</hi> of these times, may gather as much experience, and in probability, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude as rightly, as a whole <hi>Academy,</hi> or Sect of theirs could: yet I shall still deny, that any one Man, though he has the nimblest, and most universal obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, can ever, in the compass of his life, lay up enough knowledge, to suffice all that shall come after him to rest upon, without the help of any new Inquiries.</p>
            <p>And if we suppose the best, that some one Man, by wonderful sagacity, or extraordinary chance, shall light upon the True Principles of Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy: yet what will be the profit, of such uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Demonstrations, if they are onely fitted for talk, and the solving of appearances? Will there be any great matter, whether they are certain, or doubtful; old, or new; if they must be onely boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a systeme, and confin'd to discourse? The True Philosophy must be first of all begun, on a scrupulous, and severe examination of particulars: from them, there may be some general Rules, with great caution drawn: But it must not rest there, nor is that the most difficult part of its course: It must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance those Principles, to the finding out of new effects, through all the varieties of Matter: and so both the courses must proceed orderly together; from experimenting, to Demonstrating, and from demonstrating, to Experimenting again. I hope I shall content my Reader, if I onely give one instance in this case. It is probable, that he, who first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, that all things were order'd in <hi>Nature</hi> by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; went upon a better ground, then any before him. But now if he will onely manage this, by nicely disputing about the Nature, and Causes of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99266:25"/>
               <hi>Motion</hi> in general; and not prosecute it through all particular Bodies: to what will he at last arrive, but onely to a better sort of <hi>Metaphysicks</hi>? And it may be, his Followers, some Ages hence, will divide his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine into as many distinctions, as the <hi>Schole-men</hi> did that of <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>Form:</hi> and so the whole life of it, will also vanish away, into air, and words, as that of theirs has already done.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sect. XIV. <hi>The ill effects of Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi>
               </note>But it is time for me to give over this Argument; in which I fear, that what I have already said, will alarm some excellent men, whose abilities I admire: who may perhaps suspect, that it has bin with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reflexion. I might say for my self, That first they must pass sentence on themselves, before they can think so, seeing I have nam'd no man. But I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sincerely profess, that I had no satyrical Sence, but onely declar'd against <hi>Dogmatists</hi> in general. And I cannot repent my having done it, while I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, there are two very dangerous mischiefs, which are caus'd by that way of Philosophy. The one is, that it makes men give over, and believe that they are satisfi'd, too soon. This is of very ill consequence: For thereby mens industry will be slackned, and all the motives to any farther pursuit taken away. And indeed this is an error, which is very natural to mens minds: they love not a long and a tedious doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though it brings them at last to a real certainty: but they choose rather to conclude presently, then to be long in suspence, though to better purpose. And it is with most mens understandings, as with their eyes; to which those seem the most delightful pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, where varieties of Hills, and Woods, do soon bound their wandrings; then where there is one
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99266:25"/>
large smooth <hi>campagne,</hi> over which they may see much farther, but where there is nothing to delay, and stop, and divert the sight.</p>
            <p>But the other ill effect of which I shall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, is, that it commonly inclines such men, who think themselves already resolv'd, and immoveable in their opinions, to be more imperious, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of contradiction, then becomes the calmness, and unpassionate evenness of the true Philosophical Spirit. It makes them prone to undervalue other mens labours, and to neglect the real advantage, that may be gotten by their assistance; least they should seem to darken their own glory. This is a Temper of mind, of all others the most pernicious; to which I may chiefly attribute the slowness of the increase of knowledge amongst men. For what great things can be expected, if mens understandings shall be (as it were) always in the warlike State of Nature, one against another? if every one be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of anothers inventions, and still ready to put a stop to his conquests? Will there not be the same wild condition in Learning, which had been amongst men, if they had always been dispers'd, still preying upon, and spoiling their neighbors? If that had still continued, no Cities had been built, no Trades found out, no Civility taught: For all these noble produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions came from mens joyning in compacts, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into <hi>Society.</hi> It is a usual saying, that <hi>Where the Natural Philosopher ends, the Physitian must begin:</hi> and I will also add, that <hi>The Natural Philosopher is to begin, where the Moral ends.</hi> It is requisite, that he who goes about such an undertaking, should first know himself, should be well-practis'd in all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, humble, friendly Vertues: should be willing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99266:26"/>
to be taught, and to give way to the Judgement of others. And I dare boldly say, that a plain, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Man, so prepar'd, is more likely to make a good Philosopher, then all the high, earnest, insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Wits, who can neither bear partnership, nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. The <hi>Chymists</hi> lay it down, as a necessary qualification of their happy Man, to whom God will reveal their ador'd <hi>Elixir,</hi> that he must be rather innocent, and vertuous, then knowing. And if I were to form the Character of a True Philosopher, I would be sure to make that the Foundation: Not that I believe, God will bestow any extraordinary Light in Nature, on such men more then others: But upon a bare, rational account: For certainly, such men, whose minds are so soft, so yielding, so complying, so large, are in a far better way, then the Bold, and haughty Assertors: they will pass by nothing, by which they may learn: they will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to receive, and communicate Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: they will not contemn the Fruits of others di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: they will rejoyce, to see mankind benefited, whether it be by themselves, or others.</p>

from ever falling back again into a subjection to one usurping Philosopher. But if their purpose was, to erect those Scholes which they reviv'd, into as abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute a power, as the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> had heretofore: if they strive to make a competition between <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> or <hi>Democritus,</hi> or <hi>Philolaus</hi>: they do not contribute very much, towards the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. For towards that, it is not enough, that the <hi>Tyrant</hi> be chang'd; but the <hi>Tyranny</hi> it self must be wholy taken away.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> sort of <hi>new Philosophers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. XVI. <hi>Modern Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimenters.</hi>
               </note> have been those, who have not onely disagreed from the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,</hi> but have also propos'd to themselves the right course of slow, and sure <hi>Experimenting</hi>: and have prosecuted it as far, as the shortness of their own Lives, or the multiplicity of their other affairs, or the narrowness of their Fortunes, have given them leave. Such as these, we are to expect to be but few: for they must devest themselves of many vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and overcome a thousand false Images, which lye like Monsters in their way, before they can get as far as this. And of these, I shall onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one great Man, who had the true Imagination of the whole extent of this Enterprize, as it is now set on foot; and that is, the <hi>Lord Bacon.</hi> In whose Books there are every where scattered the best argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that can be produc'd for the defence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philosophy; and the best directions, that are needful to promote it. All which he has already adorn'd with so much Art; that if my desires could have prevail'd with some excellent Friends of mine, who engag'd me to this Work: there should have been no other Preface to the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:99266:27"/>
but some of his Writings. But methinks, in this one Man, I do at once find enough occasion, to admire the strength of humane Wit, and to bewail the weakness of a Mortal condition. For is it not wonderful, that he, who had run through all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of that <hi>profession,</hi> which usually takes up mens whole time; who had studied, and practis'd, and govern'd the <hi>Common Law</hi>: who had always liv'd in the crowd, and born the greatest Burden of Civil business: should yet find leisure enough for these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd Studies, to excel all those men, who separate themselves for this very purpose? He was a Man of strong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cleer, and powerful Imaginations: his Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us was searching, and inimitable: and of this I need give no other proof, then his Style it self; which as, for the most part, it describes mens minds, as well as Pictures do their Bodies; so it did his above all men living. The course of it vigorous, and majestical: The Wit Bold, and Familiar: The comparisons fetch'd out of the way, and yet the most easie: in all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing a soul, equally skill'd in Men, and Nature. All this, and much more is true of him: But yet his <hi>Philosophical Works</hi> do shew, that a single, and busie hand can never grasp all this whole Design, of which we treat. His Rules were admirable: yet his <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> not so faithful, as might have been wish'd in many places, he seems rather to take all that comes, then to choose; and to heap, rather, then to register. But I hope this accusation of mine can be no great injury to his Memory; seeing, at the same time, that I say he had not the strength of a thousand men; I do also allow him to have had as much as twenty.</p>

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:99266:27"/>The next Philosophers,<note place="margin">Sect. XVII. <hi>The Chym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists.</hi>
               </note> whom I shall touch upon, are the <hi>Chymists,</hi> who have been more numerous, in this later Age, then ever before. And without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, they have lighted upon the right Instrument of great productions, and alterations: which must for the most part be perform'd by Fire. They may be divided into three rancks: Such, as look after the knowledge of Nature in general: Such, as seek out, and prepare Medicines: and such, as search after riches, by Transmutations, and the great <hi>Elixir.</hi> The two first, have been very successful, in separating, compounding, and changing the parts of things: and in shewing the admirable powers of Nature, in the raising of new consistencies, figures, colors, and vertues of Bodies. And from their labors, the true <hi>Philosophy</hi> is like to receive the noblest Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But the pretensions of the Third kind, are not onely to indow us, with all the benefits of this life, but with Immortality it self. And their success has been as small, as their design was extravagant. Their Writers involve them in such darkness; that I scarce know, which was the greatest task, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand their meaning, or to effect it. And in the chase of the <hi>Philosopher's Stone,</hi> they are so earnest, that they are scarce capable of any other thoughts: so that if an Experiment lye never so little out of their rode, it is free from their discovery: as I have heard of some creatures in <hi>Africk,</hi> which still going a violent pace straight on, and not being able to turn themselves, can never get any prey, but what they meet just in their way. This secret they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute so impetuously, that they believe they see some footsteps of it, in every line of <hi>Moses, Solomon,</hi> or <hi>Virgil.</hi> The truth is, they are downright <hi>Enthusiasts</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:99266:28"/>
about it. And seeing we cast <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> out of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> it self, we shall hardly sure be perswaded, to admit it into Philosophy. It were perhaps a vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, to try to cure such Men of their groundless hopes. It may be they are happier now, as they are. And they would onely cry out with the Man in <hi>Horace,</hi> that their Friends, who had restor'd them to a perfect sense, had murder'd them. But certainly, if they could be brought to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with moderate things, to grow rich by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and not to imagine, they shall gain the <hi>Indies,</hi> out of every <hi>Crucible</hi>: there might be wonderful things expected from them. And of this we have good assurance, by what is come abroad from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers eminent Persons: amongst whom some are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Royal Society.</hi> And, if it were not alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy excellently perform'd by others, I might here speak largely, of the advantages that accrue to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, by the industrious labors of such <hi>Chymists,</hi> as have onely the discreet, and sober flame, and not the wild lightning of the others Brains.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sect XVIII. <hi>Those that have handled particular Subjects.</hi>
               </note>But the last kind, that I shall name, has been of those, who, conscious of humane frailty, and of the vastness of the Design of an <hi>universal Philosophy</hi>; have separated, and chosen out for themselves, some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Subjects, about which to bestow their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. In these, there was less hazard of failing: these by one mans Industry, and constant indeavors, might probably at last be overcome. And indeed they have generally reap'd the fruits of their mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty. I have but one thing to except against some few of them: that they have been sometimes a little too forward to conclude upon <hi>Axioms,</hi> from what
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99266:28"/>
they have found out, in some particular Body. But that is a fault, which ought to be overwhelm'd by their other praises. And I shall boldly affirm, that if all other Philosophical Matters had been as well, and as throughly sifted, as some admirable Men of this Age have manag'd some parts of <hi>Astronomy, Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Anatomy,</hi> &amp;c. there would scarce any burden have remain'd, on the shoulders of our Posterity: But they might have sate quietly down, and injoy'd the pleasure of the true <hi>Speculative</hi> Philosophy, and the profit of the <hi>Practical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all these proceedings, that I have mention'd, there is as much honor to be payd, as can be due to any one single humane Wit: But they must pardon us, if we still prefer the joynt force of many men.</p>
            <p>And now it is much to be wonder'd,<note place="margin">Sect. XIX. <hi>Modern A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademies for Language.</hi>
               </note> that there was never yet such an <hi>Assembly</hi> erected, which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, on some standing constitutions of Experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There have, 'tis true, of late, in many parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> some Gentlemen met together, submitted to Common Laws, and form'd themselves into <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies.</hi> But it has been, for the most part, to a far different purpose: and most of them only aim'd at the smoothing of their Style, and the Language of their Country. Of these, the first arose in <hi>Italy</hi>; where they have since so much abounded, that there was scarce any one great City without one of these <hi>combinations.</hi> But that, which excell'd all the other, and kept it self longer untainted from the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of speech, was the <hi>French Academy</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi> This was compos'd of the noblest Authors of that Nation: and had for its <hi>Founder,</hi> the <hi>Great Cardinal de Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu:</hi> who, amongst all his cares, whereby he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99266:29"/>
and enlarg'd that <hi>Monarchy</hi> so much, did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten refresh himself by directing, and taking an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their progress. And indeed in his own life, he found so great success of this Institution, that he saw the <hi>French Tongue</hi> abundantly purifi'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to take place in the Western World, almost as much, as the <hi>Greek</hi> did of old, when it was the Language of Merchants, Souldiers, Courtiers, and Travellers. But I shall say no more of this <hi>Academy</hi>; that I may not deprive my Reader of the delight of perusing their own <hi>History,</hi> written by <hi>Monsieur de Pelisson</hi>: which is so masculinely, so chastly, and so unaffectedly done, that I can hardly forbear envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>French Nation</hi> this honor: that while the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Royal Society</hi> has so much out-gone their <hi>Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Academy, in the greatness of its undertaking, it should be so far short of them in the abilities of its <hi>Historian.</hi> I have onely this to allege in my excuse; that as they undertook the advancement of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of Speech, so it became their <hi>History,</hi> to have some resemblance to their enterprize: Whereas the intention of ours, being not the Artifice of Words, but a bare knowledge of things; my fault may be esteem'd the less, that I have written of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> without any ornament of <hi>Eloquence.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Sect. XX. <hi>A proposal for erecting an English Academy.</hi>
               </note>I hope now, it will not be thought a vain digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, if I step a little aside, to recommend the forming of such an <hi>Assembly,</hi> to the Gentlemen of our Nation. I know indeed, that the <hi>English Genius</hi> is not so airy, and discoursive, as that of some of our neighbors, but that we generally love to have Reason set out in plain, undeceiving expressions; as much, as they to have it deliver'd with colour, and beauty. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99266:29"/>
this, I understand well enough, that they have one great assistance, to the growth of Oratory, which to us is wanting: that is, that their Nobility live commonly close together in their Cities, and our for the most part scattered in their Country Houses. For the same reason, why our streets are not so well built as theirs, will hold also, for their exceeding us in the Arts of Speech: They prefer the Pleasures of the Town; we, those of the Field: whereas it is from the frequent conversations in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that the Humour, and Wit, and Variety, and Elegance of Language, are chiefly to be fetch'd. But yet, notwithstanding these discouragements, I shall not stick to say: that such a project is now season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be set on foot, and may make a great Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the manner of our Speaking, and Writing. First, the thing itself is no way contemptible. For the purity of Speech, and greatness of Empire have in all Countries, still met together. The <hi>Greeks</hi> spoke best, when they were in their glory of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest: The <hi>Romans</hi> made those times the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of their Wit, when they subdu'd, and gave Laws to to the World: And from thence, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, they declin'd to corruption; as their valour, their prudence, and the honor of their Arms did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay: and at last, did even meet the <hi>Northern Nations</hi> half way in <hi>Barbarism,</hi> a little before they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run by their <hi>Armies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides, if we observe well the <hi>English Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi>; we shall find, that it seems at this time more then others, to require some such aid, to bring it to its last perfection. The Truth is, it has been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a little too carelessly hand led; and I think, has had less labor spent about its polishing, then it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99266:30"/>
Till the time of <hi>King Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth,</hi> there was scarce any man regarded it, but <hi>Chaucer</hi>; and nothing was written in it, which one would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to read twice, but some of his <hi>Poetry.</hi> But then it began to raise it self a little, and to sound tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well. From that Age, down to the beginning of our late <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> it was still fashioning, and beautifying it self. In the Wars themselves (which is a time, wherein all Languages use, if ever, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease by extraordinary degrees; for in such busie, and active times, there arise more new thoughts of men, which must be signifi'd, and varied by new expressions) then I say, it receiv'd many fantastical terms, which were introduc'd by our <hi>Religious Sects</hi>; and many outlandish phrases, which several <hi>Writers,</hi> and <hi>Translators,</hi> in that great hurry, brought in, and made free as they pleas'd, and with all it was inlarg'd by many sound, and necessary Forms, and Idioms, which it before wanted. And now, when mens minds are somewhat settled, their Passions allai'd, and the peace of our Country gives us the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of such diversions: if some sober and judicious Men, would take the whole Mass of our Language into their hands, as they find it, and would set a mark on the ill Words; correct those, which are to be retain'd; admit, and establish the good; and make some emendations in the Accent, and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar: I dare pronounce, that our <hi>Speech</hi> would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrive at as much plenty, as it is capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; and at the greatest smoothness, which its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation from the rough <hi>German</hi> will allow it.</p>
            <p>Nor would I have this new <hi>English Acamedy,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd only to the weighing Words, and Letters: But there may be also greater Works found out for it. By
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99266:30"/>
many signs we may ghess, that the Wits of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not inferior to any other; and that they have an excellent mixture of the Spirit of the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard</hi>: and I am confident, that we only want a few more standing Examples, and a little more familiarity with the Antients, to excel all the Moderns. Now the best means, that can be devis'd to bring that about, is to settle a fixt, and <hi>Impartial Court</hi> of <hi>Eloquence</hi>; according to whose Censure, all Books, or Authors should either stand or fall. And above all, there might be recommended to them one Principal Work, in which we are yet defective; and that is, the compiling of a <hi>History</hi> of our late <hi>Civil Wars.</hi> Of all the labors of mens Wit, and Industry, I scarce know any, that can be more useful to the World, then <hi>Civil History</hi>: if it were written, with that sincerity, and majesty, as it ought to be, as a faithful Idea of humane Actions. And it is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that almost in all civiliz'd Countries, it has been the last thing, that has come to perfection. I may now say, that the <hi>English</hi> can already shew many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious, and worthy Pieces in this kind: But yet, I have some Prophetical imagination in my thoughts, that there is still behind, something Greater, then any we have yet seen, reserv'd for the Glory of this Age. One Reason of this my strong persuasion, is a comparison, that I make, between the condition of our <hi>State,</hi> and that of the <hi>Romans.</hi> They at first writ, in this way, not much better then our <hi>Moncks:</hi> onely Registring in an undigested manner, some few naked Breviaries of their Wars, and Leagues, and Acts, of their City Magistrates. And indeed they advanc'd forward by very slow degrees: For I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that <hi>Tully</hi> somewhere complains, in these
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99266:31"/>
Words: <hi>Historia nonclum latinis literis illustrata.</hi> But it was in the peaceful reign of <hi>Augustus,</hi> after the conclusion of their long Civil Wars, that most of their perfect <hi>Historians</hi> appear'd. And it seems to me, that we may expect the same progress amongst us. There lye now ready in Bank, the most memorable Actions of Twenty years: a Subject of as great Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Variety, as ever pass'd under any Mans hands: the peace which we injoy, gives leisure and incouragement enough: The effects of such a Work would be wonderfully advantageous, to the safety of our Country, and to <hi>His Majesties</hi> Interest: for there can be no better means to preserve his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in obedience for the future, than to give them a full view of the miseries, that attended rebellion. There are onely therefore wanting, for the finishing of so brave an undertaking, the united indeavors of some publick minds, who are conversant both in Letters and business: and if it were appointed to be the labor of one or two men to compose it, and of such an <hi>Assembly,</hi> to revise and correct it, it might certainly challenge all the Writings of past, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Times.</p>
            <p>But I see, I have already transgress'd: For I know it will be thought unadvisedly done, while I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing a weightier Design, to start, and to follow another of less moment. I shall therefore let it pass as an extravagant conceit: only I shall affirm, that the <hi>Royal Society</hi> is so far from being like to put a stop to such a business, that I know many of its Members, who are as able as any others, to assist in the bringing it into practice.</p>
            <p>Thus I have dispatch'd my first general Head; in which, it may be, it was not needful to have stay'd so
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99266:31"/>
long: seeing, I am confident, I have said nothing, but what was before very well known, and what passes about in common discourse.</p>
            <p>I did on purpose omit the <hi>Learned Age</hi> of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect XXI. <hi>The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians.</hi>
               </note> in its proper place: because I was resolv'd, as I came down, to keep my self as neer as I could, within the Bounds of <hi>Christendom.</hi> But I shall now add, concerning them, that their Studies also were principally bent, upon expounding <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the <hi>Greek Physitians.</hi> They were, without question, men of a deep, and subtile Wit: which is a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter that it may be in all Ages has belong'd more justly to the Tempers of the Southern, then of the Northern Countries: of this they have left many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Testimonies behind them; so many, that (if we believe some worthy and industrious Men of our own Nation, who have search'd into their Monuments) they might even almost be compar'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> themselves. But they injoy'd not the light long enough. It brake forth upon the point of their greatest conquests: It mainly consisted, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the Antients: and what they would have done, when they had been weary of them, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell: For that Work was not fully over, before they were darkned by that, which made even <hi>Greece</hi> it self Barbarous, the <hi>Turkish Monarchy.</hi> However, that knowledge, which they had, is the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, because it sprung up, in that part of the World, which has been almost always perversly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. For methinks, that small Spot of Civil Arts, compar'd to their long course of ignorance, before, and after, bears some resemblance with that Country it self; where there are some few little Vallies, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99266:32"/>
Wells, and pleasant Shades of <hi>Palm-Trees</hi>; But those lying in the midst of Deserts, and unpassable Tracts of Sands.</p>

               </note>But now it being a fit time to stop, and breathe a while, and to take a review of the ground, that we have pass'd. It will be here needful for me, to make an Apology for my self, in a matter, which, if it be not before hand remov'd, may chance to be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to mens good opinion of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> it self, as well as of its <hi>Historian.</hi> I fear, that this <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi> will receive disadvantage enough, from my weak management of their cause, in many other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: so that I must not leave them, and my self unjustify'd, in this, wherein we have so much right on our sides. I doubt not then, but it will come into the thoughts of many <hi>Criticks,</hi> (of whom the World is now full) to urge against us, that I have spoken a little too sparingly of the Merits of former Ages; and that this Design seems to be promoted, with a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious intention of disgracing the Merits of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But First, I shall beseech them, calmly to consider; whether they themselves do not more injure those great Men, whom they would make the Masters of our Judgments, by attributing all things to them so absolutely; then we, who do them all the Justice we can, without adoring them? It is always esteemd the greatest mischief, a man can do those whom he loves, to raise mens expectations of them too high, by undue, and impertinent commendations. For thereby not only their enemies, but indifferent men, will be secretly inclin'd to be more watchful over their failings, and to conspire in beating down their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99266:32"/>
Fame. What then can be more dangerous to the honor of Antiquity; then to set its value at such a rate, and to extol it so extravagantly, that it can never be able to bear the tryal, not onely of envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but even of impartial Judges? It is natural to Mens mind, when they perceive others to arrogate more to themselves, then is their share; to deny them even that, which else they would confess to be their Right. And of the Truth of this, we have an instance of far greater concernment, then that which is before us. And that is, in <hi>Religion</hi> it self. For while the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did assume an infallibility, and a sovereign Dominion over our Faith: the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches</hi> did not onely justly refuse to grant them that, but some of them thought themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to forbear all communion with them, and would not give them that respect, which possibly might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to so antient, and so famous a <hi>Church</hi>; and which might still have been allowed it, without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Superstition.</p>
            <p>But to carry this Dispute a little farther: What is this, of which they accuse us? They charge us with immodesty in neglecting the guidance of wiser, and more discerning Men, then our selves. But is not this rather the greatest sign of Modesty, to confess, that we our selves may err, and all mankind besides? To acknowledge the difficulties of Science? and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our minds, to all the least Works of Nature? What kind of behavior do they exact from us in this case? That we should reverence the Footsteps of <hi>Antiquity</hi>? We do it most unanimously. That we should subscribe to their sense, before our own? We are willing, in probabilities; but we cannot, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact: for in them we follow the most antient
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99266:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Author of all others, even <hi>Nature</hi> it self. Would they have us make our eies behold things, at no farther distance, than they saw? That is impossible; seeing we have the advantage of standing upon their shoulders. They say, it is insolence, to prefer our own inventions before those of our <hi>Ancestors.</hi> But do not even they the very same thing themselves, in all the petty matters of life? In the Arts of War, and Government; In the making, and abolishing of Laws; nay even in the fashion of their Cloaths, they differ from them, as their humour, or Fancy leads them. We approach the Antients, as we behold their Tombs, with veneration: but we would not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be confin'd to live in them altogether: nor would (I believe) any of those, who profess to be most addicted to their Memories. They tell us, that in this corruption of Manners, and sloth of Mens Minds, we cannot go beyond those, who search'd so diligently, and concluded so warily before us. But in this they are confuted by every days experience. They object to us <hi>Tradition,</hi> and the consent of all Ages. But do we not yet know the deceitfulness of such Words? Is any man, that is acquainted with the craft of founding <hi>Sects,</hi> or of managing Votes in <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Assemblies,</hi> ignorant, how easie it is to carry things in a violent stream? And when an opinion has once master'd its first opposers, and setled it self in Mens Passions, or Interests: how few there be, that coldly consider, what they admit for a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? So that when they say, that <hi>all Antiquity</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us; 'tis true, in shew, they object to us, the Wisdom of many Ages; but in reality, they onely confront us, with the Authority of a few leading Men. Nay, what if I should say, that this honor for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99266:33"/>
the dead, which such men pretend to, is rather a worshiping of themselves, than of the <hi>Antients</hi>? It may be well prov'd, that they are more in love with their own <hi>Commentaries,</hi> then with the <hi>Texts</hi> of those, whom they seem to make their Oracles: and that they chiefly doat on those Theories, which they themselves have drawn from them: which, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are almost as far distant from the Original mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their <hi>Authors,</hi> as the Positions of the <hi>New Philosophers</hi> themselves.</p>
            <p>But to conclude this Argument (for I am weary of walking in a rode so trodden) I think I am able to confute such men by the practice of those very <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> to whom they stoop so low. Did not they trust themselves, and their own Reasons? Did not they busie themselves in inquiry, make new Arts, establish new Tenents, overthrow the old, and order all things as they pleas'd, without any servile Regard to their Predecessors? The <hi>Grecians</hi> all, or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of them, fetch'd their Learning from <hi>Egypt.</hi> And did they blindly assent to all, that was taught them by the <hi>Priests</hi> of <hi>Isis,</hi> and <hi>Osiris</hi>? If so; then why did they not, together with their Arts, receive all the infinit Idolatries, which their Masters em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd? seeing it is not to be question'd, but the <hi>Egyptians</hi> deliver'd the rites of their Religion to strangers, with as much Solemnity at least, as they did the Mysteries of their <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> or <hi>Philosophy.</hi> Now then, let <hi>Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the rest of their wise Men, be our examples, and we are safe. When they travell'd into the <hi>East,</hi> they collected what was fit for their purpose, and suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Genius of their Country; and left the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities behind them: They brought home some
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99266:34"/>
of their useful Secrets: but still counted their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping a Dog, or an Onion, a Cat, or a Crocodile, ridiculous. And why shall not we be allow'd the same liberty, to distinguish, and choose, what we will follow? Especially, seeing in this, they had a more certain way of being instructed by their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, then we have by them: They were present on the place: They learn'd from the Men themselves, by word of mouth; and so were in a likely course to apprehend all their Precepts aright: whereas we are to take their Doctrines, so many hundred years after their death, from their Books only, where they are for the most part so obscurely express'd, that they are scarce sufficiently understood by the <hi>Grammarians,</hi> and <hi>Linguists</hi> themselves, much less by the <hi>Philosophers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In few words therefore, let such men believe, that we have no thought of detracting from what was good in former times: But, on the contrary, we have a mind to bestow on them, a solid praise, insteed of a great, and an empty. While we are raising new Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations upon Nature, we mean not to abolish the Old, which were well, and judiciously establish'd by them: No more, then a <hi>King,</hi> when he makes a new Coyn of his own, does presently call in that, which bears the Image of his Father: he onely intends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to increase the current Money of his Kingdom, and still permits the one to pass, as well as the other. It is probable enough, that upon a fresh survey, we may find many things true, which they have before asserted: and then will not they receive a greater confirmation, from this our new and severe appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, then from those men, who resign up their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to their Words only? It is the best way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring them, to separate the certain things in them,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99266:34"/>
from the doubtful: For that shews, we are not so much carri'd towards them, by rash affection, as by an unbyass'd Judgement. If we would do them the most right; it is not necessary we should be perfectly like them in all things. There are two principal Ways of preserving the Names of those, that are pass'd: The one, by <hi>Pictures</hi>; the other, by <hi>Children:</hi> The <hi>Pictures</hi> may be so made, that they may far neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er resemble the Original, then <hi>Children</hi> do their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: and yet all Mankind choose rather to keep themselves alive by Children, then by the other. It is best for the <hi>Philosophers</hi> of this Age to imitate the <hi>Antients</hi> as their <hi>Children:</hi> to have their blood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd down to them; but to add a new Complexion, and Life of their own: While those, that indeavor to come neer them in every Line, and Feature, may rather be call'd their dead <hi>Pictures,</hi> or <hi>Statues,</hi> then their <hi>Genuine Off-spring.</hi>

               </note>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus I am, at length, arriv'd at the second Part of my Method, The <hi>Narration</hi> it self. This I shall divide into three Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of Time, according to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Degrees of the <hi>preparation, growth,</hi> and <hi>compleat Constitution</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The First shall consist of the <hi>first occasions</hi> of this Model, and the <hi>Men,</hi> who first devis'd to put it in execution: and shall end, where they began to make it a form'd, and <hi>Regular Assembly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second shall trace out their <hi>first attempts,</hi> till they receiv'd the publick assistance of <hi>Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third shall deliver, what they <hi>have done,</hi> since they were made a <hi>Royal Corporation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may seem perhaps, that in passing through the first of these, I go too far back, and treat of things, that may appear to be of too private, and Domestick concernment, to be spoken in this publick way. But if this <hi>Enterprise,</hi> which is now so well establish'd, shall be hereafter advantageous to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (as I make no scruple to foretel, that it will)
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99266:35"/>
it is but just, that future times should hear the <hi>names,</hi> of its first <hi>Promoters</hi>: That they may be able to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der particular thanks to them, who first conceiv'd it in their minds, and practis'd some little draught of it long ago. And besides, I never yet saw an Historian that was cleer from all Affections: that, it may be, were not so much to be call'd <hi>Integrity,</hi> as a stoical <hi>insensibility</hi>: Nor can I, more then others, resist my inclinations, which strongly force me to mention that, which will be for the honor of that place, where I receiv'd a great part of my Education. It was therefore, some space after the end of the Civil Wars at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in <hi>Dr. Wilkins</hi> his Lodgings, in <hi>Wadham College,</hi> which was then the place of Resort for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and Learned Men, that the first meetings were made, which laid the foundation of all this that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd. The <hi>Vniversity</hi> had, at that time, many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of its own, who had begun a <hi>free way</hi> of reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and was also frequented by some <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> of Philosophical Minds, whom the misfortunes of the Kingdom, and the security and ease of a retirement amongst Gown-men, had drawn thither.</p>
            <p>Their first purpose was no more,<note place="margin">Sect. II. <hi>The Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at</hi> Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</note> then onely the satisfaction of breathing a freer air, and of conversing in quiet one with another, without being ingag'd in the passions, and madness of that dismal Age. And from the Institution of that <hi>Assembly,</hi> it had been enough, if no other advantage had come, but this: That by this means there was a race of yong Men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, against the next Age, whose minds receiving from them, their first Impressions of <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous knowledge,</hi> were invincibly arm'd against all the inchantments of <hi>Enthusiasm.</hi> But what is more, I may
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99266:36"/>
venture to affirm, that it was in good measure, by the influence, which these Gentlemen had over the rest, that the <hi>Vniversity</hi> it self, or at least, any part of its Discipline, and Order, was sav'd from ruine. And from hence we may conclude, that the same Men have now no intention, of sweeping away all the honor of Antiquity in this their new Design: seeing they imploy'd so much of their labor, and prudence, in preserving that <hi>most venerable Seat</hi> of antient Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when their shrinking from its defence, would have been the speediest way to have destroy'd it. For the Truth of this, I dare appeal to all uninteres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed men, who knew the Temper of that place; and especially to those who were my own contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries there: of whom I can name very many, whom the happy restoration of the Kingdom's peace, found as well inclin'd, to serve their <hi>Prince,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> as if they had been bred up in the most prosperous condition of their Country. This was undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so. Nor indeed could it be otherwise: for such <hi>spiritual Frensies,</hi> which did then bear Rule, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver stand long, before a cleer, and a <hi>deep skill</hi> in <hi>Nature.</hi> It is almost impossible, that they, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse much with the subtilty of <hi>things,</hi> should be deluded by such <hi>thick deceits.</hi> There is but one bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter charm in the world, then <hi>Real Philosophy,</hi> to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the impulses of the <hi>false spirit</hi>: and that is, the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed presence, and assistance of the <hi>True.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor were the good effects of this conversation, onely confin'd to <hi>Oxford</hi>: But they have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves known in their printed Works, both in our own, and in the learned Language: which have much conduc'd to the Fame of our Nation <hi>abroad,</hi> and to the spreading of profitable Light, <hi>at home.</hi> This I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99266:36"/>
trust, will be universally acknowledg'd, when I shall have nam'd the Men. The principal, and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of them, were Doctor <hi>Seth Ward,</hi> the present Lord Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> Sir <hi>William Petty,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mathew Wren,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> Dr. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,</hi> Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bathurst,</hi> Dr. <hi>Christopher Wren,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rook:</hi> besides several others, who joyn'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to them, upon occasions. Now I have produc'd their Names, I am a little at a stand, how to deal with them. For, if I should say what they deserve; I fear it would be intepreted flatt'ry, insteed of justice. And yet I have now lying in my sight, the example of an <hi>Elegant Book,</hi> which I have profess'd to admire: whose Author sticks not, to make large Panegyricks, on the Members of that <hi>Assembly,</hi> whose <hi>Relation</hi> he Writes. But this President is not to be follow'd by a <hi>yong Man</hi>; who ought to be more jealous of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick censure, and is not enough confirm'd in the good liking of the world; to think, that he has such a weighty, and difficult work, as the making of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, committed to him. I will therefore pass by their praises in silence; though I believe, that what I might say of them, would be generally confess'd: and that if any ingenuous man, who knows them, or their writings, should contradict me, he would also go neer to gainsay himself, and to retract the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauses, which he had sometime, or other, bestow'd upon them.</p>
            <p>For such a candid, and unpassionate company, as that was, and for such a gloomy season, what could have been a fitter Subject to pitch upon, then <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philosophy?</hi> To have been always tossing about some <hi>Theological question,</hi> would have been, to have made that their private diversion, the excess of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99266:37"/>
which they themselves dislik'd in the publick: To have been eternally musing on <hi>Civil business,</hi> and the distresses of their Country, was too melancholy a reflexion: It was <hi>Nature</hi> alone, which could plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly entertain them, in that estate. The contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of that, draws our minds off from past, or present misfortunes, and makes them conquerers over things, in the greatest publick unhappiness: while the consideration of <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>humane affairs,</hi> may affect us, with a thousand various disquiets; <hi>that</hi> never separates us into mortal Factions; <hi>that</hi> gives us room to differ, without animosity; and permits us, to raise contrary imaginations upon it, without any danger of a <hi>Civil War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>meetings</hi> were as frequent, as their affairs permitted: their proceedings rather by action, then discourse; cheifly attending some particular Trials, in <hi>Chymistry,</hi> or <hi>Mechanicks:</hi> they had no Rules nor Method fix'd: their intention was more, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to each other, their discoveries, which they could make in so narrow a compass, than an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, constant, or regular inquisition. And me thinks, their constitution did bear some resemblance, to the <hi>Academy</hi> lately begun at <hi>Paris</hi>: where they have at last turn'd their thoughts, from <hi>Words,</hi> to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and perhaps in imitation of the <hi>Royal Society.</hi> Their manner likewise, is to assemble in a private house, to reason freely upon the works of Nature; to pass Conjectures, and propose Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, on any Mathematical, or Philosophical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which comes in their way. And this is an Omen, on which I will build some hope, that as they agree with us in what was done at <hi>Oxford,</hi> so they will go on farther, and come by the same degrees, to erect
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99266:37"/>
another <hi>Royal Society</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> I promise for these Gentlemen here (so well I know the generosity of their Design) that they will be most ready to accept their assistance. To them, and to all the Learned World besides, they call for aid. No difference of <hi>Country, Interest,</hi> or profession of <hi>Religion,</hi> will make them backward from taking, or affording help in this enterprize. And indeed all <hi>Europe</hi> at this time, have two general Wars, which they ought in honor to make: The one a <hi>holy,</hi> the other a <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical</hi>: The one against the common Enemy of <hi>Christendom,</hi> the other also against powerful, and barbarous Foes, that have not been fully subdu'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most these six thousand years, <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>False Opinions.</hi> Against these, it becomes us, to go forth in one common expedition: All civil Nations joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Armies</hi> against the one, and their <hi>Reason</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the other; without any petty contentions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout privileges, or precedence.</p>
            <p>Thus they continued without any great Intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,<note place="margin">Sect. III. <hi>Their first meetings at</hi> London.</note> till about the year 1658. But then being call'd away to several parts of the Nation, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est number of them coming to <hi>London,</hi> they usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly met at <hi>Gresham</hi> College, at the <hi>Wednesdays,</hi> and <hi>Thursdays</hi> Lectures of Dr. <hi>Wren,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rook</hi>: where there joyn'd with them several eminent persons of their common acquaintance: The Lord <hi>Viscount Brouncker,</hi> the now Lord <hi>Brereton,</hi> Sir <hi>Paul Neil,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Evelyn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henshaw,</hi> Mr. <hi>Slingsby,</hi> Dr. <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Clark,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ent,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> Dr. <hi>Crone</hi>: and divers other Gentlemen, whose inclinations lay the same way. This Custom was observ'd once, if not twice a week, in Term time; till they were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t'red
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99266:38"/>
by the miserable distractions of that Fatal year; till the continuance of their meetings there might have made them run the hazard of the fate of <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes:</hi> For then the place of their meeting was made a <hi>Quarter</hi> for <hi>Soldiers.</hi> But, (to make hast through those dreadful revolutions, which cannot be beheld upon Paper, without horror; unless we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that they had this one happy effect, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen mens eies to look out for the true Remedy) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this follow'd the <hi>King's</hi> Return; and that, wrought by such an admirable chain of events, that if we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regard the <hi>easiness,</hi> or <hi>speed,</hi> or <hi>blessed issue</hi> of the Work; it seems of it self to contain variety, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure enough, to make recompence, for the whole Twenty years Melancholy, that had gone before. This I leave to another kind of History to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd. It shall suffice my purpose, that Philosophy had its share, in the benefits of that glorious Action: For the <hi>Royal Society</hi> had its beginning in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful pacifick year, 1660. So that, if any conjectures of good Fortune, from extraordinary <hi>Nativities,</hi> hold true; we may presage all happiness to this underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. And I shall here joyn my solemn wishes, that as it began in that time, when our Country was freed from confusion, and slavery: So it may, in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, redeem the minds of Men, from obscurity, uncertainty, and bondage.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sect. IV. <hi>The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Royal Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
               </note>These Gentlemen therefore, finding the hearts of their Countrymen inlarg'd by their Joys, and fitted for any noble Proposition: and meeting with the concurrence of many Worthy Men, who, to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Honor, had follow'd the King in his banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mr. <hi>Erskins,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Moray,</hi> Sir <hi>Gilbert Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:99266:38"/>
&amp;c. began now to imagine some greater thing; and to bring out experimental knowledge, from the <hi>retreats,</hi> in which it had long hid it self, to take its part in the <hi>Triumphs</hi> of that universal Jubilee. And indeed Philosophy did very well deserve that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: having been always Loyal in the worst of times: For though the Kings enemies had gain'd all other advantages; though they had all the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and Fleets, and Ammunitions, and Treasures, and Armies on their side: yet they could never, by all their Victories, bring over the Reason of Men to their Party.</p>
            <p>While they were thus ord'ring their platform; there came forth a Treatise, which very much hasten'd its contrivance: and that was a Proposal by Master <hi>Cowley,</hi> of erecting a Philosophical College. The intent of it was, that in some place neer <hi>London,</hi> there should liberal Salaries be bestow'd, on a competent number of Learned Men, to whom should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the operations of Natural Experiments. This Model was every way practicable: unless perhaps, in two things, he did more consult the generosity of his own mind, than of other mens: the one was the <hi>largeness of the Revenue,</hi> with which he would have his College at first indow'd: the other, that he impos'd on his Operators, a Second task of great pains, the <hi>Education of youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last of these is indeed a matter of great weight: The Reformation of which ought to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously examin'd by prudent Men. For it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Truth, which is commonly said; that there would be need of fewer Laws, and less force to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern Men, if their Minds were rightly inform'd, and set strait, while they were yong, and pliable. But
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99266:39"/>
perhaps this labor is not so proper, for Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to undergo: For it would not only devour too much of their Time: but it would go neer, to make them a little more <hi>magisterial</hi> in Philosophy, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them; by being long accustom'd to command the opinions, and direct the manners, of their Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. And as to the other particular, the large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, which he requir'd to the maintenance of his College: It is evident, that it is so difficult a thing, to draw men in to be willing to divert an antient Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, which had long run in another stream, or to contribute out of their own purses, to the support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any new Design, while it shews nothing but promises, and hopes: that, in such cases, it were (it may be) more advisable, to begin upon a small stock, and so to rise by degrees; then to profess great things at first, and to exact too much benevolence, all in one lump together. However, it was not the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Author's fault, that he thought better of the Age, then it did deserve. His purpose in it was like himself, full of honor, and goodness: most of the other particulars of his draught, the <hi>Royal Society</hi> is now putting in practice.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Second Period of my Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: wherein I promis'd, to give an account of what they did, till they were publickly own'd, incourag'd, and confirm'd by Royal Favor. And I trust, that I shall here produce many things, which will prove their attempts to be worthy of all Mens incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: though what was perform'd in this interval, may be rather styl'd the <hi>Temporary Scaffold</hi> about the building, then the <hi>Frame it self.</hi> But in my entrance upon this Part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being come to the top of the Hill, I begin to tremble, and to apprehend the greatness of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99266:39"/>
my Subject. For I perceive that I have led my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Minds on, by so long, and so confident a Speech, to expect some wonderful Model, which shall far exceed all the former, that I have acknowledg'd to have been imperfect. Now, though this were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally so, as I believe it is; yet I question, how it will look, after it has been disfigur'd by my unskilful hands. But the danger of this ought to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd me in the beginning. It is now too late to look back; and I can only apply my self to that <hi>good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which a <hi>Great Man</hi> has observ'd to be so pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to our <hi>Nation,</hi> that there is scarce an expression to signifie it, in any other Language. To this I must flye for succor, and most affectionately intreat my Countrymen, that they would interpret my fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be onely errors of obedience to some, whose commands, or desires, I could not resist: and that they would take the measure of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> not so much from my lame description of it; as from the honor, and reputation, of many of those Men, of whom it is compos'd.</p>
            <p>I will here, in the first place, contract into few Words,<note place="margin">Sect. V. <hi>A model of their whole design.</hi>
               </note> the whole <hi>summe</hi> of their <hi>Resolutions</hi>; which I shall often have occasion, to touch upon in <hi>parcels.</hi> Their purpose is, in short, to make faithful <hi>Records,</hi> of all the Works of <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Art,</hi> which can come within their reach: that so the present Age, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, may be able to put a mark on the Errors, which have been strengthned by long prescription: to restore the Truths, that have lain neglected: to push on those, which are already known, to more various uses: and to make the way more passable, to what remains unreveal'd. This is the compass of their
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99266:40"/>
Design. And to accomplish this, they have indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd, to separate the knowledge of <hi>Nature,</hi> from the colours of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> the devices of <hi>Fancy,</hi> or the delightful deceit of <hi>Fables.</hi> They have labor'd to inlarge it, from being confin'd to the custody of a few; or from servitude to private interests. They have striven to preserve it from being over-press'd by a confus'd heap of vain, and useless particulars; or from being straitned and bounded too much up by General Doctrines. They have try'd, to put it into a condition of perpetual increasing; by settling an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable correspondence between the hand, and the brain. They have studi'd, to make it, not onely an Enterprise of one season, or of some lucky opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but a business of time; a steddy, a lasting, a popular, an uninterrupted Work. They have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, to free it from the Artifice, and Humors, and Passions of Sects; to render it an Instrument, whereby Mankind may obtain a Dominion over <hi>Things,</hi> and not onely over one anothers <hi>Iudgements.</hi> And lastly, they have begun to establish these Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations in Philosophy, not so much, by any solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Laws, or ostentation of Ceremonies, as by so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Practice, and examples: not, by a glorious pomp of Words; but by the silent, effectual, and unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable Arguments of real Productions.</p>
            <p>This will more fully appear, by what I am to say on these four particulars, which shall make up this part of my Relation, the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of their <hi>Members:</hi> the <hi>manner</hi> of their <hi>Inquiry:</hi> their <hi>weekly Assemblies:</hi> and their <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Registring.</hi>

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>As for what belongs to the <hi>Members</hi> themselves, that are to constitute the <hi>Society:</hi> It is to be noted,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99266:40"/>
that they have freely admitted Men of different Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, Countries, and Professions of Life. This they were oblig'd to do, or else they would come far short of the the largeness of their own Declarations. For they openly profess, not to lay the Foundation of an <hi>English, Scotch, Irish, Popish,</hi> or <hi>Protestant</hi> Philosophy; but a Philosophy of <hi>Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Church of England</hi> ought not to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>They admit Men of all Religions.</hi>
               </note> of this free converse of various Judgments, I shall afterwards manifest at large. For the present, I shall franckly assert; that our <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> will be so far from receiving damage by it; that it were the best way to make them universally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd, if they were oftner brought to be canvas'd amidst all sorts of dissenters. It is dishonorable, to pass a hard Censure on the Religions of all other Countries: It concerns them, to look to the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of their Faith; and it is sufficient for us, to be establish'd in the Truth of our own. But yet this comparison I may modestly make; that there is no one Profession, amidst the several denominations of Christians, that can be expos'd to the search and scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of its adversaries, with so much safety as ours. So equal it is, above all others, to the general Reason of Mankind: such honorable security it provides, both for the liberty of Mens Minds, and for the peace of Government: that if some Mens conceptions were put in practice, that all wise Men should have two Religions; the one, a <hi>publick,</hi> for their conformity with the people; the other, a <hi>private,</hi> to be kept to their own Breasts: I am confident, that most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Men, whatever their first were, would make ours their second, if they were well acquainted with it. Seeing therefore, our Church would be in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99266:41"/>
so fair a probability of gaining very much, by a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent contention, and incounter, with other Sects: It cannot be indanger'd by this Assembly; which proceeds no farther, then to an unprejudic'd mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with them.</p>

               </note>By their <hi>naturalizing</hi> Men of all Countries, they have laid the beginnings of many great advantages for the future. For by this means, they will be able, to settle a <hi>constant Intelligence,</hi> throughout all civil Nations; and make the <hi>Royal Society</hi> the general <hi>Banck,</hi> and Free-port of the World: A policy, which whether it would hold good, in the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> I know not: but sure it will in the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi> We are to overcome the mysteries of all the Works of Nature; and not onely to prosecute such as are confin'd to one Kingdom, or beat upon one shore. We should not then refufe to list all the aids, that will come in, how remote soever. If I could fetch my materials whence I pleas'd, to fashion the <hi>Idea</hi> of a perfect Philosopher: he should not be all of one <hi>clime,</hi> but have the different excellencies of several Countries. First, he should have the <hi>Industry, Activity,</hi> and <hi>Inquisitive humor</hi> of the <hi>Dutch, French, Scotch,</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> in laying the ground Work, the heap of Experiments: And then he should have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the cold, and <hi>circumspect,</hi> and <hi>wary</hi> disposition of the <hi>Italians,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in meditating upon them, before he fully brings them into speculation. All this is scarce ever to be found in one single Man: sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the same Countrymen: It must then be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, as well as it may, by a <hi>Publick Council</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the various dispositions of all these Nations, may be blended together. To this purpose, the <hi>Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> has made no scruple, to receive all inquisitive
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99266:41"/>
strangers of all Countries, into its number. And this they have constantly done, with such peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, that they have not oblig'd them to the charge of contributions: they have always taken care, that some of their Members, should assist them in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting all that pass'd, in their publick Assemblies: and they have freely open'd their Registers to them; thereby inviting them, to communicate forein Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by imparting their own discoveries. This has been often acknowledg'd, by many Learned Men, who have travell'd hither; who have been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to their meetings, and have admir'd the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, the gravity, the plainess, and the calmness of their debates. This they have publish'd to the world: and this has rous'd all our neighbors to fix their eies upon <hi>England.</hi> From hence they expect the great improvements of knowledge will flow: and though, perhaps, they send their <hi>Youth</hi> into other parts, to learn <hi>Fashion,</hi> and <hi>Breeding</hi>: yet their <hi>Men</hi> come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for nobler ends; to be instructed, in the <hi>mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> and the <hi>solid Arts of Life:</hi> which is a matter of as much greater Reputation, as it is more honorable, to teach Philosophers, than Children.</p>
            <p>By their admission of Men of all <hi>professions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions.</hi>
               </note> these <hi>two</hi> Benefits arise: The <hi>one,</hi> that every <hi>Art,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way of life already establish'd, may be secure of receiving no damage by their Counsels. A thing which all new Inventions ought carefully to consult. It is in vain, to declare against the profit of the most, in any change that we would make. We must not always deal with the violent current of popular pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; as they do with the furious <hi>Eager</hi> in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern:</hi> Where the safest way is, to set the head of the Boat directly against its force. But here Men must
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99266:42"/>
follow the shore; wind about leisurably; and insinuate their useful alterations, by soft, and unperceivable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. From the neglect of this Prudence, we often see men of great Wit, to have been overborn by the multitude of their opposers; and to have found all their subtile projects too weak, for custom, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest: While being a little too much heated with a love of their own fancies; they have rais'd to themselves more Enemies than they needed to have done; by defying at once, too many things in use. But here, this danger is very well prevented. For what suspicion can <hi>Divinity, Law,</hi> or <hi>Physick,</hi> or any other course of life have, that they shall be impair'd by these mens labours: when they themselves are as capable of sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting amongst them as any others? Have they not the same security that the whole Nation has for its lives and fortunes? of which this is esteem'd the Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that men of all sorts, and qualities, give their voice in every law that is made in <hi>Parliament.</hi> But the other benefit is, that by this equal Balance of all Professions, there will no one particular of them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh the other, or make the <hi>Oracle</hi> onely speak their <hi>private</hi> sence: which else it were impossible to avoid. It is natural to all Ranks of men, to have some one Darling, upon which their care is chiefly fix'd. If <hi>Mechanicks</hi> alone were to make a Philosophy, they would bring it all into their Shops; and force it wholly to consist of Springs and Wheels, and Weights: if <hi>Physicians,</hi> they would not depart farr from their Art; scarce any thing would be consider'd, besides the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Causes, Signs,</hi> and <hi>Cures</hi> of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases. So much is to be found in Men of all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of that which is call'd <hi>Pedantry</hi> in Scholars: which is nothing else but an obstinate addiction, to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99266:42"/>
the forms of some private life, and not regarding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral things enough. This freedom therefore, which they use, in embracing all assistance, is most advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to them: which is the more remarkable, in that they diligently search out, and join to them, all extraordinary men, though but of ordinary Trades. And that they are likely to continue this comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive temper hereafter, I will shew by one Instance: and it is the recommendation which the <hi>King</hi> himself was pleased to make, of the judicious Author of <hi>the Observations on the Bills of Mortality:</hi> In whose Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it was so farr from being a prejudice, that he was a Shop-keeper of <hi>London</hi>; that His Majesty gave this particular charge to His Society, that if they found any more such Tradesmen, they should be sure to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them all, without any more ado. From hence it may be concluded, what is their inclination towards the manual Arts; by the carefull regard which their <hi>Founder,</hi> and <hi>Patron,</hi> has engag'd them to have, for all sorts of <hi>Mechanick Artists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But,<note place="margin">Sect. VII. <hi>It consists chiefly of Gentlemen.</hi>
               </note> though the <hi>Society</hi> entertains very many men of <hi>particular Professions</hi>; yet the farr greater Number are <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> free, and unconfin'd. By the help of this, there was hopefull Provision made against <hi>two corruptions</hi> of Learning, which have been long com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of, but never remov'd: The <hi>one,</hi> that <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> still degenerates, to consult <hi>present profit</hi> too soon; the <hi>other,</hi> that <hi>Philosophers</hi> have bin always <hi>Masters,</hi> &amp; <hi>Scholars</hi>; some imposing, &amp; all the other submitting; and not as equal observers without dependence.</p>
            <p>The first of these may be call'd, the <hi>marrying of Arts too soon</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of this.</hi>
               </note> and putting them to generation, before they come to be of Age; and has been the cause of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99266:43"/>
much inconvenience. It weakens their strength; It makes an unhappy disproportion in their increase; while not the <hi>best,</hi> but the <hi>most gainfull</hi> of them florish: But above all, it diminishes that very profit for which men strive. It busies them about possessing some petty prize; while Nature it self, with all its mighty Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, slips from them: and so they are serv'd like some foolish Guards; who, while they were earnest in picking up some small Money, that the Prisoner drop'd out of his Pocket, let the Prisoner himself escape, from whom they might have got a great randsom. This is easily declam'd against, but most difficult to be hindred. If any caution will serve, it must be this; to commit the Work to the care of such men, who, by the freedom of their education the plenty of their estates, and the usual generosity of Noble Bloud, may be well suppo'd to be most averse from such sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did considerations.</p>
            <p>The second Error, wich is hereby endeavour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to be remedied, is, that the Seats of Knowledg, have been for the most part heretofore, not <hi>Laboratories,</hi> as they ought to be; but onely <hi>Scholes,</hi> where some have <hi>taught,</hi> and all the rest <hi>subscrib'd.</hi> The conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this are very mischievous. For first, as many <hi>Learners</hi> as there are, so many hands, and brains may still be reckon'd upon, as useless. It being onely the <hi>Master</hi>'s part, to examine, and observe; and the Disciples, to submit with silence, to what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. But besides this, the very inequality of the Titles of <hi>Teachers,</hi> and <hi>Scholars,</hi> does very much sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, and tame mens Spirits, which though it should be proper for Discipline and Education; yet is by no means consistent with a free Philosophical Consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is undoubtedly true; that scarce any man's
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99266:43"/>
mind, is so capable of <hi>thinking strongly,</hi> in the presence of one, whom he <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>reverences</hi>; as he is, when that restraint is taken off. And this is to be found, not only in these weightier matters; but also (to give a lighter instance) in the Arts of <hi>Discourse,</hi> &amp; <hi>raillery</hi> themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For we have often seen men of bold tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that have over-aw'd and govern'd the Wit of most Companies; to have been disturb'd, and dumb, &amp; bashful as children, when some other man has been near, who us'd to out-talk them. Such a kind of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral soveraignty there is, in some mens minds over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: which must needs be farr greater, when it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd by long use &amp; the venerable name of a <hi>Master.</hi> I shall only mention one prejudice more, &amp; that is this; That from this onely teaching, and learning, there does not onely follow a continuance, but an increase of the yoak upon our Reasons. For those who take their opinions from others Rules, are commonly stricter Imposers upon their Scholars, than their own Authors were on them, or than the first Inventors of things themselves are upon others. Whatever the cause of this be; whether the first men are made meek, and gentle, by their long search, and by better understanding all the difficulties of Knowledg; while those that learn afterwards, onely hastily catching things in small <hi>Systems,</hi> are soon satisfy'd, before they have broken their pride, &amp; so become more imperious: or, whether it arises from hence, that the same <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Soul,</hi> which made them bound their thoughts by others Precepts, makes them also <hi>insolent</hi> to their inferiors; as we always find <hi>cowards</hi> the most <hi>cruel:</hi> or whatever other cause may be alleg'd, the observation is certain, that the <hi>successors</hi> are usually more positive, and Tyrannical, than the <hi>beginners</hi> of Sects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:99266:44"/>If then there can be any cure devis'd for this; it must be no other, than to form an <hi>Assembly</hi> at one time, whose privileges shall be the same; whose gain shall be in common; whose <hi>Members</hi> were not brought up at the feet of each other. But after all, even this cannot be free from prevarication in all future Ages. So apt are some to distrust, and others to confide too much in themselves: so much sweetness there is, in leading parties: so much pride, in following a Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: such various artifices there are, to ensnare mens <hi>Passions,</hi> and soon after their <hi>Vnderstandings.</hi> All these hazards, and many more, are to be suppos'd; which it is impossible, for mortal Wit, wholly to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, much less to avoid. But yet we have less ground of jealousie from this Institution, than any other, not only, because they only deal in matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> which are not so easily perverted; but also upon security of the Inclinations of the greatest part of the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> it self. This, I hope, most men will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, and I will take the permission, to say in general of them, that in all <hi>past</hi> and <hi>present</hi> times, I am confident, there can never be shewn, so great a Number of <hi>Contemporaries,</hi> in so narrow a space of the World, that lov'd truth so zealously; sought it so constantly; and upon whose labours, mankind might so freely rely. This I speak, not out of Bravery to <hi>Foreiners</hi> (before whose eyes, I believe this negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Discourse will never appear) but to the learned Men of this <hi>Nation,</hi> who are better Judges of what I say. And this too, I dare affirm, in an <hi>Age,</hi> wherein I expect to be condemn'd of falshood, or partiality, for this Character, which I have given. For so it happens, that we are now arriv'd at that excessive censuring humor, that he who takes upon him to commend any
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99266:44"/>
thing, though never so worthy, will raise to himself farr more Enemies than Friends. And indeed this <hi>sowrness</hi> of <hi>Criticism,</hi> which now bears all down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, is very injurious to the honour of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. For by despising men, for not being absolutely excellent; we keep them from being so: while <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,</hi> join'd with <hi>praises</hi>; and <hi>reproofs,</hi> with <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections</hi>; would quickly bring all things to a higher perfection. But the rudeness of such <hi>Criticks,</hi> I do not so much regard; as the objections of soberer men, who have a real good will to the promotion of this design, and yet may be a little dissatisfy'd in this place. For here especially they may doubt of two things. The first, whether the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> being so numerous as it is, will not in short time be diverted from its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive purpose; seeing there wil be scarce enough men of Philosophical temper always found, to fill it up; and then others will crowd in, who have not the same bent of mind; and so the whole business will insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be made, rather a matter of noise and pomp, than of real benefit? The second, Whether their number being so large, will not afright private men, from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting many profitable secrets to them; lest they should thereby become common, and so they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of the gain, which else they might be sure of, if they kept them to themselvs.</p>
            <p>To the first,<note place="margin">Sect. VIII. <hi>A defence of the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their number.</hi>
               </note> I shall reply, That this scruple is of no force, in respect of <hi>the Age wherein we live.</hi> For now the Genius of <hi>Experimenting</hi> is so much dispers'd, that even in this <hi>Nation,</hi> if there were one, or two more such <hi>Assemblies</hi> settled; there could not be wanting able men enough, to carry them on. All places and corners are now busie, and warm about this Work:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99266:45"/>
and we find many Noble Rarities to be every day given in, not onely by the hands of Learned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd Philosophers; but from the Shops of <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks</hi>; from the Voyages of <hi>Merchants</hi>; from the Ploughs of <hi>Husbandmen</hi>; from the Sports, the Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds, the Parks, the Gardens of <hi>Gentlemen</hi>; the doubt therefore will onely touch <hi>future Ages.</hi> And even for them too, we may securely promise; that they will not, for a long time be barren of a Race of Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive minds, when the way is now so plainly trac'd out before them; when they shall have tasted of these first Fruits, and have been excited by this Example. There was scarce ever yet, any the meanest Sect, or the most contemptible Opinion, that was utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd in its Cradle. Whether they deserv'd to live, or not, they all had their course; some longer, some shorter; according as they could combine with the Interests, or affections, of the Countreys where they began. What reason then have we to bode ill alone to this <hi>Institution</hi>; which is now so earnestly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd; and which, the older it grows, cannot but still appear more inoffensive? If we onely requir'd <hi>perfect Philosophers,</hi> to manage this employment, it were another case. For then I grant it were impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that threescore, or an hundred such should meet in one time. But here it is far otherwise. If we cannot have a sufficient choice of those that are skill'd in all <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>human</hi> things (which was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient definition of a Philosopher) it suffices, if many of them be plain, diligent, and laborious observers: such, who, though they bring not much knowledg, yet bring their hands, and their eyes uncorrupted: such as have not their Brains infected by false Images; and can honestly assist in the <hi>examining,</hi> and <hi>Registring</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:99266:45"/>
what the others represent to their view. It seems strange to me, that men should conspire, to believe all things more perplex'd, and difficult, than indeed they are. This may be shewn in most other matters; but in this particular in hand, it is most evident. Men did generally think, that no man was sit to meddle in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this consequence, but he that had bred himself up in a long course of Discipline for that purpose; that had the habit, the gesture, the look of a Philosopher. Whereas experience on the contrary tells us, that greater things are produc'd, by the <hi>free</hi> way, than the <hi>formal.</hi> This mistake may well be compar'd, to the conceit we had of <hi>Souldiers,</hi> in the beginning of the civil Warrs. None was thought worthy of that name, but he that could shew his wounds, and talk aloud of his exploits in the <hi>Low Countreys.</hi> Whereas the whole business of fighting, was afterwards chiefly perform'd by <hi>untravell'd Gentlemen, raw Citizens,</hi> and <hi>Generals,</hi> that had scarce ever before seen a Battel. But to say no more, it is so farr from being a blemish; that it is rather the excellency of this Institution, that <hi>men of various Studies</hi> are introduc'd. For so there will be always many sincere witnesses standing by, whom self-love wil not persuade to report falsly, nor heat of invention carry to swallow a deceit too soon; as having themselves no hand in the making of the Experiment, but onely in the <hi>Inspection.</hi> So cautious ought men to be, in pronouncing even upon Matters of Fact. The whole care is not to be trusted to <hi>single</hi> men: not to a <hi>Company</hi> all of <hi>one mind</hi>; not to <hi>Philosophers</hi>; not to <hi>devout,</hi> and religious men <hi>alone:</hi> By all these we have been already deluded; even by those whom I last nam'd, who ought most of all to abhorr falshood; of whom yet many have mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99266:46"/>
upon us, infinite Stories, and false Miracles, without any regard to Conscience, or Truth.</p>
            <p>To the second Objection I shall briefly answer; that if all the Authors, or Possessors of extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, should conspire to conceal all, that was in their power, from them; yet the <hi>Method,</hi> which they take, will quickly make abundant reparation for that defect. If they cannot come at Nature in its particular <hi>Streams,</hi> they will have it in the <hi>Fountain.</hi> If they could be shut out from the Closets of <hi>Physicians,</hi> or the Work-houses of <hi>Mechanicks</hi>; yet with the same, or with better sorts of Instruments, on more materials, by more hands, with a more rational light, they would not onely restore again the old Arts, but find out, perhaps, many more of farr greater importance. But I need not lay much tress upon that hope; when there is no question at all, but all, or the greatest part of such <hi>Domestick Receipts,</hi> and Curiosities, will soon flow into this <hi>publick Treasure.</hi> How few secrets have there been, though never so gainful, that have been long conceal'd from the whole World by their <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors?</hi> Were not all the least Arts of life at first pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate? Were not <hi>Watches,</hi> or <hi>Locks,</hi> or <hi>Guns,</hi> or <hi>Printing,</hi> or lately the <hi>Bow-dye,</hi> devis'd by <hi>particular men,</hi> but soon made <hi>common?</hi> If neither <hi>chance,</hi> nor <hi>friendship,</hi> nor <hi>Treachery</hi> of servants, have brought such things out; yet we see <hi>ostentation</hi> alone, to be every day powerful enough to do it. This desire of glory, and to be counted <hi>Authors</hi>; prevails on all, even on many of the dark and reserv'd <hi>Chymists</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: who are ever printing their greatest myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; though indeed they seem to do it, with so much reluctancy, and with a willingness to hide still; which makes their <hi>style</hi> to resemble the <hi>smoak,</hi> in which they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99266:46"/>
deal. Well then, if this disposition be so <hi>universal</hi>; why should we think, that the Inventors, will be only ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and backward to the <hi>Royal Society</hi>? From which they will not only reap the most <hi>solid honor</hi>; but will also receive the strongest assurances, of still retaining the <hi>greatest part of the profit?</hi> But if all this should fail; there still remains a refuge, which will put this whole matter out of dispute: and that is, that the <hi>Royal Society</hi> will be able by degrees, to purchase such extraordinary inventions, which are now close lock'd up in <hi>Cabinets</hi>; and then to bring them into one common Stock, which shall be upon all occasions expos'd to all mens use. This is a most <hi>heroick Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> For by such concealments, there may come very much hurt to mankind. If any certain remedy should be found out against an <hi>Epidemical</hi> disease; if it were suffer'd to be ingross'd by one man, there would be great swarms swept away, which otherwise might be easily sav'd. I shall instance in the <hi>Sweating-Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> The <hi>Medicine</hi> for it was almost infallible: But, before that could be generally publish'd, it had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most dispeopl'd whole Towns. If the same disease should have return'd, it might have been again as destructive, had not the <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> taken care, to set down the particular course of <hi>Physick</hi> for it, in his History of <hi>Henry the Seventh,</hi> and so put it beyond the possibility of any private man's invading it. This ought to be imitated in all other <hi>soveraign cures</hi> of the like nature, to avoid such dreadful casualties. The <hi>Artificers</hi> should reap the common crop of their <hi>Arts:</hi> but the <hi>publick</hi> should still have <hi>Title</hi> to the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous productions. It should be so appointed, as it is in the profits of mens Lands: where the Corn, and Grass, and Timber, and some courser Metals belong to the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99266:47"/>
               <hi>owner:</hi> But the <hi>Royal Mines,</hi> in whose ground soever they are discover'd, are no man's propriety, but still fall to the <hi>Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These therefore are the <hi>Qualities,</hi> which they have principally requir'd, in those, whom they admitted: still reserving to themselves a power of <hi>increasing,</hi> or keeping to their number, as they saw occasion. By this means, they have given assurance of an eternal quietness, and moderation, in their experimental pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress; because they allow themselves to differ in the weightiest matter, even in the <hi>way of Salvation</hi> it self. By this they have taken care, that nothing shall be so remote, as to escape their reach: because some of their <hi>Members</hi> are still scattered abroad, in most of the habitable parts of the Earth. By this, they have provided, that no profitable thing shall seem too mean for their consideration, seeing they have some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, whose life is employ'd about <hi>little</hi> things, as well as <hi>great.</hi> By this they have broken down the partition wall, and made a fair entrance, for <hi>all conditions of men</hi> to engage in these Studies; which were heretofore affrighted from them, by a groundless apprehension of their chargeableness, and difficulty. Thus they have form'd that <hi>Society,</hi> which intends a <hi>Philosophy,</hi> for the use of <hi>Cities,</hi> and not for the retirements of <hi>Schools,</hi> to resemble the <hi>Cities</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: which are compounded of all sorts of men, of the <hi>Gown,</hi> of the <hi>Sword,</hi> of the <hi>Shop,</hi> of the <hi>Field,</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> of the <hi>Sea</hi>; all mutually assisting each other.</p>

               </note> upon which their <hi>Expence</hi> has been hitherto defraid, I can say nothing, that is very <hi>magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent:</hi> seeing they have rely'd upon no more than some small <hi>Admission-money,</hi> and <hi>weekly Contributions</hi> amongst themselves. Such a <hi>Revenue</hi> as this, can make no great sound, nor amount to any <hi>vast summ.</hi> But yet, I shall say this for it, that it was the onely way, which could have been begun, with a security of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, in that condition of things. The <hi>publick Faith</hi> of <hi>Experimental Philosophy,</hi> was not then strong enough, to move Men and Women of all conditions, to bring in their Bracelets and Jewels, towards the carrying of it on. Such affections as those may be rais'd by a mis-guided zeal; but seldom, or never, by calm and unpassionate Reason. It was therefore well ordain'd, that the first Benevolence should come from the <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimenters themselves.</hi> If they had speedily at first call'd for <hi>mighty Treasures</hi>; and said aloud, that their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise requir'd the <hi>Exchequer of a Kingdom</hi>; they would onely have been contemn'd, as vain <hi>Projectors.</hi> So ready is man-kind, to suspect all new undertakings to be Cheats, and <hi>Chimaeraes</hi>; especialy, when they seem <hi>chargeable:</hi> that it may be, many excellent things have been lost by that jealousie. Of this we have a fatal Instance amongst our selves. For it was this fear of being circumvented, that made one of our wisest <hi>Kings</hi> delay <hi>Columbus</hi> too long, when he came with the promise of a <hi>new World:</hi> whereas a little more confidence in his <hi>Art,</hi> and a small charge in furnishing out some few Ships, would have yearly brought all the Silver of the <hi>West-Indies</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> which now arrives at <hi>Sevill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This suspicion, which is so natural to mens breasts,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99266:48"/>
could not any way harm the <hi>Royal Societies</hi> establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: seeing its first claims, and pretensions were so modest. And yet I shall presume to assure the World; that what they shall raise on these mean Foundations, will be more answerable to the <hi>largeness</hi> of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, than to the <hi>narrowness</hi> of their beginnings. This I speak so boldly, not onely because it is almost generally found true; that those things, which have been <hi>small</hi> at first, have oftener grown <hi>greater,</hi> than those which have begun upon a <hi>wider</hi> bottom, which have commonly <hi>stood at a stay:</hi> But also in respect of the present prevailing <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> Nation. It is most usually found, that every People, has some one study or other in their view, about which their minds are most intent, and their Purses readier to open. This is sometimes a profusion in <hi>Habit,</hi> and <hi>Dyet</hi>; sometimes <hi>Religious Buildings</hi>; and sometimes the <hi>Civil Ornaments</hi> of their Cities, and Country. The first of these will shortly vanish from amongst us, by the irresistible correction of the King's own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: the <hi>next</hi> is of late years very sensibly abated: and it is the <hi>last</hi> of the three towards which mens desires are most propense. To evidence this; I think it may be calculated, that since the <hi>Kings</hi> Return, there have been more <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> for the <hi>clearing</hi> and <hi>beautifying</hi> of Streets, for the <hi>repayring</hi> of <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,</hi> for the <hi>cutting</hi> of <hi>Rivers,</hi> for the <hi>increase</hi> of <hi>Manufactures,</hi> for the setting on foot the Trade of Fishing, and many other such Publick Works, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the State; than in divers Ages before. This <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Temper</hi> being well weigh'd; it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, that the <hi>Nation</hi> will withdraw its assistance from the <hi>Royal Society</hi> alone; which does not intend to stop at some <hi>particular benefit,</hi> but goes to the root
<pb facs="tcp:99266:48"/>
of <hi>all noble Inventions,</hi> and proposes an infallible course to make <hi>England</hi> the glory of the Western world.</p>
            <p>This my Love, and my Hopes prompt me to say. But besides this, there is one thing more, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suades me, that the <hi>Royal Society</hi> will be <hi>Immortal.</hi> And that is, that if their Stock should still continue narrow, yet even upon that, they will be able to free themselves from all difficulties, and to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant increase of it, by their managing. There is scarce any thing, has more hindred the <hi>True Philosophy</hi>; than a vain opinion, that men have taken up, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be done in it, to any purpose, but upon a <hi>vast charge,</hi> and by a <hi>mighty Revenue.</hi> Men commonly think, that the <hi>pit,</hi> in which (according to <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>) Truth lyes hid, is bottomless: and that it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, whatever is thrown into it, without being the fuller. This false conception had got so much ground, that assoon as a man began to put his hands to <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,</hi> he was presently given over, as impoverish't and undone. And indeed the Enemies of Real Knowledge, had some appearance of Reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this heretofore: because they had seen the great Estates of some <hi>Chymists</hi> melted away, without any thing left behind, to make recompence. But this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination can now no longer prevail. Men now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that Philosophy needs not so great a prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to maintain it: that the most <hi>profitable</hi> Tryals are not always the most <hi>costly:</hi> that the best Inventions have not been found out by the <hi>richest,</hi> but by the most <hi>prudent,</hi> and <hi>Industrious</hi> Observers: that the right <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Experimenting,</hi> when it is once set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, will go near to sustain it self. This I speak, not to stop mens future Bounty, by a Philosophical Boast,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99266:49"/>
that the <hi>Royal Society</hi> has enough already: But rather to encourage them to cast in more help; by shewing them, what return may be made from a little, by a wise administration.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sect. X. <hi>Their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.</hi>
               </note>Of the variety, and excellence of the <hi>Instruments,</hi> which it lyes in their power to use; I will give no other proof, then the wonderfull perfection to which all Manual Arts have of late years arriv'd. Men now generally understand, to employ those very Tools which the <hi>Antients</hi> lent us, to infinite more Works, than formerly: they have also <hi>of late</hi> devis'd a great multitude of all sorts, which were before <hi>unknown</hi>: and besides, we may very well expect, that time will every day bring forth <hi>more.</hi> For, according as the <hi>matter</hi> to work upon does abound, the greater plenty of <hi>Instruments,</hi> must by consequence follow: such a connexion there is between <hi>Inventions,</hi> and the <hi>means</hi> of Inventing, that they mutually increase each other.</p>
            <p>I might be as large, as I pleas'd, in this particular; in running through some part of all the Innumerable Arts of the <hi>Western world</hi>; and it were not difficult to shew, that the ordinary shops of <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> are now as full of <hi>rarities,</hi> as the <hi>Cabinets</hi> of the former <hi>noblest Mathematicians.</hi> But I will leave that subject, which is so familiar to all; and choose rather, to fetch a confirmation of this, even from those Countreys, which (after the manner of the <hi>Antients</hi>) we call <hi>Barbarous.</hi> And in going thither for an example, I have a farther end. In my foregoing discourse, I try'd to make out the advantages of the <hi>Moderne</hi> Times, above the <hi>antient</hi>; by following the progress of Learning, down through their tracks, to which <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:99266:49"/>
usually confine it; I will now also strengthen that argument; by briefly comparing the skill, and the works of the <hi>unlearned</hi> parts of the <hi>present</hi> world, with those that are <hi>past.</hi> The antient <hi>Barbarians</hi> then, those <hi>Nations</hi> I mean, who lay without the circle of those Arts which we admire; the <hi>Gaules,</hi> the <hi>Britains,</hi> the <hi>Germans,</hi> the <hi>Scythians,</hi> have scarce left any foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps behind them, to shew that they were rational men. Most of them were savage in their <hi>practices</hi>; gross in their <hi>contrivances</hi>; ignorant of all, that might make life either safe, or pleasant. Thus it was with them, and this all History speaks with one voice: whereas the <hi>Barbarians</hi> of our Times (if I may take the liberty still to use that word, which the pride of <hi>Greece</hi> first brought into fashion) the <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Moors,</hi> the <hi>East-Indians,</hi> and even the <hi>Americans,</hi> though they too are utterly unacquainted with all our Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yet by the help of an <hi>Vniversal Light,</hi> which seems to overspread this <hi>Age,</hi> are in several <hi>Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts</hi> most ready, and dextrous: insomuch that in some, they can scarce be imitated by the <hi>Europeans</hi> themselves. I shall leave it to any man, to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture from hence, which of these two times has the Prerogative; and how much better helps are proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be found at this day, in the most <hi>Civil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:</hi> when we now find so much artifice, amongst those our <hi>Contemporaries,</hi> who only follow <hi>rude,</hi> and <hi>untaught</hi> Nature.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:99266:50"/>As for the First, they meddle no otherwise with <hi>Divine things,</hi> than onely as the <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of the <hi>Creator,</hi> is display'd in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable order, and workman-ship of the Creatures. It cannot be deny'd, but it lies in the <hi>Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> hands, best to advance that part of <hi>Divinity:</hi> which, though it fills not the mind, with such <hi>tender,</hi> and <hi>powerful contemplations,</hi> as that which shews us Man's <hi>Redemption</hi> by a <hi>Mediator</hi>; yet it is by no means to be pass'd by unregarded: but is an excellent ground to establish the other. This is <hi>a Religion,</hi> which is confirm'd, by the unanimous agreement of all sorts of Worships: and may serve in respect to <hi>Christianity,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Porch to the <hi>Temple</hi>; into the one the <hi>Heathens</hi> themselvs did also enter; but into the other, onely God's <hi>peculiar People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In men, may be consider'd the <hi>Faculties,</hi> and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of their <hi>Souls</hi>; The <hi>constitution of their Bodies,</hi> and the <hi>works of their Hands.</hi> Of these, the <hi>first</hi> they omit: both because the knowledg and direction of them have been before undertaken, by some <hi>Arts,</hi> on which they have no mind to intrench, as the <hi>Politicks, Morality,</hi> and <hi>Oratory:</hi> and also because the <hi>Reason,</hi> the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> the <hi>Tempers,</hi> the <hi>Will,</hi> the <hi>Passions</hi> of Men, are so hard to be reduc'd to any certain obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>senses</hi>; and afford so much room to the <hi>observers</hi> to falsifie or counterfeit: that if such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses should be once entertain'd; they would be in danger of falling into <hi>talking,</hi> insteed of <hi>working,</hi> which they carefully avoid. Such subjects therefore as these, they have hitherto kept out. But yet, when they shall have made more progress, in <hi>material</hi> things, they will be in a condition, of pronouncing more boldly on them too. For, though Man's <hi>Soul,</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:99266:50"/>
and <hi>Body</hi> are not onely one <hi>natural Engine</hi> (as some have thought) of whose motions of all sorts, there may be as certain an accompt given, as of those of a Watch or Clock: yet by long studying of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> of the <hi>Bloud,</hi> of the <hi>Nourishment,</hi> of the parts, of the <hi>Diseases,</hi> of the <hi>Advantages,</hi> of the accidents which belong to <hi>humane bodies</hi> (all which will come within their Province) there, without question, be very neer ghesses made, even at the more <hi>exalted,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi> Actions of the <hi>Soul</hi>; and that too, without destroying its <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Immortal</hi> Being.</p>
            <p>These two Subjects, <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Soul,</hi> being onely forborn: In all the rest, they wander, at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: In the frame of <hi>Mens bodies,</hi> the ways for strong, healthful, and long life: In the <hi>Arts of Mens Hands,</hi> those that either <hi>necessity, convenience,</hi> or <hi>delight</hi> have produc'd: In the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> their helps, their varieties, redundancies, and defects: and in bringing all these to the <hi>uses</hi> of <hi>humane Society.</hi>

               </note> I will observe, how they have behav'd themselves, in things that might be brought within their <hi>own Touch and Sight:</hi> and how in those, which are so remote, and hard to be come by, that about them, they were forc'd to trust <hi>the reports of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first kind: I shall lay it down, as their <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Law,</hi> that whenever they could possibly get to <hi>handle</hi> the subject, the <hi>Experiment</hi> was still per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by some of the <hi>Members</hi> themselves. The want of this <hi>exactness,</hi> has very much diminish'd the credit of former <hi>Naturalists.</hi> It might else have seem'd strange, that so many men of Wit, setting so many hands on work; being so watchful to catch up all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99266:51"/>
from Woods, Fields, Mountains, Rivers, Seas, and Lands; and scattering their Pensions so liberally; should yet be able to collect so few Observations, that have been judicious or useful. But the Reason is plain; for while they thought it enough, to be onely <hi>Receivers</hi> of others Intelligence; they have either em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd <hi>Ignorant</hi> searchers, who knew not how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest or distinguish what they found: or <hi>frivolous,</hi> who always lov'd to come home laden, though it were but with trifles: or (which is worst of all) <hi>crafty,</hi> who having perceiv'd the humours of those that paid them so well, would always take care to bring in such col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections as might seem to agree with the Opinions and Principles of their <hi>Masters,</hi> however they did with <hi>Nature</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>This Inconvenience, the <hi>Royal Society</hi> has escap'd, by making the whole process pass under its own eyes. And the Task was divided amongst them, by one of these two ways. First, it was sometimes referr'd to some <hi>particular men,</hi> to make choice of what <hi>Subject</hi> they pleased, and to follow their own humour in the <hi>Trial</hi>; the <hi>expence</hi> being still allow'd from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Stock. By which liberty, that they afforded, they had a very necessary regard to the power of <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Inclinations:</hi> which in all sorts of <hi>Knowledg</hi> is so strong; that there may be numberless Instances given of men, who in some things have been altogether <hi>useless,</hi> and yet in others have had such a vigorous, and <hi>successful</hi> faculty, as if they had been born, and form'd for them alone.</p>
            <p>Or else secondly, the <hi>Society</hi> it self made the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution, and deputed whom it thought fit for the prosecution of such, or such Experiments. And this they did, either by allotting the <hi>same Work</hi> to <hi>several</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:99266:51"/>
men, separated one from another; or else by <hi>joyning</hi> them into <hi>Committees</hi> (if we may use that word in a Philosophical sence, and so in some measure purge it from the ill sound, which it formerly had) By this <hi>union</hi> of <hi>eyes,</hi> and <hi>hands</hi> there do these <hi>advantages</hi> arise. Thereby there will be a full <hi>comprehension</hi> of the object in <hi>all</hi> its appearances; and so there will be a mutual communication of the light of one <hi>Science</hi> to another: whereas <hi>single labours</hi> can be but as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect taken upon one side. And also by this fixing of several mens thoughts upon one thing, there will be an excellent cure for that <hi>defect,</hi> which is almost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable in great <hi>Inventors.</hi> It is the custom of such earnest, and powerful minds, to do wonderful things in the <hi>beginning</hi>; but shortly after, to be overborn by the multitude, and weight of their own thoughts; then to yield, and cool by little and little; and at last grow weary, and even to loath that, upon which they were at first the most eager. This is the wonted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of <hi>great Wits:</hi> such tender things, are those exalted Actions of the mind; and so hard it is, for those imaginations, that can run swift, and mighty Races, to be able to travel a long, and a constant jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The effects of this infirmity have been so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that we have certainly lost very many <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,</hi> after they have been in part fashion'd, by the meer <hi>languishing,</hi> and <hi>negligence</hi> of their <hi>Authours.</hi> For this, the best provision must be, to join many men together; for it cannot be imagin'd, that they should be all so violent, and fiery: and so by this mingling of Tempers, the <hi>Impetuous</hi> men, not having the whole burthen on them, may have leisure for intervals to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit their first heat; and the more <hi>judicious,</hi> who are not so soon possess'd with such raptures, may carry
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99266:52"/>
on the others strong conceptions, by soberer degrees, to a full accomplishment.</p>

               </note>This they have practis'd in such things, whereof the matter is common; and wherein they may repeat their labours as they please. But in <hi>forein,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote</hi> affairs, their <hi>Intentions,</hi> and their <hi>Advantages</hi> do farr exceed all others. For these, they have begun to settle a <hi>correspondence</hi> through all Countreys; and have taken such order, that in short time, there will scarce a Ship come up the <hi>Thames,</hi> that does not make some return of <hi>Experiments,</hi> as well as of <hi>Merchandize.</hi>

            <p>This their care of an <hi>Vniversal Intelligence,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended by <hi>Nature</hi> its self, in the situation of <hi>England:</hi> For, lying so, as it does, in the passage between the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of the World, and the <hi>Southern</hi>; its <hi>Ports</hi> being open to all Coasts, and its <hi>Ships</hi> spreading their Sails in all Seas; it is thereby necessarily made, not onely <hi>Mistress</hi> of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> but the most proper <hi>Seat,</hi> for the advancement of <hi>Knowledg.</hi> From the <hi>positions</hi> of Countreys, arise not only their several shapes, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, customs, colours, but also their <hi>different Arts,</hi> and <hi>Studies.</hi> The <hi>Inland</hi> and <hi>Continent,</hi> we see do give Laws, to Discourse, to Habits, to Behaviour: but those that border upon the <hi>Seas,</hi> are most properly seated, to bring home matter for <hi>new Sciences,</hi> and to make the same proportion of Discoveries above others, in the <hi>Intellectual</hi> Globe, as they have done in the <hi>Material.</hi>

            <p>Upon this advantage of our Island, there is so much stress to be laid, towards the prosperity of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; that if we should search through all the World, for a perpetual habitation, wherein the Universal Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy might settle it self; there can none be found,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99266:52"/>
which is comparable to <hi>London,</hi> of all the former, or present Seats of Empire. <hi>Babylon,</hi> that was the <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal City</hi> of the first <hi>Monarchy,</hi> was situated in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion Countrey, had a clear, and uncloudy air; and was therefore fit enough to promote one part of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Knowledg,</hi> the <hi>Observations</hi> of the <hi>Heavens:</hi> But it was a Mid-land Town, and regarded not the Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique of Foreiners; abounding with its own luxury, and riches. <hi>Memphis</hi> was improper, upon the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt; for <hi>Egypt</hi> was a <hi>Land content with its own plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; admitting strangers, rather to instruct them, than to learn any thing from them. <hi>Carthage</hi> stood not so well for a resort for <hi>Philosophers,</hi> as for <hi>Pirats</hi>; as all the <hi>African</hi> shore continues at this day. As for <hi>Rome,</hi> its Fortune was read by <hi>Virgil</hi>; when he said, that <hi>it only ought to excel in the Arts of Ruling. Constantinople,</hi> though its present <hi>Masters</hi> were not <hi>Barbarous,</hi> yet is too much shut up by the Straits of <hi>Hellespont. Vienna</hi> is now a Frontier Town, and has no communication with the <hi>Ocean,</hi> but by a long compass about. <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> is a place of Trade, without the mixture of men of freer thoughts. And, even <hi>Paris</hi> it self, though it is far to be preferr'd before all the others for the resort of Learned and Inquisitive men to it, yet is less ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, for the same reasons, for which <hi>Athens</hi> was, by being the Seat of <hi>Gallantry,</hi> the <hi>Arts of speech,</hi> and <hi>education.</hi> But it is <hi>London</hi> alone, that enjoys most of the others advantages, without their inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. It is the head of a <hi>mighty Empire,</hi> the greatest that ever commanded the <hi>Ocean:</hi> It is compos'd of <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> as well as <hi>Traders:</hi> It has a large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse with all the <hi>Earth:</hi> It is, as the <hi>Poets</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe their <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Fame,</hi> a City, where all the noises and business in the World do meet: and therefore this
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99266:53"/>
honor is justly due to it, to be the <hi>constant</hi> place of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence</hi> for that <hi>Knowledg,</hi> which is to be made up of the Reports, and Intelligence of all Countreys.</p>
            <p>To this I will adde; That we have another help in our hands, which almost forces this Crown on the head of the <hi>English</hi> Nation: and that is, the <hi>Noble,</hi> and <hi>Inquisitive Genius</hi> of our <hi>Merchants.</hi> This cannot be better shewn, than by comparing them, with those of that one Countrey; which onely stands in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with us for Trade. The <hi>Merchants</hi> of <hi>England</hi> live honourably in forein parts; those of <hi>Holland</hi> meanly, minding their gain alone: ours converse freely, and learn from all; having in their behaviour, very much of the <hi>Gentility</hi> of the Families, from which so many of them are descended: The others, when they are abroad, shew, that they are onely a Race of plain <hi>Citizens,</hi> keeping themselves most with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their own Cells, and Ware-houses; scarce regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the acquaintance of any, but those, with whom they traffick. This <hi>largeness</hi> of ours, and <hi>narrowness</hi> of their living, does, no doubt, conduce very much to inrich them; and is, perhaps, one of the Reasons, that they can so easily under-sel us: But withall, it makes ours the most <hi>capable,</hi> as theirs <hi>unfit,</hi> to promote such an <hi>Enterprise,</hi> as this of which I am now speaking. For indeed, the effects of their several ways of life, are as different: of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> I need say no more: But of the <hi>English Merchants</hi> I will affirm, that in all sorts of Politeness, and skill in the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>humane affairs,</hi> they do not onely excel them, but are equal to any other sort of men amongst us.</p>
            <p>This I have spoken, not to lessen the reputation of that <hi>Industrious people:</hi> But, that I might (if it were possible) inflame their minds to an emulation of this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99266:53"/>
Design. They have all things imaginable to stirr them up: they have the Examples of the greatest <hi>Wits</hi> of other Countreys, who have left their own homes, to retire thither, for the freedom of their Philosophical Studies: they have one place (I mean the <hi>Hague</hi>) which may be soon made the very Copy of a Town in the <hi>New Atlantis</hi>; which for its pleasantness, and for the concourse of men of all conditions to it, may be counted above all others (except <hi>London</hi>) the most advantagiously seated for this service.</p>
            <p>These have been the privileges and practices of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> in things forein, &amp; Native. It would now be needless to set down all the steps of their progress about them; how they observ'd all the varieties of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,</hi> and <hi>corruptions,</hi> natural, and artificial; all the increasings, and lessenings; agreements, and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things; how, having found out a <hi>cause,</hi> they have apply'd it to many other <hi>effects:</hi> and the <hi>effects</hi> to different <hi>causes</hi>; how they are wont to change the Instruments and places, and quantities of matter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to occasions: and all the other subtilties, and windings of Trial, which are almost infinite to express. I shall onely, in passing, touch on these two things, which they have most carefully consulted.</p>
            <p>The one is, not to prescribe to themselves, any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Experimenting,</hi> within which to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe their thoughts: But rather to keep themselves free, and change their course, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent circumstances, that occurr to them in their operations; and the several alterations of the Bodies, on which they work. The true <hi>Experimenting</hi> has this one thing inseparable from it, never to be a <hi>fix'd</hi> and <hi>settled Art,</hi> and never to be <hi>limited</hi> by constant Rules. This, perhaps, may be shewn too in other <hi>Arts</hi>; as in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99266:54"/>
that of <hi>Invention,</hi> of which, though in <hi>Logick,</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> so many bounds, and helps are given: yet I believe very few have argued or discoursed by those <hi>Topicks.</hi> But whether that be unconfin'd, or no, it is certain, that <hi>Experimenting</hi> is; like that which is call'd <hi>Decence</hi> in humane life; which, though it be that, by which all our Actions are to be fashion'd; and though many things may be plausibly said upon it; yet it is never wholly to be reduc'd to <hi>standing Precepts</hi>; and may almost as easily be <hi>obtain'd,</hi> as defin'd.</p>
            <p>Their other care has been, to regard the <hi>least,</hi> and the <hi>plainest</hi> things, and those that may appear at <hi>first</hi> the most <hi>inconsiderable</hi>; as well as the <hi>greatest Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> This was visibly neglected by the <hi>Antients.</hi> The <hi>Histories</hi> of <hi>Pliny, Aristotle, Solinus, Aelian,</hi> abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more with pretty Tales, and fine monstrous Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; than sober, and fruitful Relations. If they could gather together some extraordinary Qualities of <hi>Stones,</hi> or <hi>Minerals,</hi> some Rarities of the <hi>Age,</hi> the <hi>food,</hi> the <hi>colour,</hi> the <hi>shapes</hi> of <hi>Beasts,</hi> or some <hi>vertues</hi> of <hi>Fountains,</hi> or <hi>Rivers:</hi> they thought, they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the chiefest part of <hi>Natural Historians.</hi> But this course is subject to much corruption. It is not the true following of <hi>Nature</hi>; For that still goes on in a steddy Rode, nor is it so extravagant, and so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial in its contrivances, as our admiration, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from our ignorance, makes it. It is also a way that of all others, is most subject to be deceiv'd: For it will make men inclinable to bend the Truth much awry, to raise a specious Observation out of it. It stops the severe progress of <hi>Inquiry:</hi> Infecting the mind, and making it averse from the true <hi>Natural Philosophy:</hi> It is like <hi>Romances,</hi> in respect of <hi>True History</hi>; which,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99266:54"/>
by multiplying varieties of extraordinary Events, and surprizing circumstances, makes that seem dull, and tastless. And, to say no more, the very delight which it raises, is nothing so solid: but, as the satisfaction of <hi>Fancy,</hi> it affects us a little, in the beginning, but soon wearies, and surfets: whereas a just <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> like the pleasure of <hi>Reason,</hi> would not be, perhaps, so quick and violent, but of farr longer continuance, in its contentment.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Matter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. XIV. <hi>Their week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</hi>
               </note> being thus collected, has been brought before their <hi>weekly meetings,</hi> to undergo a just and a full examination. In them their principal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours have been, that they might enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of a <hi>mix'd Assembly,</hi> which are largeness of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and diversity of Judgments, without the mischiefs that usually accompany it, such as confusion, unsteddiness, and the little animosities of divided Parties. That they have avoided these dangers for the time past; there can be no better proof, than their constant practice; wherein they have perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preserv'd a singular sobriety of debating, slowness of consenting, and moderation of dissenting. Nor have they been onely free from <hi>Faction,</hi> but from the very <hi>Causes,</hi> and <hi>beginnings</hi> of it. It was in vain for any man amongst them to strive to preferr himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another; or to seek for any great glory from the subtilty of his Wit; seeing it was the inartificial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of the <hi>Experiment,</hi> and not the <hi>Acuteness</hi> of any Commentary upon it, which they have had in vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. There was no room left, for any to attempt, to heat their own, or others minds, beyond a due temper; where they were not allow'd to expatiate, or amplifie, or connect specious arguments together.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99266:55"/>
They could not be much exasperated one against an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in their disagreements, because they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that there may be several Methods of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in producing the same thing, and all equally good: whereas they that contend for truth by talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do commonly suppose that there is but one way of finding it out. The differences which should chance to happen, might soon be compos'd; because they could not be grounded on matters of speculation, or opinion, but onely of sence; which are never wont to administer so powerful occasions of disturbance, and contention, as the other. In brief, they have escap'd the prejudices that use to arise from Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from unequality of Persons, from insinuations, from friendships; But above all, they have guarded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against themselves, lest the strength of their own thoughts should lead them into error; lest their good Fortune in one Discovery, should presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine them onely to one way of trial; lest their failings should discourage, or their success abate their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. All these <hi>excellent Philosophical Qualities,</hi> they have by long custom, made to become the peculiar Genius of this <hi>Society:</hi> and to descend down to their successors, not onely as <hi>circumstantial Laws,</hi> which may be neglected, or alter'd in the course of time; but as the very <hi>life</hi> of their constitution; to remain on their minds, as the <hi>laws</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> do in the hearts of Men; which are so near to us, that we can hardly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish, whether they were taught us by degrees, or rooted in the very foundation of our Being.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sect. XV. <hi>The Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their meetings.</hi>
               </note>It will not be here seasonable, to speak much, of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> which they have hitherto observ'd in these <hi>Meetings</hi>; because they are, almost, the same,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99266:55"/>
which have been since establish'd by their <hi>Council,</hi> which we shall have a more proper occasion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce hereafter. Let this onely be said in brief, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the curious.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Place</hi> where they hitherto assembled, is <hi>Gresham-College</hi>; where, by the munificence of a Citizen, there have been Lectures for several <hi>Arts</hi> indow'd so liberally, that if it were beyond Sea, it might well pass for an <hi>Vniversity.</hi> And indeed, by a rare happiness in the constitution (of which I know not where to find the like example) the Professors have been from the beginning, and chiefly, of late years, of the most Learned Men of the Nation; though the choice has been wholly in the disposal of Citizens. Here the <hi>Royal Society</hi> has one <hi>publick Room</hi> to meet in, another for a <hi>repository</hi> to keep their Instruments, Books, Rarities, Papers, and whatever else belongs to them: making use besides, by permission, of several of the other Lodgings, as their occasions do require. And, when I consider the place it self; me thinks it bears some likeness to their Design; It is now a <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> but was once the Mansion-house of one of the <hi>greatest Merchants,</hi> that ever was in <hi>England:</hi> And such a <hi>Philosophy</hi> they would build; which should first wholly consist of <hi>Action,</hi> and <hi>Intelligence,</hi> before it be brought into <hi>Teaching,</hi> and <hi>Contemplation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There Time is every <hi>Wednesday,</hi> after the Lecture of the <hi>Astronomy</hi> Professor; perhaps, in memory of the first occasions of their Rendezvouses.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Elections,</hi> perform'd by <hi>Ballotting</hi>; every member having a Vote; the Candidates being nam'd at one meeting, and put to the <hi>scrutiny</hi> at another.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Chief Officer,</hi> is the <hi>President</hi>; to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to call, and dissolve their <hi>meetings</hi>; to <hi>propose</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:99266:56"/>
the Subject; to <hi>regulate</hi> the Proceedings; to <hi>change</hi> the Inquiry from one thing to another; to <hi>admit</hi> the Members who are elected.</p>
            <p>Besides him, they had at first a <hi>Register,</hi> who was to take Notes of all that pass'd; which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be reduc'd into their <hi>Iournals,</hi> and <hi>Register Books.</hi> This Task was first <hi>perform'd</hi> by Dr. <hi>Croone.</hi> But they since thought it more necessary, to appoint two <hi>Secretaries,</hi> who are to reply to all Addresses from abroad, and at home; and to publish what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall be agreed upon by the <hi>Society.</hi> These are at present, Dr. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Oldenbourgh,</hi> from whom I have not usurp'd this first imployment of that kind; for it is onely my hand that goes, the substance and direction came from one of them.</p>
            <p>This is all that I have to say concerning their <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial part.</hi> In most other things, they bounded themselves to no standing Orders, there being nothing more intended in such <hi>circumstances,</hi> than conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and order. If any shall imagine, they have not limited themselves to <hi>Forms</hi> enough, to keep up the gravity, and solemnity of such an Enterprise, they are to consider, that so much exactness and curiosity of observances, does not so well befit <hi>Inquirers,</hi> as <hi>Sects</hi> of Philosophy, or places appointed for Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or those who submit themselves to the severity of some religious Order. The Work which the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> proposes to it self, being not so fine, and easie, as that of teaching is; but rather a painful digging, and toiling in <hi>Nature</hi>; It would be a great incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to them, to be straightned to many strict <hi>pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilioes</hi>; as much as it would be to an <hi>Artificer,</hi> to be loaded with many cloaths, while he is labouring in his Shop.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:99266:56"/>But having made so much hast through <hi>the Formal part of these their Meetings,</hi> I shall not so soon dispatch <hi>the substantial</hi>; which consists in <hi>Directing, Iudging, Conjecturing, Improving, Discoursing</hi> upon <hi>Experiments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Towards the first of these ends,<note place="margin">Sect. XVI. <hi>Their dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments.</hi>
               </note> it has been their usual course, when they themselves appointed the <hi>Trial,</hi> to propose one week, some particular <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> to be prosecuted the next; and to debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, concerning all things that might conduce to the better carrying them on. In this <hi>Praeliminary Collection,</hi> it has been the custom, for any of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> to urge what came into their thoughts, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories concerning them; either from the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others, or from <hi>Books,</hi> or from their own <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> or even from common <hi>Fame</hi> it self. And in performing this, they did not exercise any great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of choosing, and distinguishing between <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Falshoods:</hi> but a mass altogether as they came; the certain Works, the Opinions, the Ghesses, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, with their different Degrees and Accidents, the Probabilities, the Problems, the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, the miraculous Stories, the ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, the changes incident to the same Matter in several places, the Hindrances, the Benefits, of <hi>Airs,</hi> or <hi>Seasons,</hi> or <hi>Instruments</hi>; and whatever they found to have been begun, to have fail'd, to have succeeded, in the Matter which was then under their Disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p>This is a most necessary preparation, to any that resolve to make a perfect search. For they cannot but go blindly, and lamely, and confusedly about the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, unless they have first laid before them a full <hi>Account</hi> of it. I confess the excellent <hi>Monsieur des
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99266:57"/>
Cartes</hi> recommends to us another way in his <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Method</hi>; where he gives this Relation of his own progress; that after he had run through the usual Studies of youth, and spent his first years in an active life; when he retir'd to search into <hi>Truth,</hi> he at once rejected all the <hi>Impressions,</hi> which he had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, from what he had heard, and read; and wholly gave himself over to a reflexion on the naked <hi>Ideas</hi> of his own mind. This he profess'd to do, that he might lay aside all his <hi>old imaginations,</hi> and begin anew to write on a white and unblotted <hi>Soul.</hi> This, perhaps, is more allowable in matters of <hi>Contemplation,</hi> and in a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> whose chief aim was his own delight; and so it was in his own choice, whether or no, he would go farther to seek it, than his own mind: But it can by no means stand with a practical and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal <hi>Inquiry.</hi> It is impossible, but they, who will onely transscribe their own thoughts, and disdain to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or strengthen them by the assistance of others, should be in most of their apprehensions too narrow, and obscure; by setting down things for general, which are onely peculiar to themselves. It cannot be avoided, but they will commit many gross mistakes; and bestow much useless pains, by making themselves wilfully <hi>ignorant</hi> of what is already known, and what conceal'd. It was try'd amongst the <hi>Antients,</hi> to find out the pure, and Primitive Language of the World, by breeding up a child so, that he might never hear any man speak. But what was the event of that trial? Instead of obtaining that end, the child was made absolutely dumb thereby. And the like success will that <hi>Philosopher</hi> find, who shall expect, that, by the keeping his mind free from the <hi>Tincture</hi> of all others <hi>Opinions,</hi> it will give him the original, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infected
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99266:57"/>
               <hi>Truths</hi> of things. All <hi>Knowledg</hi> is to be got the same way that a Language is, by <hi>Industry, Vse,</hi> and <hi>Observation.</hi> It must be receiv'd, before it can be drawn forth. 'Tis true, the mind of Man is a Glass, which is able to represent to it self, all the Works of <hi>Nature:</hi> But it can onely shew those Figures, which have been brought before it: It is no <hi>Magical Glass,</hi> like that with which <hi>Astrologers</hi> use to deceive the Ignorant; by making them believe, that therein they may behold the Image of any <hi>Place,</hi> or <hi>Person</hi> in the World, though never so farr remov'd from it. I know it may be here suggested; that they, who busie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves much abroad, about learning the judgments of others, cannot be unprejudic'd in what they think. But it is not the <hi>knowing,</hi> but the peremptory <hi>addicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to others <hi>Tenents,</hi> that sowers and perverts the <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi> Nay, to go farther; that man, who is throughly acquainted with all sorts of <hi>Opinions,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much more unlikely, to adhere obstinately to any one particular, than he whose head is onely fill'd with thoughts, that are all of one colour.</p>
            <p>It being now so requisite, to premise this general collection: It could not be better made, than by the <hi>joint labours</hi> of the whole <hi>Society.</hi> It were an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable burthen, if it were wholly cast on the <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters</hi> themselves. For, it is not onely true, that those who have the best faculty of <hi>Experimenting,</hi> are commonly most averse from reading Books; and so it is fit, that this <hi>Defect</hi> should be supply'd by others pains: But also it would too much tire, and wast, or at least divert their spirits, before they came to the main Work. Whereas the <hi>Task</hi> being shar'd amongst so great a number, will become not much more than a business of <hi>delight.</hi> Well then, by

this first <hi>Comment,</hi> and <hi>Discourse</hi> upon the <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; he, that is to try it, being present; and having so good an opportunity, of comparing so many other mens conceptions with his own, and with the <hi>thing</hi> it self; must needs have his thoughts more enlarg'd, his judgment confirm'd, his eyes open'd to discern, what most compendious helps may be provided; what part of it is more or less useful; and upon what side it may be best attempted: The <hi>Truths,</hi> which he learns this way, will be his Pattern; the <hi>Errors</hi> will be his Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, to teach to avoid the same dangers; the very falshoods themselves will serve to enlarge, though they do not inform his <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi> And, indeed, a thousand more advantages will hereby come into the minds of the most Sagacious, and acute <hi>Inquirers,</hi> which they would never have compass'd, if they had been onely lest to themselves. I remember, my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> some where says; <hi>That it is one of the greatest secrets of Nature, that mens Passions are more capable, of being rais'd to higher degrees in company, than in soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: and that we sooner grieve, fear, rejoyce, love, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, when we behold many others so mov'd, than when we are alone.</hi> This is true; and the same may be as well affirm'd, of most other actions of the mind. In <hi>Assemblies,</hi> the <hi>Wits</hi> of most men are <hi>sharper,</hi> their <hi>Apprehensions readier,</hi> their <hi>Thoughts fuller,</hi> than in their <hi>Closets.</hi> Of this there is an undoubted proof in the <hi>Art of speaking.</hi> For, let the wittiest, and most eloquent men think as largely as they can, on any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in private; yet, when they come into the publick; and especially, when they have heard others speak before them, their <hi>Argument</hi> appears quite another thing to them; their former expressions seem too flat, and cold for their present thoughts; their minds swell,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99266:58"/>
and are enlightned, as if at that time they were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd with the <hi>Souls</hi> of the whole multitude, before whom they stand.</p>
            <p>Those,<note place="margin">Sect. XVII. <hi>Their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the matter of Fact.</hi>
               </note> to whom the conduct of the <hi>Experiment</hi> is committed, being dismiss'd with these advantages, do (as it were) carry the eyes, and the imaginations of the whole company into the <hi>Laboratory</hi> with them. And after they have perform'd the <hi>Trial,</hi> they bring all the <hi>History</hi> of its <hi>process</hi> back again to the <hi>test.</hi> Then comes in the second great Work of the <hi>Assembly</hi>; which is to <hi>judg,</hi> and <hi>resolve</hi> upon the matter of <hi>Fact.</hi> In this part of their imployment, they us'd to take an exact view of the repetition of the whole course of the <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; here they observ'd all the <hi>chances,</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities</hi> of the proceeding; what <hi>Nature</hi> does wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, what constrain'd; what with its own power, what by the succours of Art; what in a constant rode, and what with some kind of sport and extravagance; industriously marking all the various shapes into which it turns it self, when it is persued, and by how many secret passages it at last obtains its end; never giving it over till the whole <hi>Company</hi> has been fully satisfi'd of the certainty and constancy; or, on the otherside, of the absolute impossibility of the effect. This <hi>critical,</hi> and <hi>reiterated scrutiny</hi> of those things, which are the plain objects of their eyes; must needs put out of all reasonable dispute, the reality of those operations, which the <hi>Society</hi> shall positively deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to have succeeded. If any shall still think it a just <hi>Philosophical liberty,</hi> to be jealous of resting on their credit: they are in the right; and their <hi>dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> will be most thankfully receiv'd, if they be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd on solid works, and not onely on <hi>prejudices,</hi> or
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99266:59"/>
               <hi>suspicions.</hi> To the <hi>Royal Society</hi> it will be at any time almost as acceptable, to be <hi>confuted,</hi> as to <hi>discover:</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by this means, they will accomplish their main <hi>Design:</hi> others will be inflam'd: many more will labour; and so the <hi>Truth</hi> will be obtain'd between them: which may be as much promoted by the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> of hands, and eyes; as it is commonly injur'd by those of Tongues. However, that men may not hence undervalue their <hi>authority,</hi> because they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are not willing to impose, and to usurp a <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> over their <hi>reason</hi>; I will tell them, that there is not any one thing, which is now approv'd and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd in the World, that is confirm'd by stronger evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, than this, which the <hi>Society</hi> requires; except onely the <hi>Holy Mysteries of our Religion.</hi> In almost all other matters of <hi>Belief,</hi> of <hi>Opinion,</hi> or of <hi>Science</hi>; the assurance, whereby men are guided, is nothing near so firm, as this. And I dare appeal to all <hi>sober men</hi>; whether, seeing in all Countreys, that are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Laws, they expect no more, than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of two, or three witnesses, in matters of life, and estate; they will not think, they are fairly dealt withall, in what concerns their <hi>Knowledg,</hi> if they have the concurring Testimonies of <hi>threescore or an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred?</hi>

               </note>The <hi>History,</hi> of the <hi>Trial</hi> perform'd, being thus se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, I will next declare, what room they allow'd for conjecturing upon the <hi>Causes</hi>; about which they also took some pains, though in a farr different way from the antient <hi>Philosophers</hi>; amongst whom, scarce any thing else was regarded, but such <hi>general contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> This indeed, is the <hi>Fatal point,</hi> about which so many of the greatest <hi>Wits</hi> of all Ages have miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99266:59"/>
and commonly, the greater the Wit, the more has been the danger: so many wary steps ought to be troden in this uncertain path: such a multitude of pleasing <hi>Errors,</hi> false <hi>Lights,</hi> disguised <hi>Lies,</hi> deceitful <hi>Fancies</hi> must be escap'd: so much care must be taken, to get into the right way at first: so much, to continue in it; and at last, the greatest caution still remaining to be us'd; lest when the treasure is in our view, we undo all, by catching at it too soon, with too greedy, and rash a hand. These, and many more are the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, to be pass'd; which I have here with less ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension reckon'd up, because the remedy is so nigh. To this <hi>Work</hi> therefore the <hi>Society</hi> approaches, with as much circumspection and modesty, as humane coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels are capable of: They have been cautious, to shun the overweening <hi>dogmatizing</hi> on causes on the one hand: and not to fall into a <hi>speculative Scepticism</hi> on the other: and whatever causes they have with just deliberation found to hold good; they still make them increase their benefits, by farther experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them; and will not permit them to rust or corrupt, for want of use. If after all this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they shall not seem wholly to have remov'd the <hi>mischiefs,</hi> that attend this <hi>hazardous matter</hi>; they ought rather to be judg'd, by what they have done towards it above others, than by what they have not provided against: seeing the thing it self is of that nature; that it is impossible to place the minds of men beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of erring about it.</p>
            <p>The first <hi>Danger</hi> that I shall observe in this kind, is an <hi>over-hasty,</hi> and <hi>praecipitant</hi> concluding upon the <hi>Causes,</hi> before the <hi>Effects</hi> have been enough search'd into: a finishing the <hi>roof,</hi> before the <hi>foundation</hi> has been well laid. For this, I shall first allege this cure;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99266:60"/>
that, though the <hi>Experiment</hi> was but the private task of one or two, or some such small number; yet the <hi>conjecturing,</hi> and <hi>debating</hi> on its <hi>consequences,</hi> was still the employment of their full, and solemn <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.</hi> I have already, upon several occasions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd <hi>Companies</hi> before <hi>single endeavours</hi> in <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical</hi> matters; and yet I am not asham'd here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it again; especially, seeing in this place, it is most apparent, to which of them the prerogative of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and clearness of judging, belongs. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I shall affirm, that there can never be found, in the breast of any particular <hi>Philosopher,</hi> as much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness, and coldness of thinking, and rigorous exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; as is needfull, to a solid <hi>assent,</hi> and to a lasting <hi>conclusion,</hi> on the whole frame of <hi>Nature.</hi> How can it be imagin'd, that any single mind can comprehend, and sustain long enough the weight of so many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Opinions,</hi> and infinite <hi>Observations</hi>; when even the best <hi>Mathematicians</hi> are soon tyr'd, with a long train of the most delightful <hi>Propositions,</hi> which were before made to their hands? Or, if there could be a man of that vastness of <hi>Soul</hi>; yet, how can we be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd, that he will hold the <hi>scale</hi> even? where have we ever had an example of so much streightness, and impartiality of judgment; to persuade us, that the <hi>calmest Philosopher</hi> will not be insensibly inclin'd, to preferr his own <hi>Doctrines,</hi> before those of a stranger? We see all the world flatter themselves in their <hi>strength, beauty,</hi> nay, even (as some have noted) in their very <hi>Statures</hi>; the lowest men scarce believing, but that they are tall enough. Why then should they be singly trusted in their votes about their own thoughts; where the comparison of Wit, makes them more eagerly concern'd? If we follow the <hi>Philosopher</hi> home
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99266:60"/>
into his study; we shall quickly discover, by how many <hi>plausible degrees,</hi> the wisest men are apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themselves, into a <hi>sudden confidence</hi> of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of their knowledg. We will suppose him, to begin his <hi>Inquiry,</hi> with all the sincerity imaginable: resolving to pass by no small mistake, and to forgive to himself no slight error in the <hi>accompt</hi>; with these <hi>fair purposes,</hi> he pitches on some <hi>particular subject:</hi> This he turns, and tortures every way; till, after much labour, he can make some ghesses at its <hi>Causes:</hi> upon this, his industry increases: he applies the same matter to several other operations: he still finds the effects answer his expectations: Now he begins to mould some <hi>general Proposition</hi> upon it: he meets with more and more proofs to confirm his <hi>judgment:</hi> thus he grows by little and little, warmer in his <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations:</hi> the delight of his success swells him: he triumphs and applauds himself, for having found out some <hi>important Truth:</hi> But now his Trial begins to slacken: now <hi>impatience</hi> and <hi>security</hi> creeps upon him: now he carelesly admits whole crouds of Testimonies, that seem any way to confirm that <hi>Opinion,</hi> which he had before establish'd: now he stops his survay, which ought to have gone forward to many more <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>; and so at last, this <hi>sincere,</hi> this <hi>invincible Observer,</hi> out of weariness, or presumption, becomes the most negligent in the later part of his work, in which he ought to have been the most exact. Such is the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal inclination of mankind, to be mis-led by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: which I have mention'd, not to beat down the credit of any particular <hi>Philosophers,</hi> whose <hi>superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi> have not bin answerable to the strength of their first <hi>assertions:</hi> but I have onely complain'd of it in general; as we use to do of Man's mortality, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99266:61"/>
subject to diseases: the aggravating of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon infirmities, can never be esteem'd by any private man, as an effect of <hi>malice,</hi> or <hi>ill nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, on the other side, this <hi>doubtfulness</hi> of thoughts, this <hi>fluctuation,</hi> this <hi>slowness</hi> of concluding, which is so usefull in this case, is so natural to a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Counsellors; that it is frequently urg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, as their <hi>inseperable Imperfection.</hi> Every man has this Argument in his mouth, wherewith to condemn a great and mixt number of advisers; that their <hi>deliberations</hi> are so tedious, that commonly the <hi>seasons of Action</hi> are lost, before they can come to any result. 'Tis true, this unweildiness, and want of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, is most destructive in <hi>matters of State,</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>; as Christendom lately felt: But it has a quite contrary influence on <hi>Philosophy.</hi> It is not here the most speedy, or the swiftest determination of thoughts, that will do the business; here, many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays are requir'd: here, he that can make a <hi>solid ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> or ask a <hi>seasonable question,</hi> will do more good, than he, who shall boldly fix on a hundred <hi>ill-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed resolutions.</hi> Every rubb is here to be smooth'd: every scruple to be plain'd: every thing to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen: the satisfaction of the reason of all past, pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent, and future times to be design'd: so that here, that which is so much cry'd down in <hi>policy,</hi> a striving still to do better, can never be too much regarded.</p>
            <p>Nor is the <hi>Society</hi> only fore-arm'd against this great <hi>inconvenience,</hi> this rashness of setling upon cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, by the multitude of Judges that are to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd: but also by their indifferent hearing of all <hi>conjectures,</hi> that may be made from the Tenents of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Sect of Philosophy</hi>; and by touching every effect that comes before them; upon all the <hi>varieties of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:99266:61"/>
that have been either of late found out, or reviv'd. By this equality of respect to all parties, it has allow'd a sufficient time, to ripen whatever it debated: By this too, it has made it self the common <hi>Cherisher,</hi> and <hi>Vmpire</hi> of them all: and has taken the right way of finding out, what is good in any one of them. A course, which if the Antients had more follow'd, their Sects would not so soon have destroy'd each other. It was a most perverse custom amongst their Disciples, not to make any <hi>strict choice</hi>; to leave some, and embrace others of their Masters Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, but to swallow all at once. He that became a <hi>Stoick,</hi> an <hi>Epicurean,</hi> a <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> in <hi>Logick,</hi> or <hi>Moral Philosophy,</hi> or <hi>Physicks</hi>; never stuck, presently to assent to whatever his Founder had said in all the other <hi>Sciences:</hi> though there was no kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between his Doctrines in the one, and the other. Thus was the whole image of <hi>Philosophy</hi> form'd in their minds altogether: And what they receiv'd so carelesly, they defended the same way; not in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, but in gross. Of this the Errors are apparent; for by so <hi>partially</hi> believing all sorts of Tenents, they had no time to be fully convinc'd: and so became ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>formal</hi> Asserters of them, than <hi>judicious.</hi> And by thus adhering to all; without making any distinction between the Truths, and falshoods; weaknesses, and strengths of <hi>their Sects</hi>; they deny'd to themselves a farr more <hi>calm,</hi> and <hi>safe knowledg</hi>; which might have been compounded out of them all, by fetching some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from one, and something from another.</p>
            <p>This <hi>the Royal Society</hi> did well foresee: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not regard the credit of <hi>Names,</hi> but <hi>Things:</hi> rejecting or approving nothing, because of the title, which it bears: preserving to it self the liberty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99266:62"/>
or liking, as it found: and so advancing its stock, by a <hi>sure</hi> and a <hi>double increase</hi>; by adding <hi>new Discoveries,</hi> and retaining <hi>antient Truths.</hi> A largeness, and generosity, which certainly is an excellent <hi>Omen</hi> of its establishment. In this, me-thinks, it excels any <hi>other Sect</hi>; as the <hi>Roman Common-wealth,</hi> did that of <hi>Venice.</hi> The later began upon a small stock, and has been careful to preserve it self unmingled, bestowing the freedom of its City very sparingly: And we see, it has been still on the defensive; making no great progress in the World: whereas the <hi>Romans,</hi> by a far more frank, and honourable counsel, admitted all, that desir'd to be their confederates; gave the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Roman Citizens</hi> to whole Towns, and Countreys; excluded none, but those that would <hi>obstinately</hi> stand out: and so deservedly extended their Empire, as farr as the bounds of the <hi>civil World</hi> did reach.</p>
            <p>The second mischief in this great matter of causes, is an <hi>eternal instability,</hi> and <hi>aversion</hi> from assigning of any. This arises, from a violent, and imprudent hast to avoid the first. So easie is the passage from one extreme to another; and so <hi>hard</hi> it is, to stop in that little point, wherein the right does consist. The truth is, they are both almost equally pernicious: nothing <hi>sound</hi> is to be expected from those, who wil fix blindly on whatever they can lay hold on: and nothing <hi>great</hi> from them, who will always wander; who will never leave disputing, whether they dream; or wake; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is any motion; whether they have any being, or no: the <hi>one</hi> can produce nothing, but <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesome,</hi> and <hi>rotten</hi> fruits: and the <hi>other,</hi> for fear of that, will endeavour to have no <hi>Harvest,</hi> nor <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>To this fault of <hi>Sceptical doubting,</hi> the <hi>Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:99266:62"/>
may perhaps be suspected, to be a little too much inclin'd: because they always professed, to be so backward from <hi>setling</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> or <hi>fixing</hi> upon <hi>Doctrines.</hi> But if we fairly consider their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we shall soon acquit them. Though they are not yet very daring, in establishing conclusions; yet they lay no injunctions upon their successors not to do the same, when they shall have got a sufficient store for such a work. It is their study, that the way to attain a <hi>solid speculation,</hi> should every day be more and more persued: which is to be done, by a long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing of <hi>speculation</hi> at first, till the matters be ripe for it; and not, by madly rushing upon it in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning. Though they do not contemplate much on the <hi>general</hi> agreements of things; yet they do on the <hi>particular:</hi> from whence the others also will in time be deduc'd. They are therefore as farr from being <hi>Scepticks,</hi> as the greatest <hi>Dogmatists</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The <hi>Scepticks</hi> deny all, both <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>Works.</hi> The <hi>Dogmatists</hi> determine on <hi>Doctrines,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a sufficient respect to <hi>Works</hi>: and this Assembly, (though we should grant, that they have wholly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Doctrines</hi>) yet they have been very positive and affirmative in their <hi>Works.</hi> But more than this, It must also be confess'd, that sometimes after a full inspection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have ventur'd to give the advantage of probability to one Opinion, or Cause, above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Nor have they run any manner of hazard by thus concluding. For first, it is likely, they did hit the <hi>right,</hi> after so long, so punctual, and so gradual an examination: or if we suppose the worst, that they should sometimes judg <hi>amiss</hi> (as we cannot but allow they may; seeing it will not be just to bestow infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility on them alone; while we deny it to all others)
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99266:63"/>
yet they have taken care, that their <hi>weaker reasonings,</hi> and even their <hi>Errors,</hi> cannot be very prejudicial to Posterity. The causes, upon which they have agreed, they did not presently extend, beyond their due strength, to all other things, that seem to bear some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance to what they try'd. Whatever they have resolv'd upon; they have not reported, as <hi>unalterable Demonstrations,</hi> but as <hi>present appearances:</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to future Ages, with the good success of the Experiment, the <hi>manner</hi> of their progress, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,</hi> and the several differences of the <hi>matter,</hi> which they have apply'd: so that, with their mistake, they give them also the means of finding it out. To this I shall add, that they have never affirm'd any thing, concerning the cause, till the trial was past: whereas, to do it before, is a most venomous thing in the making of <hi>Sciences:</hi> for whoever has fix'd on his <hi>Cause,</hi> before he has experimented; can hardly avoid fitting his <hi>Experiment,</hi> and his Observations, to his own <hi>Cause,</hi> which he had before imagin'd; rather than the <hi>Cause</hi> to the truth of the <hi>Experiment</hi> it self. But, in a word, they have hitherto made little other benefit of the <hi>causes,</hi> to which they have consented; than that thereby they might have a firm footing, whereon <hi>new operations</hi> may proceed. And for this Work, I mean a continuation, and variation of the <hi>Inquiry</hi>; the tracing of a <hi>false</hi> Cause, doth very often so much conduce; that, in the progress, the <hi>right</hi> has been discover'd by it. It is not to be question'd, but many inventions of great moment, have been brought forth by Authors, who began upon suppositions, which afterwards they found to be untrue. And it frequently happens to <hi>Philosophers,</hi> as it did to <hi>Columbus:</hi> who first believ'd the <hi>clouds,</hi> that hover'd about the Continent, to be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99266:63"/>
the firm <hi>Land:</hi> But his mistake was happy; for, by sailing towards them, he was led to what he sought: so by prosecuting of <hi>mistaken Causes,</hi> with a resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of not giving over the persute; they have been guided to the <hi>truth</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>The last Defect is, the rendring of Causes barren: that when they have been found out, they have been suffer'd to lye idle; and have been onely us'd, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease thoughts, and not works. This negligence is of all others the most dangerous: It is a <hi>Shipwrack</hi> in the end of the <hi>voiage,</hi> and thence the more to be pitied: It is a corruption, that both hinders additions, and eats out the knowledg that has been already obtain'd: It is the fault of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and not of meer <hi>Inquirers</hi>; of those that have been <hi>successfull,</hi> and not of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate</hi> in their search: and therefore it is, as the miscarriages of those, that are prosperous in humane actions; which are always observ'd to be more destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and harder to be cur'd, than the failings of the afflicted, or those that are still in persute.</p>
            <p>To this the <hi>Royal Society</hi> has apply'd a double pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention;<note place="margin">Sect XIX. <hi>Their way of Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
               </note> both by endeavouring to strike out <hi>new Arts,</hi> as they go along; and also, by still improving all to <hi>new experiments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the possibility of their performing the first; and the Method, which is to be taken about it; I shall shortly speak in another place. It is enough here, to say; that by this, they have taken care, to satisfie the <hi>hopes</hi> of the <hi>present times</hi>; which else might justly languish, and grow cold about this enterprise: if they once saw, that nothing would be ripe in their days; but that all was to come up <hi>hereafter,</hi> for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of those, that are yet unborn. They consulted
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99266:64"/>
the good of <hi>Future</hi> times; but have not neglected their <hi>own</hi>; they have practis'd both the parts of <hi>good Husbandry</hi>; planting Trees, and sowing Corn. This later, for their own speedy benefit, and support; and the other, for the profit, and ornament of after-Ages.</p>
            <p>Nor have they suffer'd their diligence to be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd up, by the pleasures, and enjoyments of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> discoveries; but have still submitted their noblest Inventions, to be made Instruments, and means, for the finding out of <hi>others.</hi> This certainly is the most comprehensive, and unerring Method; at once to make use of that assistance, they give, and to force them, to be farther helpfull to greater ends. There is nothing of all the works of Nature, so inconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, so remote, or so fully known; but, by being made to reflect on other things, it will at once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligten them, and shew it self the clearer. Such is the dependance amongst all the orders of creatures; the inanimate, the sensitive, the rational, the natural, the artificial: that the apprehension of one of them, is a good step towards the understanding of the rest: And this is the highest pitch of <hi>humane reason</hi>; to follow all the links of this chain, till all their secrets are open to our minds; and their works advanc'd, or imitated by our hands. This is truly to command the world; to rank all the <hi>varieties,</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of things, so orderly one upon another; that standing on the top of them, we may perfectly behold all that are below, and make them all serviceable to the quiet, and peace, and plenty of Man's life. And to this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, there can be nothing else added: but that we make a second advantage of this <hi>rising ground,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to look the nearer into heaven: An ambition,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99266:64"/>
which though it was punish'd in the <hi>old World,</hi> by an <hi>universal Confusion</hi>; when it was manag'd with <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,</hi> and <hi>insolence:</hi> yet, when it is carried on by that <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>innocence,</hi> which can never be separated from true knowledg; when it is design'd, not to <hi>brave</hi> the Creator of all things, but to <hi>admire</hi> him the more: it must needs be the utmost perfection of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature.</hi>

               </note> judg'd, conjectur'd upon, and improved <hi>Experiments.</hi> But lastly, in these, and all other businesses, that have come under their care; there is one thing more, about which the <hi>Society</hi> has been most sollicitous; and that is, the manner of their <hi>Discourse:</hi> which, unless they had been very watchful to keep in due temper, the whole spirit and vigour of their <hi>Design,</hi> had been soon eaten out, by the luxury and redundance of <hi>speech.</hi> The ill effects of this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of talking, have already overwhelm'd most other <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Professions</hi>; insomuch, that when I consider the means of <hi>happy living,</hi> and the causes of their corruption, I can hardly forbear recanting what I said before; and concluding, that <hi>eloquence</hi> ought to be banish'd out of all <hi>civil Societies,</hi> as a thing fatal to Peace and good Manners. To this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I should wholly incline; if I did not find, that it is a Weapon, which may be as easily procur'd by <hi>bad</hi> men, as <hi>good:</hi> and that, if these should onely cast it away, and those retain it; the <hi>naked Innocence</hi> of vertue, would be upon all occasions expos'd to the <hi>armed Malice</hi> of the wicked. This is the chief reason, that should now keep up the Ornaments of speaking, in any request: since they are so much degenerated from their original usefulness. They were at first, no doubt,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99266:65"/>
an admirable Instrument in the hands of <hi>Wise Men:</hi> when they were onely employ'd to describe <hi>Goodness, Honesty, Obedience</hi>; in larger, fairer, and more moving Images: to represent <hi>Truth,</hi> cloth'd with Bodies; and to bring <hi>Knowledg</hi> back again to our very senses, from whence it was at first deriv'd to our understandings. But now they are generally chang'd to worse uses: They make the <hi>Fancy</hi> disgust the best things, if they come sound, and unadorn'd: they are in open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance against <hi>Reason</hi>; professing, not to hold much correspondence with that; but with its Slaves, <hi>the Passions:</hi> they give the mind a motion too change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and bewitching, to consist with <hi>right practice.</hi> Who can behold, without indignation, how many mists and uncertainties, these specious <hi>Tropes</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi> have brought on our Knowledg? How many rewards, which are due to more profitable, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult <hi>Arts,</hi> have been still snatch'd away by the easie vanity of <hi>fine speaking?</hi> For now I am warm'd with this just Anger, I cannot with-hold my self, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying the shallowness of all these seeming Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; upon which, <hi>we Writers,</hi> and <hi>Speakers,</hi> look so bigg. And, in few words, I dare say; that of all the Studies of men, nothing may be sooner obtain'd, than this vicious abundance of <hi>Phrase,</hi> this trick of <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors,</hi> this volubility of <hi>Tongue,</hi> which makes so great a noise in the World. But I spend words in vain; for the evil is now so inveterate, that it is hard to know whom to <hi>blame,</hi> or where to begin to <hi>reform.</hi> We all value one another so much, upon this beautiful deceipt; and labour so long after it, in the years of our education; that we cannot but ever after think kinder of it, than it deserves. And indeed, in most other parts of Learning, I look on it to be a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99266:65"/>
utterly desperate in its cure: and I think, it may be plac'd amongst those <hi>general mischiefs</hi>; such, as the <hi>dissention</hi> of Christian Princes, the <hi>want of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> in Religion, and the like; which have been so long spoken against, that men are become insensible about them; every one shifting off the fault from himself to others; and so they are only made bare common places of complaint. It will suffice my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose, to point out, what has been done by the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> towards the correcting of its excesses in <hi>Natural Philosophy</hi>; to which it is, of all others, a most profest enemy.</p>
            <p>They have therefore been most rigorous in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in execution, the only Remedy, that can be found for this <hi>extravagance</hi>: and that has been, a constant Resolution, to reject all the amplifications, digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and swellings of style: to return back to the primitive purity, and shortness, when men deliver'd so many <hi>things,</hi> almost in an equal number of <hi>words.</hi> They have exacted from all their members, a close, naked, natural way of speaking; positive expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; clear senses; a native easiness: bringing all things as near the Mathematical plainness, as they can: and preferring the language of Artizans, Countrymen, and Merchants, before that, of Wits, or Scholars.</p>
            <p>And here, there is one thing, not to be pass'd by; which will render this establish'd custom of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> well nigh everlasting: and that is, the general constitution of the minds of the <hi>English.</hi> I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready often insisted on some of the prerogatives of <hi>England</hi>; whereby it may justly lay claim, to be the Head of a <hi>Philosophical league,</hi> above all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in <hi>Europe:</hi> I have urg'd its scituation, its present Genius, and the disposition of its Merchants; and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99266:66"/>
many more such <hi>arguments</hi> to incourage us, still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to be us'd: But of all others, this, which I am now alledging, is of the most weighty, and important consideration. If there can be a true character gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the <hi>Vniversal Temper</hi> of any Nation under Heaven: then certainly this must be ascrib'd to our Countrymen: that they have commonly an unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected sincerity; that they love to deliver their minds with a sound simplicity; that they have the middle qualities, between the reserv'd subtle southern, and the rough unhewn Northern people: that they are not extreamly prone to speak: that they are more concern'd, what others will think of the strength, than of the fineness of what they say: and that an universal modesty possesses them. These Qualities are so conspicuous, and proper to our Soil; that we often hear them objected to us, by some of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Satyrists, in more disgraceful expressions. For they are wont to revile the <hi>English,</hi> with a want of familiarity; with a melancholy dumpishness; with slowness, silence, and with the unrefin'd sullenness of their behaviour. But these are only the reproaches of partiality, or ignorance: for they ought rather to be commended for an honourable integrity; for a neglect of circumstances, and flourishes; for regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things of <hi>greater</hi> moment, more than <hi>less</hi>; for a scorn to deceive as well as to be deceiv'd: which are all the best indowments, that can enter into a <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical Mind.</hi> So that even the position of our cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, the air, the influence of the heaven, the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the English blood; as well as the embraces of the Ocean, seem to joyn with the labours of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> to render our Country, a Land of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental knowledge.</hi> And it is a good sign, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99266:66"/>
will reveal more of its secrets to the English, than to others; because it has already furnish'd them with a Genius so well proportion'd, for the receiving, and retaining its mysteries.</p>
            <p>And now,<note place="margin">Sect. II. <hi>Their way of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string.</hi>
               </note> to come to a close of the second part of the <hi>Narration:</hi> The <hi>Society</hi> has reduc'd its principal observations, into one <hi>common-stock</hi>; and laid them up in publique <hi>Registers,</hi> to be nakedly transmitted to the next Generation of Men; and so from them, to their Successors. And as their purpose was, to heap up a mixt Mass of <hi>Experiments,</hi> without digesting them into any perfect model: so to this end, they confin'd themselves to no order of subjects; and whatever they have recorded, they have done it, not as compleat Schemes of opinions, but as bare unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd Histories.</p>
            <p>In the order of their <hi>Inquisitions,</hi> they have been so free; that they have sometimes committed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be guided, according to the seasons of the year: sometimes, according to what any foreiner, or English Artificer, being present, has suggested: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, according to any extraordinary accident in the Nation, or any other casualty, which has hapned in their way. By which roving, and unsettled course, there being seldome any reference of one matter to the next; they have prevented others, nay even their own hands, from corrupting, or contracting the work: they have made the raising of <hi>Rules,</hi> and <hi>Propositions,</hi> to be a far more difficult <hi>task,</hi> than it would have been, if their <hi>Registers</hi> had been more <hi>Methodical.</hi> Nor ought this neglect of consequence, and order, to be only thought to proceed from their <hi>carelesness</hi>; but from a mature, and well grounded <hi>praemeditation.</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:99266:67"/>
For it is certain, that a too sudden striving to reduce the <hi>Sciences,</hi> in their beginnings, into Method, and Shape, and Beauty; has very much retarded their increase. And it happens to the Invention of Arts, as to children in their younger years: in whose Bodies, the same <hi>applications,</hi> that serve to make them strait, slender, and comely; are often found very mischievous, to their ease, their strength, and their growth.</p>
            <p>By their fair, and equal, and submissive way of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistring</hi> nothing, but <hi>Histories,</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi>; they have left room for others, that shall succeed, to <hi>change,</hi> to <hi>augment,</hi> to <hi>approve,</hi> to <hi>contradict</hi> them, at their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. By this, they have given <hi>posterity</hi> a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power of judging them; than ever they took over those, that went before them. By this, they have made a firm <hi>confederacy,</hi> between their own <hi>present labours,</hi> and the Industry of <hi>Future Ages</hi>; which how beneficial it will prove hereafter, we cannot better ghesse, than by recollecting, what wonders it would in all likelyhood have produc'd e're this; if it had been begun in the Times of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> or <hi>Scholemen</hi>; nay even in the very last resurrection of learning. What depth of <hi>Nature,</hi> could by this time have been hid from our view? What Faculty of the Soul would have been in the dark? What part of human infirmities, not provided against? if our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, a thousand, nay even a hundred, years ago, had begun to add by little, and little to the store: if they would have indeavour'd to be <hi>Benefactors,</hi> and not <hi>Tyrants</hi> over our Reasons; if they would have communicated to us, more of their <hi>Works,</hi> and less of their <hi>Wit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This complaint, which I here take up, will appear
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99266:67"/>
the juster; if we consider, that the first <hi>learned Times</hi> of the Antients, and all those, that follow'd after them, down to this day, would have receiv'd no prejudice at all; if their <hi>Philosophers</hi> had chiefly bestow'd their pains, in making <hi>Histories of Nature,</hi> and not in <hi>forming of Sciences:</hi> perhaps indeed the names of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, who had the luck to compile those <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemes,</hi> and <hi>Epitomes</hi> which they gave us, would have been less glorious, than they are. Though that too may be doubted: and (if we may conclude any thing surely, upon a matter so changeable, as <hi>Fame</hi> is) we have reason enough to believe, that these later Ages would have honour'd <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Zeno,</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> as much, if not more, than now they do; if they had only set things in a way of propagating Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences down to us; and not impos'd their <hi>imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> on us, as the only <hi>Truths.</hi> This may be well enough suppos'd; seeing it is common to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, still to esteem dearer the memories of their <hi>Friends,</hi> than of those that pretend to be their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this matter of <hi>reputation,</hi> was only the <hi>private</hi> concernment of five, or six. As for the Interest of those Times in general, I will venture to make good; that in all effects of <hi>true knowledge,</hi> they might have been as happy, without those <hi>Bodies</hi> of <hi>Arts,</hi> as they were with them; <hi>Logick,</hi> and the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted. To instance in their <hi>Physicks:</hi> they were utterly useless, in respect of the good of mankind: they themselves did almost confess so much, by reserving all their <hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi> for the retirements of their Wisemen. What help did it ever bring to the vulgar? What visible benefit to any City, or Country in the World? Their <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> and <hi>Artificers</hi> (for whom
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99266:68"/>
the True <hi>Natural Philosophy</hi> should be principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) were so far from being assisted by those <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse Doctrines</hi>; that perhaps scarce any one of those Professions, and Trades, has well understood <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles Principles of Bodies,</hi> from <hi>his own</hi> Time down to <hi>ours.</hi> Hence then we may conclude, that those <hi>first Times,</hi> wherein these <hi>Arts</hi> were made, had been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing dammag'd; if, instead of raising so many <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Opinions,</hi> they had only minded the laying of a <hi>solid ground-work,</hi> for a vast Pile of <hi>Experiments,</hi> to be continually augmenting through all Ages.</p>
            <p>And I will also add; that, if such a course had been at first set on foot, <hi>Philosophy</hi> would by this means have been kept closer to <hi>material things</hi>; and so, in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, would not have undergone so many <hi>Eclipses,</hi> as it has done ever since. If we reckon from its first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth in the <hi>East</hi>; we shall find, that in so long a Tract of Time, there have not been above four, or five hundred years, at several intervals, wherein it has been in any request in the World. And if we look back on all the alterations, and subversions of <hi>States,</hi> that have hapned in Civil Nations, these three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years: we may still behold, that the <hi>Sciences of mens brains,</hi> have been alwayes subject to be far more injur'd by such vicissitudes, than the <hi>Arts of their hands.</hi> What cause can be assign'd for this? Why was Learning the first thing, that was constantly swept away, in all destructions of Empire, and forein inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations? Why could not that have weather'd out the storm, as well as most sorts of Manufactures: which, though they began as soon, or before the other, yet they have remain'd, through all such changes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alter'd; except for the better? The Reason of this is evident. It is, because <hi>Philosophy</hi> had been spun
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99266:68"/>
out, to so fine a thread, that it could be known but only to those, who would throw away all their whole Lives upon it. It was made too subtile, for the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>gross</hi> conceptions of men of business. It had before in a measure been banish'd, by the Philosophers themselves, out of the World; and shut up in the shades of their walks. And by this means, it was first look'd upon, as most <hi>useless</hi>; and so fit, soonest to be <hi>neglected.</hi> Whereas if at first it had been made to converse more with the senses, and to assist familiarly in all occasions of <hi>human life</hi>; it would, no doubt, have been thought needful to be preserv'd, in the most <hi>Active,</hi> and <hi>ignorant</hi> Time. It would have escap'd the fury of the Barbarous people; as well as the Arts of <hi>Ploughing, Gard'ning, Cookery, making Iron and Steel, Fishing, Sailing,</hi> and many more such necessary handicrafts have done.</p>
            <p>But it is too late to lament this error of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; seeing it is not now to be repair'd. It is enough, that we gather from hence; that by bringing <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> down again to mens sight, and practice, from whence it was flown away so high: the <hi>Royal Society</hi> has put it into a condition of standing out, against the Invasions of <hi>Time,</hi> or even <hi>Barbarisme</hi> it self: that by establishing it on a firmer foundation, than the <hi>airy Notions</hi> of men alone, upon all the <hi>works of Nature</hi>; by turning it into one of the <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> of which men may see there is daily need; they have provided, that it cannot hereafter be extinguish'd, at the loss of a Library, at the overthrowing of a Language, or at the death of some few <hi>Philosophers:</hi> but that men must lose their <hi>eyes,</hi> and <hi>hands,</hi> and must leave off desiring to make their <hi>Lives</hi> convenient, or pleasant; before they can be willing to <hi>destroy</hi> it.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Plague</hi> was indeed an irreparable dammage to the whole Kingdom: but that which chiefly added to the misery, was the <hi>time,</hi> wherein it happen'd.

            <p>Yet when on the one side, I remember, what <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation</hi> these scourges of mankind have left behind them; and on the other when I reflect on the <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity,</hi> wherewith the English Nation did sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the mischiefs: I find, that I have not more reason to <hi>bewail</hi> the one, than to <hi>admire</hi> the other.</p>

               </note>From this <hi>observation</hi> my mind begins to take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and to presage, that as this <hi>terrible Disease,</hi> and <hi>Conflagration</hi> were not able to darken the honour of our <hi>Princes Armes</hi>; so they will not hinder the many noble <hi>Arts,</hi> which the <hi>English</hi> have begun under his <hi>Reign</hi> on the strength of these hopes, and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I will now return to my former thoughts, and to the finishing of my interrupted <hi>design.</hi> And I come with the more earnestness to perfect it, because it seems to me, that from the sad effects of these disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, there may a new, and a powerful <hi>Argument</hi> be rais'd, to move us to double our labours, about the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>New City</hi> is to be built, on the most advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Seat of all <hi>Europe,</hi> for Trade, and command. This therefore is the fittest Season for men to apply their
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99266:70"/>
thoughts, to the improving of the <hi>materials</hi> of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and to the inventing of better <hi>models,</hi> for <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Roofs, Chimnies, Conduits, Wharfs,</hi> and <hi>Streets:</hi> all which have been already under the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Royal Society</hi>: and that too, before they had such a sad occasion of bringing their <hi>observations</hi> into practice. The mortality of this <hi>Pestilence</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all others of later Ages. But the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it should rather enliven than damp our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.</hi> When mankind is overrun with such horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble invasions of <hi>Death,</hi> they should from thence be universally alarm'd, to use more diligence about pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting them for the future.</p>
            <p>It is true, that terrible <hi>evil</hi> has hitherto in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, been generally too strong, for the former reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of <hi>Art.</hi> But why should we think that it will continue so for ever? Why may we not believe, that in all the vast compass of Natural virtues of things yet conceal'd, there is still reserv'd an <hi>Antidote,</hi> that shall be equal to this <hi>poyson?</hi> If in such cases we only accuse the <hi>Anger</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> or the <hi>Cruelty</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> we lay the blame, where it is not justly to be laid. It ought rather to be attributed to the <hi>negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> of men themselves, that such <hi>difficult Cures</hi> are without the bounds of their <hi>reasons power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If all men had desponded at first, and sunk under the burden of their own <hi>infirmities,</hi> almost every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wound, or pain of the least <hi>member,</hi> had been as deadly, as the <hi>Plague</hi> at this time. It was by much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, and use, that most of the mildest diseases be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>curable.</hi> And every first success of this kind, should alwayes strengthen our assurance of farther conquests, even over this greatest <hi>Terror</hi> of mankind. Distrust, and despair of our own indeavours, is as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99266:71"/>
great a hindrance in the progress of the <hi>True Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> as it is wont to be in the rise of mens private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. Whoever aims not at the <hi>greatest</hi> things, will seldome proceed much farther, than the <hi>least.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will make a right, and a fortunate Courtship to <hi>Nature,</hi> he cannot enterprise, or attempt too much: for <hi>She</hi> (as it is said of other <hi>Mistresses</hi>) is also a Mistress, that soonest yields to the <hi>forward,</hi> and the <hi>Bold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have hitherto describ'd the first <hi>Elements,</hi> on which the <hi>Royal Society</hi> arose, and supported its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings: I have trac'd its progress from the first private indeavours of some of its <hi>members,</hi> till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came united into a <hi>Regular constitution:</hi> and from thence I have related their first <hi>conceptions,</hi> and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,</hi> towards the setling of an universal, constant, and impartial survey of the whole <hi>Creation.</hi> There now remains to be added in this Third part of my <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> an Account of the <hi>Incouragements</hi> they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from abroad, and at home; and a Particular Enumeration of the <hi>Principal Subjects,</hi> about which they have been emploi'd since they obtain'd the <hi>Royal Confirmation.</hi>

               </note>I will first begin with the <hi>esteem,</hi> which all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil world abroad has conceiv'd of their <hi>Enterprize.</hi> And I mention this with the more willingness, because I believe, that our <hi>Nation</hi> ought justly to be reprov'd, for their excess of Natural <hi>bashfulness,</hi> and for their want of care, to have their most excellent things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to Strangers with the best advantage. This silent, and reserv'd humour has no doubt been very prejudicial to us, in the judgment, that our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours have often made, not only concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99266:71"/>
of our <hi>Learning,</hi> but also of our <hi>Political affairs.</hi> I will therefore trespass a little on this <hi>disposition</hi> of my <hi>Countrymen,</hi> and affirm, that as the <hi>English</hi> name does manifestly get ground, by the bravery of their <hi>Arms,</hi> the Glory of their <hi>Naval strength,</hi> and the spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their <hi>Commerce</hi>: so there has been a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble addition to its renown, by the success, which all our <hi>Neighbours</hi> expect from this <hi>Assembly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is evident, that this <hi>searching Spirit,</hi> and this affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>sensible Knowledge,</hi> does prevail in most Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries round about us. 'Tis true, the conveniences for such labours, are not equal in all places. Some want the assistance of others <hi>hands</hi>; some the contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others <hi>purses:</hi> some the benefit of excellent <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,</hi> some the <hi>Patronage</hi> of the Civil <hi>Magistrates</hi>: But yet according to their several <hi>powers,</hi> they are every where intent on such <hi>practical Studies.</hi> And the most considerable effects of such attempts throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> have been still recommended to this <hi>Society,</hi> by their <hi>Authors,</hi> to be examin'd, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, or corrected.</p>

From their <hi>Physicians, Chirurgeons,</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomists,</hi> it has receiv'd many faithful <hi>Relations</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>Cures:</hi> from their most judicious <hi>Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> the Fruits of their <hi>Voyages:</hi> from their most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

And, to instance once for all, it has been affectionately invited to a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>correspondence</hi> by the <hi>French Academy</hi> of <hi>Paris:</hi> In which invitation, there is one expression, that ought not to be pass'd over in silence: that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>English Nation,</hi> to have many advantages, for the propagating of <hi>Real Philosophy,</hi> which are wanting to all others. This Confession is true. Yet these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, unless they had been improv'd by this <hi>insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> had been only as those, that we have for fishing, objections, and arguments of our sloth.</p>

               <hi>Royal Society</hi> has met with great veneration; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by several Testimonies, in their late <hi>Printed Books,</hi> which have been submitted to its Censure: by many <hi>Curiosities</hi> of <hi>Mechanick Instruments,</hi> that have been transmitted to it: and by the <hi>Addresses</hi> which have been sent from their <hi>Philosophical Inquirers.</hi> For which kinds of Enterprises the temper of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Nation, is admirably fit, both in respect of their peculiar dexterity in all sorts of manual <hi>Arts,</hi> and also in regard of the plain, and unaffected sincerity of their <hi>manners</hi>: wherein they so much resemble the <hi>English,</hi> that we seem to have deriv'd from them the composition of our <hi>minds,</hi> as well as to have descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from their <hi>Race.</hi>

               </note>But not to wander any farther in <hi>particulars,</hi> it may perhaps in <hi>general</hi> be safely computed, that there has been as large a communication of Forein <hi>Arts,</hi> and <hi>Inventions,</hi> to the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> within this small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of time, as ever before did pass over the <hi>English</hi> Channel since the very first transportation of <hi>Arts</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our <hi>Island.</hi> And that this benefit will still increase by the length of time is indubitable, from the <hi>Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which has been given to the <hi>Scholars, Nobility, Embassadours,</hi> and Forein <hi>Princes,</hi> who of late years have travell'd hither, to behold a <hi>Country,</hi> which had been the Stage of so famous a War, and so miraculous a Peace. All these have still visited the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> as one of the first, and Noblest <hi>Fruits</hi> of our <hi>restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> From hence they have return'd home, with a free engagement of their assistance: the <hi>men of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> assuring it of a contribution of their <hi>Labours,</hi> and the <hi>Statesmen,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of their <hi>Authority,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, in satisfying all <hi>Philosophical Quaeries,</hi> with which they have been plentifully furnish'd.</p>
            <p>It would be a useless pomp to reckon up a <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> of their <hi>Names:</hi> especially seeing they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready recorded with gratitude, in a more lasting <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument,</hi> The <hi>Register</hi> of the <hi>Society.</hi> Only it will not, I think, be amiss, if I mention the visit of one <hi>Prince,</hi> because it may afford us a profitable observation. When the Duke of <hi>Brunswyck and Lunenbourgh</hi> was introduc'd into their weekly <hi>Assembly,</hi> and had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd his name to their <hi>Statutes</hi>: there was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99266:73"/>
to the Custom, one of the <hi>Fellows</hi> appointed, to interpret to him, what Experiments were produc'd, and examin'd at that meeting. But his <hi>Highness</hi> told them, that it was not necessary, they should put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to that trouble: for he well understood our Language, having been drawn to the study of it, out of a desire of reading our <hi>Philosophical Books.</hi> From whence there may this conclusion be made, that if ever our <hi>Native Tongue</hi> shall get any ground in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> it must be by augmenting its <hi>Experimental Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi> Nor is it impossible, but as the <hi>Feminine</hi> Arts of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and <hi>Gallantry</hi> have spread some of our Neighbouring Languages, to such a vast extent: so the <hi>English Tongue</hi> may also in time be more enlarg'd, by being the Instrument of conveying to the World, the <hi>Masculine</hi> Arts of <hi>Knowledge.</hi>

will be present at the Meetings of the Society, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as conveniently we can: especially at the anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary Elections, and upon extraordinary occasions: and that we will observe the Statutes and Orders of the said Society: Provided, that whenever any of us shall signifie to the President under his hand, that he desires to withdraw from the Society, he shall be free from this Obligation for the future.</p>
                        <p>Every Fellow shall pay his admission money, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards contribution towards the defraying of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Observations and Experiments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>The business of their weekly Meetings shall be, To or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, take account, consider, and discourse of Philosophical Experiments, and Observations: to read, hear, and discourse upon Letters, Reports, and other Papers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Philosophical matters, as also to view, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon the productions and rarities of Nature, and Art: and to consider what to deduce from them, or how they may be improv'd for use, or discovery.</p>
                        <p>The Experiments that be made at the charge of the Society. Two Curators at least shall be appointed for the Inspection of those which cannot be perform'd before the Society: by them the bare report of matter of Fact shall be stated and return'd.</p>

They have bestow'd much consideration, on the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of Fruits and Trees</hi>; And the <hi>King</hi> has made <hi>Plantations</hi> enough, even almost to repair the ruines of a Civil War.

               <note place="margin">§. XXVIII. <hi>And the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Genius of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </note>By these, and many other instances it appears, that the <hi>King</hi> has not only given succour to the <hi>Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> in the prosecution of their <hi>labours</hi>; but has also led them on in their <hi>way,</hi> and trac'd out to them the paths, in which they ought to tread. And with this propitious inclination of his <hi>Majestie,</hi> and the highest <hi>Degrees</hi> of men, the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> it self irresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stibly conspires. If we reflect on all the past times of <hi>Learning</hi> in our <hi>Island</hi>; we may still observe some remarkable <hi>accidents,</hi> that retarded these <hi>studies,</hi> which were still ready to break forth, in spight of all opposition.</p>
            <p>Till the union of the two houses of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> the whole force of our <hi>Country</hi> was ingag'd in Domestick Wars, between the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Nobility,</hi> or in the furious contentions between the divided Families: unless sometimes some magnanimous <hi>Prince,</hi> was able to turn their strength, to forreign conquests. In King <hi>Henry the seventh,</hi> the two <hi>Roses</hi> were joyn'd. His Government was like his own
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99266:84"/>
temper, <hi>close, severe, jealous, avaricious,</hi> and withall <hi>victorious,</hi> and <hi>prudent:</hi> but how unprepar'd his time was for new discoveries, is evident by the slender ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that he made of the proposition of <hi>Columbus.</hi> The Reign of King <hi>Henry the eighth,</hi> was <hi>vigorous, haughty, magnificent, expensive, learned.</hi> But then the alteration of <hi>Religion</hi> began, and that alone was then sufficient to possess minds of men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Government</hi> of King <hi>Edward the sixth</hi> was contentious, by reason of the factions of those who manag'd his childhood: and the shortness of his life depriv'd us of the fruits, that might have been expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, from the prodigious beginnings of the <hi>King</hi> himself. That of <hi>Queen Mary</hi> was <hi>weak, melancholy, bloody</hi> against the Protestants, obscur'd by a forreign Marriage, and unfortunate by the loss of <hi>Calais.</hi> That of <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> was <hi>long, triumphant, peaceable</hi> at home, and <hi>glorious</hi> abroad. Then it was shewn, to what height the <hi>English</hi> may rise, when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by a <hi>Prince,</hi> who knows how to govern their hearts, as well as hands. In her dayes the <hi>Reformation</hi> was setled, commerce was establish'd, and <hi>Navigation</hi> advanc'd. But though knowledge began abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to spring forth, yet it was not then seasonable for <hi>Experiments</hi> to receive a <hi>publick incouragement:</hi> while the writings of antiquity, and the controversies between us, and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were not fully studied, and dispatch'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>King Iames</hi> was happy in all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of <hi>Peace,</hi> and plentifully furnish'd with men of profound <hi>Learning.</hi> But in imitation of the <hi>King,</hi> they chiefly regarded the matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Disputation:</hi> so that even my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> with all his authority in the State, could never raise any <hi>Colledge
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99266:85"/>
of Salomon,</hi> but in a <hi>Romance.</hi> That of <hi>King Charles the First,</hi> began indeed to be ripe for such underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, by reason of the plenty, and felicity of the first years of his <hi>Government,</hi> and the abilities of the <hi>King</hi> himself: who was not only an inimitable <hi>Master,</hi> in <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>eloquence,</hi> but excell'd in very many practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Arts,</hi> beyond the usual custome of <hi>Kings,</hi> nay even beyond the skill of the best <hi>Artists</hi> themselves. But he alas! was call'd away from the studies of <hi>quiet,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> to a more dangerous, and a more honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. The chief Triumphs that Heaven reserv'd for him, were to be gather'd from his <hi>suffering virtues,</hi> in them he was only exceeded, by his Divine Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our <hi>Saviour:</hi> in imitation of whose Passion, those afflictions, and those thorns which the rude Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers design'd for his <hi>disgrace,</hi> and <hi>torment,</hi> became his <hi>glory,</hi> and his <hi>Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The late times of <hi>Civil War,</hi> and <hi>confusion,</hi> to make recompense for their infinite calamities, brought this advantage with them, that they stirr'd up mens minds from <hi>long ease,</hi> and a <hi>lazy rest,</hi> and made them <hi>active, industrious</hi> and <hi>inquisitive:</hi> it being the usual benefit that follows upon <hi>Tempests,</hi> and <hi>Thunders</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Skie,</hi> that they purifie, and cleer the <hi>Air,</hi> which they disturb. But now since the <hi>Kings</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, the blindness of the former <hi>Ages,</hi> and the miseries of this last, are vanish'd away: now men are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weary of the <hi>Relicks</hi> of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and satiated with <hi>Religious Disputes:</hi> now not only the <hi>eyes</hi> of men, but their <hi>hands</hi> are open, and prepar'd to <hi>labour:</hi> Now there is a universal <hi>desire,</hi> and <hi>appetite</hi> after <hi>knowledge,</hi> after the peaceable, the fruitful, the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing <hi>Knowledge</hi>: and not after that of antient Sects, which only yielded hard indigestible <hi>arguments,</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:99266:85"/>
or sharp <hi>contentions</hi> instead of <hi>food:</hi> which when the minds of men requir'd <hi>bread,</hi> gave them only a <hi>stone,</hi> and for <hi>fish</hi> a <hi>serpent.</hi>

            <p>Whatever they have hitherto attempted,<note place="margin">Sect. XXIX. <hi>The subjects about which they have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploi'd.</hi>
               </note> on these Principles, and incouragements, it has been carry'd on with a vigorous spirit, and wonderful good Fortune, from their first constitution, down to this day. Yet I overhear the whispers, and doubts of many, who demand, what they have done all this while? and what they have produc'd, that is answerable to these mighty hopes, which we indeavour, to make the world conceive of their undertaking?</p>
            <p>If those who require this Account, have themselves perform'd any worthy things, in this space of time; it is fit, that we should give them satisfaction. But they who have done nothing at all, have no reason to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> for not having done as much, as they fancy it might. To those therefore who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite it to work, by their examples, as well as words and reproofs, methinks it were a sufficient Answer, if I should only repeat the particulars, I have already mention'd, wherein the <hi>King</hi> has set on foot a <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> in the Ornaments, and Advantages of our Country. For though the original praise of all this is to be ascrib'd to the Genius of the <hi>King</hi> himself: yet it is but just, that some honour should thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to this Assembly, whose purposes are conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Majesties performances of that Nature: Seeing all the little scandals, that captious humours have taken against the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> have not risen from their general proceedings; but from a few pretended offences, of some of their private Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: it is but reason, that we should alledge in their
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99266:86"/>
commendation, all the excellent Designs, which are begun by the <hi>King,</hi> who has not only stil'd himself their <hi>Founder,</hi> but acted as a particular <hi>Member</hi> of their Company.</p>
            <p>To this I will also add, that in this time, they have pass'd through the first difficulties of their <hi>Charter,</hi> and Model: and have overcome all oppositions, which are wont to arise, against the beginnings of great things. This certainly alone were enough to free them from all imputation of idleness, that they have fram'd such an Assembly in six years, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet brought about in six thousand. Besides this the world is to consider, that if any that think, the whole compass of their work might have come to a sudden issue: they seem neither to understand the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> nor the extent of their task. It was never their aim, to make a violent dispatch. They know that precipitancy in such matters, was the fault of the Antients: And they have no mind, to fall into the same error, which they indeavour to correct. They began at first on so large a Bottom, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, the whole Frame should be suddenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated. 'Tis true, they that have nothing else to do, but to express, and adorn conclusions of Knowledge already made, may bring their Arts to an end, as soon as they please. But they who follow the slow, and intricate method of Nature, cannot have the seasons of their productions, so much in their own power. If we would alwayes exact from them, daily or week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly harvests; we should wholly cut off the occasions of very many excellent Inventions, whose subjects are remote, and come but seldome under their consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. If we should require them, immediately to reduce all their labours, to publick, and conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99266:86"/>
use, by this dangerous speed, we should draw them off from many of the best Foundations of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Many of their noblest discoveries, and such as will hereafter prove most serviceable, cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly be made to turn to profit. Many of their weightiest, and most precious <hi>Observations,</hi> are not alwayes fit to be expos'd to open view: For it is with the greatest Philosophers, as with the richest Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, whose Wares of greatest bulk and price, lie commonly out of sight, in their Warehouses, and not in their Shops.</p>
            <p>This being premis'd, I will however venture to lay down a brief draught of their most remarkable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: which may be reduc'd to these following heads: The Queries, and Directions, they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven abroad: the Proposals, and Recommendations they have made: the Relations they have receiv'd: the Experiments they have try'd: the Observations they have taken: the Instruments they have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the Theories that have been proposed: the Discourses they have written, or publish'd: the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pository, and Library: and the Histories of Nature, and Arts, and Works, they have collected.</p>
            <p>Their manner of gathering,<note place="margin">Sect. XXX. <hi>Their Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</hi>
               </note> and dispersing <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> is this. First they require some of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Fellows, to examine all Treatises, and Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the Natural, and Artificial productions of those Countries, in which they would be inform'd. At the same time, they employ others to discourse with the Seamen, Travellers, Tradesmen, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who are likely to give them the best light. Out of this united Intelligence from Men and Books, they compose a Body of Questions, concerning all
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99266:87"/>
the observable things of those places. These Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers being produc'd in their weekly Assemblies, are augmented, or contracted, as they see occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And then the Fellows themselves are wont to undertake their distribution into all Quarters, according as they have the convenience of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence: of this kind I will here reckon up some of the Principal, whose Particular heads are free to all, that shall desire Copies of them for their Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>They have compos'd Queries, and Directions, what things are needful to be observ'd, in order to the making of a Natural History in general: what are to be taken notice of towards a perfect History of the Air, and Atmosphere, and Weather: what is to be observ'd in the production, growth, advancing, or transforming of Vegetables: what particulars are requisite, for collecting a compleat History of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture, which is us'd in several parts of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>They have prescrib'd axact Inquiries, and given punctual Advice for the tryal of Experiments of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction, refraction, and condensation: concerning the cause, and manner of the Petrifaction of Wood: of the Loadstone: of the Parts of Anatomy, that are yet imperfect: of Injections into the Blood of Animals; and Transfusing the blood of one Animal into another: of Currents: of the ebbing, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sea: of the kinds, and manner of the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Oysters: of the Wonders, and Curiosities ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable in deep Mines.</p>

               <head>The HISTORY of the ANSWERS RETURN'D BY Sir <hi>PHILIBERTO VERNATTI</hi> Resident in <hi>Batavia</hi> in <hi>Iava Major,</hi> To certain Inquiries sent thither by Order of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and recommended by Sir <hi>ROBERT MORAY.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Q. 1. <hi>Whether Diamonds and other Precious Stones grow again after three or four years, in the same places where they have been digged out?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Never, or at least as the memory of man can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>Whether the Quarries of Stone in</hi> India, <hi>neer</hi> Fetipoca, <hi>not far from</hi> Agra, <hi>may be cleft like Logs, and sawn like Planks, to ciel Chambers, and cover Houses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> What they are about the Place mentioned, I have not as yet been well informed; but in <hi>Persia</hi> not far from <hi>Cyrus</hi> where the best Wine groweth, there is a sort of hard Stone which may be cleft like Firr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, as if it had a grain in it: the same is at the Coast <hi>Cormandel</hi> about <hi>Sadraspatuam</hi>; where they make but a mark in the Stone, set a wedge upon it, with a wooden hammer, as thick and thin as they please; it is used commonly for pavement in houses, one foot square, and so cheap, that such a stone finely polish'd costs not above six pence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:99266:88"/>Q. 3. <hi>Whether there be a Hill in</hi> Sumatra <hi>which burneth continually, and a Fountain which runneth pure Balsom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There is a Hill that burneth in <hi>Sumatra</hi> neer <hi>Endrapoer</hi>; but I cannot hear of any such Fountain; and I believe that the like Hill is upon <hi>Iava Major</hi> opposite to <hi>Batavia</hi>: for in a clear morning or even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from the Road a man may perfectly perceive a continual smoak rise from the top and vanish by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little. I have often felt Earthquakes here, but they do not continue long; in the year 1656. or 57. (I do not remember well the time) <hi>Batavia</hi> was cover'd in one afternoon, about two of the Clock, with a black dust, which being gathered together, was so ponderous, that it exceeded the weight in Gold. I, at that time, being very ill, did not take much notice of it, but some have gathered it, and if I light upon it shall send you some. It is here thought, it came out of the Hill: I never heard of any that had been upon this Hills top: <hi>Endrapeor</hi> is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a mighty unwholsome place, as likewise all others where Pepper grows; as <hi>Iamby Banjar, Balingtoan, &amp;c.</hi> though some impute it to the Hills burning.</p>
               <p>As for the Fountain it is unknown to us, except <hi>Oleum Terrae</hi> is meant by it, which is to be had in <hi>Suma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> but the best comes from <hi>Pegu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 4. <hi>What River is that in</hi> Java Major <hi>that turns Wood into Stone?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There is none such to our knowledge; yet I have seen a piece of Wood with a Stone at the end of it; which was told me, that was turned into Stone by a River in <hi>Pegu</hi>; but I took it but for a Foppery; for divers <hi>Arbusta</hi> grow in Rocks, which being appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99266:89"/>
curiously, may easily deceive a too hasty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</p>
               <p>Q. 5. <hi>Whether it be true, that upon the Coast of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin <hi>in</hi> Sumatra, <hi>the Sea, though it be calm, groweth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high when no rain falls, but is smooth in rain, though it blows hard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Sometimes, but not alwayes; the Reason is this, that <hi>Achin</hi> lieth at the very end and corner of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> as may be seen by the Map, open in the main Ocean, so that the Sea comes rowling from the <hi>Cabo de bona Esperanca,</hi> and all that way unto it, and it is natural to the Sea to have a continual motion, let it be never so calm; which motion cannot be called a Wave, neither have I any English for it at present, but in Dutch we call it, <hi>Deyninge van Dee Zee,</hi> and the calmer it is, the higher; the natural motion of the Sea elevates very slowly the water; so that I have seen Ships and Junks tossed by these <hi>Deynings</hi> in a calm, (when there is scarce wind enough to drive a bubble) that a man can scarce stand in them; some say this motion proceeds from boysterous winds at Sea far distant. That rain beats down the swelling of these <hi>Deynings</hi> (especially if it be vehement) proceeds naturally from its weight and impetuosity. And it is observed, that about <hi>Achin</hi> the Mountains are high and steep, from whose tops boysterous, called <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> come suddenly (like a Granado cast) falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, are accompanied commonly with a great shower of rain, and last not above a quarter, or at the most, half an hour, which is too short a time to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb the Sea, or to cause a contrary motion in it, being shelter'd by these Mountains.</p>
               <p>Q. 6. <hi>Whether in the Island of</hi> Sambrero, <hi>which lyeth Northwards of</hi> Sumatra, <hi>about eight degrees Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99266:89"/>
latitude, there be found such a Vegetable as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> James Lancaster <hi>relates to have seen, which grows up to a Tree, shrinks down when one offers to pluck it up into the ground, and would quite shrink unless held very hard? And whether the same, being forcibly pluck'd up, hath a worm for its root, diminishing more and more; according as the Tree groweth in greatness; and as soon as the Worm is wholly turned into the Tree, rooting in the ground, and so growing great? And whether the same plucked up young turns, by that time it is dry, into a hard Stone, much like to white Corral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I cannot meet with any that ever have heard of such a Vegetable.</p>
               <p>Q. 7. <hi>Whether those Creatures that are in these parts plump and in season at the full Moon, are lean and out of season at the new, find the contrary at the</hi> East-Indies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I find it so here, by Experience at <hi>Batavia,</hi> in Oysters and Crabs.</p>
               <p>Q. 8. <hi>What ground there may be for that Relation, concerning Horns taking root, and growing about</hi> Goa?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Inquiring about this, a Friend laught, and told me it was a Jeer put upon the <hi>Portuges,</hi> because the Women of <hi>Goa</hi> are counted much given to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</p>
               <p>Q. 9. <hi>Whether the</hi> Indians <hi>can so prepare that stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifying Herb</hi> Datura, <hi>that they make it lye several dayes, months, years, according as they will have it, in a mans body, without doing him any hurt, and at the end kill him, without missing half an hours time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>China</hi> men in this place, have formerly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Datura</hi> as a Fermentation, to a sort of Drink much beloved by the Souldiers and Mariners, called <hi>Suyker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bier,</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:99266:90"/>
which makes them raging mad, so that it is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den strictly under the penalty of a great pain to make use of the same.</p>
               <p>Q. 10. <hi>Whether those that be stupified by the juyce of this Herb</hi> Datura, <hi>are recovered by moystning the soles of their feet in fair water?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No. For I have seen divers Souldiers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners fall into the Rivers and Ditches, being stupified by their drink aforesaid, who were rather worse after they were taken out, than better.</p>
               <p>Q. 11. <hi>Whether a</hi> Betel <hi>hath such contrariety to the</hi> Durion, <hi>that a few leaves thereof put to a whole shopful of</hi> Durions, <hi>will make them all rot suddenly? And whether those who have surfeited on</hi> Durions, <hi>and thereby overheated themselves, do by laying one leaf of</hi> Betel <hi>cold upon the heart, immediately cure the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and recover the Stomach? This</hi> Betel <hi>being thought to preserve those</hi> Indians <hi>from Tooth-ach, loose Gums, and Scurvey, and from stinking breath; some of it is desired to be sent over with the fruit</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reica, <hi>and the other Ingredients, and manner of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I have seen that <hi>Betel</hi> leaves in a short time will spoil a <hi>Durion,</hi> take away his nature, and turn a fat creamy substance into water. Commonly those that eat great quantities of Durions, eat a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel</hi> afterwards as a <hi>Correctorium</hi>; but of laying a leaf upon the heart, I have never heard. As for the other qualities of the <hi>Betel,</hi> I believe they are good, if not abused; as most of the <hi>Indians</hi> do, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are without it in their mouths, no not sleeping, which corrodes their teeth, and makes them as black as Jet: It draws from the head the Flegmatick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which are voided by spitting; so we use it:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99266:90"/>
but the <hi>Indians</hi> swallow down their spittle, together with the juyce of the <hi>Betel,</hi> and the <hi>Areica.</hi> The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of preparing it is easie, being nothing but the <hi>Nut leaf</hi> and <hi>Calx viva,</hi> of which last each one adds as much as pleaseth his palat. There is a sort of Fruit called <hi>Sivgboa,</hi> which is used with the <hi>Areica,</hi> instead of <hi>Betel,</hi> and can be dried and transported as well as the <hi>Areica,</hi> and hath the same force, but a great deal more pleasant to the palate.</p>
               <p>Q. 12. <hi>Whether the</hi> Papayas, <hi>that beareth fruit like a Melon, do not grow, much less bear fruit, unless male and female be together?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> They grow, as I have seen two in the English-house at <hi>Bantam,</hi> and bear little fruit, which never comes to perfection; but if the male and female be together, the one bears great Fruit, the other nothing but Flowers.</p>
               <p>Q. 13 <hi>Whether the</hi> Arbor Triste <hi>sheds its Flowers at the rising of the Sun, and shut them again at the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Sun? And whether the distill'd water thereof</hi> (<hi>called</hi> Aqua di Mogli <hi>by the</hi> Portugals) <hi>may not be transported to</hi> England? <hi>And whether at the rising of the Sun the leaves of the</hi> Arbor Triste <hi>drop off as well as the flowers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There is two sorts of the <hi>Arbor Triste</hi>; one is called by the <hi>Portugals Triste de Die,</hi> the other <hi>Triste de Nocte</hi>; the one sheds his Flowers at the Rising, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Setting of the Sun; but neither of them shed their leaves. There is no body here that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the distilling of waters; some say this <hi>Aqua di Mogli</hi> is to be had at <hi>Malaca,</hi> for which I have writ, and shall send it if procurable.</p>
               <p>Q. 14. <hi>Whether the</hi> Arbor de Rays, <hi>or Tree of Root, propagate it self in a whole Forrest, by shooting up and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99266:91"/>
letting fall roots from its branches into the ground, that spring up again, and so on?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is true. And we have divers trees about <hi>Batavia,</hi> and the like adjacent Islands, above fifty foot in the diameter.</p>
               <p>Q. 15. <hi>What kind of fruit is that in</hi> Jucca, <hi>which grows immediately out of the Trees body; and is said to breed the</hi> Plague <hi>if eaten immoderately?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a fruit much like to <hi>Durion,</hi> which groweth in the same manner; hath a faint smell, and sweet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terish taste; for my part I do not affect them: The <hi>Plague</hi> is a Disease unknown amongst the <hi>Indians</hi>; but this fruit, as most others do, immoderately eaten, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses a <hi>Dirthea,</hi> which easily degenerates to a <hi>Tenasmus,</hi> by us called <hi>Peirsing,</hi> a dangerous Sickness, and worse than the <hi>Plague.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 16. <hi>What Poyson is it the King of</hi> Macassar <hi>in</hi> Colebees <hi>is said to have particular to himself, which not only kills a man immediately, that hath received the slightest Wound by a Dart dipt therein, but also within half an hours time, make the flesh, touched with it, so rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that it will fall like Snivel from the Bones, and whose poysonous Steam will soon fly up to a Wound made with an unpoysoned Dart, if the Blood be only in the slightest manner touch'd with a Dart infected with the Poyson? What certainty there is of this Relation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That there is such a Poyson in this Kings pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session is most certain; but what it is, no <hi>Christian</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ever knew right. By the Government of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold De Flamminge Van Outshorn</hi> divers have been tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured; yea, killed.</p>
               <p>Some say it is the Gall of a Venemous Fish, Others say it is a Tree which is so Venemous, that those who are condemned to die, fetch the Poyson, but not one
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99266:91"/>
of an hundred scape death: the Roots of this Tree are held an Antidote against the Poyson; but our People, when we had War with <hi>Macassar,</hi> found no Antidote like to their own or others Excrements; as soon as they felt themselves wounded, instantly took a dose of this same, which presently provoked to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and so, by repulsion, (as I perceive) and sweat, freed the Noble parts from further Infection. That a Wound should be infected by this Poyson, though inflicted by an impoysoned Weapon, is not strange to those who study Sympathy; And set belief in that much renowned Sympathetical Powder of Sir <hi>Kenelme Digby.</hi> Yet such Effects of the <hi>Macassars</hi> Arts are unknown to us.</p>
               <p>Q. 17. <hi>Whether in</hi> Pegu <hi>and other places in the</hi> East-Indies, <hi>they use a Poyson that kills by smelling, and yet the Poyson smell is hardly perceived?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this no Answer was return'd.</p>
               <p>Q. 18. <hi>Whether</hi> Camphire <hi>comes from Trees? What kind of Trees they are in</hi> Borneo, <hi>that are said to yield much excellent</hi> Camphire, <hi>as that one pound thereof is said to be worth an hundred of that of</hi> China <hi>and other places?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Camphire</hi> comes from Trees of an Excessive bulk, as you may see by the Chests which comes from <hi>Iappan</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> made of the same wood of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo;</hi> it comes likewise from Trees, which are said to stand in Sandy Ground. And drop like a Gum.</p>
               <p>But of late an Experiment is found in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> that the Root of a Cinnamon Tree yields as good <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire,</hi> as either <hi>Iappan,</hi> or <hi>China,</hi> of which I shall send you a pattern, being now to be had at present here; as also an Oyl extracted from the same Roots, which
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99266:92"/>
reserves something of the Cinnamon smell: but may be the fault of the Distiller</p>
               <p>Q. 19. <hi>Whether some of that rare Wood, called</hi> Palo d' Aquila <hi>and</hi> Calamba, <hi>of an Extraordinary value, even in the Country where it groweth, as in</hi> Siam <hi>about</hi> San <hi>and</hi> Patan, <hi>and in</hi> Cochinchina, <hi>may not be brought over; as also some of those strange Nests of</hi> Cochinchina, <hi>made by Birds upon Rocks, of a certaine viscous froth of the Sea, which Nests grown dry and hard, are said to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come transparent; and when dissolved in Water; serves excellently to season all their Meats?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If the Question be made, whether these things may be brought over by permission of the Company? I answer: as first, that their Laws forbid the transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all whatsoever, whether necessary to the conservation of Health, or acquisition of Wealth, or Rarities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if the <hi>Querie</hi> be concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and substance of the Wood and Nests: they are transportable, and can subsist without decaying many years. <hi>Lignum Aquilae</hi> is far inferiour to <hi>Calamba,</hi> though not easie to be discerned: the pound of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamba</hi> is worth in <hi>Iappan</hi> thirty, and sometimes forty pounds Sterling; the best comes from <hi>Cambodia,</hi> and seems to be the pith of the Tree <hi>Aquilae</hi> in <hi>Iappan,</hi> it is used as Incence to perfume Cloth, and Chambers. It is held for a great Cordial, and commonly used by that Nation, as also the <hi>Chineses: In Defectione spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum vitalium</hi>; as in <hi>Paralisi &amp; Nervorum laxatione &amp; impotentia:</hi> They rub it with <hi>Aqua Cynamoni</hi> upon a Stone, till the substance of the Wood is mixt, <hi>sicut pulpa,</hi> with the Water, and so drink it with Wine, or what they please: The Birds-nests are a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storative to Nature, and much used by the lecherous <hi>Chinaes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:99266:92"/>Q. 20. <hi>Whether the Animal call'd</hi> Abados, <hi>or</hi> Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noceros, <hi>hath teeth, claws, flesh, blood, and skin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea his very dung and water, as well as his horns, Antidotal? And whether the horns of those beasts be better or worse, according to the food they live upon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Their horns, teeth, claws, and blood are esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Antidotes, and have the same use in the <hi>Indian Pharmacopeia</hi> as the <hi>Therieca</hi> hath in ours: the flesh I have eaten is very sweet and short: some dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Receipt of your Letter, I had a young one no bigger than a Spaniel Dog, which followed me whereever I went, drinking nothing but <hi>Buffulo</hi> milk, lived about three weeks, then his teeth began to grow, and got a looseness, and died. 'Tis observed, that Children (especially of <hi>European</hi> Parents) at the breaking out of their teeth are dangerous sick, and commonly die of the scouring in these parts. His skin I have caused to be dryed, and so present it unto you, since fate permits not to send him you living; such a young one was never seen before: The food I believe is all one to this Animal, being that they are seldome seen but amongst withered Branches, Thistles and Thorns; so that the horn is of equal vertue.</p>
               <p>Q. 21. <hi>Whether the falsifying of the</hi> China <hi>Musk is not rather done by mixing Oxen and Cows Livers dried and pulverized with some of the putrified and concrete flesh and blood of the</hi> China <hi>Musk-cat, than by beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together the bare flesh and blood of this Animal,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Not answered.</p>
               <p>Q. 22. <hi>Whether there be two sorts of</hi> Gumlack, <hi>one produced from a certain winged</hi> Ant, <hi>the other the</hi> Exudation <hi>of a Tree: The first had in the Islands
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99266:93"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We know of none but such as drop from Trees, and comes from divers places in <hi>Siam, Cambodia, Pegu, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Q. 23. <hi>If the best</hi> Ambergreece <hi>be found in the Islands</hi> Socotora <hi>and</hi> Aniana, <hi>neer</hi> Java? <hi>To endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the getting of more certain knowledge; what it is, being reported to be bred in the bottom of the Sea like to a thick mud?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The best that is in the World comes from the Island <hi>Mauritius</hi>; And is commonly found after a Storm. The Hogs can smell it at a great distance; who run like mad to it, and devour it commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people come to it. It is held to be a <hi>Zeequal</hi> viscosity, which being dried by the Sun, turns to such a Consistence as is dayly seen. <hi>Myavines</hi> father <hi>Isaac Vigny</hi> a Frenchman in <hi>Oleron,</hi> hath been a great Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller in his time, and he told me, he sailed once in his youth through so many of these <hi>Zeequalen,</hi> as would have loaded ten thousand Ships; the like having been never seen; his Curiosity did drive him to take up some of those, which being dried in the Sun, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be the best <hi>Ambergreece</hi> in the World; I have seen one piece which he kept for a <hi>Memento,</hi> and another piece he sold for 1300 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling. This being discovered, they set sail to the same place where these <hi>Zeequelen</hi> appeared, and crusing there, to and fro, for the space of six weeks, but could not perceive any more. Where this place is scituated, I do not know; but Monsieur <hi>Gentillot,</hi> a French Captain in <hi>Holland,</hi> can tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. 24. <hi>To enquire of the</hi> Divers <hi>for Pearls staying long under water; whether they do it by the assistance of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99266:93"/>
anything they carry with them, or by long and often use get a trick of holding their breath so long, at the Isle of</hi> Baharen <hi>neer</hi> Ormus?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> What they do at <hi>Baharen</hi> is unknown to me, but since we have had <hi>Tute Corein</hi> in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> where very good Pearls grow, I hear the <hi>Divers</hi> use no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice. The manner is thus; at a set time of the year Merchants come from all parts, as likewise <hi>Divers</hi> with their Boats; each Boat hath a certain quantity of square Stones, upon which Stones the <hi>Divers</hi> goe down, and give a token to their Companions, when they think it time to be hal'd up: each Stone payes tribute to the Company. The Oyster or Shell-fish is not immediately open'd, but laid on heaps, or in holes at the Sea-side. When the Diving time is ended, the Merchants come, and buy these heaps, according as they can agree, not knowing whether they shall get any thing or no. So that this is a meer Lottery. This Pearl-fishing is dangerous, being the <hi>Divers</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make their Will, and take leave of their Friends, before they tread the Stone to go down.</p>
               <p>Q. 25. <hi>Whether Cinnamon when first gathered hath no tast at all, but acquires its taste and strength by fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen dayes sunning? And whether the Bark be gathered every two years in the Isle of</hi> Ceylon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Cinnamon Tree as it groweth, is so fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant, that it may be smelt a great way off before it be seen. And hath even then, a most Excellent taste; so that by Sunning it looseth rather than acquires any taste or force; the Tree being pill'd is cut down to the root; but the young Sprigs after a year or two give the best and finest Cinnamon.</p>
               <p>Q. 26. <hi>To learn, if it may be, what Art the Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workmen of</hi> Pegu, <hi>have to add to the colour of their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi>?</p>

               <p>Q. 27. <hi>To inquire after, and get, if possible, some of the Bones of the Fish called</hi> Caballa, <hi>which are so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in stopping blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Tis done, and they shall follow with the Dutch Ships.</p>
               <p>Q. 28. <hi>Whether at</hi> Hermita, <hi>a Town in</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>there are Tortoises, so big, that Men may ride upon them</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is reported, that there be extraordinary great ones there; I have seen some Sea-Tortoises here, of four foot broad, in oval form, very low leg'd, but of that strength, that a man may stand on one: The manner of catching them, is to turn them with a Fork upon their backs.</p>
               <p>Q. 29. <hi>Whether there be a Tree in</hi> Mexico, <hi>that yields Water, Wine, Vinegar, Oyl, Milk, Honey, Wax, Thread and Needles</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Cokos</hi> Trees yields all this and more; the Nut, while it is green, hath very good Water in it, the Flower being cut, drops out great quantity of liquor, called <hi>Sury,</hi> or <hi>Taywack,</hi> which drank fresh, hath the force, and almost the taste of Wine; grown sowr, is very good Vinegar; and distilled, makes very good Brandy, or <hi>Areck</hi>: The Nut grated, and mingled with water, tasteth like Milk: pressed, yields very good Oyl; Bees swarm in these Trees, as well as in other; Thread &amp; Needles are made of the leaves and tough twigs. Nay, to add something to this description; in <hi>Amboina,</hi> they make Bread of the body of the Tree, the leaves serve to thatch houses, and likewise sails for their Boats.</p>
               <p>Q. 30. <hi>Whether about</hi> Java, <hi>there be Oysters of that vast bigness, as to weigh three hundred weight</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:99266:94"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I have seen a Shell-fish, but nothing like an Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, of such a bigness, the Fish being salted, and kept in pickle, afterwards boyled, tasteth like Brawn in <hi>England,</hi> and is of an horney substance.</p>
               <p>Q. 31. <hi>Whether neer Malacca, there be found in the Gall of certain Swine, a Stone esteemed incomparably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> Bezoar?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In that Country, but very seldome, there grows a Stone, in the Stomack of a <hi>Porkapine,</hi> called <hi>Pedro Porco:</hi> of whose virtue there are large descriptions: and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are now so fond, that I have seen 400. Dollars of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> given for one no bigger than a Pidgeons Egg; There is sophistication as well in that as <hi>Bezoar, Musk, &amp;c.</hi> and every day new falshood, so that I cannot well set down here any rules, but must be judged by experience. A false one I send you, which doth imitate very near virtue, the true one, but is a great deal bigger, and of another colour.</p>
               <p>As for the Observations desired of the Islands Saint <hi>Helena,</hi> and <hi>Ascension,</hi> they may be better made by the English <hi>East-India</hi> men, which commonly touch at both places; but the <hi>Hollander</hi> never, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seldome.</p>
               <p>Q. 32. <hi>Whether it be winter at the East-side of the Mountain</hi> Gates, <hi>which comes from the North to Cape</hi> Comoryn, <hi>whilst it is summer on the West-side? and</hi> Vice versa.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not only there, but likewise on the Island of <hi>Zeylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 33. <hi>In what Country</hi> Lignum Alloes <hi>is found, whether it be the Wood of a Tree? or the Root of a Tree? How to know the best of the Kind?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Lignum Alloes, Lignum Paradisi, Calamba,</hi> are <hi>Synonyma,</hi> the same: And the same Wood comes most
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99266:95"/>
from <hi>Cambodia,</hi> and <hi>Siam</hi>; but they say it it brought by the people of <hi>Lawlan,</hi> a Country about <hi>Cambodia,</hi> whence <hi>Musk,</hi> and <hi>Benzoin,</hi> and most <hi>Aromada</hi> come: it is easily distinguished from other Wood, by its strong scent and richness of Balm in it, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in its blackness: it is of great Value, and hard to be gotten here.</p>
               <p>The rest of the <hi>Queries</hi> are not answered, because the time is short since I received them, and especially, because I cannot meet with any one that can satisfie me, and being unsatisfied my self, I cannot nor will obtrude any thing upon you, which may hereafter prove fabulous; but shall still serve you with truth.</p>

                        <q>1. The Strength and Quarter of the Winds, and to register the Changes as often as they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; both which may be very conveniently shewn, by a small addition to an ordinary Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-clock.</q>

                  <q>Now that these and some other, hereafter to be mentioned, may be registred so as to be most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the making of comparisons, requisite for the raising <hi>Axioms,</hi> whereby the Cause or Laws of Weather may be found out; It will be desirable to order them so, that the Scheme of a whole Moneth, may at one view be presented to the Eye: And this may conveniently be done on the pages of a Book in folio, allowing fifteen dayes for one side, and fifteen for the other. Let each of those pages be divided into nine Columes, and distinguished by
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99266:98"/>
perpendicular lines; let each of the first six Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes be half an inch wide, and the three last equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly share the remaining of the side.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Let each Colume have the title of what it is to contain, in the first at least, written at the top of it: As, let the first Colume towards the left hand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the dayes of the Moneth, or place of the Sun, and the remarkable hours of each day. The second, the Place, Latitude, Distance, Ages and Phaces of the Moon. The third the Quarters and strength of Winds. The fourth the Heat and Cold of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The fifth the Dryness and Moisture of it. The sixth the Degrees of pressure. The seventh the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and appearances of the Sky. The eighth the Effects of the Weather upon other bodies, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Lightnings, or any thing extraordinary. The ninth general Deductions, Corollaries or Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisms, arising from the comparing the several <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> together.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Columes may be large enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what they are designed for, it will be necessary, that the particulars be expressed with some Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, as brief and compendious as is possible. The two first by the Figures and Characters of the Signs, commonly us'd in Almanacks. The Winds may be exprest by the Letters, by which they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in small Sea-Cards: and the degrees of strength by 1, 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according as they are marked in the contrivance of the Weather-cock. The degrees of Heat and Cold may be exprest by the Numbers appropriate to the Divisions of the <hi>Thermometer.</hi> The Dryness and Moisture, by the Divisions in the rim of the <hi>Hydroscope.</hi> The pressure by Figures denoting the height of the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder.</hi> But
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99266:98"/>
for the faces of the Sky, they are so many, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them want proper names; and therefore it will be convenient to agree upon some determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ones, by which the most usual may be in brief exprest. As let <hi>Cleer</hi> signifie a very cleer Sky with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Clouds or Exhalations: <hi>Checker'd</hi> a cleer Sky, with many great white round Clouds, such as are very usual in Summer. <hi>Hazy,</hi> a Sky that looks whitish, by reason of the thickness of the higher parts of the Air, by some Exhalation not formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Clouds. <hi>Thick,</hi> a Sky more whitened by a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter company of Vapours: these do usually make the <hi>Luminaries</hi> look bearded or hairy, and are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the cause of the appearance of Rings and Haloes about the <hi>Sun</hi> as well as the <hi>Moon. Overcast,</hi> when the Vapours so whiten and thicken the Air, that the <hi>Sun</hi> cannot break through; and of this there are very many degrees, which may be exprest by <hi>a little, much, more, very much overcast,</hi> &amp;c. Let <hi>Hairy</hi> signifie a Sky that hath many small, thin and high Exhalations, which resemble locks of hair, or flakes of Hemp or Flax: whose varieties may be exprest by <hi>straight</hi> or <hi>curv'd, &amp;c.</hi> according to the resemblance they bear. Let <hi>Water'd</hi> signifie a Sky that has many high thin and small Clouds, looking almost like water'd Tabby, called in some places a Mackeril Sky. Let a Sky be called <hi>Waved,</hi> when those Clouds appear much bigger and lower, but much after the same manner. <hi>Cloudy,</hi> when the Sky has many thick dark Clouds. <hi>Lowring,</hi> when the Sky is not very much overcast, but hath also under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath many thick dark Clouds which threaten rain. The signification of <hi>gloomy, foggy, misty, sleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, driving, rainy, snowy,</hi> reaches or racks <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99266:99"/>
&amp;c.</hi> are well known, they being very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly used. There may be also several faces of the Sky compounded of two or more of these, which may be intelligibly enough exprest by two or more of these names. It is likewise desirable, that the particulars of the eighth and ninth Columes may be entered in as little room, and as few words as are sufficient to signifie them intelligibly and plainly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It were to be wisht that there were divers in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the World, but especially in distant parts of this Kingdom, that would undertake this work, and that such would agree upon a common way somewhat after this manner, that as neer as could be, the same method and words might be made use of.

               <p>
                  <q>As for the Method of using and digesting those so collected Observations; That will be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageously considered when the <hi>Supellex</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; A Workman being then best able to fit and prepare his Tools, for his work, when he sees what materials he has to work upon.</q>

               <head>DIRECTION For the Observations of the Eclipses of the MOON. By Mr. <hi>ROOKE.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <q>EClipses of the Moon are observed for two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Ends; One <hi>Astronomical,</hi> that by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Observations with Calculations, the <hi>Theory</hi> of the <hi>Moons</hi> motion may be perfected, and the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles thereof reformed: The other <hi>Geographical,</hi> that by comparing among themselves Observations of the same <hi>Ecliptical Phases,</hi> made in divers places, the difference of <hi>Meridians,</hi> or <hi>Longitudes</hi> of those places may be discovered.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Knowledge of the <hi>Eclipses</hi> Quantity and Duration, the Shadows, Curvity and Inclination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conduce only to the former of these Ends: The exact time of the beginning, middle, and end of the <hi>Eclipses,</hi> as also in total ones, the beginning and end of total darkness is useful for both of them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But because these times considerably differ in Observations made by the bare eye, from those with a <hi>Telescope,</hi> and because the beginning of <hi>Eclipses</hi> and the end of Total darkness are scarce to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served exactly, even with Glasses (one not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble clearly to distinguish between the true shadow and <hi>Penumbra,</hi> unless one have seen, for some time before, the line, separating them, pass along upon the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99266:100"/>
surface of the <hi>Moon</hi>). And lastly, because in small partial <hi>Eclipses,</hi> the beginning and end (and in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ones of short continuance in the shadow, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and end of total darkness) are unfit for nice Observations, by reason of the slow change of apparences, which the oblique motion of the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow then causeth: For these Reasons I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound a Method particularly designed for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of the <hi>Geographical</hi> end in observing <hi>Lunar Eclipses</hi> free (as far as is possible) from all the mentioned inconveniences: For,</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>First, It shall not be practicable without a <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly, The Observer shall alwayes have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity before his principal Observation, to note the distinction between the true shadow and <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umbra.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly, It shall be applicable to those seasons of the <hi>Eclipse,</hi> when there is the suddenest altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the apparences. To satisfie all which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,</q>

               <head>A PROPOSAL For making WINE. By Dr. <hi>GODDARD.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>IT is recommended to the care of some skilful Planters in the</hi> Barbadoes, <hi>to try whether good Wine may not be made out of the Iuyce of Sugar-canes. That which may induce them, to believe this work to be possible, is this Observation, that the Iuyce of Wine, when it is dry'd, does alwayes granulate into Sugar, as appears in Raisins, or dry'd Grapes: and also that in those vessels wherein cute, or unfermented Wine is put, the sides are wont to be cover'd over with a crust of Sugar. Hence it may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd, that there is so great a likeness of the liquor of the Cane, to that of the Vine, that it may probably be brought to serve for the same uses. If this attempt shall succeed, the advantages of it will be very considerable. For the English being the chief Masters of the Sugar Trade, and that falling very much in its price of late years, while all other outlandish productions are risen in their value: it would be a great benefit to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well as to our Western Plantations, if part of our Sugar, which is now in a manner a meer Drug, might be turn'd into Wine, which is a Forein Commodity, and grows every day dearer: especially seeing this might be done, by only bruising, and pressing the Canes, which would be a far less labour and charge, than the way, by which Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar is now made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:99266:107"/>These are some of the most advantageous <hi>proposals,</hi> they have scatter'd, and incourag'd in all places, where their Interest prevails. In these they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to many distinct, and separate <hi>Trials,</hi> those designs, which some private men had begun, but could not accomplish, by reason of their <hi>charge</hi>: or those which they themselves have devis'd, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd capable of success: or even those of which men have hitherto seem'd to despair. Of these, some are already brought to a hopeful issue: some are put in use, and thrive by the practice of the publick: and some are discover'd to be feasible, which were only before thought imaginary, and fantastical. This is one of the greatest <hi>powers</hi> of the true, and unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Experimenter,</hi> that he often rescues things, from the jaws of those dreadful Monsters, <hi>Improbability,</hi> and <hi>Impossibility.</hi> These indeed are two frightful words to weaker minds, but by Diligent and Wisemen, they are generally found to be only the excuses of <hi>Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and <hi>Ignorance.</hi> For the most part they lie not in the things themselves, but in mens false <hi>opinions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them they are rais'd by <hi>opinions,</hi> but are soon abolish'd by <hi>works.</hi> Many <hi>things,</hi> that were at first improbable to the minds of men, are not so to their eyes: many that seem'd unpracticable to their <hi>thoughts,</hi> are quite otherwise to their <hi>hands:</hi> many that are too difficult for their naked hands, may be soon perform'd by the same hands, if they are strengthen'd by <hi>Instruments,</hi> and guided by <hi>Method:</hi> many that are unmanageable by a few hands, and a few Instruments, are easie to the joynt force of a multitude: many that fail in one <hi>Age,</hi> may succeed by the renew'd indeavors of <hi>another.</hi> It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conceit or fancy of men alone, that is of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

                  <q>From this famous <hi>Pico,</hi> we could ken the <hi>Grand Canaria,</hi> fourteen leagues distant, <hi>Palma</hi> eighteen, and <hi>Gomera</hi> seven leagues, which interval of Sea seemed to us not much larger than the River of <hi>Thames</hi> about <hi>London</hi>: We discerned also the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> being distant above twenty leagues, and so to the outmost limits of the Sea much farther.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>So soon as the Sun appeared, the shadow of the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99266:111"/>
                     <hi>Pico</hi> seemed to cover, not only the whole Island, and the <hi>Grand Canaries,</hi> but the Sea to the very <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> where the top of the <hi>Sugar-loaf</hi> or <hi>Pico</hi> visibly appeared to turn up and cast its shade into the Air it self, at which we were much surprised: But the Sun was not far ascended, when the Clouds began to rise so fast, as intercepted our prospect both of the Sea, and the whole Island, excepting only the tops of the subjacent Mountains, which seem'd to pierce them through: Whether these Clouds do ever surmount the <hi>Pico</hi> we cannot say, but to such as are far beneath, they sometimes seem to hang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it, or rather wrap themselves about it, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly when the North-west Wind blows; this they call the <hi>Cappe,</hi> and is a certain prognostick of ensuing Storms.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>One of our company, who made this journey again two years after, arriving at the top of the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> before day, and creeping under a great Stone to shrowd himself from the cold Air (after a little space) found himself all wet, and perceived it to come from a perpetual trickling of water from the Rocks above him. Many excellent and very exuberant Springs we found issuing from the tops of most of the other Mountains, gushing out in great Spouts, almost as far as the huge Pine tree which we mention'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Having stay'd some time upon the top, we all descended by the Sandy way till we came to the foot of the <hi>Sugar-loaf,</hi> which being steep, even to almost a perpendicular, we soon passed. And here we met a Cave of about ten yards deep, and fifteen broad, being in shape like an Oven or <hi>Cupola,</hi> having a hole at the top which is neer eight yards over;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99266:112"/>
by this we descended by a Rope, which our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants held at the top, whilst the other end being fastned about our middles, we swing our selves, till being over a Bank of Snow, we slide down and light upon it. We were forced to swing thus in the descent, because in the middle of the bottom of this Cave, opposite to the overture at the top, is a round Pit of water, resembling a Well, the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face whereof is about a yard lower than the Snow, but as wide as the mouth at top, and is about six fathom deep. We suppose this Water not a Spring, but dissolved Snow blown in, or Water trickling through the Rocks.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>About the sides of the Grot, for some height, there is Ice and Icicles hanging down to the Snow. But being quickly weary of this excessive cold place, and drawn up again, we continued our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent from the Mountains by the same passages we went up the day before, and so about five in the evening arrived at <hi>Oratava,</hi> from whence we set forth, our Faces so red and sore, that to cool them, we were forced to wash and bathe them in Whites of Eggs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The whole height of the <hi>Pico</hi> in perpendicular is vulgarly esteem'd to be two miles and a half. No Trees, Herbs, or Shrubs in all the passage but Pines, and amongst the whiter Sands a kind of Broom, being a bushy Plant; and at the side where we lay all night, a kind of <hi>Cordon,</hi> which hath Stems of eight foot high, the Trunk near half a foot thick; every Stem growing in four squares, and emerging from the ground like Tuffets of Rushes; upon the edges of these Stems grow very small red Buttons or Berries, which being squeezed produc'd a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99266:112"/>
Milk, which lighting upon any part of a Horse, or other Beast, fetches off the hair from the skin immediately; of the dead part of this we made our fires all night. This Plant is also univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally spread over the Island, and is perhaps a kind of <hi>Euphorbium.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Of the Island <hi>Tenariffe</hi> it self, this account was given by a Judicious and Inquisitive Man, who liv'd twenty years in it as a Physician and Merchant. His opinion is, that the whole Island being a ground mightily impregnated with Brimstone, did in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times take fire, and blow up all or near upon all at the same time, and that many Mountains of huge Stones calcin'd and burnt, which appear eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where about the Island, especially in the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west parts of it, were rais'd and heav'd up out of the Bowels of the Earth, at the time of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conflagration; and that the greatest quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Sulphur lying about the Center of the Island, raised up the <hi>Pico</hi> to that height at which it is now seen. And he sayes, that any one upon the place that shall carefully note the scituation, and manner of these calcin'd Rocks how they lie, will easily be of that mind: For he sayes, that they lye for three or four miles almost round the bottom of the <hi>Pico,</hi> and in such order one above another al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to the very <hi>Sugar-loaf</hi> (as 'tis called) as if the whole ground swelling and rising up together by the Ascension of the Brimstone, the Torrents and Rivers of it did with a sudden Eruption rowl and tumble them down from the rest of the Rocks, especially (as was said before) to the South-west; For on that side, from the very top of the <hi>Pico</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to the Sea shore, lye huge heaps of these burnt
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99266:113"/>
Rocks one under another. And there remain to this time the very Tracts of the Rivers of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, as they ran over all this quarter of the Island, which hath so wasted the ground beyond recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that nothing can be made to grow there but Broom: But on the North side of the <hi>Pico,</hi> few or none of these Stones appear. And he concluded hence, that the <hi>Volcanio</hi> discharg'd it self chiefly to the South-west. He adds further, that Mines of several Mettals were broken and blown up at the same time. These calcin'd Rocks resembling some of them Iron-Ore, some Silver, and others Copper, Particularly at a certain place in these South-west parts called the <hi>Azuleios,</hi> being very high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, where never any English man but himself (that ever he heard of) was. There are vast quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of a loose blewish Earth intermixt with blew Stones, which have on them yellow rust as that of Copper and Vitriol: And likewise many little Springs of Vitriolate waters, where he supposes was a Copper Mine. And he was told by a Bell-founder of <hi>Oratava,</hi> that out of two Horse loads of this Earth, he got as much Gold as made two large Rings. And a <hi>Portuguez</hi> told him, who had been in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> that his opinion was, there were as good Mines of Gold and Silver there as the best in the <hi>Indies.</hi> There are likewise hereabout Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Waters and Stones covered with a deep Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron colour'd rust, and tasting of Iron. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he mentions a Friend of his, who out of two lumps of Earth or Ore, brought from the top of this side the Mountain, made two Silver-spoons. All this he confirms from the late instance of the <hi>Palme</hi> Island eighteen leagues from <hi>Tenariffa,</hi> where a
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99266:113"/>
                     <hi>Volcanio</hi> was fired about twelve years since, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence whereof made an Earthquake in this Island so great, that he and others ran out of their houses, fearing they would have fallen upon their heads. They heard the noise of the Torrents of flaming Brimstone like Thunder, and saw the fire as plain by night, for about six weeks together, as a Candle in the room: And so much of the Sand and Ashes, brought from thence by the Wind with Clouds, fell on his Hat, as fill'd a Sand box for his Ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In some part of this Island there grows a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Shrub which they call <hi>Legnan,</hi> which they bring for <hi>England</hi> as a sweet Wood: There are likewise Abricots, Peaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Standard, which bear twice a year, Pear-trees also which are as pregnant: Almonds of a tender shell; Palms, Plantains, Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Lemmons, especially the <hi>Pregnadas</hi> which have small ones in their bellies, from whence they are so denominated. Also they have Sugar Canes, and a little Cotton. <hi>Colloquintida, &amp;c.</hi> The Roses blow at <hi>Christmas.</hi> There are good Carnations, and very large; but Tulips will not grow or thrive there: Sampier clothes the Rocks in abundance, and a kind of Clover the Ground. Another Grass growing neer the Sea, which is of a broader leaf, so luscious and rank, as it will kill a Horse that eats of it, but no other Cattle. Eighty ears of Wheat have been found to spring from one root, but it grows not very high. The Corn of this is transparent and bright like to the purest yellow Amber, and one bushel hath produc'd one hundred and thirty in a seasonable year.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Canary birds (which they bring to us in
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99266:114"/>
                     <hi>England</hi>) breed in the <hi>Barancos</hi> or <hi>Gills,</hi> which the Water hath fretted away in the Mountains, being places very cold. There are also Quails, Partridges, larger than ours and exceeding beautiful, great Wood-pigeons, Turtles at Spring, Crows, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the Coast of <hi>Barbary</hi> appears the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. Bees are carried into the Mountains, where they prosper exceedingly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>They have wild Goats on the Mountains, which climb to the very top of the <hi>Pico</hi> sometimes: Also Hogs and multitudes of Conies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Of Fish they have the Cherna, a very large and excellent fish, better tasted than any we have in <hi>England</hi>; the Mero, Dolphin, Shark, Lobsters without the great claws, Mussles, Periwinkles, &amp; the Clacas, which is absolutely the very best Shell-fish in the world, they grow in the Rocks five or six un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one great shell, through the top holes whereof they peep out with their Nebs, from whence (the shells being broken a little more open with a stone) they draw them forth. There is likewise another Fish like an Eel, which hath six or seven tails of a span in length united to one head and body, which is also as short. Besides these, they have Turtles and Cabridos which are better than our Trouts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Island is full of Springs of pure Water ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting like Milk. And in <hi>Lalaguna</hi> (where the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not altogether so Limpid and Clear) they percolate it through a kind of spungy Stone cut in form of a Bason.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Vines which afford those excellent Wines, grow all about the Island within a mile of the Sea, such as are planted farther up are nothing esteem'd, neither will they thrive in any of the other Islands,

for the <hi>Guanchios</hi> or antient Inhabitants he gives this full Account.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>September</hi> the third, about twelve years since, he took his Journey from <hi>Guimar</hi> (a Town inhabited for the most part by such as derive themselves from the old <hi>Cuanchios</hi>) in the company of some of them, to view their Caves and the Bodies buried in them. This was a favour they seldome or never permit to any (having in great veneration the Bodies of their Ancestours, and likewise being most extreamly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any molestation of the Dead) but he had done several <hi>Eleemosinary</hi> Cures amongst them (for they are generally very poor, yet the poorest thinks himself too good to marry with the best <hi>Spaniard</hi>) which indeared him to them exceedingly, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways it is death for any Stranger to visit these Caves or Bodies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>These Bodies are sowed up in Goat-skins with thongs of the same, with very great curiosity, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the incomparable exactness and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the seams, and the Skins are made very close and fit to the body: Most of these Bodies are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, the eyes closed, hair on the head, ears, nose, teeth, lips, beard, all perfect, only discoloured and a little shriveld, likewise the <hi>Pudenda</hi> of both Sexes; He saw about three or four hundred in several Caves, some of them are standing, others lie on beds of Wood, so hardned by an art they had (which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Curar,</hi> to cure a piece of wood) as no Iron can pierce or hurt it He says, that one day being hunting a Ferret (which is much in use there) having a bell about his neck, ran after a Coney in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a hole, where they lost the sound of the bell; the owner being afraid he should loose his Ferret,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99266:115"/>
seeking about the Rock and Shrubs, found the mouth of a Cave, and entring in, was so afrighted, that he cryed out. It was at the sight of one of these Bodies, very tall and large, lying with his head on a great Stone, his feet supported with a little wall of stone, the body resting on a bed of Wood (as before was mention'd.) The fellow being now a little out of his fright entered it, and cut off a great piece of the skin that lay on the breast of this body, which, the Doctor sayes, was more flexible and pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant than ever he felt any Kids-leather-glove, and yet so far from being rotten, that the man used it for his Flail many years after.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>These bodies are very light, as if made up of straw, and in some broken Limbs he observed the Nerves and Tendons, and also some strings of the Veins and Arteries very distinctly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>His great care was to enquire of these people what they had amongst them of Tradition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the embalming and preservation of these Bodies: from some of the eldest of them (above a hundred and ten years of age) he received this Account, That they had of old one particular Tribe of men that had this Art amongst themselves only, and kept it as a thing sacred, and not to be communicated to the Vulgar: These mixt not with the rest of the Inhabitants, nor married out of their own Tribe, and were also their Priests and Ministers of Religion: That upon the Conquest of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> they were most of them destroy'd, and the Art lost with them, only they held some Traditions yet of a few Ingredients, that were made use of in this business. They took Butter of Goats Milk (some said Hogs Grease was mingled with it) which
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99266:115"/>
they kept in the Skins for this purpose, in this they boyled certain Herbs; first a sort of wild Laven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which grows there in great quantities on the Rocks: Secondly, an Herb called Lara, of a very gummy and glutinous Consistence, which now grows there under the tops of the Mountains only: Thirdly, a kind of Cyclamen or Sow-bread: Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wild Sage, growing plentifully in this Island: These with others bruised and boiled in the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, render'd it a perfect Balsame. This prepared, they first unbowelled the Corps (and in the poorer sort, to save charges, they took out the Brain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and these poor were also sew'd up in Skins with the hair on, whereas the richer sort were (as was said before) put up in Skins so finely and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly dressed, as they remain most rarely pliant and gentle to this day.) After the Body was thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, they had in readiness a <hi>Lixivium</hi> made of the Bark of Pine trees, with which they washt the Body, drying it in the Sun in Summer, and in Stoves in Winter, this repeating very often. Afterward they began their Unction with the Balsame, both without and within, drying it again as before. This they continued till the Balsame had penetrated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole habit, and the Muscles in all parts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared through the contracted Skin, and the Body became exceeding light: Then they sew'd them up in the Goat-skins, as was mention'd already. He was told by these Ancient People, that they have above twenty Caves of their Kings and great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, with their whole Families, yet unknown to any but themselves, and which they will never discover. Lastly, he sayes, that Bodies are found in the Caves of the <hi>Grand Canaria</hi> in sacks, and quite consumed,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99266:116"/>
not as these in <hi>Teneriffa.</hi> Thus far of the Bodies and embalming.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Antiently when they had no knowledge of Iron, they made their Lances of Wood hardned as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, some of which the Doctor hath seen. He hath also seen Earthen-pots so hard, that they cannot be broken; of these some are found in the Caves and old <hi>Bavances,</hi> and used by the poorer people that find them to boyl meat in. Likewise they did <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> Stone it self, that is to say, a kind of Slate called now <hi>Tobona,</hi> which they first formed to an edge or point as they had occasion to use it, either as Knives or Lancets to let blood withall.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Their Food is Barly roasted, and then ground with little Mills, which they made of Stone, and mixt with Milk and Honey: This they still feed on, and carry it on their backs in Goat-skins.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To this day they drink no Wine, nor care for Flesh. They are generally very lean, tall, active and full of courage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>He himself hath seen them leap from Rock to Rock, from a very prodigious height, till they came to the bottom, sometimes making ten fathom deep at one leap.</q>
               </p>
               <p>"The manner is thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>First they <hi>Tertiate</hi> their Lance (which is about the bigness of a half Pike) that is, they poise it in their hand, then they aim the point of it at any piece of a Rock, upon which they intend to light (sometimes not half a foot broad.) At their going off they clap their feet close to the Lance, and so carry their bodies in the Air. The point of the Lance first comes to the place, which breaks the force of their fall; then they slide gently down
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:99266:116"/>
by the Staffe, and pitch with their feet upon the very place they first designed, and from Rock to Rock till they come to the bottome. Their Novices sometimes break their necks in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>He added several Stories to this effect of their great activity in leaping down Rocks and Cliffs. And how twenty eight of them made an escape from the battlements of an extraordinary high Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in the Island, when the Governour thought he had made sure of them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>He told also (and the same was seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and another <hi>Canary</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant then in the company) That they whistle so loud as to be heard five miles off. And that to be in the same Room with them when they whistle, were enough to indanger breaking the <hi>Tympanum</hi> of the ear, and added, that he (being in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of one that whistled his loudest) could not hear perfectly for fifteen dayes after, the noise was so great.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>He affirms also, That they throw Stones with a force almost as great as that of a Bullet, and now use Stones in all their fights as they did ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</q>

               <head>An Account of a Dog dissected. By Mr. <hi>HOOK.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN prosecution of some Inquiries into the Nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration in several Animals; A Dog was dissected, and by means of a pair of bellows, and a certain Pipe thrust into the Wind-pipe of the Creature, the heart continued beating for a very long while after all the Thorax and Belly had been open'd, nay after the <hi>Diaphragme</hi> had been in great part cut away, and the <hi>Pericardium</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from the heart. And from several tyrals made, it seem'd very probable, that this motion might have been continued, as long almost as there was any blood left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the vessels of the Dog: for the motion of the Heart seem'd very little chang'd after above an hours times from the first displaying the <hi>Thorax</hi>; though we found, that upon removing the Bellows, the Lungs would presently grow flactid, and the Heart begin to have convulsive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but upon removing the motion of the Bellows, the Heart recovered its former motion, and the Convulsions ceased. Though I made a <hi>Ligature</hi> upon all the great Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels that went into the lower parts of its Body, I could not find any alteration in the pulse of the Heart; the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, it seems, being perform'd some other way. I could not perceiue any thing distinctly, whether the Air did unite and mix with the Blood; nor did in the least per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Heart to swell upon the extension of the Lungs: nor did the Lungs seem to swell upon the contraction of the Heart.</p>

                  <hi>Therefore to avoid all these, the Experiments I caus'd to be made before you in the Gallery of this Colledge, you may be pleased to remember were performed, first, taking only eight grains of Powder for the charge. Secondly, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Engine upon the floor, and thirdly, aiming by a thread at</hi> M, <hi>a mark about an Inch and</hi> ¾ <hi>from the mouth of the Gun (the edge of a knife being put for the mark the better to discern the line that was shot in) and they thus succeeded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the piece was fastned to the floor both at</hi> R <hi>and</hi> L, <hi>the Bullet then did so fully hit the mark, that it was divided by it into two parts, whose difference in weight was less than ten grains (about the thirty third part of the whole Bullet) although the lesser part was a little hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and that from which the neck of Lead was a little too close pared off: But when hindred from Recoiling only at</hi> R, <hi>the Bullet mist the mark towards</hi> L <hi>or</hi> A, <hi>for the whole Bullet, less than two grains excepted, went on that side: And in like manner when hindred from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiling at</hi> L, <hi>the Bullet mist the mark towards</hi> R <hi>or</hi> B, <hi>the whole Bullet, less than two grains excepted, passing the knife on that side thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I had the honour to make other Experiments with the same Engine, lately at</hi> White-Hall <hi>before his Majesty and his Highness Royal within the</hi> Tilt-yard <hi>Gallery, where there is the hearth of a Chimney raised a little above the floor, about the distance of thirteen feet from the opposite wall, against which I caused a Plank to be placed, and the Engine to be laid first against the middle of the Hearth, that it might not recoil at all, and that part of the board to be marked against which 'twas levelled, known by a line stretched from the Breech of the Peece unto the Board, directly over the sight and button, and the fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given (the charge being but eight grains of Powder
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:99266:128"/>
as before) the Bullet did fully hit the mark. Secondly, the Peece (charged and levelled in the same manner) was laid at the end of the Hearth next the Park, so that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little of the corner</hi> R <hi>rested against it, and then the Bullet miss'd the mark about an inch and a quarter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Park or</hi> A. <hi>The like being done at the other end of the Hearth, the Bullet then miss'd the mark as much the other way; and afterwards with double that charge something more, as before I had found it less with a smaller charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since this (at first designing only to experiment the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral distances that the bullet is carried wide of the mark with different charges of Powder) I made these Experiments following.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the first Colume whereof you have the corner stopt from recoiling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the second the grains of Powder with which the Peece was charged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the third the distance the Bullet was shot wide from the mark in inches, tenths, and parts of tenths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the fourth the side on which the Bullet was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the last the distance of the mark from the muzzle of the Gun in feet.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:99266:129"/>
                  <hi>Whence you may be pleased to observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, That the recoil of the Peece being hindred only at</hi> R <hi>or</hi> L, <hi>whatsoever be the charge of the Powder, the Bullet still misses the mark, placed at the mouth of the Gun, on the same side that the recoil is made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, That about twelve grains of Powder shoots widest from the mark at all distances above mentioned, on the same side that the Recoil is made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, That above forty eight grains of Powder shoots wide from the mark, placed at nine foot from the muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle of the Peece, on the contrary side to that on which the recoil is made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The cause of the first I cannot doubt to be the recoil of the Peece (from the force of the Powder) before the Bullet be parted from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The second is, as I conceive, because with less than twelve grains the Peece ceaseth to recoil before the Bullet be parted from it. And with more than twelve grains the Bullet is parted from the Peece before it hath recoiled so far: A greater power not moving a greater weight swifter (horizontally) in the same proportion that it doth the lesser.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for the third I have this to offer,</hi> viz <hi>Because the mouth of the Gun is moving sidewards whilst the Bullet is going out; Therefore the mouth of the Peece must be contiguous (at least) unto the Bullet on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary side to that on which the Peece recoils, some time after the separation made on the other side, and therefore the last impulse of the Bullet from the force of the Powder is on that side the Peece recoils, wherefore the Bullet must necessarily cross the Axis of the Peece, and that with a greater or lesser Angle, according to the force of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp; when this Angle therefore is greater than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of recoil, then must the Axis of that Cylinder in which
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:99266:130"/>
the Bullet moues cross the Axis of the mark, beyond which interjection the mark being placed, the Bullet must be carried necessarily wide of the mark on the contrary side to the recoil of the Peece.</hi>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>fek=flp=phm= <hi>the Angle of Recoile</hi> phn <hi>the Angle of Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made at the parting of the Bullet from the Peece. When</hi> phn&gt;phm (mh <hi>being alwayes parallel to</hi> fg) <hi>then must</hi> hn <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect</hi> fg <hi>if continued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some other Experiments I have also made with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Peece (about the same length, but of a bore neer two tenths of an inch less) and ordered in the same manner, and do find, that with a small charge the Bullet is shot (thence too) wide of the mark on the same side on which the Recoil is made, and with a full charge wide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary side.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:99266:130"/>
                  <hi>I caused besides two Pistol barrels of about five inches long to be placed upon Carriages with four Wheels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fig. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and loaded with lead, that they might not overturn when dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and both of equal weight, and an Iron</hi> Cylinder <hi>of the length of both their bores, and of the same diameter with a piece of Lead of weight equal to it. So that the piece of Lead affixed to either of these Guns (which of them I should please to charge) might equally poise the other with the Iron</hi> Cylinder. <hi>And thus indifferently charging either with eight grains more or less of Powder, and putting the Iron</hi> Cylinder <hi>home into both, the piece of Lead being affixed to that which held the Powder, and then both so set upon the floor and the Powder fired, I could not thereby discover, that the charged Peece, or the other, either of them, did certainly recoil more or less than the other, they rather seemed still to be equal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These few Experiments I have made since, the Barrel being first cut at the muzzle, parallel to a vertical plain passing the line</hi> CD.</p>

                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:99266:131"/>Besides these, there is another that I shall mention, and that is the Experiment it self, or the Double-Bottom'd-Ship, invented by Sir <hi>William Petty</hi>: of this I will venture to add a few words, and I think I may do it, without transgressing that Rule I had fix'd to my self, of not enlarging on the praise of particular Names, or Designs. For since the <hi>Experiment</hi> it self is lost, I hope I may securely speak of its advantages: seeing men are wont out of common humanity to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the commendations of dead Men, I trust I may commend a <hi>wreck'd Ship,</hi> without any fear of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy that may thence arise to the <hi>Author.</hi> In brief there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will say this of it, that it was the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Experiment,</hi> that has been made in this <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Experiments:</hi> if either we regard the great charge of the work, or the wonderful change it was likely to make in <hi>Navigation,</hi> or the great success, to which this first <hi>Attempt</hi> was arriv'd. Though it was at first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted with the doubts, and Objections of most <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of our <hi>Nation,</hi> yet it soon confuted them by <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</hi> It appear'd very much to excel all other forms of <hi>Ships,</hi> in sayling, in carriage, in security, and many other such benefits. Its first <hi>Voyage</hi> it perform'd with admirable <hi>swiftness.</hi> And though it miscarried after its return, yet it was destroyed by a common fate, and by such a dreadful <hi>tempest,</hi> as overwhelm'd a great <hi>Fleet</hi> the same night: so that the Antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks of <hi>Ships</hi> have no reason to triumph over that new <hi>Model,</hi> when of the threescore and ten sail that were in the same <hi>Storm,</hi> there was not one escap'd to bring the News.</p>
               <p>In a word, though this <hi>Invention</hi> succeeded not, while it was only supported by <hi>private Purses:</hi> it will undoubtedly produce great effects, if ever it shall
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:99266:131"/>
be retreiv'd upon the <hi>publick Stock</hi> of a <hi>Nation:</hi> which will be able to sustain the first hazards, and losses that must be allow'd to happen in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of all extraordinary <hi>Trials.</hi>

               <p>For <hi>Examples</hi> of this <hi>Head,</hi> I will only refer my
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:99266:132"/>
Reader to those which Mr. <hi>Graunt</hi> has publish'd on the <hi>Bills of Mortality</hi>; wherein the <hi>Author</hi> has shewn, that the meanest and most trivial matters may be so cultivated, as to bear excellent Fruit, when they come under the management of an accurate, and prudent <hi>Observer:</hi> For from those <hi>Papers,</hi> which went about so many years, through every Tradesmans hands, without any manner of profit, except only to the Clerks that collected them, he has deduc'd many true Conclusions, concerning the gravest, and most weighty Parts of <hi>Civil Government,</hi> and <hi>humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I am now passing away from their <hi>Experiments.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. XXXV. <hi>An Objection answered concerning the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>Observations,</hi> which have been their proper, and principal work: there comes before me an <hi>Objection,</hi> which is the more to be regarded, because it is rais'd by the <hi>Experimenters</hi> themselves. For it is their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon complaint, that there is a great <hi>nicety,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency,</hi> in the making of many <hi>Experiments:</hi> that their success is very often various, and inconstant, not only in the hands of <hi>different,</hi> but even of the same <hi>Triers.</hi> From hence they suggest their fears, that this continuance of <hi>Experimenters,</hi> of which we talk so much, will not prove so advantageous, though they shall be all equally cautious in <hi>observing,</hi> and faithful in recording their <hi>Discoveries:</hi> because it is probable, that the <hi>Trials</hi> of Future Ages will not agree with those of the present, but frequently thwart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Objection</hi> is strong, and material; and I am so far from diminishing the weight of it, that I am ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing to add more to it. I confess many <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments</hi> are obnoxious to failing; either by reason of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99266:133"/>
some <hi>circumstances,</hi> which are scarce discernable, till the work be over: or from the diversity of <hi>Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi> whereof some may be <hi>genuine,</hi> some <hi>sophisticated,</hi> some <hi>simple,</hi> some <hi>mix'd,</hi> some <hi>fresh,</hi> some may have lost their <hi>virtue.</hi> And this is chiefly remarkable, in <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Operations,</hi> wherein if the dissolvents be ill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd, if the <hi>Spirits</hi> be too much, or too little purify'd, if there be the least alteration, in the degree of <hi>Fire,</hi> the quantity of <hi>Matter,</hi> or by the negligence of those that attend it, the whole course will be overthrown, or chang'd from its first purpose.</p>
               <p>But what is now to be concluded from hence? shall this <hi>instability,</hi> and <hi>Casualty</hi> of <hi>Experiments,</hi> deter us from labouring in them at all? or should it not rather excite us to be more curious and watchful in their <hi>process</hi>? It is to be allow'd that such <hi>underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings</hi> are wonderfully hazardous and difficult; why else does the <hi>Royal Society</hi> indeavour to preserve them from degenerating, by so many <hi>forewarnings,</hi> and <hi>rules,</hi> and a <hi>Method</hi> so severe? It is granted, that their <hi>event</hi> is often uncertain, and not answerable to our expectations. But that only ought to admonish us, of the indispensable necessity of a jealous, and exact <hi>Inquiry.</hi> If the uncertainty proceeded from a constant irregularity of <hi>Nature,</hi> we had reason then to despair: but seeing it for the most part arises only from some defect or change in our progress, we should thence learn, first to correct our own miscarriages, before we cease to hope for the <hi>success.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let then the <hi>Experiment</hi> be often renew'd. If the same kinds, and proportions of <hi>Ingredients</hi> be us'd, and the same circumstances be punctually observ'd, the <hi>effect</hi> without all question will be the same. If some little variation of any of these, has made any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:99266:133"/>
a judicious, and well practis'd <hi>Trier</hi> will soon be able to discern the <hi>cause</hi> of it; and to rectifie it, upon the next repetition. If the difference of <hi>time,</hi> or <hi>place,</hi> or <hi>matter,</hi> or <hi>Instruments,</hi> will not suffer the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to be just the same in all points: yet something else will result, that may prove perhaps as beneficial. If we cannot alwayes arrive at the main end of our <hi>Labours,</hi> some less unsought <hi>Curiosities</hi> will arise. If we cannot obtain that which shall be useful for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, there may something appear that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct.</p>
               <p>It is strange that we are not able to inculcate into the minds of many men, the necessity of that <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of my Lord <hi>Bacons,</hi> that there ought to be <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> as well as of <hi>Fruit.</hi> It is their usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al word, <hi>What solid good will come from thence?</hi> They are indeed to be commended for being so severe <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actors</hi> of <hi>goodness.</hi> And it were to be wish'd, that they would not only exercise this vigour, about <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,</hi> but on their own <hi>lives</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>actions:</hi> that they would still question with themselves, in all that they do; what <hi>solid good</hi> will come from thence? But they are to know, that in so large, and so various an <hi>Art</hi> as this of <hi>Experiments,</hi> there are many degrees of usefulness: some may serve for real, and plain <hi>benefit,</hi> without much <hi>delight:</hi> some for <hi>teaching</hi> without apparent <hi>profit:</hi> some for <hi>light</hi> now, and for <hi>use</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; some only for <hi>ornament,</hi> and <hi>curiosity.</hi> If they will persist in contemning all <hi>Experiments</hi>; except those which bring with them immediate <hi>gain,</hi> and a present <hi>harvest:</hi> they may as well cavil at the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, that he has not made all the seasons of the year, to be times of <hi>mowing, reaping,</hi> and <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</hi>

                  <q>WHether the <hi>Nitre</hi> of the Antients be of the same species with the Salt which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known by the name of <hi>Salt peter,</hi> is various<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disputed by very learned Authors amongst the modern Physitians: on the negative side are <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiolus</hi> and <hi>Bellonius</hi>; the latter of which had the advantage, by the opportunity of his travels in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> to have often seen and handled them both, and is so positive as to pronounce, that in all <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> there is not one grain of <hi>Nitre</hi> to be found, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be brought from other parts, although at the time of his being in <hi>Grand Caire</hi> (which was about the year 1550.) it was so common there (as he sayes) that ten pounds of it would not cost a <hi>Mordin.</hi> Among those that hold the affirmative, the most eminent are <hi>Cardan</hi> and <hi>Longius</hi>; and it should seem the general vote of Learned men hath been most favourable to that Opinion, by reason that in all Latine Relations and Prescriptions, the word <hi>Nitrum</hi> or <hi>Halinitrum</hi> is most commonly used for <hi>Salt-peter.</hi>
                  </q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:99266:141"/>
                  <q>I have often enquired amongst our <hi>London</hi> Drugsters for <hi>Egyptian Nitre,</hi> and if I had been so fortunate as to have found any, I doubt not but I should have been able to have put an end to that Question by a Demonstration; that is, by turning the greatest part of it into <hi>Salt-peter.</hi> However, the Observations I have made in my own private Experiments, and in the practice of <hi>Salt-peter men</hi> and Refiners of <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> seem to give me suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground to suspect, that the confidence of those, who hold them to be several Salts, proceedeth chiefly from their being unacquainted with the various <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> in the making and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining of it: and also their comparing double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined <hi>Salt-peter</hi> (of which Gunpowder is made) with that description of <hi>Nitrum</hi> and <hi>Aprhonitrum</hi> in the tenth chapter of the one and thirtieth Book of <hi>Plinies Natural History</hi> (the only tolerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of that Salt that hath been handed to us from Antiquity) where he tells us, That <hi>Aphroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum</hi> was <hi>Colore penè purpureo,</hi> and <hi>Egyptian Nitre Fuscum &amp; Lapidosum,</hi> adding afterward, <hi>Sunt ibi Nitrariae in quibus rufum exit a colore terrae,</hi> which is sufficient to have hinted to any one but mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately versed in the modern way of ordering <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> that the Antients were not at all skilled in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining their <hi>Nitre</hi> from the Earth and common Salt that is usually mingled with it, nor from that foul yellow Oyl, which, it seems, did accompany their <hi>Nitre,</hi> as well as it doth our <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance; for <hi>Pliny</hi> takes notice of it, when he mentions the removing the <hi>Nitre</hi> (after it is grain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) out of the <hi>Nitrariae,</hi> saying, <hi>Hic quoque natura olei intervenit, ad scabiem animalium utilis:</hi> And
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:99266:142"/>
indeed this greasie Oyl (which the Workmen call <hi>Mother of Salt-peter,</hi> and perhaps is but the crude and unripe part of it) doth by nature so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully adhere to every part else of the <hi>Peter</hi> (it may be ordained for the nutriment and augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it) that the separation of it is the sole cause of the great charge and labour that is required to the refining of <hi>Peter:</hi> otherwise the <hi>Peter</hi> will be yellow, or brown, or some other dark colour. And <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 104. <hi>Exercit. sect.</hi> 15. saith, <hi>Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris purpurae quasi splendor quidam in salis-petrae-ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris sepenumero est a nobis observatus</hi>; and he that shall boyl a Lixivium past through a <hi>Salt-peter</hi>-earth, up to a consistence, without filtring it through ashes, or giving the Salt leave to Chrystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize, may perhaps find something not unlike the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre</hi> of the Antients.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To make this doubt yet clearer, it will require your patience to observe a few short remains out of the same <hi>Pliny,</hi> concerning the production of <hi>Nitre</hi>; saith he, <hi>Exiguum Nitri fit apud Medos, candescenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus siccitate convallibus quod vocant Halmirhaga: minus etiam in Thracia juxta Philippos sordidum Terra quod appellant Agrium.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This agrees very exactly with what I have been informed of by a Refiner of <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> that near <hi>Sophia, Santa-Cruz,</hi> and several other places in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> he hath seen <hi>Salt-peter</hi> shoot out of the ground (as thick and white as a hoar frost) on many bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and desart Lands; only he adds, that this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens not till the beginning of the rains in <hi>August,</hi> or <hi>September</hi>; and that it is the falling of the fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water that causes the <hi>Salt-peter</hi> to shoot out into little Chrystals; and that the people of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:99266:142"/>
do no more but take it off the ground as clean as they can, and sell it to Merchant-Strangers. This is, sayes he, the <hi>Barbary Peter,</hi> which the Refiners buy commonly at twenty shillings <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Much after the same manner (by the relation of an <hi>India</hi> Merchant) is that great quantity of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> produced, which of late years hath been brought into <hi>England,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> from about <hi>Pegu</hi> in <hi>East-India,</hi> saving that the Natives do refine it once, before they sell it to the Merchants: But being not so skilful, to discharge it from the common Salt, which attends <hi>Peter,</hi> our Workmen do refine it again, before it be fit for Gun-powder.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The next remarque out of <hi>Pliny</hi> is, <hi>Aquae vero Nitrosae pluribus in locis reperiuntur, sed sine viribus Densandi</hi> (he means by the heat of the Sun in those places) <hi>Optimum Copiosumque in Clytis Macedoniae quod vocant Chalastricum candidum purumque proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum sali. Lacus est Nitrosus, exiliente è medio dulci fonticulo, ibi fit Nitrum circa Canis ortum, novenis diebus, totidemque cessat, &amp; rursus innatat &amp; deinde cessat, iis autem diebus quibus gignitur si fuëre imbres salsius Nitrum faciunt, Aquilones deterius quia Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius commovent limum. In Egypto autem confici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur multò abundantius sed deterius, nam suscum lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosumque est, fit penè eodem modo quo Sal: nisi quod Salinis mare infundunt, Nilum autem Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariis.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>How such great plenty of <hi>Nitre</hi> should be found in the Waters above mention'd will be no difficulty to conjecture, if we consider that Lakes are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles of Land floods, and that great Rains may easily bring it to the Lake in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> from the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:99266:143"/>
higher parts in the Country about it. And for the River <hi>Nile,</hi> there must needs be less scruple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, if we call to mind that once in a year, it sweeps with an impetuous overflow the burnt and barren Desarts of <hi>Africa</hi> under the <hi>Torrid Zone</hi>; where, by the relation of Travellers, those Sands are visibly full of <hi>Nitre,</hi> and those few Springs and Wells that are to be found there, are by that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so bitter, that the <hi>Mores</hi> and their Camels are forced to make a hard shift with them in their long journeys.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But when he comes to describe the <hi>Aphronitrum,</hi> he comes more home, both to the name and nature of our <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> in these words, <hi>Proxima aetas Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicorum tradidit, Aphronitrum in Asia Colligi in speluncis &amp; molibus distillans, dein sole siccant.</hi> And <hi>Scaliger</hi> speaking of <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> sayes, <hi>Est quaedam Nitri species inhaerens Rupibus, in quibus insolatur, ac propterea Salpetra dicitur.</hi> And I my self, for my own satisfaction in the point, have drawn very good <hi>Rock peter</hi> out of those <hi>Stiriae,</hi> which are usually found hanging like Icycles in Arched-cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and Vaults; and have been told, that a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian in <hi>Shropshire</hi> did perform great Cures by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Sal-prunellae,</hi> which he made only of Flower of Brimstone and those <hi>Stiriae.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But to steer more directly upon our immediate subject, <hi>Salt-peter</hi>; though it be likely, that the Air is every where full of a volatile kind of <hi>Nitre,</hi> which is frequently to be seen coagulated into fine white Salt, like Flower of Wheat (but by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry taste may be easily known to be <hi>Peter</hi>) sticking to the sides of Plastred-walls, and in Brick-walls to the Mortar between the Bricks, (in dry wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:99266:143"/>
or where the wall is defended from the rain) for Lime doth strongly attract it; though Dew and Rain do conveigh much of it to the Earth, and the Clouds seem to be spread out before the face of the Sun, either to imbibe some part of his influence, or to have a Salt generated in them, for to advance the fertility of the Earth, and certainly they return not without a blessing; for I have more than once extracted <hi>Salt peter</hi> out of Rain and Dew, but from the latter more plentifully, and yet even there, is <hi>Salt-peter</hi> accompanied with a greazy purple Oyl, in great plenty: Though (as I have found upon tryal) that most standing waters, and even deep Wells have some small quantity of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> in them; though the face of the Earth, if it were not impregnated with this Salt, could not produce Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables; for Salt (as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> sayes) is the first Rudiment of Life; and <hi>Nitre</hi> is as it were the life of Vegetables: Yet to be more sure of it, I made Experiment likewise there too, and found some little of it in fallows, and the Earth which Moles cast up in the Spring: Though I say the Air and Water want it not, yet is it not there to be had in any proportion, answerable to the charge in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it: And though the Earth must necessarily have great quantities thereof, generated or infused into it; yet in these temperate Countreys of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> it is no sooner dilated by Rain-water, or the Moisture of the Earth, but it is immediately apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the production or nutriment of some Plant, Insect, Stone, or Mineral; so that the Artist will find as little of it here to serve his turn, as in the other two Elements.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The only place therefore, where <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:99266:144"/>
be found in these Northern Countries, is in Stables, Pigeon-houses, Cellars, Barns, Ware-houses, or indeed any place, which is covered from the Rain, which would dissolve it, and (as I have said) make it vegetate; as also from the Sun, which doth rarifie it, and cause it to be exhaled into the Air; (For the same reason Husbandmen also might make dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or treble the profit they usually do of their Muck, if they would lay it up under a Hovel, or some covered place, until they carry it out upon their Land.) And I have been told by an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Workman, that no place yields <hi>Peter</hi> so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, as the Earth in Churches, were it not an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety to disturb the Ashes of our Ancestours, in that sacred Depository.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Provided alwayes, that the Earth be of good mould, and the better the mould is, the more <hi>Peter</hi> is produc'd, for in Clay or sandy Earth, little or none is to be found: The freer ingress the Air hath into a place, is still of more advantage, so that the Sun be excluded: And let the Earth be never so good, if it be laid on a brick or boarded floor, it will not be so rich in <hi>Peter,</hi> as if it have free communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the Exhalations of the lower parts of the Earth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In any place thus qualified, you cannot miss of good quantities of <hi>Peter,</hi> if it have not been drawn out in some years before; which a Workman will quickly find, after he hath digged the first spadeful of Earth, by laying a little of it on the end of his tongue, and if it tast bitter, he is sure of good store of mineral, (as they love to call it) that is, <hi>Salt-peter</hi>; if the Ground be good, it continues rich, to six or eight foot deep, and sometimes, but not often, to ten.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:99266:144"/>
                  <q>After the <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is extracted, if the Earth be laid wet into the same place again, it will be twenty years ere any considerable quantity grow there of it; but if the Earth be well dryed, it will come in twelve or fourteen: and if they mingle, with the dryed Earth store of Pigeons-dung, and mellow Horse-dung, and then temper it with Urine (as was usual before we were supplied with <hi>Peter</hi> from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>) it will be fit to dig again in five or six years. He that shall cast Water upon a Ground fit to dig for <hi>Peter,</hi> will only sink the Mineral deeper into the Earth; but he that throws Soap-suds on it, will quite destroy the <hi>Peter,</hi> (as the Workmen have a Tradition) and it very well deserves a further En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> and the way of drawing it out of the Earth, now in use, was a modern Invention, is generally concluded by all Authors; but whether we owe it to chance, or the sagacity of some great Wit, is as unknown, as the time when it was first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It seems to have many years preceeded the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gunpowder, which by the <hi>Germans</hi> is ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to <hi>Constantine Autlitzer,</hi> or <hi>Berthold Schwertz</hi> a Monk of <hi>Friburgh,</hi> and was, in all probability, not long discovered, when the Inventor (as <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> tells us) taught the use of Guns, to the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Fossa Claudia,</hi> when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that notable Victory over the <hi>Genoueses, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1380. For there is mention made, both of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> and <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> in the Writings of <hi>Geber,</hi> a <hi>Spanish More,</hi> and an <hi>Alchymist</hi>; but at what time he lived is unknown, though it be certain, some hundreds of years before <hi>Raimund Lully</hi>; who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:99266:145"/>
the year 1333. published some of his Books, wherein he treats of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> and <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi> It is no ill conjecture of <hi>Maierus,</hi> that the foresaid Monk, being a skilful Alchymist, had a design to draw a higher Spirit from <hi>Peter</hi> than the common <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and that he might better open the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Peter,</hi> he ground it with Sulphur and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal, by which Composure he soon became the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventour of Gun-powder.</q>

                  <head>The manner of making SALT-PETER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <q>IN the first place you must be provided of eight or ten Tubs, so large, that they may be able to contain about ten Barrows full of Earth, each of them. These Tubs must be all open at the top; but in the bottom of every one of them, you must make a hole near to that side you intend to place outermost, which hole you must fit very well with a Tap and Spigot on the outside downward. On the inside of the Tub, near the tap-hole, you must carefully place a large wad of straw, and upon that a short piece of board, which is all to keep the earth from stopping up the tap-hole. When you have placed your Tubs on their stands, at such a distance one from the other, that you may come with ease between them, then fill them up with such <hi>Peter-earth</hi> as you have chosen for your work, leaving only void about a spans breadth between the Earth and the edge of the Tub; then lay on the top of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:99266:145"/>
the Earth in each Tub, as near as you can to the middle, a rundle of Wicker, like the bottom of a Basket, and about a foot in diameter, and by it stick into the earth a good strong Cudgel, which must be thrust pretty near the bottom; the Wicker is to keep the Water, when it is poured on, from hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and disordering the Earth, and the Cudgel is to be stirred about, to give the Water ingress to the Earth upon occasion: Then pour on your Earth common cold Water, till it stand a hands breadth over the Earth: When it hath stood eight or ten hours loosen the Spigots, and let the Water rather dribble, than run into half Tubs, which must be set under the taps: This <hi>Lixivium</hi> the Workmen call their Raw-liquor; and note that if it come not clear at the first drawing, you must pour it on again, and after some little time draw it off, till it come clear, and of the colour of Urine.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If you are curious to know how rich your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is before boyling, you may take a Glass-vial, containing a quart, fill it with the common Water you use, then weigh it exactly; next fill the same Glass with your Liquor, and find the difference of weight, which compared with the quantity of all your Liquors, will give you a very near ghess, how much <hi>Salt-peter</hi> you are like to make by that boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Then pour on again, on the same Earth, more common Water, that it may bring away what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Earth of the former Liquor. This second Liquor is of no other use, but to be poured on new Earth, instead of common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because it contains some quantity of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> in it.</q>

                     <q>When this is done, turn out the useless insipid Earth out of the Tubs, which you must fill with new Earth, and continue this Operation, till you have in the same manner lixiviated all the Earth: Then fill your Copper with your Liquor, which Copper, for one of the Profession, must be about two hundred weight, and set strongly in a Furnace of brick-work; besides, on one side of your Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, you are to place a Tub full of your Liquor, which at a tap below may dribble as fast into the Copper, as the force of the Fire doth wast your Liquor, which Invention is only to save charges in Fewel. When you have boyled it up to that height, that a little of it, flirted off the finger on a live Charcoal, will flash like Gun-powder (which for the most part falls out to be after two dayes and a nights boyling) at what time, upon tryal, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight of the Liquor contains about five and thirty pound weight of <hi>Peter.</hi> But the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men seldom make use of any further indication, than by finding the Liquor hang like oyl on the sides of the Brasen-scummer, when 'tis dipped into it, which is a sign it is fit to be passed through the Ashes, which is done in this manner.</q>

                     <q>You must prepare two Tubs fitted after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the first, where you put your Earth, saving that at the bottom of these Tubs, you must lay Reeds or Straw a foot high, over them place loose boards, pretty neer one another, over them, a little more Straw (which is to keep the Ashes from the top, and to give the Liquor room to drein the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from them:) Then fill up your Tubs with any sort of Wood-ashes to half a foot of the top; Then pour on the foresaid Liquor, as it comes scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  <p>
                     <q>Note that toward the end of your boyling, there will arise great store of Scum and Froth, which must be carefully taken off with a great brass Scummer, made like a Ladle, full of little holes, and usually about that time it lets fall some common Salt to the bottom, which you must take up with the said Scummer, and lay it aside for another use.</q>

                     <q>When you find your Liquor thus ready to shoot, you must with great Iron Ladles lade it out of the Copper into a high narrow Tub for that purpose, which the Workmen call their settling Tub; and when the Liquor is grown so cool, that you can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure your finger in it, you shall find the common or cubick Salt begin to gravulate and stick to the sides of the Tub, then at the tap, placed about half a foot from the bottom, draw off your Liquor into deep wooden Trays, or Brass-pans, and the cooler the place is where you let them stand to shoot in, the better and more plentifully will the <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> be produc'd; but it will be of no good colour till it be refined, but will be part white, part yellow, and some part of it blackish.</q>

                     <q>The Salt which sticketh to the sides and bottom of the setling Tub is (as I have sayd) of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of common Salt; and there is scarce any Peter to be found but is accompanied with it, though no doubt some of this is drawn out of the Ashes by the second Liquors: If it be foul they refine it by it self, and about <hi>London</hi> sell it at good rates to those that salt Neats Tongues, Bacon, and Collar-Beef, for besides a savory taste, it gives a pleasing red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to most Flesh that is salted with it. <hi>Pliny</hi> sayes <hi>Nitrum obsonia alba &amp; deteriora reddit Olera viri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diora,</hi> whether Salt-peter doth so, I have not yet tryed.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>AFter you have made your Copper very clean, put in as much Water as you think will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve that quantity of <hi>Peter</hi> you purpose to Refine, when the Water is very hot cast in the <hi>Peter</hi> by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, stirring it about with a Ladle, that it may the sooner dissolve, then increase the Fire till your Liquor begin to boyle: In the mean time feel with the Scummer, whether there be at the bottom any Salt undissolv'd and take it out, for it is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Salt, and doth not so soon dissolve as the <hi>Peter</hi>; then as the Water boyls scim of the Froth that swims at the top of it as fast as it riseth; when it hath boyled to the height that a drop of it will coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late on a Plate, (as hath been said above in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Salt-Peter,</hi>) then cast in by degrees either a Pint of the strongest Wine-Vinegar, or else four Ounces of Allom beaten to powder (some choose burnt Allom,) and you shall observe a black Scum to rise on the top of the Liquor, which when you have allowed some time to thicken, you may easily take off with the Scummer; repeat this so often till no more Scum arises. Some do use to throw in a Shovel full of quick-Lime, and say it makes <hi>Peter</hi>

the whiter, and Rock the better; you must take great care all this while the Fire be not too strong, for while this is doing, the Liquor will be apt to boyl over, and will not easily be appeased without your great loss.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>When this is done, lade out the Liquor into a setling Tub, and cover it over with a Cloth, that it cool not too soon, and within an hour or two a thick yellow Faeces will fall to the bottom of the Tub, then quickly draw of the Liquor while it is hot, into the shooting Trays or Pans, and do as you did in making <hi>Peter,</hi> saving that you must cover the Trays with a Cloth, for then the Liquor will begin to shoot at the bottom, which will make the <hi>Peter-Rock</hi> into much fairer Chrystals, than otherwise it would: When no more <hi>Peter</hi> will shoot (which is commonly after two days,) pour off the Liquor that swims at the top, and put the <hi>Peter</hi> into a Tub with a hole at the bottom for to drain, and when it is dry, it is fit for use.</q>

                        <pb n="275" facs="tcp:99266:148"/>
go alway in Gun-powder, yet if you fulminate it in a Crucible, and burn of the volatile part with Powder of Coal, Brimstone, Antimony or Meal, there will remain a Salt, and yet so fixed (very unlike Common-Salt) that it will endure the force of almost the strongest Fire you can give it; which being dissolved into Water and Spirit of <hi>Nitre</hi> drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into it, till it give over hissing (which is the same with the Volatile part that was seperated from it in the fulmination) it will be again reduced to Chrystals of <hi>Peter,</hi> as it was at first, which noble Experiment the World hath already been taught by an honourable Member of this Society; with a train of such important Observations, as never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were raised from one Experiment.</q>

such Animals are but Caterers of it for Man; and others whom Natures bounty gratifies with a more lusty and delicious Dyet.</q>

               <head>THE HISTORY Of Making GUN-POWDER.</head>
               <p>
                  <q>THE materials of <hi>Gun-Powder</hi> are, <hi>Salt-Peter, Brimstone,</hi> and <hi>Coal</hi>; the <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi> must be both refined if you mean to make good <hi>Powder,</hi> and the Coal must be <hi>Withy</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> equal parts; for <hi>Withy</hi> alone is counted too soft, and some do commend <hi>Hazle</hi> alone to be as good as the other two.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The whole Secret of the Art consists in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Materials, the exact mixture of them, that in every the least part of <hi>Powder</hi> may be found all the Materials in their just proportion; then the Corning or making of it into Grains; and lastly the Drying and Dusting of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Proportion is very differently set down by several Authors; <hi>Baptista Porta</hi> tells us the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Powder</hi> is made of Four parts of <hi>Peter,</hi> one of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and one of <hi>Withy</hi> Coal: But the best <hi>Powder</hi> of 6, or 8. of <hi>Peter,</hi> and one a piece of the other, which agrees pretty well with <hi>Bonfadini</hi> a late <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Writer, in his Book of the Art of <hi>Shooting flying,</hi> where to make the best <hi>Gun-Powder</hi> he prescribes Seven parts of <hi>Peter,</hi> one of <hi>Brimstone,</hi> and of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle</hi> Coal an ounce less in every pound: <hi>Cardan</hi> sayes; <hi>Constat ex tribus Halinitri partibus, duabus
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:99266:150"/>
Saligni Carbonis atque una Sulphuris, Convenitque magnis Machinis: Sed Mediocribus Halinitri partes decem, Saligni carbonis tres, Sulphuris duas, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis verò Halinitri partes decem; Carbonis ligni nucis Avellonae sine nodis, tum Sulphuris partem unam sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularem: Langius</hi> appoints three of <hi>Peter,</hi> two of <hi>Withy</hi> Coal, and one of <hi>Brimstone</hi>: The <hi>English</hi> Author of Fire-Works sayes, that the proportions in <hi>England</hi> to make good, indifferent, and ordinary <hi>Powder</hi> is, 5.4. and 3. parts of <hi>Peter,</hi> to two of Coal and one of <hi>Brimstone.</hi> Our <hi>English</hi> Work-men are generally so curious of their secret, that I could not obtain the proportion of them without a promise of Secrecy: But when all is done their secret is not so much the way to make the best <hi>Powder,</hi> as the best way to get most mony by it; by substracting from the <hi>Peter,</hi> and making up weight with the Coal; when indeed there is so great a Latitude, that provided the Materials be perfectly mixt, you make good <hi>Powder</hi> with any of the proportions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mention'd; but the more <hi>Peter</hi> you allow it, it will still be the better, till you come to observe Eight parts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The next thing after the proportion, is the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, about which most of the workmens time and pains is bestowed: For first in a Horse-mill with two stones (like that with which they grind their Materials at the <hi>Glass-house</hi>) moving upon a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bottom, which is edged with boards set sloap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that what slips from under the stones may slide back again.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>They grind the Brimstone and Coal each of them apart by themselves as fine as possibly they can; then they sift each of them apart by themselves:
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:99266:150"/>
The Brimstone is sifted thorow Tiffany in a Bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-mill, such as the Bakers use for wheat-flower: The Coal is sifted thorow Lockram, in a bag made like a shirt sleeve; for the convenience of the Work-man it is done in a close Bin, with only two holes for him to put his arms in and shake the bag about. Whatsoever of each material is not small enough to sift thorow, is brought again to the Mill to be new ground.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>As for the <hi>Peter,</hi> that must in the Copper be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in as much water as will just take it up, and then the water must be boyled away till the <hi>Peter</hi> comes to the thickness of hasty-pudding. The reason of this operation is, because when the <hi>Peter</hi> is thus soft, the other materials will the easilier incorporate with it, and in the next place it will not wear the wooden pestles so much when it comes to the Mill, as when it is hard and dry.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>When the Materials are in this readiness, they are weighed (only the <hi>Peter</hi> is weighed before it is put to dissolve in the Copper) and by proportion are carried to the mingling Trough, which is made of boards, like a great Chest without a cover, being about eight foot long, four broad, and three foot high. The Coal is laid in first, the Brimstone next, and the Peter at top of all; Then two men with shovels stir and mingle them together for an hour, and then 'tis ready for the Mill.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Powder-mills are seldom made to move with any thing but water: The great water-wheel is made like that of an ordinary water-wheel, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over-shot or under-shot, according to the quantity of water they have: to the <hi>axis</hi> of this wheel, a little way within the Mill, is fastned a
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:99266:151"/>
lesser wheel called the Spar-wheel, with strong Cogs, which in their motion round take hold of the round slaves of another wheel of about the same diameter, set a little way above it, and fastned to the end of a beam of 15 or 16 foot long, laid parallel to the Horizon, with an iron gudgeon at the other end of it, to facilitate its motion round: This beam is called the round beam; out of it come a certain number of arms of about nine inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and three inches broad, which in their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round meet with other lesser armes (called Tapes) coming out of the Pestles (for so they call certain small quarters of Timber placed perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to the Horizon, about nine foot long and four inches broad; they are set in a slight frame to keep them steady); by these small arms the Pestles are lifted up about two foot and a half, and then let fall into a strong wooden Trough set under them, wherein the powder is put to be pounded.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Every Mill hath two Troughs, and about sixteen Pestles: every Pestle hath fastned to the lower end of it a round piece of <hi>Lignum Vitae,</hi> of about five inches long and three and a half diameter; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottom of the Trough, just where the Pestle is to fall, is let in another piece of <hi>Lignum Vitae,</hi> of the fashion and bigness of an ordinary Bowl, split according to its longest diameter: The Pestles are not lifted up all together, but alternatively, to make the Powder turn the better in the working; and for the same reason round Troughs are counted better than square.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To make excellent Powder it ought to be wrought thus thirty hours; but of late they will not afford it above eighteen or twenty hours: once
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:99266:151"/>
in eight hours they use to moisten the Powder with a little fair water; others who are more curious, put water something thickned with quick-lime; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers use White-wine Vinegar; others <hi>Aqua-vitae:</hi> But if it be not moistned with something once in eight hours, the Powder will grow dry, and in half an hour after it will take fire. As soon as the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grows dry, you may find it, though at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, by the noise of the Mill; for then the Pestles will rebound from the bottom of the Trough and make a double stroak. The only danger to the Mill is not from the Trough; for many times the iron Gudgeons grow hot for want of greasing, and then the dust that flies about will be apt to fire, and so the Mill blows up.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>From the Mill the Powder is brought to the Corning-house, of a middle temper between moist and dry. The way of corning it is with two hair Sieves joyn'd together, the upper Sieve inclosing some part of the hoop of the lower Sieve: The upper Sieve hath holes of the size you will have the Powder grained at; the holes of the lower Sieve are much lesser: The upper Sieve they call their corning Sieve, the lower their wet Dust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: They lay the Powder upon the upper Sieve some two inches thick; upon that a piece of heavy wood made like a Trencher, of about eight inches diameter and two and a half in thickness, called a Runner, which when the Sieve is moved, by its weight and motion forces the Powder thorow the upper Sieve, and that corns it. Then the lower Sieve receives the Powder, and lets the dust go thorow into a Bin, over which the Sieve is shaken, called the Dusting-Bin.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:99266:152"/>
                  <q>When the Powder is thus corned, it is laid about an inch and half thick on the drying Sieves, which are made of course Canvase fastned to slight frames of Deal about an ell long and some twenty inches broad; and thus it is carried into Stoves to dry.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Stove is commonly a little Room about eighteen or twenty foot square, with ranges of small Firr poles about two foot one above another, to lay the drying Sieves upon, but only on that side the fire is made. Besides a glass window to give light, there must be a small lover hole at the top of the Room, to let out the steam, else the Powder will not only be the longer a drying, but often by the return of the steam on the Sieves, the top of the Powder will be so crusted that the lower part will not dry. The Rome is heated by an Iron of about a yard high and half a yard broad, cast in the form of an Arch equal to a Semy-quadrant, and placed in the back of a Chimney, the fore part whereof is like a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; and to avoid danger, opens into another lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Room apart called the Stoke-hole.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Powder is brought into the Stove before it be heated, and is not taken out again till the Stove be cold; and about eight hours is required to the drying of it. In hot Countries the Sun is the best Stove, and a great deal of danger and charges that way avoided.</q>

                  <q>After the Powder is dried, it is brought again to the Corning-house, where it is again sifted over the dusting Bin in other double Sieves, but without any Runners. These Sieves have both of them smaller holes than the former: The upper Sieve is called the Separater, and serves to divide the great
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:99266:152"/>
corns from the lesser; the great corns are put by themselves, and serve for Cannon Powder: The lower Sieve is called the dry Duster, and retains the small corns (which serve for Musquet and Pistol) and lets fall the dust into the bin, which is to be mingled with fresh Materials, and again wrought over in the Mill.</q>

                  <q>IT were not incongruous to begin the History with a Retrospect into the very nature of Light it self (as to inquire whether the same be a Motion or else a Body;) nor to premise some Theorems about the Sun, Flame, Glow-worms, the eyes of some Animals, shining Woods, Scales of some Fishes, the dashing of the Sea, stroaks upon the eyes, the <hi>Bolonian</hi> Slate (called by some the Magnet of Light) and of other light and lucid bodies.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>It were also not improper to consider the very essentials of Colour and Transparencies (as that the most transparent bodies, if shaped into many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, present the eye with very many colours;) That bodies having but one single superficies, have none at all, but are suscipient of every colour laid
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:99266:153"/>
before them; That great depths of Air make a Blew, and great depths of Water a Greenish co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; That great depths or thicknesses of colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Liquors do all look Blackish (red Wine in a large Conical Glass being of all reddish colours between black at the top and white at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That most Vegetables, at one time or other, are greenish; and that as many things passing the Sun are blackned, so many others much whitened by the same: Other things are whitened by acid Fumes, as red Roses and raw Silks by the smoak of Brimstone.</q>

                  <q>I begin this History by enumerating all the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Materials and Ingredients which I understand to be or to have been used in any of the last afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Colorations, which I shall represent in various Methods, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the <hi>Mineral</hi> Family. They use Iron and Steel, or what is made or comes from them, in all true Blacks (called <hi>Spanish</hi> Blacks) though not in <hi>Flanders</hi> Blacks; <hi>viz.</hi> they use Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras, Steel-filings, and Slippe, which is the stuff found in the Troughs of Grind-stones, whereon
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:99266:155"/>
Edge-tools have been ground. They also use Pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Bow-dye, Scarlet, <hi>viz.</hi> they dissolve Bars of Pewter in the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> they use; and make also their Dying-kettles or Furnace of this Mettal.</q>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Litharge</hi> is used by some, though acknowledged by few, for what necessary reason I cannot learn, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to add weight unto Dyed Silk; <hi>Litharge</hi> being a calx of Lead, one of the heaviest and most colouring Mettals.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I apprehend <hi>Antimony</hi> much used to the same purpose, though we know there be a very tingent Sulphur in that Mineral, which affordeth variety of Colour by the precipitations and other operations upon it.</q>

                  <q>Of <hi>Mineral-Salts</hi> used in <hi>Dying</hi>; the chief is Allum; the very true use thereof seems to me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure enough, notwithstanding all the Narrations I could get from Dyers about it: For I doubt,</q>

                        <q>1. Whether it be used to make Common-water a fit <hi>Menstruum,</hi> wherewith to extract the Tingent particles of several hard Materials; for I find Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum to be used with such Materials as spend easy enough, as Brasill, Logwood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And withal, that the Stuffs to be dyed are first boyled in Allum-liquors, and the Allum afterwards (as they say) cleared from the said Stuff again, before any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour at all be applyed.</q>

                     <item>
                        <q>2. Whether it be used to scour the <hi>Sordes,</hi> which
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:99266:155"/>
may interpose between the <hi>Coloranda,</hi> and the Dying Stuff; and so hinder the due adhesion of the one unto the other: The boyling of several things first in Allum seeming to tend this way. But I find this work to be done in Cloth and Rugs, by a due scouring of the same in the Fulling-mills with Earth, and in Silk with Soaps, by which they boyl out the Gums and other <hi>Sordes,</hi> hindring or vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the intended Colours.</q>

                     <item>
                        <q>3. Whether Allum doth intenerate the Hairs of Wool, and Hair-stuff, as Grograins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may the better, receive and imbibe their Colours? Unto which opinion I was led by the Dyers; saying, that after their Stuffs were well boyled in Allum, that they then cleared them of the Allum again: But we find the most open Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died-Cottons and Silks, to have Allum used upon them; as well as the harder Hairs. Nor is Allum used in many Colours, <hi>viz.</hi> In no Woad or Indico Blews; and yet the Stuffs Dyed Blew, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any previous inteneration quickly tinged; and that with a slight and short immersion thereof into the Blew fat.</q>

                     <item>
                        <q>4. Whether it contribute to the Colour it self, as Copperas doth to Gals, in order to make a black; or as Juice of Lemmons doth to Cocheneel in the <hi>Incarnadives</hi>; or as <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi> impregnated with Pewter, doth in the Bow-Scarlet, changing it from a red Rose-Crimson to flame Colour. This use is certainly not to be denyed to Allum in some cases; but we see in other cases, that the same Colours may be Dyed without Allum, as well as with it, though neither so bright and lively, nor so lasting.</q>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <q>5. Wherefore Fifthly, I conclude (as the most
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:99266:156"/>
probable opinion) that the use of Allum is to be a <hi>Vinculum</hi> between the Cloth and the Colour, as clammy-Oyls and Gum-waters are in Painting and Limming; Allum being such a thing, whose particles and <hi>Aculei</hi> dissolved with hot Liquors will stick to the Stuffs, and pitch themselves into their Pores; and such also, as on which the particles of the Dying Drugs will also catch hold, as we see the particles of Copperas and other Crystallizing materials, do of Boughs and Twigs in the Vessel, where such Crystallization is made. A second use I imagine of Allum in Dying, to be the extracting or drying up of some such particles, as could not consist with the Colour to be superinduced, for we see Allum is used in the dressing of <hi>Alutas</hi> or white Leather, the which it dryeth, as the Salt of Hen-dung doth in Ox-hides, and as common Salt doth in preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Flesh-meats; for we know, a Sheep-skin newly flayed could not be Colour'd as Brasils are, unless it were first dressed into Leather with Allum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is necessary to the Colour, even although the Allum be, as it is, cleared out of the Leather again, before the said Colouration, with Bran, yelks of Eggs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore as Allum, as it were by accident, makes a wet raw skin to take a bright Colour by extracting some impedimental particles out of it; so doth it also out of other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, though perhaps less discernably.</q>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Another use I suppose of Allum, which is to brighten a Colour: For as we see the finest and most Glassie materials to make the most orient Colours, as Feathers, Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So certainly if by boyling Cloth in Allum, it become incrusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with particles, as it were of Glass, the tinging
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:99266:156"/>
of them yields more brightness, than the tinging of a Scabrous matter, (such as unallumed Cloth is) can do. <hi>Analogous</hi> hereunto I take the use of Bran, and Bran-liquors in Dying to be; for Bran yielding a most fine flower (as we see in the making of white-Starch;) I conceive that this flower entring into the pores of the Stuff, levigates their <hi>Superficies</hi> and and so makes the Colour laid on it, the more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, just as we see, that all woods, which are to be guilded are first smoothned over with white Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, before the Gold be laid on.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And indeed all other Woods are filled, not only as to their greater holes and Asperities, with <hi>Putty</hi>; but also their smaller Scabrities are cured by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Colours, before the Ultimate Colour intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be laid thereon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The next Mineral Salt is <hi>Salt-Peter,</hi> not used by ancient Dyers, and but by few of the modern. And that not, till the wonderfull use of <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> (whereof <hi>Salt-Peter</hi> is an ingredient) was observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Bow-Scarlet: Nor is it used now, but to brighten Colours by back-boyling them; for which use <hi>Argol</hi> is more commonly used. Lime is much used in the working of blew-fats, being of Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone calcined and called <hi>Calke,</hi> of which more hereafter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Of the <hi>Animal</hi> family are used about Dying, Cochineel (if the same be any part of an <hi>Animal</hi>) Urine of labouring men, kept till it be stale and stinking; Honey, Yelks of Eggs, and Ox-gall. The three latter so rarely; and as the conceits of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Work-men, and for Collateral uses (as to increase weight, promote fermentation, and to scour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) That I shall say very little more of them
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:99266:157"/>
in this place, only saying of Urine that it is used to scour, and help the fermenting and heating of Woad; it is used also in the blew-fats instead of Lime: It dischargeth the yellow (of which and blew, most Greens are compounded) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is alwayes used to spend <hi>Weld</hi> withal. Lastly, the stale Urine, or old mudd of pissing places, will colour a well scoured small piece of Silver, into a Golden colour, and it is with this (and not at all with the Bath-water) wherewith the Boys at <hi>Bath</hi> colour single pence; although the generality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve otherwise. Lastly it seems to me, that Urine agreeth much in its Nature with <hi>Tartarous Lixivia</hi>; not only because Urine is a Lye made of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in the body of <hi>Animals</hi>; nor because in the Receptacles of Urine, <hi>Tartarous</hi> stones are bred like as in Vessels of Wine; nor because Urine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges and abrades Colours as the <hi>Lixivia</hi> of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> or the deliquated Salts of <hi>Tartar</hi> do; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Sulphur-Lixivia</hi> do colour the superficies of Silver, as we affirmed of Urine; and the difference I make between Urine and <hi>Tartarous Lixivia</hi> is only this, that though the Salts of both of them seem by their effects in Dying, in a manner the same; yet that Urine is made and consists of Salt and Sulphur both.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Before we enter upon the <hi>Vegetable</hi> materials for Dying, we may interpose this Advertisement, That there are two sorts of Water used by Dyers, <hi>viz.</hi> River-water and Well-water: By the latter I mean in this place the Pump water in great Cities and Towns, which is a harsh Water wherewith one can scarce wash ones hands, much less scour them clean; nor will Soap dissolve in it, but remains in rolls and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:99266:157"/>
lumps: moreover the Flesh boyled in it becomes hard and reddish. The Springs rising out of large covered spaces (such as are great Cities) yield this Water, as having been percolated thorow more ground than other Water, and consequently been divested of its fatty earthy particles, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with saline substances in all the way it hath passed. The Dyers use this Water in Reds, and in other colours wanting restringency, and in the Dying of Materials of the slacker Contextures, as in Callico, Fustian, and the several species of Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-works. This Water is naught for Blews, and makes Yellows and Greens look rusty.</q>

                  <q>River-water is far more fat and oylie, sweeter, bears Soap; that is, Soap dissolves more easily in it, rising into froth and bubbles, so as the Water thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens by it. This Water is used in most cases by Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and must be had in great quantities for washing and rinsing their Cloathes after Dying.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Water is called by Dyers White Liquor; but there is another sort of Liquor called Liquor abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and that is their Bran-liquor, which is one part of Bran and five of River-water, boyled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an hour, and put into leaden Cisterns to settle. This Liquor when it turns sour is not good, which sourness will be within three or four days in the Summer time. Besides the uses afore-named of this Liquor, I conceive it contributes something to the holding of the Colour; for we know Starch, which is nothing but the flower of Bran, will make a clinging Paste, the which will conglutinate some things, though not every thing; <hi>viz.</hi> Paper, though neither Wood nor Mettals. Now Bran-liquors are used to mealy dying Stuffs, such as <hi>Mather</hi> is, being
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:99266:158"/>
the Powder or <hi>fecula</hi> of a Root; So as the flower of the Bran being joyned with the <hi>Mather,</hi> and made clammy and glutinous by boyling, I doubt not but both sticking upon the <hi>villi</hi> of the Stuff Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Mather</hi> sticks the better by reason of the starchy pastiness of the Bran-flower joyned with it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Gums have been used by Dyers about Silk, <hi>viz. Gum Arabick, Gum Dragant, Mastick,</hi> and <hi>Sanguis Draconis.</hi> These Gums tend little to the tincture of the said Silk, no more than Gum doth in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry writing Ink, which only gives it a consistence to stay just where the Pen delivers it, without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning abroad uncertainly: So Gum may give the Silk a glassiness, that is, may make it seem finer, as also stiffer; so as to make one believe the said stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness proceeded from the quantity of Silk close wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And lastly to increase weight; for if an ounce of Gum, worth a peny, can be incorporated into a pound of Silk, the said penny in the Gum produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth three shillings, the price of an ounce of Silk. Wherefore we shall speak of the use of each of the said four Gums, rather when we treat of Sising and Stiffening, than now, in a Discourse of Dying, where also we may speak of Honey and Molasses.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>We refer also the Descriptions of Fullers-earth, Soaps, Linseed-oyl, and Ox-galls, unto the head of Scouring, rather than to this of Dying.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Wines and <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> have been used by some particular Artists; but the use of them being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther constant nor certain, I omit further mention of them. The like I say of Wheaten-flower and Leaven.</q>

                  <q>Having spoken thus far of some of the Dying stuffs, before I engage upon the main, and speak more fully of those which have been but slightly touched upon already, I shall more Synoptically here insert a Catalogue of all Dying Materials, as well such as I have already treated upon, as such as I intend hereafter to describe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The three peculiar Ingredients for Black are Copperas, filings of Steel, and Slippe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Restringent binding Materials are Alder, Bark, Pomegranate Pills, Wallnut rinds and roots, Oaken Sapling Bark, and Saw-dust of the same; Crab-tree Bark, Galls, and Sumach.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Salts</hi> are Allum, Argol, Salt-peter, <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi> Pot-ashes, and Stone-lime; unto which Urine may be enumerated as a liquid Salt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Liquors are Well-water, River-water, Wine, <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> Vinegar, juyce of Lemmon, and <hi>Aqua-fortis:</hi> There is Honey used, and Molasses.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Ingredients of another <hi>Classis</hi> are Bran, Wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-flower, Yelks of Eggs, Leaven, Cummin-seed, Fenugreek-seed, Agarick, and Senna.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Gums are <hi>Gum Arabick, Dragant, Mastick,</hi> and <hi>Sanguis Draconis.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Smecticks or Abstersives are Fullers-earth, Soap, Linseed-oyl, and Ox-gall.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The other Metals and Minerals are Pewter, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degrease, Antimony, Litharge, and Arsenick.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But the <hi>Colorantia colorata</hi> are of three sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Blew, Yellow, and Red; of which Logwood, old Fustick, and Mather, are the <hi>Polychresta</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent &amp; common practices, being one of each sort. The Blews are Woad, Indico, and Logwood: The Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:99266:159"/>
are Weld, Wood-wax, and old Fustick, as also Turmerick now seldom used: The Reds are Red-wood, Brazel, Mather, Cochineel, Safflowrs, Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes-berries, and Sanders; the latter of which is seldom used, and the Kermes not often. Unto these <hi>Arnotto</hi> and young Fustick, making Orange colours, may be added, as often used in these times.</q>
               </p>
               <p>"In Cloth Dying wood-soot is of good use.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Having presented this Catalogue, I come now to give or enlarge the Description and Application of some of the chief of them, beginning with Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Copperas is the common thing us'd to dye Blacks withal, and it is the salt of the <hi>Pyrites</hi> stone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with old Iron (having been dissolved in it) is incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated. The filings of Steel, and such small par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Edge-tools as are worn away upon the Grindstone, commonly called Slipp, is used to the same purpose in dying of Silks (as was said before) which I conceive to be rather to increase the weight than for any other necessity; the particles of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras being not so heavy and crass as these are: for else why should not these later-named Materials be as well used about Cloth, and other cheaper Stuffs?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>We observe, That green Oaken-boards by affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Saw become black; and that a green sour Apple, cut with a knife, becomes likewise black; and that the white grease wherewith Coach-wheels are anointed becomes likewise black, by reason of the iron boxes wherewith the Nave is lined, besides the ustulation or affriction between the Nave and the Axel-tree. Moreover we observe, That an Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en stick, by a violent affriction upon other wood in a Turning-Lath, makes the same black.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:99266:159"/>
                  <q>From all which we may observe, That the whole business of Blacking lies in the Iron, as if the salt of the <hi>Pyrites</hi>-stone in Copperas served only to extract the same; and withal it seems to lie in a kind of sindging and ustulation, such as rapid affrictions do cause: For Allum seems to be of the same nature with Vitriol; and yet in no case that I know of is, it is used for black colours: And the black colour upon earthen Ware is made with scalings of Iron vitrified. Note, That where-ever Copperas is used, either Galls, Sumach, Oak-Sapling-barks, Alder-bark, Wallnut-rinds, Crabtree-bark, or green Oak saw-dust, must be used with it; All which things Physicians call Austere and Stiptick.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Red-wood must be chopt into small pieces, then ground in a Mill between two heavy stons, as corn is. It is used also in Dying of Cloth and Rugs, and those of the Courser sort: The colour is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with much and long boyling, and that with Galls. The colour it makes is a kind of Brick-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour-Red; it holdeth much better than Brasil. The Cloth it dyeth is to be boyled with it: Wherefore only such matters as are not prejudiced by much boyling are dyed herewith.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Brasil is chopt and ground like as the Red-wood:
<q>It dyeth a Pink-colour or Carnation, imitating the colour of Cochineil the nearest: It is used with Allum for the ordinary colour it dyeth; and with addition of Pot-ashes, when it is used for Purples.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Brasil steept in Water giveth it the colour of Clar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret-wine, into which a drop or two of Juyce of Lemmons or Vinegar being put, turneth it into the colour of Canary-Sack; in which particular it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with Cochineil. This Colour soon staineth,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:99266:160"/>
as may appear by the easie change which so small a quantity of acid liquor makes upon it. A drop of Spirit of Vitriol turneth the infusion of Brasil into a purplish violet-colour, even although it hath been made yellow before, by the addition of Juyce of Lemmons or Vinegar; and is the same effect which Pot-ashes also produce, as we said before.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Mather</hi> is a Root cultivated much in <hi>Flanders</hi>: There be of it two sorts; <hi>Pipe-Mather,</hi> which is the coursest; and <hi>Bale-Mather,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Crap-Mather:</hi> This <hi>Mather</hi> used to the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, dyeth on Cloth a colour the neerest to our Bow-dye, or the new Scarlet; the like whereof Safflowr doth in Silk; insomuch as the colours cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Bastard-Scarlets are dyed with it. This colour indures much boyling, and is used both with Allum and Argol; it holdeth well. The brightest colours dyed with this material are made by over-dying the same, and then by discharging part of it by back-boyling it in Argol.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Mather</hi> is used with Bran-liquor, instead of White-liquor or ordinary Water.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Cochineel</hi> is of several sorts, <hi>viz. Silvester</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stequa</hi>: This also is used with Bran-liquor in Pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Furnaces, and with <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> in order to the Scarlet-dye. It is the colour whereof the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity effecteth most in Dying; and Colours dyed with it, are said to be dyed in Grain. Rags dyed in the dregs of this colour is called <hi>Turnsole,</hi> and 'tis used to colour Wines; <hi>Cochineel</hi> being counted so far from an unwholesom thing, that it is esteemed a Cordial. Any acid Liquor takes off the intense Redness of this colour, turning it towards an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range, Flame, or Scarlet-colour: With this colour
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:99266:160"/>
also the <hi>Spanish</hi> Leather and Flocks are dyed which Ladies use. The extract or <hi>fecula</hi> hereof makes the finest <hi>Lake.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Arnotto</hi> Dyeth of it self an Orang-colour, is used with Pot-ashes upon Silk, Linnen, and Cottons, but not upon Cloth, as being not apt to penetrate into a thick substance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Weld,</hi> called in Latin <hi>Luteola</hi>; when 'tis ripe (that is to say, in the flower) it Dyeth (with the help of Pot-ashes) a deep Lemon colour, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ranunculus,</hi> or Broom flower; and either by the smalness of proportion put into the Liquor, or else by the slighter tincture, it Dyeth all Colours between White and the Yellow aforesaid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the use of this material, Dyers use a cross, driven down into their Furnace with a screw to keep it down, so as the Cloth may have liberty in the supernatant Liquor, to be turned upon the Winch and kept out with the staves: This weed is much cultivated in <hi>Kent,</hi> for the use of the <hi>London</hi>-Dyers, it holdeth sufficiently well but against U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine and <hi>Tartarous</hi> Liquors. Painters Pinke is made of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Wood wax,</hi> or <hi>Genista Tinctoria</hi> (commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Grasing-weed by the Dyers,) produces the same effect with <hi>Luteola,</hi> being used in greater quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: It is seldome made use of as to Silk, Linnen, or Cottons, but only as to course-Cloths: It is also set with Pot-ashes or Urine, called by the Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>Siggefustick</hi>; of it there be two sorts, the <hi>young</hi> and the <hi>old: Fustick</hi> is chopt and ground, as the other Woods abovementioned are.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>young Fustick</hi> Dyeth a kind of Reddish-Orang-colour; the <hi>old,</hi> a Hair-colour with several
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:99266:161"/>
degrees of yellowness between: It is used with slacked Lime. The Colours Dyed with <hi>old Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> hold extreamly; and are not to be discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will spend <hi>with</hi> Salts or <hi>without,</hi> and will work hot or cold.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Soot of Wood. Soot</hi> containeth in it self both a Colour and Salt; wherefore there is nothing add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it to extract its Colour, nor to make it strike upon the Stuff to be Dyed; the natural Colour which it Dyeth of it self, is the Colour of Honey; but is the foundation of many other Colours upon Wool and Cloth; for to other things 'tis not used. <hi>Woad</hi> is made of a Weed, sown upon strong new-broken Land, perfectly cleered from all stones and weeds, cut several times by the top leaves, then ground, or rather chopt with a peculiar Mill for that purpose; which being done several times, it is made up in Balls and dryed in the Sun; the dryer the year is, the better the Woad.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>When it is made up in Balls, it is broken again and laid in heaps, where if it heat to fast, it is sprinkled with ordinary water: but if it heat too slowly, then they throw on it a quantity of Lime, or Urine. But of the perfect cultivating and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Woad, we shall speak elsewhere.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>English Woad</hi> is counted the strongest, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly tryed by staining of white Paper with it, or a white Limed wall, and if the Colour be a French-green it is good.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Woad</hi> in use, is used with Pot-ashes commonly called Ware, which if it be double refin'd, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hard Ware (which is much the same with Kelp) or Sea-weeds, calcin'd and burnt into the hardness of a stone, by reiterated Calcinations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Lime,</hi> or <hi>Calke</hi> which is strong Lime, is used to accelerate the fermentation of the Woad, which by the help of the same Pot-ashes and warm liquors kept alwayes so, in three or four dayes will come to work like a Kive of Beer, and will have a blew or rather greenish froth or flowry upon it, answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Yest of the Kive. Now the over quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Ware, fretting too much upon the Woad, is obtunded or dulled by throwing in Bran sometimes loose, sometimes in Baggs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The making and using Woad, is one of the most mysterious, nice, and hazardous operations in Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: It is one of the most lasting Colours that is Dyed: An intense Woad-Colour is almost black, that is to say, of a Damson-colour; this Colour is the foundation of so many others in its degree, that the Dyers have a certain Scale, or number of Stalls, whereby to compute the lightness and deepness of this Colour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Indico</hi> is made of a Weed of the same Nature with Woad, but more strong; and whereas Woad is the whole substance of the Herb, Indico is only a mealy concrete juice or <hi>faecula</hi> dryed in the Sun, sometimes made up in flat Cakes, sometimes into round-balls, there be several sorts of Indico.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Logwood</hi> is chopt and ground like other of the Woods abovementioned, it maketh a Purplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blew; may be used without Allum: It hath been esteemed a most false and fading Colour; but now being used with Galls, is far less complained of.</q>

                  <q>2. That few of the Coloring materials (as Cochineil, Soot, Wood wax, Woad,) are in their outward and first appearance of the same Colour, which by the slieghtest distempers and solutions in the weakest <hi>Menstrua,</hi> the Dye upon Cloth, Silk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <q>7. That although Green be the most frequent and common of natural Colours, yet there is no simple ingredient, which is now used alone, to Dye Green with upon any Material; <hi>Sap green</hi> (being the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densated juyce of the <hi>Rhamnous Berry</hi>) being the neerest; the which is used by Country people.</q>

                  <q>8. There is no Black thing in use which dyes black; though both the coal and soot of most things burnt or scorched be of that colour; and the blacker, by how much the matter before it was burnt was whiter, as in the famous instance of <hi>Ivory-black.</hi>

                  <q>10. Some of the Dyers Materials are used to bind and strengthen a Colour, some to brighten it, some to give lustre to the stuff, some to discharge and take off the colour either in whole or in part, and some out of fraud, to make the Material Dyed (if cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to be heavyer.</q>

That Scowring and Washing of Stuffs to be dyed, is to be done with special Materials; as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with Ox-galls, sometimes with Fullers earth, sometimes with Soap: This latter being pernicious in some cases, where Pot-ashes will stain or alter the colour.</q>

                  <q>14. Where great quantities of Stuffs are to be dyed together, or where they are to be done with great speed, and where the pieces are very long, broad, thick, or otherwise, they are to be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently handled, both in respect to the Vessels and Ingredients.</q>

               <p n="16">

               <p n="17">
                  <q>17. Some Colours or Stuffs are best dyed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated Dippings ever into the same Liquor at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral distances of time; and some by continuing longer, and others lesser whiles therein.</q>

                  <q>19. There is little reckoning made how much Liquor is used in proportion to the dying Drugs; the Liquor being rather adjusted to the bulk of the Stuff, as the Vessels are to the breadth of the same: The quantity of dying Drugs being proportioned to the colour higher or lower, and to the Stuffs both; as likewise the Salts are to dying Drugs.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Concerning the weight which Colours give to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:99266:163"/>
Silk (for in them 'tis most taken notice of, as being sold by weight, and being a Commodity of great price:) It is observed, That one pound of raw Silk loseth four ounces by washing out the Gums and natural <hi>Sordes.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the same scowred Silk may be raised to above thirty ounces from the remaining twelve, if it be dyed black with some Materials.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The reason why Black colour may be most heavy dyed, being because all gravitating Drugs may be dyed black, being all of colours lighter than it: whereas perhaps there are few or no Materials wherewith to increase the weight of Silk, which will consist with fair light colours; such as will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been used, as white Arsenick to Incarnadives. Of a thing truly useful in Dying, especially of Blacks, nothing increases weight so much as Galls, by reason whereof Black Silks are restored to as much weight as they lost by washing out their Gum: Nor is it counted extraordinary, that Blacks should gain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four or six ounces in the Dying upon each pound.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Next to Galls old Fustick increases the weight about 1 ½ in 12.</p>
                  <p>Mather about one ounce.</p>
                  <p>Weld half an ounce.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <q>The Blew-fat, in deep Blews of the fifth stall, gives no considerable weight.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Neither doth Logwood, Cochineel, nor Arnotto: Nor doth Copperas it self, where Galls are not.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I conceive much light would be given to the Philosophy of Dying, by careful Experiments of the weight added by each Drug or Salt in Dying of every colour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:99266:164"/>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Slipp</hi> adds much to the weight, and giveth a deeper Black than <hi>Copperas</hi> it self; which is a good excuse for the Dyers that use it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I have hitherto but mentioned the several Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations used in Humane Affairs, Enumerated the several Materials used in one of them, namely, Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and imperfectly described the several uses and applications of them in Dying. I have also set down some general Observations relating to that whole Trade. It remains now that we describe the several Vessels, Tools, and Utensils used in the same. And particularly to shew how any Colour assigned may be superinduced upon any kind of Material, as Wool, Linnen, Hair, Feathers, Cotton or Silk: And with what Advantages or Disadvantages of Lasting, Brightness, Cheapness, and Variety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> each may be performed. But this being infinite, and almost unteachable by words, as being incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more difficult, than how to imitate and compose any Colour assigned, out of the few, usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furnishing a Painters-palat; I leave the whole to the further consideration of this Learned Society.</q>

               <head>THE HISTORY Of the Generation and Ordering of GREEN-OYSTERS, Commonly called Colchester-Oysters.</head>
               <p>
                  <q>IN the Month of <hi>May</hi> the <hi>Oysters</hi> cast their Spaun (which the Dredgers call their Spat;) it is like to a drop of Candle, and about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a half-penny.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Spat cleaves to Stones, old Oyster-shells, pieces of Wood, and such like things, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea, which they call Cultch.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>'Tis probably conjectured, that the Spat in twenty four hours begins to have a Shell.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the Month of <hi>May</hi> the Dredgers (by the Law of the Admiralty Court) have liberty to catch all manner of <hi>Oysters,</hi> of what size soever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>When they have taken them, with a knife they gently raise the small brood from the Cultch, and then they throw the Cultch in again, to preserve the ground for the future, unless they be so newly Spat that they cannot be safely severed from the Cultch, in that case they are permitted to take the stone or shell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Spat is upon, one Shell having many times 20 Spats.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:99266:165"/>
                  <q>After the Month of <hi>May</hi> it is Felony to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Cultch, and punishable to take any other <hi>Oysters,</hi> unless it be those of size (that is to say) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bigness of an half Crown piece, or when the two shells being shut, a fair shilling will rattle between them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The places where these <hi>Oysters</hi> are chiefly catcht, are called the <hi>Pont-Burnham, Malden,</hi> and <hi>Colne</hi>-Waters; the latter taking its name from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Colne,</hi> which passeth by <hi>Colne-Chester,</hi> gives the name to that Town, and runs into a Creek of the Sea at a place called the <hi>Hythe,</hi> being the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of the Town.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Brood and other <hi>Oysters</hi> they carry to Creeks of the Sea at <hi>Brickel-Sea, Mersey, Langno, Fringrego, Wivenbo, Tolesbury,</hi> and <hi>Salt-coase,</hi> and there throw them into the Channel, which they call their Beds or Layers, where they grow and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and in two or three years the smallest Brood will be <hi>Oysters</hi> of the size aforesaid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Those <hi>Oysters</hi> which they would have green, they put into Pits about three foot deep, in the Salt-Marshes, which are overflowed only at Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides, to which they have Sluces, and let out the Salt-water until it is about a foot and half deep.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>These Pits from some quality in the Soil coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating with the heat of the Sun, will become green, and communicate their colour to the <hi>Oysters</hi> that are put into them in four or five days, though they commonly let them continue there six Weeks, or two Months, in which time they will be of a dark green.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To prove that the Sun operates in the greening, <hi>Tolesbury</hi> Pits will green only in Summer; but that
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:99266:165"/>
the Earth hath the greater power, <hi>Brickel-sea</hi> Pits green both Winter and Summer: and for a further proof, a Pit within a foot of a greening Pit will not green; and those that did green very well, will in time lose their quality.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Oysters</hi> when the Tide comes in lie with their hollow shell downwards, and when it goes out they turn on the other side; they remove not from their place unless in cold weather, to cover themselves in the Ouse.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The reason of the scarcity of <hi>Oysters,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of their dearness, is, because they are of late years bought up by the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>There are great penalties by the Admiralty-Court, laid upon those that fish out of those grounds which the Court appoints, or that destroy the Cultch, or that take any <hi>Oysters</hi> that are not of size, or that do not tread under their feet, or throw upon the shore, a Fish which they call a <hi>Five-finger,</hi> resembling, a Spur-rowel, because that Fish gets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Oysters</hi> when they gape, and sucks them out.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The reason why such a penalty is set upon any that shall destroy the Cultch, is because they find that if that be taken away the Ouse will increase, and then <hi>Muscles</hi> and <hi>Cockles</hi> will breed there, and destroy the <hi>Oysters,</hi> they having not whereon to stick their Spat.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Oysters</hi> are sick after they have Spat; but in <hi>Iune</hi> and <hi>Iuly</hi> they begin to mend, and in <hi>August</hi> they are perfectly well: The Male-<hi>Oyster</hi> is black-sick, having a black substance in the Fin; the Female white-sick (as they term it) having a milky substance in the Fin. They are salt in the Pits, salter in the Layers, but saltest at Sea.</q>

                  </note> I have been cautious to forbear Commending the labours of any Private <hi>Fellows</hi> of the <hi>Society.</hi> For this, I need not make any <hi>Apology</hi> to them; seeing it would have been an inconsiderable Honour, to be prais'd by so mean a Writer: But now I must break this <hi>Law,</hi> in the particular case of Dr. <hi>Christopher Wren</hi>: For doing so, I will not alledge the excuse of my <hi>Friendship</hi> to him; though <hi>that</hi> perhaps were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; and it might well be allow'd me to take this occasion of Publishing it: But I only do it on the meer consideration of Justice: For in turning over the <hi>Registers</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> I perceiv'd that many excellent things, whose first <hi>Invention</hi> ought to be ascrib'd to him, were casually omitted: This moves me to do him right by himself, and to give this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Account of his indeavours, in promoting the Design of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> in the small time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he has had the opportunity of attending it.</p>
               <p>The first instance I shall mention, to which he may lay peculiar claim, is the <hi>Doctrine of Motion,</hi> which is the most considerable of all others, for establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> by <hi>Geometrical Demonstrations.</hi> This <hi>Des Cartes</hi> had before begun, having taken up some <hi>Experiments</hi> of this kind, upon Conjecture, and made them the first <hi>Foundation</hi> of his whole <hi>Systeme</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi>: But some of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions seeming very questionable, because they were only deriv'd from the gross Trials of Balls
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:99266:167"/>
meeting one another at <hi>Tennis,</hi> and <hi>Billiards</hi>: Dr. <hi>Wren</hi> produc'd before the <hi>Society,</hi> an <hi>Instrument</hi> to represent the effects of all sorts of <hi>Impulses,</hi> made between two hard globous Bodies, either of equal, or of different bigness, and swiftness, following or meeting each other, or the one moving, the other at rest. From these varieties arose many unexpected effects; of all which he demonstrated the true <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> after they had been confirm'd by many hundreds of <hi>Experiments</hi> in that <hi>Instrument.</hi> These he propos'd as the Principles of all <hi>Demonstrations</hi> in <hi>Natural Philosophy</hi>: Nor can it seem strange, that these <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> should be of such Universal use; if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Generation, Corruption, Alteration,</hi> and all the Vicissitudes of <hi>Nature,</hi> are nothing else but the effects arising from the meeting of little Bodies, of differing Figures, Magnitudes, and Velocities.</p>
               <p>The Second <hi>Work</hi> which he has advanc'd, is the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Seasons</hi>: which will be of admirable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to Mankind, if it shall be constantly pursued, and deriv'd down to <hi>Posterity.</hi> His proposal therefore was, to comprehend a <hi>Diary</hi> of Wind, Weather, and other conditions of the <hi>Air,</hi> as to Heat, Cold, and Weight; and also a <hi>General Description</hi> of the Year, whether contagious or healthful to Men or Beasts; with an Account of <hi>Epidemical Diseases,</hi> of Blasts, Mill-dews, and other accidents, belonging to Grain, Cattle, Fish, Fowl, and Insects. And because the difficulty of a constant <hi>Observation</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> by Night, and Day seem'd invincible, he therefore devis'd a <hi>Clock</hi> to be annex'd to a Weather-Cock, which mov'd a rundle, cover'd with Paper, upon which the Clock mov'd a black-lead-Pensil; so that the Observer by the Traces of the Pencil on

the Paper, might certainly conclude, what Winds had blown in his absence, for twelve hours space: After a like manner he contriv'd a <hi>Thermometer</hi> to be its own <hi>Register</hi>: And because the usual <hi>Thermometers</hi> were not found to give a true measure of the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Air,</hi> by reason that the accidental gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the liquor, as it lay higher or lower in the Glass, weigh'd unequally on the <hi>Air,</hi> and gave it a farther contraction or extension, over and above that which was produc'd by heat and cold; therefore he invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Circular Thermometer,</hi> in which the liquor occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions no fallacy, but remains alwayes in one height moving the whole <hi>Instrument,</hi> like a Wheel on its <hi>Axis.</hi>

                  <hi>He</hi> has devis'd many subtil wayes for the easier finding the gravity of the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> the degrees of drought and moysture, and many of its other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Amongst these <hi>Instruments</hi> there are <hi>Balances</hi> which are usefull to other purposes, that shew the weight of the <hi>Air</hi> by their spontaneous inclination.</p>
               <p>Amongst the new Discoveries of the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> these are to be attributed to him, that the <hi>Pendulum</hi> in its motion from rest to rest; that is, in one descent and ascent, moves unequally in equal times, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a line of sines: That it would continue to more either in <hi>Circular,</hi> or <hi>Eliptical</hi> Motions; and such <hi>Vibrations</hi> would have the same Periods with those that are reciprocal; and that by a complication
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:99266:168"/>
of several <hi>Pendulums</hi> depending one upon another, there might be represented motions like the Planeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Helical Motions,</hi> or more intricate: And yet that these <hi>Pendulums</hi> would discover without confusion (as the <hi>Planets</hi> do) three or four several <hi>Motions,</hi> act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon one Body with differing <hi>Periods</hi>; and that there may be produc'd a Natural Standard for Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure from the <hi>Pendulum</hi> for vulgar use.</p>
               <p>He has invented many ways to make <hi>Astronomical Observations</hi> more acurate and easie: <hi>He</hi> has fitted and hung <hi>Quadrants, Sextants,</hi> and <hi>Radii,</hi> more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously than formerly: <hi>He</hi> has made two <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopes,</hi> to open with a joynt like a Sector, by which Observers may infallibly take a distance to half mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and find no difference in the same Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reiterated several times; nor can any warping or luxation of the Instrument hinder the truth of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> has added many sorts of <hi>Retes, Screws,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther devises to <hi>Telescopes,</hi> for taking small distances and apparent diamets to Seconds. He has made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertures to take in more or less light, as the Observer pleases, by opening and shutting like the pupil of the eye, the better to fit Glasses to <hi>Crepusculine Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> He has added much to the Theory of <hi>Dioptrics</hi>; much to the Manufacture it self of grinding good Glasses. <hi>He</hi> has attempted, and not without success, the making of Glasses of other forms than Spherical. <hi>He</hi> has exactly measur'd and delineated the Spheres of the humors in the <hi>Eie,</hi> whose proportions one to another were only ghess'd at before. This accurate discussion produc'd the reason, why we see things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and that <hi>Reflection</hi> conduces as much to <hi>Vision</hi> as <hi>Refraction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> discours'd to them a Natural and easie <hi>Theory</hi> of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:99266:168"/>
                  <hi>Refraction,</hi> which exactly answer'd every <hi>Experiment. He</hi> fully demonstrated all <hi>Dioptrics</hi> in a few Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, shewing not only (as in <hi>Keplers Dioptrics</hi>) the common properties of Glasses, but the proportions by which the individual Raies cut the <hi>Axis,</hi> and each other; upon which the Charges (as they are usually called) of <hi>Telescopes,</hi> or the proportion of the Eye-glasses and <hi>Apertures</hi> are demonstrably disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> has made constant Observations on <hi>Saturn</hi>; and a Theory of that Planet, truly answering all <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> before the printed Discourse of <hi>Hugonius</hi> on that subject appear'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> has essay'd to make a true <hi>Selenography</hi> by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; the <hi>world</hi> having nothing yet but pictures, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Surveighs or Maps of the <hi>Moon. He</hi> has stated the <hi>Theory</hi> of the Moons Libration, as far as his <hi>Observations</hi> could carry him. <hi>He</hi> has compos'd a <hi>Lunar Globe,</hi> representing not only the spots, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious degrees of whiteness upon the surface, but the hills, eminencies, and cavities moulded in solid work. The Globe thus fashioned into a true model of the Moon, as you turn it to the light represents all the Menstrual phases, with the variety of appearances that happen from the shadows of the Mountains and Valleys <hi>He</hi> has made Maps of the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Telescopical</hi> Stars; and propos'd Methods to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the great doubt of the Earths motion or rest, by the small Stars about the Pole to be seen in large <hi>Telescopes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order to <hi>Navigation he</hi> has carefully pursu'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Magnetical Experiments</hi>; of which this is one of the noblest and most fruitful of <hi>Speculation.</hi> A large <hi>Terella</hi> is plac'd in the midst of a Plane Board, with a hole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:99266:169"/>
which the <hi>Terella</hi> is half immers'd, till it be like a <hi>Globe,</hi> with the <hi>Poles</hi> in the <hi>Horizon.</hi> Then is the Plane dusted over with steel-filings equally from a Sieve: The Dust by the <hi>Magnetical</hi> virtue is immediatly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd into Furrows, that bend like a sort of <hi>Helix,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding as it were out of one <hi>Pole,</hi> and returning into the other: And the whole Plane is thus figur'd like the Circles of a <hi>Planisphere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It being a Question amongst the Problems of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,</hi> very well worth resolving, to what Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical powrs the Sailing (against the wind especially) was reducible; he shew'd it to be a Wedge: And he demonstrated how a transient Force upon an oblique Plane, would cause the motion of the Plane against the first Mover. And he made an <hi>Instrument,</hi> that <hi>Mechanically</hi> produc'd the same effect, and shew'd the reason of Sayling to all Winds.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Geometrical Mechanics</hi> of <hi>Rowing,</hi> he shew'd to be a <hi>Vectis</hi> on a moving or cedent <hi>Fulcrum.</hi> For this end he made <hi>Instruments,</hi> to find what the expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Body was towards the hindrance of Motion in a Liquid <hi>Medium</hi>; and what degree of impediment was produc'd, by what degree of expansion: with other things that are the necessary Elements for lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the <hi>Geometry</hi> of <hi>Sailing, Swimming, Rowing, Fl<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> has invented a very curious and exceeding spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way of <hi>Etching. He</hi> has started several things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the emendation of <hi>Water works. He</hi> has made <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>Respiration,</hi> and for straining the breath from fuliginous vapours, to try whether the same breath so purify'd will serve again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> was the first <hi>Inventor</hi> of drawing Pictures by <hi>Microscopical Glasses. He</hi> has found out perpetual, at
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:99266:169"/>
least long-liv'd Lamps, and Registers of Furnaces, and the like, for keeping a perpetual temper, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to various uses; as hatching of Eggs, Insects, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Plants, Chymical Praeparations, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Nature in producing Fossils and Minerals, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motion of Watches equal, in order to <hi>Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi> and <hi>Astronomical uses,</hi> and infinite other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> was the first Author of the Noble <hi>Anatomical Experiment</hi> of <hi>Injecting Liquors into the Veins of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</hi> An <hi>Experiment</hi> now vulgarly known; but long since exhibited to the Meetings at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and thence carried by some <hi>Germans,</hi> and publish'd abroad. By this <hi>Operation</hi> divers Creatures were immediately purg'd, vomited, intoxicated, kill'd, or reviv'd, according to the quality of the Liquor injected: Hence arose many new <hi>Experiments,</hi> and chiefly that of <hi>Transfusing Blood,</hi> which the <hi>Society</hi> has prosecuted in sundry Instances, that will probably end in extraordinary Success.</p>
               <p>This is a short account of the Principal <hi>Discoveries</hi> which Dr. <hi>Wren</hi> has presented or suggested to this <hi>Assembly.</hi> I know very well, that some of them <hi>he</hi> did only start and design; and that they have been since carry'd on to perfection, by the Industry of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands. I purpose not to rob them of their share in the honour: Yet it is but reasonable, that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal <hi>Invention</hi> should be ascrib'd to the true <hi>Author,</hi> rather than the <hi>Finishers.</hi> Nor do I fear that this will be thought too much, which I have said concerning him: For there is a peculiar reverence due to so much excellence cover'd with so much modesty. And it is not Flattery but honesty, to give him his just praise; who is so far from usurping the fame of other men,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:99266:170"/>
that he indeavours with all care to conceal his own.</p>
               <p>I have now perform'd my <hi>Promise,</hi> and drawn out of the Papers of the <hi>Society,</hi> an <hi>Epitome</hi> of the chief <hi>Works</hi> they have conceiv'd in their minds, or reduc'd into Practice. If any shall yet think they have not usefully employ'd their time, I shall be apt to suspect, that they understand not what is meant by a <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>profitable labouring</hi> about <hi>Nature.</hi> There are indeed some men who will still condemn them for being idle; unless they immediately profess to have found out the Squaring of the Circle, or the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Stone,</hi> or some other such mighty <hi>Nothings.</hi> But if these are not satisfied with what the <hi>Society</hi> has done, they are only to blame the extravagance of their own Expectations. I confess I cannot boast of such pompous <hi>Discoveries</hi>: They promise no Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor endeavour after them: Their Progress has been equal, and firm, by Natural degrees, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row small things, as well as great: They go leisu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably on; but their slowness is not caus'd by their idleness, but care. They have contriv'd in their thoughts, and couragiously begun an <hi>Attempt,</hi> which all <hi>Ages</hi> had despair'd of. It is therefore fit that they alone, and not others, who refuse to partake of their burden, should be Judges by what steps, and what pace, they ought to proceed.</p>
               <p>Such men are then to be intreated not to interrupt their <hi>Labors</hi> with impertinent rebukes; they are to remember, that the <hi>Subject</hi> of their <hi>Studies</hi> is as large as the <hi>Vnivers</hi>: and that in so vast an <hi>Enterprise,</hi> many intervals and disappointments must be recon'd upon. Though they do not behold that the <hi>Society</hi> has already fill'd the world with <hi>perfect Sciences</hi>;
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:99266:170"/>
yet they are to be inform'd, that the nature of their <hi>Work</hi> requir'd that they should first begin with <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical Collections</hi> and <hi>indigested Experiments,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they go on to finish and compose them into <hi>Arts.</hi> In which Method they may well be justified, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have the <hi>Almighty Creator</hi> himself for an <hi>Example:</hi> For he at first produc'd a confus'd and scatter'd Light; and reserv'd it to be the <hi>work</hi> of another day, to gather and fashion it into beautiful <hi>Bodies.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough it be certain,<note place="margin">Sect. I. <hi>The Subject and Division of this Third Part.</hi>
               </note> that the promoting of <hi>Experiments</hi> according to this <hi>Idaea,</hi> cannot injure the Virtue, or Wisdom of Mens minds, or their former <hi>Arts,</hi> and Mechanical Practices; or their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish'd wayes of life: Yet the perfect innocence of this design, has not been able to free it from the Cavill of the <hi>Idle,</hi> and the <hi>Malicious</hi>; nor from the jealousies of Private Interests. These groundless prejudices of the particular <hi>Professions,</hi> and <hi>Ranks</hi> of Men, I am now in the Last place to remove; and to shew that there is no Foundation for them: To suspect the <hi>Change,</hi> which can be made by this <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>; or the new things it it likely to produce.</p>
            <p>That it will probably be the Original of many <hi>new things,</hi> I am so far from denying, that I chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge it. Nor am I frighted at that, which is wont to be objected in this Case, the hazard of <hi>alteration,</hi> and <hi>Novelty.</hi> For if all things that are
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:99266:172"/>
               <hi>new</hi> be <hi>destructive,</hi> all the several means, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, by which Mankind has risen to this perfection of <hi>Arts,</hi> were to be condemn'd. If to be the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of <hi>new things,</hi> be a crime; how will the first Civilizers of <hi>Men,</hi> and makers of <hi>Laws,</hi> and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Governments</hi> escape? Whatever now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights us in the Works of <hi>Nature,</hi> that excells the rudeness of the first Creation, is <hi>New.</hi> Whatever we see in Cities, or Houses, above the first wildness of Fields, and meaness of Cottages, and nakedness of Men, had its time, when this imputation of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,</hi> might as well have bin laid to its charge. It is not therefore an offence, to profess the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>New things,</hi> unless that which is introduc'd prove pernicious in itself; or cannot be brought in, without the extirpation of others, that are better.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>Experimental Knowledge,</hi> will not expose us to these dangers, I am next to declare, in a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal <hi>Apology</hi> for its intentions, and effects. This was the Third Portion, which I at first reserv'd, for the Conclusion of my Discourse. Yet casting my eyes back, I find, that I have already on several occasions prevented my self; and said many things as I came along, which would have bin more proper for this place. But I desire that my Reader would interpret this to have proceeded from the Nature of my Subject, of which it is hard to Write a plain <hi>History,</hi> without falling sometimes unawares into its <hi>Praise.</hi> And now I will proceed to a fuller, and more solemn <hi>Defence</hi>: In which, I will try to prove, that the increase of <hi>Experiments</hi> will be so far from hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it will be many waies advantageous, above other <hi>Studies,</hi> to the wonted Courses of <hi>Education</hi>; to the Principles, and instructions of the minds of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:99266:172"/>
Men in general; to the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> to the Church of <hi>England</hi>; to all Manual <hi>Trades</hi>; to <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sic</hi>; to the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi>; and the Universal Interest of the whole <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all which <hi>Particulars,</hi> I hope I shall represent this <hi>Model,</hi> to be inoffensive to all the various wayes of Living, already in use: and thereby I shall secure all the Ancient <hi>Proprietors</hi> in their <hi>Rights</hi>: A work as necessary to be done, in raysing a <hi>new Philosophy</hi> as we see it is in building a <hi>new London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The First prejudice I am to wipe away,<note place="margin">Sect. II. <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will not injure Education.</hi>
               </note> concerns the usual wayes of <hi>Education.</hi> For it is an obvious doubt; whether so great a change in <hi>Works,</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,</hi> may not have some fatal consequence, on all the former Methods of <hi>Teaching,</hi> which have bin long setled, and approv'd by much Custom. And here many Good Men of severe, and ancient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, may seem to have reason, when they urge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us; that the Courses of Trayning up of Youth, ought to be still the same; that if they be subverted, or multiply'd, much confusion will follow; and that this our <hi>Universal Inquiry</hi> into things hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>question'd, can never be made, without disturbing such establish'd <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Instruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For a <hi>General Answer</hi> to this, it might suffice to declare, that in this <hi>Institution,</hi> Men are not ingag'd in these <hi>Studies,</hi> till the Course of <hi>Education</hi> be fully compleated: that the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Experiments,</hi> is not thrust into the hands of Boyes, or set up to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by Beginners in the School; but in an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Men of Ripe years: who while they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a <hi>new Method</hi> of Knowledge, which shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of <hi>Works,</hi> and is therefore most proper for Men:
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:99266:173"/>
they still leave to Learners, and Children, the old talkative <hi>Arts</hi> which best fit the younger Age. From hence it must follow, that all the various man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Education,</hi> will remain undisturb'd; because the practises of them, and the labors of this, are not appointed to meet in the same <hi>Age,</hi> or <hi>Persons.</hi> But if this will not satisfy our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> let us proceed to consider the different Parts of <hi>Education</hi>: and then we shall be able to make the surer Conjectures, what manner of Influence, <hi>new Experiments</hi> will have upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Education</hi> Consists in divers Rules, and Practises, whereby men are furnish'd for all the several Courses of Life, to which they may apply themselves. Of these praeparatory <hi>Arts,</hi> some concern the <hi>Body,</hi> some the <hi>Mind.</hi> Those of the <hi>Body</hi> have no relation to my present <hi>Argument</hi>: Of those of the <hi>Mind,</hi> some intend the purity, and Ornament of <hi>Speech:</hi> Some the Knowledge of the Actions of former, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Times:</hi> Some the Government, and Virtu of our Lives: Some the <hi>Method</hi> of reas'ning: Some the skill in the motions and measures of the <hi>Hevens,</hi> and the <hi>Earth,</hi> and all this great Frame of <hi>Visible</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Grammar. and Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric.</hi>
               </note>First then I will make no scruple to acquit <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philosophy,</hi> from having any ill effects, on the usual <hi>Arts,</hi> whereby we are taught the Purity, and Elegance of <hi>Languages.</hi> Whatever discoveries shall appear to us afresh, out of the hidden things of <hi>Nature,</hi> the same words, and the same waies of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression will remain. Or if perhaps by this means, any change shall be made herein; it can be only for the better; by supplying mens Tongues, with very many <hi>new things,</hi> to be nam'd, and adorn'd, and describ'd in their discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:99266:173"/>Nor can there be any more jealousie concerning the <hi>Moral,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Political</hi> Rules of ordering mens lives. But they may still have the same influence, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and may be propos'd to our imitation, by the same praecepts, and arguments, of persuasion.</p>
            <p>It is also as manifest,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>History.</hi>
               </note> that the <hi>Art</hi> of teaching the <hi>Actions</hi> of former Ages; can from hence receive no dammage, or alteration. This cannot be otherwise; seeing the Subjects of <hi>Natural,</hi> and <hi>Civil History</hi> do not cross each other; nor does the <hi>New Philosophy</hi> of Nature more interfere, with the <hi>Historys</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> than the <hi>Old,</hi> of which this doubt was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rays'd.</p>
            <p>Thus far then we are secure. These great, and fundamental Parts of <hi>Education,</hi> the Instruments of mens Expressing, and Ruling their own minds, and searching into the Actions of others, will be unalter'd, whatever new changes of Opinions may arise about <hi>Natural Things.</hi> Let us next go on to consider the <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Demonstration,</hi> and <hi>Argumentation,</hi> in which consists one of the most weighty Parts of youthful Studies.</p>
            <p>First for all the <hi>Mathematical Sciences,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics.</hi>
               </note> they will still remain the same, and still continue to be learn'd, and taught, in the same <hi>Systemes,</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Nothing that can now be discover'd will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, but rather Confirm what is already well built on those immoveable principles. As they came down to us without detriment, through all the corrupt Times of <hi>Learning</hi>; so they will certainly now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue uncorrupt, at this present, when <hi>Learning</hi> is
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:99266:174"/>
restor'd. Seing they could not be destroy'd in the <hi>Ignorant Ages,</hi> they will be in no fear, at this time, by this <hi>Institution,</hi> which designs not only to inlarge them, but to promote the same rigid way of <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> in all other <hi>Natural things,</hi> which only the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics</hi> have hitherto maintaind.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Metaphyscis and Logic.</hi>
               </note>Now then, this whole controversy is reduc'd to the alteration, which the <hi>Logic,</hi> and <hi>physics</hi> of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, may receive by this change. As for their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysics,</hi> they scarce deserve to have a place allow'd them in this consideration.</p>
            <p>Nor does that prevail with mee, which the Lovers of that <hi>Cloudy Knowledge</hi> are wont to boast, that it is an excellent instrument to refine, and make subtil the minds of men. For there may be a greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in the subtilty of mens wits, than in their thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: as we see those threads, which are of too fine a spinning, are found to be more useless, than those which are homespun, and gross.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Logic</hi> is the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Conceiving, Arguing,</hi> and <hi>Method.</hi> And notwithstanding all the progress which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in <hi>Natural Knowledge,</hi> all the several parts of Reas'ning, which it teaches in all manner of business, will continue the same. The operations, and powers of the <hi>mind</hi> will still be the same: they will still be subject to the same errors: they will still use the same degrees of Arguing from particular things, to <hi>proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>conclusions</hi>; and therefore they will still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the same means, and exercises for <hi>direction.</hi> It is not the complaint of the promoters of <hi>Experiments,</hi> that men have bin wanting to themselves, in regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, disposing, or judging of their own <hi>thoughts.</hi> Nay they rather condemn them, for being wholy
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:99266:174"/>
imployd about the <hi>productions</hi> of their own <hi>minds,</hi> and neglecting all the works of <hi>Nature,</hi> that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. It cannot therefore be suspected that these <hi>Inquisitive Men,</hi> should busy themselves, about al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the <hi>Art of Discours,</hi> wherin they judge that mankind has bin already rather too Curious, than negligent.</p>
            <p>The Last part that I shall mention,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Natural Philosophy.</hi>
               </note> of the <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that is taught, is the <hi>Systeme</hi> of <hi>Natural Philosophy.</hi> And it is in this alone, that I can allow, there will be any alteration made, by this reformation of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> But yet the change will be so advantageous, that I have no reason to dissemble it. I grant indeed that the greatest part of the former Body of <hi>Physics,</hi> may hereby chance to fall to the ground. But to what sum will the dammage amount? What can we lose, but only some few <hi>definitions,</hi> and idle <hi>questions,</hi> and empty <hi>disputations?</hi> Of which I may say as one did of <hi>Metaphors, Poterimus vivere sine illis.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there will be no more use of Twenty, or Thirty obscure Terms, such as <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>Form, Privation, Entelichia,</hi> and the like. But to supply their want, and infinit variety of <hi>Inventions, Motions,</hi> and <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> will succeed in the place of words. The Beautiful Bosom of <hi>Nature</hi> will be Expos'd to our view: we shall enter into its <hi>Garden,</hi> and tast of its <hi>Fruits,</hi> and satisfy our selves with its <hi>plenty:</hi> insteed of Idle talking, and wandring, under its fruitless shadows; as the <hi>Peripatetics</hi> did in their first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their Successors have done ever since.</p>

               </note>Thus for I have briefly examin'd the influence of <hi>new Experiments,</hi> or all the chief Parts of <hi>Education.</hi> And after all the <hi>Innovation,</hi> of which they can be suspected, we find nothing will be indanger'd, but only the <hi>physics</hi> of <hi>Antiquity</hi>: wherein we also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, that many things of greater concernment, will arise, to supply the place of what shall be cut away. By this discours, I hope, I have said enough, to manifest the innocence of this <hi>Design</hi> in respect of all the present <hi>Schools of Learning</hi>; and especially our own <hi>Vniversities.</hi> And it was but just, that we should have this <hi>tenderness,</hi> for the Interest of those magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent <hi>Seats</hi> of <hi>humane Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>divine</hi>; to which the <hi>Natural Philosophy</hi> of our Nation, cannot be injurious without horrible <hi>ingratitude</hi>; seeing in them it has been principally cherish'd, and reviv'd. From thence the greatest part of our <hi>Modern Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> have deduc'd their <hi>Original.</hi> It is true such <hi>Experimental Studies</hi> are largely dispers'd at this time: But they first came forth thence, as the <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of old did from <hi>Rome:</hi> and therefore as those did, they should rather intend the strength, than the destruction of their <hi>Mother-Cities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confess there have not bin wanting some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Assertors</hi> of <hi>new Philosophy,</hi> who have not us'd any kind of <hi>Moderation</hi> towards them: But have presently concluded, that nothing can be well-done in <hi>new Discoveries,</hi> unless all the <hi>Ancient Arts</hi> be first rejected, and their Nurseries abolish'd. But the rashness of these mens proceedings, has rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd, than advanc'd, what they make shew to promote. They have come as furiously to the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> as our <hi>Modern Zealots</hi> did to the

               <hi>reformation</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> And the one Party is as justly to be condem'd, as the other. Nothing will suffice either of them, but an utter <hi>Destruction, Root</hi> and <hi>Branch,</hi> of whatever has the face of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> But as the <hi>Vniversities</hi> have withstood the fierceness of the ones zeal without knowledge; so there is no doubt, but they will also prevail against the violence of the others pretences to <hi>knowledge</hi> without <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now after I have shewn that all the receiv'd forms of <hi>Education</hi> will be safe,<note place="margin">Sect. IV. <hi>The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of an Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </note> I shall make no scruple to add my <hi>conjecture,</hi> that it could be no hindrance to the <hi>minds</hi> of men, if besides those courses of Studies which are now follow'd, there were also trial made of some other more practical ways, to prepare their <hi>minds</hi> for the world, and the businesses of human life. It is not enough to urge against this, that the multiplicity of <hi>Methods</hi> would hinder and confound the Spirits of young men; for it is apparent that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more suppresses the <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>Learners,</hi> than the <hi>formality,</hi> and the <hi>confinement</hi> of the Precepts, by which they are instructed. To this purpose I will venture to propose to the <hi>consideration</hi> of wise men, whether this way of <hi>Teaching</hi> by <hi>Practise</hi> and <hi>Experiments,</hi> would not at least be as beneficial, as the other by <hi>Vniversal Rules?</hi> Whether it were not as profitable to apply the eyes, and the hands of Children, to see, and to touch all the several kinds of <hi>sensible things,</hi> as to oblige them to learn, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the difficult <hi>Doctrines</hi> of general <hi>Arts?</hi> In a word, Whether a <hi>Mechanical Education</hi> would not excel the <hi>Methodical?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This certainly is no new device: For it was that
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:99266:176"/>
which <hi>Plato</hi> intended; when he injoin'd his <hi>Scholars</hi> to begin with <hi>Geometry</hi>; whereby, without question, he design'd, that his <hi>Disciples</hi> should first handle <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Things,</hi> and grow familiar to visible Objects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they enter'd on the retir'd <hi>Speculations</hi> of other more abstracted <hi>Sciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to this counsail of the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,</hi> it would not be amiss, if before yong Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars be far ingag'd in the beaten tracks of the Scholes, the Mysteries of <hi>Manual Arts,</hi> the names of their <hi>Instruments,</hi> the secrets of their <hi>Operations,</hi> the effects of Natural causes, the several kinds of <hi>Beasts,</hi> of <hi>Birds,</hi> of <hi>Fishes,</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> of <hi>Stones,</hi> of <hi>Minerals,</hi> of <hi>Earths,</hi> of <hi>Waters,</hi> and all their common Virtues and Qualities, were propos'd to be the subjects of their first thoughts and observations. It may be here suggested, That the vast number of such particulars will soon overwhelm their tender minds, before they are well establish'd by time, and use. But on the contrary it is evident, that the <hi>Memories</hi> of <hi>Youth</hi> are fitter to retain such sensible images, than those of a fuller age. It is <hi>Memory</hi> that has most vigour in Children, and <hi>Iudgment</hi> in Men: which if rightly consider'd, will confirm what I said, that perhaps we take a praeposterous cours in <hi>Education,</hi> by teaching <hi>General Rules,</hi> before <hi>Particular Things</hi>: and that therein we have not a sufficient Regard, to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent advantages of <hi>Youth</hi> and <hi>Manhood.</hi> We load the minds of Children with Doctrines, and Praecepts, to apprehend which they are most unfit, by reason of the weakness of their understandings; wheras they might with more profit be exercis'd in the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>sensible things</hi>; of whose impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they are most capable, because of the strength
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:99266:176"/>
of their <hi>Memories,</hi> and the perfection of their <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
            </p>

               </note> I will now proceed more boldly to bring them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst the Throngs, and Crowds of human business; and to declare to all Professions, and practical Lives, that they can receive no ill impressions from them, but that they will be the most beneficial and proper <hi>Studies,</hi> for their praeparation and direction. And to this purpose, I will treat of their usefulness, both in respect of mens public practise, and the privat go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their own minds.</p>
            <p>As to the first,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Experiments free from the faults of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sorts of Learning.</hi>
               </note> it has bin an old complaint, that has bin long manag'd by men of business, against many sorts of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> that our thoughts are thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with such conceptions, as make them more unfit for action, than they would have bin, if they were wholly left to the force of their own <hi>Nature.</hi> The common Accusations against <hi>Learning</hi> are such as these; That it inclines men to be unsetled, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious</hi>; That it takes up more of their time, than men of business ought to bestow; That it makes them <hi>Romantic,</hi> and subject to frame more perfect images of things, than the things themselves will bear; That it renders them overweening, unchangeable, and obstinat; That thereby men become averse from a practical cours, and unable to bear the difficulties of action; That it emploies them about things, which are no where in use in the world; and, That it draws them to neglect and contemn their own present times, by doting on the past. But now I will maintain, that in every one of these dangers <hi>Experimental Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:99266:177"/>
is less to be suspected than any other; That in most of them (if not all) it is absolutely innocent; nay, That it contains the best remedies for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers which some other sorts of Learning are thought to bring with them.</p>

               </note>The first <hi>Objection</hi> against <hi>Knowledge,</hi> of which I shall take notice in the active part of life is this, That it makes men too plentiful in their <hi>thoughts</hi>; too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive, and cavilling in their <hi>Arguments</hi>; and so ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teaches them to be witty in <hi>objecting,</hi> than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in <hi>resolving,</hi> and diligent in <hi>performing.</hi> I confess the Ancient <hi>Philosophy</hi> will hardly be able to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it self from this charge: For its chief purpose is to enlarge the fancy, and to fill the head with the matter and artifice of discours. But this cannot any way touch the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Experiments.</hi> That consists not in <hi>Topicks</hi> of reas'ning, but of working: That indeed is full of doubting and inquiry, and will scarce be brought to settle its assent: But it is such a doubting as proceeds on <hi>Trials,</hi> and not on <hi>Arguments.</hi> That does neither practise nor cherish this humor of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputing, which Breaks the force of things by the subtilty of words; as <hi>Seneca</hi> was said to do by his style: It weakens mens arms, and slackens all the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of action: For so it commonly happens, that such earnest disputers evaporate all the strength of their minds in arguing, questioning, and debating; and tire themselves out before they come to the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sect. VII. <hi>The second, That it takes up too much time.</hi>
               </note>The next accusation is, That so many intricate paths, and spacious windings of <hi>Learning,</hi> will require more time than can be spar'd by men of active and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:99266:177"/>
busy lives. The belief of this has always made a wide divorce between men of <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>action</hi>; while both have thought, that they must either be wholly <hi>Scholars,</hi> or wholly men of <hi>business</hi>; and that an excellence in both these courses can never be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by human wit. 'Tis true indeed, there is no <hi>Knowledge</hi> or <hi>Science</hi> that can be acquitted from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too large, if their <hi>Professors</hi> have not the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to know how far to proceed, and what mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is to be us'd in every <hi>Study.</hi> There is in the least <hi>Art</hi> enough matter, about which if men shall resolve to trouble their brains all their lives, one <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> and <hi>difficulty</hi> will perpetually beget another, and so (as one of the <hi>Ancients</hi> sayes) <hi>Ipsa tractatio, &amp; questio quotidiè ex se gignet aliquid, quod cum desidiosâ delectatione vestiges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this danger perhaps <hi>Experiments</hi> may seem most expos'd, by reason of the infinit multitude of particulars, and innumerable variations of inquiries, that may be made. But the <hi>Royal Society</hi> has prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this mischief, by the number and succession of those that shall undertake the <hi>work.</hi> They require not the whole time of any of their <hi>Members,</hi> except only of their <hi>Curators</hi>: From the rest they expect no more but what their <hi>business,</hi> nay even their very <hi>recreations</hi> can spare. It is the continuance and perpetuity of such <hi>Philosophical labours,</hi> to which they principally trust; which will both allow a sufficient relaxation to all the particular <hi>laborers,</hi> and will also give good assurance of the happy issue of their <hi>work</hi> at the last: For though that be true, which the Great Physician laments, <hi>That Art is long, and Life is short</hi>; yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lives of studious and industrious men in one <hi>Age,</hi> and the succession of many Lives of such men in all

               </note>They farther object against <hi>Learning,</hi> That it makes our minds too <hi>lofty</hi> and <hi>Romantic,</hi> and inclines them to form more perfect imaginations of the matters we are to practise, than the matters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves will bear. I cannot deny, but a meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative man is obnoxious to this error: He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses chiefly in his Closet, with the heads and noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things, and so discerns not their bottoms neer and distinctly enough: And thence he is subject to overlook the little circumstances, on which all human actions depend. He is still reducing all things to stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Doctrines</hi>; and therefore must needs be liable to neglect the opportunities, to set upon business too soon, or too late; to put those things together in his mind, which have no agreement in <hi>Nature.</hi> But this above all is his greatest danger, that thinking it still becomes him to go out of the <hi>ordinary way,</hi> and to refine and heighten the conceptions of the vulgar, he will be ready to disdain all the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>easy</hi> ways of <hi>Practice,</hi> and to believe that nothing ought to be done, though never so common, but by some device of <hi>Art,</hi> and trick of unusual <hi>wisdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From these inconveniences the <hi>Experimenter</hi> is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure: He invents not what he does out of himself; but gathers it from the footsteps and progress of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> He looks on every thing standing equal to it, and not as from a higher ground: He labors about the plain and undigested objects of his senses, without considering them as they are joyn'd into common <hi>Notions.</hi> He has an opportunity of understanding the most natural ways by which all things are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:99266:178"/>
He cleerly beholds all the secret accidents and turnings, advantages and failings of <hi>Nature.</hi> He indevors rather to know, than to admire; and looks upon <hi>admiration,</hi> not as the end, but the imperfection of our <hi>knowledge.</hi>

               </note> is <hi>an obstinacy of resolution,</hi> and a want of <hi>Dexterity,</hi> to change our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of things according to occasions. This is the more destructive, because it carries with it the most solemn appearance of <hi>Wisdom.</hi> There is scarce any thing that renders a man so useless, as a pervers sticking to the same things in <hi>all times,</hi> because he has somtimes found them to have bin in season. But now in this, there is scarce any <hi>comparison</hi> to be made, between him who is only a <hi>thinking man</hi>; and a <hi>man of experience.</hi> The first does commonly establish his constant Rules, by which he will be guided: The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter makes none of his <hi>opinions</hi> irrevocable. The one if he mistakes, receives his errors from his <hi>Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; the other only from his <hi>Senses</hi>; and so he may correct, and alter them with more ease. The one fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es his <hi>opinions</hi> as soon; the other doubts as long as he can. The one chiefly strives to be unmovable in his mind: The other to enlarge, and amend his <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi> And from hence the one is inclin'd to be <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous,</hi> the other modest in his <hi>judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next pretence,<note place="margin">Sect. X. <hi>The fifth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, That its pleasure draws men off from bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</hi>
               </note> on which men of <hi>Learning</hi> are wont to be vilified, is, that they use to be so much affected, with the pleasant musings of their own thoughts, as to abhor the roughness, and toyl of <hi>business.</hi> This accusation I confess, is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther groundless. The solitary imaginations of <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:99266:179"/>
Men</hi> are of all other the most easy: there a man meets with little stubborness of matter: he may choose his subject where he likes; he may fashion and turn it as he pleases: whereas when he comes abroad into the world, he must indure more <hi>contradiction</hi>: more <hi>difficulties</hi> are to be overcome; and he cannot always follow his own <hi>Genius</hi>: so that it is not to be wonder'd, that so many <hi>great Wits</hi> have despis'd the labor of a practical cours; and have rather chosen to shut themselves up from the <hi>nois</hi> and <hi>preferments</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> to convers in the shadow with the pleasant <hi>productions</hi> of their own <hi>fancies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this perhaps is the reason why the most <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary men</hi> of <hi>Arts</hi> in all Ages, are generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd to be the greatest <hi>Humorists</hi>: They are so full of the sweetness of their own <hi>conceptions,</hi> that they become morose, when they are drawn from them, they cannot easily make their minds ductil and plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to others tempers, and so they appear untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and unskilful in <hi>conversation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this I shall also free the <hi>Experimental Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</hi> The satisfaction that he finds, is not <hi>imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> but <hi>real:</hi> It is drawn from things that are not out of the world, but in it: It does not carry him farther off, but brings him neerer to <hi>Practice.</hi> 'Tis true, that <hi>Knowledge</hi> which is only founded on thoughts and words, has seldom any other end, but the <hi>breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>increasing</hi> of more thoughts and words: But that which is built on <hi>Works</hi> (as his will be) will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally desire to discover, to augment, to apply, to communicate it self by more <hi>Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can it be thought, that his <hi>mind</hi> will be made to languish by this pleasure of <hi>observation,</hi> and to have any aversion from the difficulty and tediousness
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:99266:179"/>
of human affairs; seing his way of <hi>observation</hi> itself is so <hi>laborious.</hi> It is a good Precept, which is wont to be given, in respect of all sorts of <hi>Exercises,</hi> that they should be at least as hard and toilsom, as that <hi>Art</hi> which we strive to gain by them. And by this rule <hi>Experiments</hi> are an excellent preparation towards any habit or faculty of life whatsoever. For what thing, which can be effected by <hi>mortal Industry,</hi> can seem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to him who has been ingag'd in these <hi>Studies,</hi> which require such an indefatigable watchfulness? What can overcome his diligence, who has bin able to sustain with patience the <hi>escapes</hi>; the <hi>delaies,</hi> the <hi>labyrinths</hi> of <hi>Nature?</hi> whom the repetition of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>labors,</hi> so many failings, with which he meets, and so long attendance could not tire?</p>
            <p>Another Principal mischief to be avoided,<note place="margin">Sect. XI. <hi>The sixth objection, That it makes men regard the times past, and neglect the present.</hi>
               </note> is the conformity of our <hi>Actions</hi> to times past, and not the present. This extravagance is generally imputed to <hi>studious</hi> men; and they cannot be wholly acquitted from it. For while they continue heaping up in their <hi>Memories</hi> the customs of past <hi>Ages,</hi> they fall insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to imitate them, without any manner of care <hi>how</hi> sutable they are to <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Things.</hi> The grounds of this mistake will be worth our discovering, because in mens opinions it does so much prejudice to the learned part of the <hi>World.</hi> In the ancient <hi>Authors</hi> which they turn over, they find descriptions of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues more perfect than indeed they were: the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments</hi> are represented better, and the waies of life pleasanter than they deserv'd. Upon this, these <hi>Bookish</hi> wise men strait compare what they read with what they see: and here beholding nothing so heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally transcendent, because they are able to mark all
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:99266:180"/>
the <hi>spots,</hi> as well as <hi>beauties</hi> of every thing, that is so close to their sight, they presently begin to despise their own <hi>times,</hi> to exalt the past, to contemn the <hi>virtues</hi> and aggravate the <hi>vices</hi> of their <hi>Country</hi>; not indeavoring to amend them, but by such examples as are now unpracticable, by reason of the alteration of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Manners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this defect, <hi>Experiments</hi> are a sovereign cure: They give us a perfect sight of what is before us; they bring us home to our selves; they make us live in <hi>England,</hi> and not in <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Sparta</hi>; at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time, and not three thousand years ago: though they permit us to reflect on what has bin done in <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages</hi>; yet they make us chiefly to regard and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templat the things that are in our <hi>view.</hi> This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is conformable to the <hi>Design</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> it self; which though it has fram'd our bodies in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that we may easily upon occasion turn about to look behind us; yet it has plac'd the <hi>Eies,</hi> the chief <hi>instruments</hi> of <hi>observation,</hi> not in our <hi>Backs,</hi> but in our <hi>Foreheads.</hi>

               </note>The last failing which is wont to be imputed to <hi>Learned men,</hi> is want of <hi>use,</hi> and fear of <hi>practice,</hi> and a conversing with things in their <hi>Studies,</hi> which they meet with no where else. It may now perhaps be thought, that an <hi>Experimenter</hi> is as inclinable to these weaknesses, as he that only contemplates; becaus they both keep out of the way, in the shaddow; the one in his <hi>Library, arguing, objecting, defending, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> with himself: the other in his <hi>Work-hous,</hi> with such Tools and Materials, whereof many perhaps are not publickly in use. Let us then consider which of them is most to be blam'd for conversing with matters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:99266:180"/>
those that we meet with in <hi>Civil affairs?</hi> and which most abounds with <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>doubts,</hi> and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken idaeas of <hi>things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but the men of <hi>Reading</hi> do very much busy themselves about such <hi>conceptions,</hi> which are no where to be found out of their own Chambers. The <hi>sense,</hi> the <hi>custom,</hi> the <hi>practice,</hi> the <hi>judgement</hi> of the world, is quite a different thing from what they imagine it to be in private. And therefore it is no wonder, if when they come abroad into business, the sight of Men, the Tumult and nois of Cities, and the very brightness of Day it self af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright them: Like that <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> who having bin us'd to declaim in the shade of a <hi>School,</hi> when he came to plead a true cause in the open <hi>Air,</hi> desir'd the Judges to remove their Seat under some roof, because the <hi>light</hi> offended him.</p>
            <p>But now on the other side, the men of <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Experiments</hi> perhaps do not alwaies handle the very same <hi>Subjects</hi> that are acted on the stage of the <hi>World</hi>; yet they are such as have a very great resemblance to them. It is <hi>matter,</hi> a visible and sensible <hi>matter,</hi> which is the object of their <hi>labors:</hi> And the same is also us'd by men of practical lives. This likeness of their <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments</hi> will soon make the one excel in the other. For it is far easier for him who has been conversant in one sort of <hi>works</hi> to apply himself to any other; than for him who has only thought much, to turn a man of <hi>Practice:</hi> as he that can paint the face of a Man or a Lion, will much sooner come to draw any other Creature; than he who has all the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Limning</hi> in his head, but never yet us'd his hand to lay on a <hi>Colour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>terrors</hi> and <hi>misapprehensions</hi> which
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:99266:181"/>
commonly confound weaker minds, and make mens hearts to fail and boggle at Trifles; there is so little hope of having them remov'd by <hi>Speculation</hi> alone, that it is evident they were first produc'd by the most <hi>contemplative</hi> men amongst the <hi>Ancients</hi>; and chiefly prevail'd of late years, when that way of <hi>Learning</hi> florish'd. The <hi>Poets</hi> began of old to impose the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. They to make all things look more venerable than they were, devis'd a thousand false <hi>Chimaeras</hi>; on every <hi>Field, River, Grove,</hi> and <hi>Cave,</hi> they bestow'd a <hi>Fantasm</hi> of their own making: With these they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd the world; these they cloath'd with what shapes they pleas'd; by these they pretended, that all Wars, and Counsails, and Actions of men were administred. And in the modern <hi>Ages</hi> these <hi>Fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Forms</hi> were reviv'd, and possess'd <hi>Christendom,</hi> in the very height of the <hi>Scholemens</hi> time: An infinit number of <hi>Fairies</hi> haunted every house; all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were fill'd with <hi>Apparitions</hi>; men began to be frighted from their <hi>Cradles,</hi> which fright continu'd to their <hi>Graves,</hi> and their Names also were made the causes of scaring others. All which abuses if those acute <hi>Philosophers</hi> did not promote, yet they were never able to overcome; nay, even not so much as King <hi>Oberon</hi> and his invisible <hi>Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But from the time in which the <hi>Real Philosophy</hi> has appear'd, there is scarce any whisper remaining of such <hi>horrors</hi>: Every man is unshaken at those Tales, at which his <hi>Ancestors</hi> trembled: The cours of things goes quietly along, in its own true channel of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Causes</hi> and <hi>Effects.</hi> For this we are beholden to <hi>Experiments</hi>; which though they have not yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted the discovery of the true world, yet they have already vanquish'd those wild inhabitants of the false
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:99266:181"/>
worlds, that us'd to astonish the minds of men. A Blessing for which we ought to be thankful, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that it is one of the greatest Curses that God pronounces on the wicked, <hi>That they shall fear where no fear is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what I have said, may be gather'd, That <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philosophy</hi> will prevent mens spending the strength of their thoughts about <hi>Disputes,</hi> by turning them to <hi>Works</hi>: That it may well be attended by the united <hi>Labors</hi> of many, without wholly devouring the time of those that <hi>labor</hi>: That it will cure our minds of <hi>Romantic swelling,</hi> by shewing all things fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly to them, just as large as they are: That it will free them from <hi>perversity,</hi> by not permitting them to be too peremptory in their <hi>Conclusions:</hi> That it accustoms our hands to things which have a neer resemblance to the business of life; and, That it draws away the shadows which either inlarge or dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>human affairs.</hi> And indeed of the usual titles by which men of business are wont to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd, the <hi>Crafty,</hi> the <hi>Formal,</hi> and the <hi>Prudent</hi>; The <hi>Crafty</hi> may answer to the <hi>Empyric</hi> in <hi>Philosophy</hi>; that is, he is such a one who has a great collection of particular <hi>Experiences,</hi> but knows not how to use them but to base and low ends. The <hi>Formal</hi> man may be compar'd to the meer <hi>Speculative Philosopher</hi>: For he vainly reduces every thing to grave and solemn gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Rules,</hi> without discretion, or mature deliberation. And lastly, the <hi>Prudent</hi> man is like him who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds on a constant and solid cours of <hi>Experiments.</hi> The one in Civil life neither wholly rejects the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ancient</hi> or <hi>Modern</hi> times: The other in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi> has the same reverence for <hi>former Ages,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for the <hi>present.</hi> The one does not rest upon
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:99266:182"/>
empty <hi>prudence,</hi> but designs it for action: the other does the same with his discoveries: upon a just, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and deliberate examination of things, they both rays their <hi>Observations,</hi> which they do not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to lye idle, but use them to direct the <hi>actions,</hi> and supply the <hi>wants</hi> of <hi>human life.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Sect. XIII. <hi>Experiments usefull for the cure of mens minds</hi>
               </note>Besides what I have said of the help, which <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments</hi> will bring to our public <hi>duties,</hi> and civil <hi>actions</hi>: I promis'd to add something, concerning the assistance, that they are able to give, towards the management of the privat <hi>motions,</hi> and <hi>passions</hi> of our <hi>minds</hi>: Of this I need say the less, because there is amongst the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> a particular Science appointed for this purpose, to prescribe rules for calming our <hi>affections,</hi> and conquering our <hi>vices.</hi> However I will not wholly pass it over in silence.

            <p>If we shall cast an eye on all the <hi>Tempests,</hi> which arise within our Breasts, and consider the causes, and remedies of all the violent <hi>desires,</hi> malicious <hi>envies,</hi> intemperate <hi>joyes,</hi> and irregular <hi>griefs,</hi> by which the lives of most men become <hi>miserable,</hi> or <hi>guilty</hi>: we shall find, that they are chiefly produc'd by <hi>Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and may be most naturally cur'd by <hi>diversion.</hi> Whatever <hi>Art</hi> shall be able to busy the <hi>minds</hi> of men, with a constant cours of <hi>innocent Works,</hi> or to fill them with as vigorous, and pleasant Images, as those ill <hi>impressions,</hi> by which they are deluded; it will certainly have a surer effect in the composing, and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:99266:182"/>
purifying of their thoughts, than all the rigid prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Stoical, or the empty distinctions of the <hi>Peripatetic Moralists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then it is requir'd in that <hi>study,</hi> which shall attempt, according to the force of <hi>Nature,</hi> to cure the diseases of the mind, that it keep it from <hi>idleness</hi> by full, and earnest <hi>employments,</hi> and that it possess it with innocent, various, lasting, and even sensible <hi>delights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How active, and industrious the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Experiments</hi> ought to be, may be concluded from the whole te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of my discours: wherein I have often prov'd, that it can never be finish'd by the perpetual <hi>labours</hi> of any one man, nay scarce by the successive force of the greatest <hi>Assembly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That therefore being taken for granted, that it will afford eternal <hi>employments</hi>: It is also as true that its labors will contain the most <hi>affecting,</hi> and the most <hi>diverting Delights</hi>: and that thence it has power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to free the <hi>minds</hi> of men from their vanities, and intemperance, by that very way which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Epicure</hi> has no reason to reject, by opposing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against pleasure.</p>
            <p>And I dare challenge all the corrupt <hi>Arts</hi> of our <hi>Senses,</hi> or the devices of voluptuous wits, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide fuller, more changeable, or nearer objects, for the contentment of mens <hi>minds.</hi> It were indeed to be wish'd, that severe virtu itself, attended only by its own <hi>Authority,</hi> were powerful enough to establish its dominion. But it cannot be so. The corruptions, and infirmities of <hi>human Nature</hi> stand in need of all manner of allurements, to draw us to good, and quiet manners. I will therefore propose for this end this cours of <hi>Study,</hi> which will not affright us
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:99266:183"/>
with rigid praecepts, or sou'r looks, or peevish com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but consists of sensible <hi>pleasure,</hi> and besides will be most lasting in its satisfaction, and innocent in its remembrance.</p>
            <p>What <hi>raptures</hi> can the most <hi>voluptuous</hi> men fancy to which these are not equal? Can they relish no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>pleasures</hi> of their <hi>senses</hi>? They may here injoy them without guilt or remors. Are they affrighted at the difficulties of <hi>Knowledge</hi>? Here they may meet with a <hi>Study,</hi> that as well fits the most <hi>negligent</hi> minds, as the most <hi>industrious.</hi> This consists of so many <hi>Works,</hi> and those so obvious, and facil, that the most laborious will never find cause to be idle, and the most idle may still have something to do with the greatest ease. In this they need not weary themselves by searching for <hi>matter.</hi> Whatever they feel, or see, will afford them <hi>Observations.</hi> In this there is no tedious praeparation requir'd to fit them for such indeavors. As soon as they have the use of their <hi>hands,</hi> and <hi>eies,</hi> and common <hi>sense,</hi> they they are sufficiently furnish'd to undertake them: Though we cannot comprehend the <hi>Arts</hi> of men without many praevious <hi>Studies,</hi> yet such is the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of <hi>Nature,</hi> that it has from the beginning, out of its own store, sufficiently provided every man, with all things, that are needful for the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of itself.</p>
            <p>Thus neither the <hi>sensual mind,</hi> has any occasion to contemn <hi>Experiments</hi> as unpleasant, nor the idle as burdensome, or intollerable, nor the virtuous as unworthy of his <hi>labors.</hi> And the same influence they may have, on all other <hi>moral</hi> imperfections of <hi>human Nature.</hi> What room can there be for low, and little <hi>things</hi> in a <hi>mind</hi> so usefully and successfully employd?
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:99266:183"/>
What <hi>ambitious disquiets</hi> can torment that man, who has so much glory before him, for which there are only requir'd the delightful <hi>Works</hi> of his <hi>hands</hi>? What dark, or melancholy passions can overshadow his <hi>heart,</hi> whose <hi>senses</hi> are always full of so many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>productions,</hi> of which the least progress, and success, will affect him with an <hi>innocent joy</hi>? What anger, envy, hatred, or revenge can long torment his breast, whome not only the greatest, and noblest objects, but every sand, every pible, every grass, every earth, every fly can divert? To whom the return of every season, every month, every day, do suggest a circle of most pleasant <hi>operations</hi>? If the <hi>Antients</hi> prescrib'd it as a sufficient <hi>Remedy,</hi> against such <hi>violent Passions,</hi> only to repeat the Alphabet over: whereby there was leasure given to the <hi>mind,</hi> to recover itself from any sudden fury: then how much more <hi>effectual Medicines,</hi> against the same <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers,</hi> may be fetch'd from the whole Alphabet of <hi>Nature,</hi> which represents itself to our <hi>Consideration,</hi> in so many infinit <hi>Volumes</hi>!</p>
            <p>I will now proceed to the weightiest,<note place="margin">Sect. XIV. <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not dangerous to the Christian Religion.</hi>
               </note> and most solemn part of my whole <hi>undertaking</hi>; to make a defence of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and this new <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Learning,</hi> in respect of the <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> I am not ignorant, in what a slippery place I now stand; and what a tender matter I am enter'd upon. I know that it is almost impossible without offence, to speak of things of this Nature, in which all <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> each <hi>Country,</hi> and now almost every <hi>Family,</hi> do so widely disagree among themselves. I cannot expect that what I shall say will escape misinterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, though it be spoken with the greatest sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:99266:184"/>
and submission, while I behold that most men do rather value themselves, and others, on the little differences of <hi>Religion,</hi> than the main substance itself; and while the will of <hi>God</hi> is so variously di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, that what appears to be <hi>Piety</hi> to some <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> is abhorr'd as the greatest superstition, and heresy by others.</p>
            <p>However to smooth my way as much as I can, and to prepare all our several <hi>Spiritual Interests,</hi> to read this part with some tolerable <hi>moderation</hi>; I do here in the beginning most sincerely declare, that if this design should in the least diminish the <hi>Reverence,</hi> that is due to the <hi>Doctrine of Iesus Christ,</hi> it were so far from deserving <hi>protection,</hi> that it ought to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd by all the <hi>Politic,</hi> and <hi>Prudent</hi>; as well as by the devout Part of Christendom. And this I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I think they were bound to do, not only from a just dread of the <hi>Being,</hi> the <hi>Worship,</hi> the <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> the <hi>Love of God,</hi> all which are to be held in the highest veneration: but also out of a regard to the peace, and prosperity of men. In matters that concern our <hi>opinions</hi> of another <hi>World,</hi> the least al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations are of wonderful hazard: how mischievous then would that enterprise be, whose effects would abolish the <hi>command of Conscience,</hi> the belief of a <hi>future life</hi>; or any of those Hevenly <hi>Doctrines,</hi> by which not only the <hi>eternal condition</hi> of men is secur'd, but their <hi>natural Reason,</hi> and their <hi>Temporal safety</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd? Whoever shall impiously attempt to subvert the Authority of the <hi>Divine Power,</hi> on false pretences to better <hi>Knowledge,</hi> he will unsettle the strongest foundations of our <hi>hopes</hi>: he will make a terrible confusion in all the offices, and opinions of men: he will destroy the most prevailing <hi>Argument</hi> to <hi>virtu:</hi>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:99266:184"/>
he will remove all <hi>human Actions,</hi> from their firmest center: he will even deprive himself, of the praero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of his <hi>Immortal Soul</hi>; and will have the same success, that the <hi>Antient Fables</hi> make those to have had, who contended with their <hi>Gods,</hi> of whom they report, that many were immediatly turn'd into <hi>Beasts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With these apprehensions I come to examin the <hi>Objections,</hi> which I am now to satisfy: and having calmly compar'd the <hi>Arguments</hi> of some devout men against <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and chiefly that of <hi>Experiments</hi>; I must pronounce them both, to be altogether inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive. I did before affirm, that the <hi>Royal Society</hi> is abundantly cautious, not to intermeddle in <hi>Spiritual things</hi>: But that being only a general plea, and the question not lying so much on what they do at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, as upon the probable effects of their Enterprise; I will bring it to the test through the chief Parts of <hi>Christianity</hi>; and shew that it will be found as much avers from <hi>Atheism,</hi> in its issue and consequences, as it was in its original purpose.</p>
            <p>The public Declaration of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> is to propose to mankind, an infallible way to <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Towards the performance of this happy end, besides the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the acknowledgment and Worship of a <hi>Deity:</hi> It has offer'd us the merits of a glorious <hi>Saviour</hi>: By him, and his <hi>Apostles Ministry,</hi> it has given us suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <hi>Examples,</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi> to acquaint us with <hi>divine things,</hi> and carry us to <hi>Heven.</hi> In every one of these, the <hi>Experiments</hi> of <hi>Natural things,</hi> do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther darken our eies, nor deceive our minds, nor deprave our hearts.</p>

               </note>First there can be no just reason assign'd, why an <hi>Experimenter</hi> should be prone to deny the essence, and properties of <hi>God,</hi> the universal Sovereignty of his <hi>Dominion,</hi> and his <hi>Providence</hi> over the <hi>Creation.</hi> He has before him the very same argument, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his judgment in all these; with which he himself is wont to be abundantly satisfy'd, when he meets with it in any of his <hi>Philosophical Inquiries.</hi> In every thing that he tryes, he believes, that this is enough for him to rest on, if he finds, that not only his own, but the <hi>universal Observations</hi> of men of all times and places, without any mutual conspiracy have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in the same <hi>conclusion.</hi> How can he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from embracing this common <hi>Truth,</hi> which is witness'd by the unanimous approbation of all <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> the agreement of <hi>Nations,</hi> and the secret ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of every mans breast?</p>
            <p>'Tis true his <hi>employment</hi> is about <hi>material things.</hi> But this is so far from drawing him to oppose invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <hi>Beings,</hi> that it rather puts his thoughts into an excellent good capacity to believe them. In every <hi>work</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> that he handles, he knows that there is not only a gross substance, which presents it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to all mens eies; but an infinit subtilty of <hi>parts,</hi> which come not into the sharpest sense. So that what the <hi>Scripture</hi> relates of the Purity of <hi>God,</hi> of the Spirituality of his <hi>Nature,</hi> and that of <hi>Angels,</hi> and the <hi>Souls</hi> of men, cannot seem incredible to him, when he perceives the numberless particles that move in every mans <hi>Blood,</hi> and the prodigious streams that continually flow unseen from every <hi>Body</hi>: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found that his own <hi>senses</hi> have been so far as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by the <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> he may sooner ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:99266:185"/>
that his mind ought to be rays'd higher, by a Hevenly light, in those things wherein his <hi>senses</hi> do fall short. If (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> says) the invisible things of <hi>God</hi> are manifested by the visible; then how much stronger Arguments has he for his belief, in the <hi>eternal power,</hi> and <hi>Godhead,</hi> from the vast number of Creatures, that are invisible to others, but are expos'd to his view by the help of his <hi>Experiments?</hi>
            </p>

He is also from his <hi>Experiments</hi> as well furnish'd with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> to adore it: he has always before his eys the <hi>beauty, contrivance,</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Gods Works</hi>: From hence, he will learn to serve him with all reverence, who in all that he has made, consulted <hi>Ornament,</hi> as well as <hi>Vse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence he will best understand the infinit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between <hi>himself,</hi> and his <hi>Creator,</hi> when he finds that all things were produc'd by him: whereas he by all his study, can scarce imitate the least effects, nor hasten, or retard the common cours of <hi>Nature.</hi> This will teach him to <hi>Worship</hi> that <hi>Wisdom,</hi> by which all things are so easily sustain'd, when he has look'd more familiarly into them, and beheld the chances, and alterations, to which they are expos'd. Hence he will be led to admire the wonderful contrivance of the <hi>Creation</hi>; and so to apply, and direct his praises aright: which no doubt, when they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd up to <hi>Heven,</hi> from the mouth of one, who has well studied what he commends, will be more suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> than the blind applauses of the ignorant. This was the first service, that <hi>Adam</hi> perform'd to his <hi>Creator,</hi> when he obey'd him in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:99266:186"/>
and naming, and looking into the <hi>Nature</hi> of all the <hi>Creatures.</hi> This had bin the only <hi>Religion,</hi> if men had continued innocent in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and had not wanted a <hi>Redemption.</hi> Of this the <hi>Scripture</hi> itself makes so much use, that if any devout man shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all <hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi> he may blot <hi>Genesis,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> and the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and some other Books, out of the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Bible. God</hi> never yet left himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witness in the <hi>World</hi>: And it is observable, that he has commonly chosen the dark and ignorant <hi>Ages,</hi> wherein to work Miracles; but seldom or never the times when <hi>Natural Knowledge</hi> prevail'd: For he knew there was not so much need to make use of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary signs, when men were diligent in the works of his hands, and attentive on the impressions of his footsteps in his <hi>Creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is almost a <hi>proverbial</hi> speech, <hi>That the most</hi> Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ages <hi>are still the most</hi> Atheistical, <hi>and the</hi> ignorant <hi>most</hi> devout. Whoever devis'd this distinction at first, the true <hi>Piety</hi> is little beholden to him for it: For insteed of obeying the <hi>Iewish Law,</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us to offer up to <hi>God</hi> a Sacrifice that has a Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, he has bestow'd the most excellent of all the Race of men on the Devil; and has only assign'd to <hi>Religion</hi> those <hi>Men</hi> and those <hi>Times,</hi> which have the greatest Blemish of <hi>human Nature,</hi> even a defect in their <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there can be found any colour for this <hi>observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> That the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> should produce a <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual darkness</hi>; it can only then hold good, when the <hi>knowledge</hi> of men, and not that of <hi>Nature</hi> abounds. Whether the first be true, or no, let the <hi>Politicians</hi> consider: But of the second, this is a sufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, that in most Countries God has been wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:99266:186"/>
in a form proportionable to that kind of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philosophy</hi> in which they excell'd. In <hi>Persia,</hi> where the skill of the <hi>hevenly Motions</hi> first began, they had their Temples on the Top of Hills, and open to the Air. In <hi>Aegypt</hi> they had the best opportunities of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying the Nature of <hi>living Creatures</hi>; by reason of that variety which their River and their Land pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd. And their <hi>Religious Mysteries</hi> were contain'd in <hi>Hieroglyphics,</hi> which were most of them borrow'd from Beasts. And why should <hi>Natural Philosophy</hi> be now condemn'd, for contempt of all <hi>Divinity,</hi> when of old it did rather incline them to <hi>Superstition,</hi> which is the other extreme? It is true indeed, by that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> which they had of many Creatures, they were drawn to adore them; but that was only because it was imperfect: If they had understood them tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, they had never done it: So true is that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Lord <hi>Bacon, That by a little knowledge of Nature men become Atheists; but a great deal returns them back again to a sound and Religious mind.</hi> In brief, if we rightly apprehend the matter, it will be found, that it is not only sottishness, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaness, for men to cry out against the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Nature</hi>: For that being nothing else but the instrument of <hi>God,</hi> whereby he gives being and action to <hi>things</hi>; the <hi>knowledge</hi> of it deserves so little to be esteem'd impious, that it ought rather to be reckon'd as <hi>Divine.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Sect. XVII. <hi>Experiments not praejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel.</hi>
               </note> on which the certainty of all the rest depends, is the <hi>Evangelical Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> by <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> In this there is nothing, from which he that converses much with <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> can be thought to be more avers than others;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:99266:187"/>
nay, to which he may not be concluded to be more inclinable, on this very account; seing it has all bin prov'd to him his own way. Had not the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Christ</hi> bin strengthen'd by undeniable signs of <hi>almighty Power,</hi> no age nor place had bin oblig'd to believe his Message. And these <hi>Miracles</hi> with which he asserted the <hi>Truths</hi> that he taught (if I might be allow'd this boldness in a matter so sacred) I would even venture to call <hi>Divine Experiments</hi> of his <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then can there be in all this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> at which a Real and impartial <hi>Inquirer</hi> into <hi>Natural Things,</hi> should be offended? Does he demand a Testimony from <hi>Heven</hi>? he has it: He reads effects produc'd, that did exceed all mortal skill and force: And of this he himself is a better judge than others: For to understand aright what is <hi>supernatural,</hi> it is a good step first to <hi>know</hi> what is according to <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Does he require that this should be testified, not by men of <hi>Craft</hi> or <hi>Speculation</hi>; but rather by men of <hi>Honesty, Trades,</hi> and <hi>Business?</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> were such. Will he not consent to any mans <hi>Opinions,</hi> unless he sees the <hi>operations</hi> of his hands agree with them? <hi>Christ</hi> himself requires no more of any of his <hi>Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi> For he commanded his <hi>Disciples</hi> not to believe him, but the <hi>Works</hi> that he did. Does he think that it is the most honorable Labor to study the benefit of Mankind? to help their infirmities? to supply their wants? to ease their burdens? He here may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the whole <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Future Happiness,</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by the same means; by feeding the Hungry, by curing the Lame, and by opening the eyes of the Blind: All which may be call'd <hi>Philosophical Works,</hi> perform'd by an <hi>Almighty hand.</hi>

It may here be suggested, that the sensible <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>things</hi> may in time abolish most of these, by insinuating into mens minds, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand before the impartiality of <hi>Philosophical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions,</hi> But this surmise has no manner of founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. These Superstructures are of two sorts: either those of which a man may have a cleer apprehension in his thoughts, upon a rational account, and which are intelligible to any ordinary Reader; or else such as exceed the common measures of our <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Senses.</hi> There will be no fear that an <hi>Experimenter</hi> should reject the first, seeing they may be conceiv'd by the meanest capacity, and have that stamp upon
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:99266:188"/>
them, which he for the most part esteems the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of <hi>Truth,</hi> that they are vulgar. But now to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the consenting to the last, there is nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to believe them in gross: And for this he is as well prepar'd as any other <hi>Philosopher.</hi> If we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him sufficiently convinc'd of the authority of the Deliverer (as I have already shewn he may be) he cannot be suspected for disavowing his word, though never so mystical; or for resisting the voice of him, whose Arm he has found to be Omnipotent. This submission of his <hi>judgment</hi> he may make, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the severity of his <hi>Inquiries</hi>: And the most subtil Speculative man in the world can do no more. After all his acute <hi>Arguings</hi> in <hi>Divinity,</hi> he can never render any one point, which is the proper object of <hi>Faith,</hi> to be plain, and equal, and expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our <hi>Reason.</hi> What good can he then do? se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is not able to make it any way fitter for our <hi>Faith,</hi> by all his <hi>Transcendental Notions,</hi> than it was before, on the bare account of the <hi>wondrous Works</hi> of the <hi>Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the place in which the <hi>Peripatetic Philosophy</hi> has long triumph'd: But I cannot imagine on what right. The spiritual and supernatural part of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> no <hi>Philosophy</hi> can reach: And in the plain things there is no need of any at all: So that it is excluded on both accounts. In some <hi>Doctrines</hi> it is useless, by reason of their sublimity; in others, because of their commoness. How small assistance it brings, may be seen in those very points, in which its Empire seems most to be plac'd, in <hi>Gods Decrees,</hi> his <hi>Immateriality,</hi> his <hi>Eternity,</hi> and the holy Mystery of the <hi>Trinity</hi>: In all which we are only brought into a more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed darkness by it; and in which unfathomable
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:99266:188"/>
Depths a plain <hi>Believing</hi> is at last acknowledg'd by all to be our only Refuge. The truth is, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the great stir they have made about <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> if we had only follow'd their light, we had still worshipp'd the <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Redeemer</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> under the same title by which their Praedecessors did formerly at <hi>Athens,</hi> as the <hi>Vnknown God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I have urg'd so far, because I am confident that the reducing of <hi>Christianity</hi> to one particular Sect of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and confining it to that, is one of the most destructive Engines that ever was manag'd against it. Of this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for her share has already found the ill effects: And the danger is apparent: For by this means the benefit of <hi>Religion</hi> will become very narrow, seing where <hi>Reason</hi> takes place it will only convince them who are of the same opinions in <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy</hi> with those that convert them. And also (that which is worse) if ever by any fate of <hi>Times,</hi> or change of <hi>Governments,</hi> or succession of new <hi>Arts,</hi> that Sect shall chance to be quite broken, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> relying upon it, were inevitably ruin'd, unless <hi>God</hi> were pleas'd to support it a supernatural way, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store it again by new <hi>Miracles. Religion</hi> ought not to be the subject of <hi>Disputations</hi>: It should not stand in need of any devices of <hi>reason</hi>: It should in this be like the Temporal Laws of all Countries, towards the obeying of which there is no need of <hi>syllogisms</hi> or <hi>distinctions</hi>; nothing else is necessary but a bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation, a common apprehension, and sense e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to understand the Grammatical meaning of ordinary words. Nor ought <hi>Philosophers</hi> to regret this divorce: seing they have almost destroy'd themselves, by keeping <hi>Christianity</hi> so long under their guard: By fetching <hi>Religion</hi> out of the <hi>Church,</hi>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:99266:189"/>
and carrying it Captive into the <hi>Schools,</hi> they have made it suffer banishment from its proper place; and they have withal thereby very much corrupted the substance of their own <hi>Knowledge</hi>: They have done as the <hi>Philistims</hi> by seising on the <hi>Ark:</hi> who by the same action, depriv'd the People of <hi>God</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and also brought a Plague amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

               <note place="margin">Sect. XIX. <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will not hinder the Practice of Religion.</hi>
               </note>Thus far I trust it will be confess'd, that <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are unblameable. But yet there is much more behind, of which many pious men are wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press their jealousy. For though they shall be brought to allow, that all these <hi>Doctrines,</hi> which I have nam'd, may seem to remain safe amidst the studies of <hi>Natural things:</hi> yet they still whisper, that they may chance by degrees, to make the sincerity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion appear ridiculous, and to bring the strictness of holy life out of fashion: and that so they will si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and by piece-meals, demolish <hi>Religion,</hi> which they dare not openly encounter. I will therefore next endeavor the removal of these scruples, though I sufficiently understand, that it is a very <hi>difficult Work,</hi> to confute such popular, and plausible er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which have the pretence of the caus of <hi>God</hi> to confirm them.</p>
            <p>The chief substance of Real, and Sober <hi>Piety,</hi> is contain'd in the devout observation of all those ways, whereby <hi>God</hi> has bin pleas'd to manifest his Will; and in a right separation of our minds from the lusts, and desires of the <hi>World.</hi> The most remarkable means, whereby he has made known his pleasure, are those, which have been fix'd, and reveal'd in his <hi>Word</hi>; or else the extraordinary signs of his Authority, and Command.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:99266:189"/>Concerning our acknowledgment of his <hi>reveal'd Will</hi> in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> I have already spoken. And our obedience to the later consists chiefly of two kinds: an humble submission to <hi>Divine Prophecies,</hi> and a careful observance of all <hi>remarkable Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> In both which <hi>Experimental Philosophy</hi> may well be justify'd. It may perhaps correct some excesses, which are incident to them: But it declares no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity against the things themselves.</p>
            <p>The sum of the whole <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Prophecies</hi> is this, that the <hi>Great Creator</hi> of the World has the Praerogative of foreseeing, appointing, and praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting all future Events: that he has often in former Ages made use of this power, by the Visions, and raptures of holy men inspir'd from above: that his <hi>infinit Wisdom</hi> has still the like ability to do the same: that whenever such praedictions are accompanied, with undeniable Testimonies of their being sent from <hi>Heven,</hi> they ought to be praefer'd before all <hi>human Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The true Foundation of <hi>Divine Prodigies,</hi> is much of the same Nature with the other. It relyes on these suppositions, that all the Creatures are subject to <hi>Gods Word,</hi> by which they were made: that he can alter their <hi>Courses,</hi> exalt, or destroy their <hi>Natures,</hi> and move them to different ends from their own, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his pleasure: that this he has often done heretofore: that still his Arm it not weaken'd, nor the same <hi>omnipotence</hi> diminish'd: that still he may change the wonted Law of the <hi>Creation,</hi> and dispose of the <hi>Beings,</hi> and <hi>motions</hi> of all things, without controul: and that when this is done, it is with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar design of punishing, or rewarding, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:99266:190"/>To the belief and assertion of these <hi>Doctrines,</hi> we are oblig'd by the very end of <hi>Religion</hi> itself. But yet their counterfeit colors have seduc'd many vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous minds into manifold mischiefs.</p>
            <p>The mistakes about <hi>Prophecies</hi> may arise, either from our abusing of the old, or a vain setting up of new. We err in the first, when we translate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Prophecies</hi> from those times, and Countries, which they did properly regard, to others, which they do not concern. And we offend in the second, when we admit of New <hi>Prophetical Spirits</hi> in this Age, without the uncontroulable tokens of <hi>Hevenly Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are guilty of false interpretations of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi> and <hi>Wonders</hi>; when we either make those to be <hi>Miracles</hi> that are none; or when we put a false sense on those that are real, when we make general events to have a privat aspect, or particular accidents to have some universal signification. Though both these may seem at first to have the strictest appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Religion,</hi> yet they are the greatest usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the secrets of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable praesumptions on his high <hi>Praerogatives</hi> of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi> and <hi>reward.</hi>

events to be the immediat Finger of <hi>God,</hi> because he familiarly beholds the inward workings of things: and thence perceives that many effects, which use to affright the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> are brought forth by the common <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> He cannot be sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly inclin'd, to pass censure on mens eternal condition, from any <hi>Temporal Iudgments</hi> that may befall them; because his long convers with all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, times, and places, has taught him, the truth of what the <hi>Scripture</hi> says, that <hi>all things happen alike to all.</hi> He cannot blindly consent to all imaginations of devout men, about future <hi>Contingencies</hi>: seing he is so rigid, in examining all particular matters of Fact: He cannot be forward to assent to <hi>Spiritual Raptures,</hi> and <hi>Revelations</hi>: becaus he is truly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Tempers of mens Bodies, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of their Blood, and the power of Fancy: and so better understands the difference, between <hi>Diseases,</hi> and <hi>Inspirations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in all this, he commits nothing, that is <hi>Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</hi> 'Tis true, to deny that <hi>God</hi> has heretofore warn'd the World of what was to come, is to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the very Godhead itself: But to reject the sense, which any privat man shall fasten to it, is not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain the Word of <hi>God,</hi> but the opinions of men like our selves. To declare against the possibility, that new <hi>Prophets</hi> may be sent from <hi>Heven</hi> is to insinuat that the same infinit Wisdom which once shew'd it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that way, is now at an end. But to slight all pretenders, that come without the help of <hi>Miracles,</hi> is not a contempt of the Spirit, but a just circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that the <hi>Reason</hi> of men be not over-reach'd.

men frame against their Enemies, or for themselves, is not to reverence the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> but to make that serve the Passions, and interests, and revenges of men.</p>
            <p>It is a dangerous mistake, into which many Good men fall; that we neglect the <hi>Dominion of God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the World,</hi> if we do not discover in every Turn of human Actions many supernatural <hi>Providences,</hi> and miraculous <hi>Events.</hi> Whereas it is enough for the honor of his <hi>Government,</hi> that he guids the whole Creation, in its wonted cours of <hi>Causes,</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi>: as it makes as much for the reputation of a Prince's wisdom, that he can rule his subjects peaceably, by his known, and standing Laws, as that he is often forc'd to make use of extraordinary justice to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, or reward.</p>
            <p>Let us then imagin our <hi>Philosopher,</hi> to have all slowness of belief, and rigor of Trial, which by some is miscall'd a blindness of mind, and hardness of heart. Let us suppose that he is most unwilling to grant that any thing exceeds the force of <hi>Nature,</hi> but where a full evidence convinces him.

Can he by this undermine <hi>Christianity,</hi> which does not now stand in need of such extraordinary Testimonies from <hi>Heven?</hi> or do not they rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger it, who still venture all its Truths on so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous a chance?

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:99266:191"/>
               <hi>Signs,</hi> and <hi>Wonders,</hi> as if the works of our <hi>Savior</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> had not bin sufficient: who ought to be esteem'd the most carnally minded? the <hi>Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ast,</hi> that pollutes his <hi>Religion,</hi> with his own passions? or the <hi>Experimenter,</hi> that will not use it to flatter, and obey his own desires, but to subdue them? who is to be thought the greatest enemy of the <hi>Gospel</hi>? He that loads mens <hi>Faiths,</hi> by so many improbable things, as will go neer to make the reality itself suspected? or he that only admits a few <hi>Arguments,</hi> to confirm the <hi>Evangelical Doctrines,</hi> but then chuses those, that are <hi>unquestionable?</hi> It cannot be an ungodly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to strive to abolish all <hi>Holy Cheats</hi>: which are of fatal consequence, both to the Deceivers, and those that are deceiv'd: to the Deceivers, becaus they must needs be <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> having the artifice in their keeping: to the deceiv'd, because if their eies shall be ever open'd, and they chance to find, that they have been deluded in any one thing, they will be apt not only to reject that, but even to despise the very <hi>Truths</hi> themselves, which they had before bin taught by those deluders.</p>
            <p>It were indeed to be confess'd, that this severity of <hi>Censure</hi> on <hi>Religious things,</hi> were to be condemn'd in <hi>Experimenters,</hi> if while they deny any wonders, that are falsely attributed to the <hi>True God,</hi> they should approve those of Idols or false <hi>Deities.</hi> But that is not objected against them. They make no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison between his power, and the works of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but only between the several ways of his own manifesting himself. Thus if they lessen one heap yet they still increas the other: In the main they diminish nothing of his right. If they take from the <hi>Prodigies,</hi> they add to the ordinary <hi>Works</hi> of the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:99266:192"/>
same <hi>Author.</hi> And those ordinary <hi>Works</hi> themselves, they do almost rais to the height of <hi>Wonders,</hi> by the exact Discovery, which they make of their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies: while the <hi>Enthusiast</hi> goes neer to bring down the price of the True, and Primitive <hi>Miracles,</hi> by such a vast, and such a negligent augmenting of their number.</p>

               <note place="margin">Sect. XXI. <hi>On his account Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are fit for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Temper of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </note>By this I hope it appears, that this Inquiring, this scrupulous, this incredulous Temper is not the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, but the honor of <hi>Experiments.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will declare them to be the most seasonable study, for the present <hi>Temper</hi> of our <hi>Nation.</hi> This wild amuzing mens minds, with <hi>Prodigies,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of <hi>Providences,</hi> has been one of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable causes of those spiritual distractions, of which our Country has long bin the <hi>Theater.</hi> This is a vanity, to which the English seem to have bin always subject above others. There is scarce any <hi>Modern Historian,</hi> that relates our Forein Wars, but he has this <hi>Objection</hi> against the <hi>disposition</hi> of our Countrymen, that they us'd to order their affairs of the greatest importance, according to some obscure <hi>Omens,</hi> or <hi>praedictions,</hi> that pass'd about amongst them, on little or no foundations. And at this time, especially this last year, this gloomy, and ill-boding humor has prevail'd. So that it is now the fittest sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for <hi>Experiments</hi> to arise, to teach us a Wisdome, which springs from the depths of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> to shake off the shadows, and to scatter the mists, which fill the minds of men with a vain consternation. This is a <hi>work</hi> well-becoming the most <hi>Christian Profession.</hi> For the most apparent effect, which attended the passion of <hi>Christ,</hi> was the putting of an eternal silence,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:99266:192"/>
on all the false oracles, and dissembled inspirations of <hi>Antient Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There have bin 'tis true, some peculiar occasions, wherein <hi>God</hi> was pleas'd to convince the World from <hi>Heven,</hi> in a visible manner. But if we consider the <hi>Arguments</hi> that us'd to move him to it, we may conclude, that such wonderful signs are not often now to be expected.</p>
            <p>He has either done it, in Times of gross ignorance, or in the beginning of a new way of <hi>Religion,</hi> or for the peculiar punishment of some praevailing wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Upon the account of the two first, we have no reason to expect Wonders in this <hi>Age</hi>: becaus all sorts of <hi>Knowledge</hi> do so much abound; and becaus we have a <hi>Religion</hi> already establish'd, against which the Gates of Hell shall never praevail.</p>
            <p>The Third Time has bin, when <hi>God</hi> has taken to himselfe, the <hi>Exemplary Punishment</hi> of some haynous Sin. From this indeed our <hi>Age</hi> is no more exempted, than it is free from those vices, that are wont to provoke the <hi>Divine Vengeance.</hi> This then we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that even at this present, <hi>God</hi> may declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, against the Iniquities of men, by the supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tokens of his displeasure. But yet the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of such punishments ought to be handled, with the greatest tenderness. For as it is said of the last, and General Judgment, <hi>that no man knows the time, when it shall happen</hi>; so we may also affirm of these particular <hi>Iudgments:</hi> that there is no man, who understands the Circumstances, or occasions of their infliction, but they are one of the deepest parts of <hi>God</hi>'s unsearchable Counsails.</p>
            <p>Whenever therefore a hevy calamity falls from <hi>Heven</hi> on our <hi>Nation,</hi> a <hi>universal Repentance</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd;
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:99266:193"/>
but all particular applications of privat men, except to their own hearts, is to be forborn. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man must bewail his own <hi>Transgressions,</hi> which have increas'd the <hi>Public misery.</hi> But he must not be too hasty, in assigning the Causes of <hi>Plagues,</hi> or <hi>Fires,</hi> or <hi>inundations</hi> to the sins of other men. Whoever thinks that way to repent, by condemning the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of those parties, that differ from his own, and by reproving them, as the <hi>Authors</hi> of such <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,</hi> he is grosly mistaken: For that is not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but to make a Satyr: That is not an Act of humiliation, but the greatest <hi>Spiritual Pride.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is indeed a disgrace to the Reason, and honor of mankind, that every fantastical <hi>Humorist</hi> should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to interpret all the <hi>secret Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Heven</hi>; and to expound the Times, and Seasons, and Fates of Empires, though he be never so ignorant of the very common <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> that lye under his Feet. There can be nothing more injurious than this, to mens public, or privat peace. This with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws our obedience, from the true Image of <hi>God</hi> the rightfull Soveraign, and makes us depend on the vain Images of his pow'r, which are fram'd by our own <hi>imaginations.</hi> This weakens the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of human actions. This affects men with fears, doubts, irresolutions, and terrors. It is usually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, that such <hi>presaging,</hi> and <hi>Prophetical Times,</hi> do commonly fore-run great <hi>destructions,</hi> and <hi>revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of human affairs. And that it should be so is natural enough, though the <hi>presages,</hi> and <hi>prodigies</hi> themselves did signify no such events. For this <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,</hi> this <hi>frightful,</hi> this <hi>Astrological</hi> humor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms mens hearts, it breaks their courage; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds their Councils, it makes them help to bring
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:99266:193"/>
such <hi>calamities</hi> on themselves: First they fancy, that such ill accidents must come to pass: And so they render themselves fit subjects to be wrought upon, and very often become the <hi>instruments,</hi> to bring those effects about, which they fondly imagin'd were ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably threatn'd them from <hi>Heven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last <hi>accusation</hi> concerns that which is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a <hi>holy life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. XXII. <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not prejudicial to Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>mortifying</hi> of our <hi>Earthly desires.</hi> And here the men of a retyr'd, and severe devotion are the loudest: For they tell us, that we cannot conquer, and despise the <hi>World</hi> while we study it so much; that we cannot have sufficient leasure to reflect on another life, while we are so taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Curiosities of this: that we cannot be strict enough in correcting the irregularities of our own thoughts, while we give them so much liberty to wander, and so pleasant a Rode wherin to travail; and that it is in vain to strive after the <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> of our minds, while we suffer them to spend so much time, on the labors of our <hi>Senses.</hi> This <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> appears at first sight somwhat terrible: But I come the more boldly to answer it, because there are involv'd in the same indictment, all the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>Arts,</hi> and civil <hi>Actions</hi> of men, which must either stand, or fall with <hi>Experiments</hi> in this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
            <p>First then I will allege, that if this sort of <hi>study,</hi> should be acknowledg'd not to be proper, for the promoting of the severer offices of <hi>Christianity,</hi> yet it would sufficiently recompence for that, by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, it may bring to some other kinds of <hi>Christian Virtues</hi>: If it shall not fill our minds, with the most mortifying Images, which may rise from the terrors
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:99266:194"/>
of <hi>Gods Iustice,</hi> yet it will make amends for that, by inclining us to adore his <hi>Goodness.</hi> If it fits us not so well for the secrecy of a <hi>Closet</hi>: It makes us service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>World.</hi> If it shall not seem to contribute towards <hi>Godly sorrow,</hi> or <hi>Contrition:</hi> It will give us more opportunities of <hi>Charity, Affability, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> and <hi>Generosity,</hi> which are all of them <hi>divine Graces,</hi> as well as <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a great error to think that <hi>Religion</hi> does only consist in one sort of <hi>Duties.</hi> It is as various as the Dispositions, the Qualities, the Conditions of men: With some, the severe, the strict, the retir'd are best: with others, the bountiful, the affable, the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the friendly: Of both which kinds I will not say whether is to be prefer'd: But this is true, that while the first are chiefly limited to the regulating of our own <hi>Hearts,</hi> the influence of the last extends much farther; to spread the fame of the <hi>Gospel</hi> in the <hi>World</hi>; to make it appear lovely in the eies of all beholders; and to allure them to submit to the honorableness, the gentleness, the easiness of its yoke. And this methinks is evident in our <hi>Saviors</hi> life: For whenever he intended to convert any to his <hi>Faith,</hi> he did it by some visible <hi>good Work,</hi> in the sight of the Multitude. But he never gain'd any <hi>Disciple</hi> by the conflicts, which he was pleas'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo in his own mind; for he perform'd his <hi>Fast,</hi> and his <hi>Agony</hi> alone, in the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> and the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place I will affirm, That it is improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that even the hardest and most rigorous parts of <hi>Mortification</hi> itself should be injur'd by these <hi>Studies</hi> more than others; seing many duties of which it is compos'd, do bear some resemblance to the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:99266:194"/>
that are requisit in <hi>Experimental Philosophers.</hi> The spiritual <hi>Repentance</hi> is a careful survay of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Errors, and a resolution of amendment. The spiritual <hi>Humility</hi> is an observation of our Defects, and a lowly sense of our own weakness. And the <hi>Experimenter</hi> for his part must have some Qualities that answer to these: He must judge aright of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; he must misdoubt the best of his own thoughts; he must be sensible of his own ignorance, if ever he will attempt to purge and renew his Reason: So that if that be true, which is commonly observ'd, that men are wont to prove such kinds of <hi>Christians</hi> as they were men before; and that Conversion does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, but only exalt our <hi>Tempers</hi>; it may well be concluded, that the doubtful, the scrupulous, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent <hi>Observer</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> is neerer to make a modest, a severe, a meek, an humble <hi>Christian,</hi> than the man of <hi>Speculative Science,</hi> who has better thoughts of himself and his own <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I need not take so great a compass in this vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, when it may be fairly maintain'd, that the true and unfain'd <hi>Mortification</hi> is not at all inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with mens consulting of their happiness in this world, or being emploi'd about earthly affairs. The honest pursuit of the conveniences, decences, and ornaments of a mortal condition, by just and regular ways, is by no means contradictory to the most real and severe duties of a <hi>Christian.</hi> It is true indeed, the irregular prosecution of such things is an offence to <hi>Religion</hi>: But so it is also to <hi>right Reason,</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> itself.</p>
            <p>It is a wrong conception of the state of <hi>Grace,</hi> if men believe, that when they enter upon it, they must presently cast away all the thoughts and desires
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:99266:195"/>
of <hi>humanity.</hi> If this were so, to sanctifie our <hi>Natures</hi> were not to renew, but to destroy them. When we are commanded to <hi>put off the old man,</hi> we are not injoin'd to renounce our Faculties of <hi>Reason.</hi> When we are bidden <hi>not to think our own thoughts,</hi> it is not intended that we should forbear all <hi>Natural Actions</hi> and <hi>Inclinations.</hi> Such <hi>Scriptures</hi> as these are to be understood in a moderate sense: By such expressions the irregularity of the <hi>Lust,</hi> and not the <hi>Natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> is condemn'd: The <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Innocence</hi> of our <hi>Lives,</hi> and not the utter change of our <hi>Estate,</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended. Seing the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> intends the happiness and security of mankind in this life; and the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> pursues the same ends, both in this and a future life; they are so far from being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite one to another, that <hi>Religion</hi> may properly be styl'd the best and the noblest part, the perfection and the crown of the Law of <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will therefore first demand, Whether it be not lawful for the strictest <hi>Christian</hi> to provide for the necessities of this life? This Request is modest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: For if they deny it, they will reduce man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind into a condition which is literally wors than that of the Beasts that perish; seing to them it is natural to seek out for all the ways of their own preservation. I will go on to ask them, Whether it be a breach of the <hi>Law of Christianity</hi> to labor for the advantages of Living, which are injoy'd by others? If this be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd me, we shall not deprive it of that honor which now justly belongs to it, that there is little civility at present amongst men without the Pale of the <hi>Christian Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in few words, let them tell me, Whether it be indispensably necessary for us to be always thinking
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:99266:195"/>
of hevenly things? If so, how far short were the very <hi>Apostles</hi> of this character of <hi>Sanctity,</hi> which these men would prescribe us? What Traffic, what Commerce, what Government, what secular Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment could be allow'd? Where should we at last make an end of refining? What would become of all the men of Trade themselves, of whom this <hi>Age</hi> has shewn so many pretenders to the purest <hi>Religion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let it only therefore be granted, that we are <hi>Men,</hi> and not <hi>Angels:</hi> Let it be confess'd, that there may be an <hi>excess,</hi> as well as <hi>defect,</hi> in mens opinions of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness: And then I will make no scruple to say, that the <hi>Philosopher</hi> defiles not his mind when he labors in the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi>; that the Diversion they give him, will stand with the greatest constancy, and the delight of pursuing them, with the truth and reality of <hi>Religion.</hi> But to say no more, How can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd to be a sinful and carnal thing, to consider the objects of our <hi>Senses</hi>; when <hi>God,</hi> the most <hi>spiritual Being,</hi> did make them all? Since they first were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in his unspotted mind, why may they not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently enter into ours? For if there be any pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which necessarily flows from thinking of them, it might as well be concluded to stick on the <hi>Author,</hi> as on the <hi>Souls</hi> of them that only observe them.</p>
            <p>And now having insisted so long on the parts of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> in general,<note place="margin">Sect. XXIII. <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not dangerous to the Church of</hi> England.</note> it will be less needful that I should be large in vindicating this <hi>Design</hi> from the imputation of being praejudicial to the <hi>Church of England</hi>: For This has the same Interest with That, and differs in nothing from its Primitive Pattern, but only in the addition of some circumstances, which make it fit for this <hi>Age</hi> and this <hi>Place:</hi> And therefore
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:99266:196"/>
they will both be strengthen'd by the same benefits, and weaken'd by the same mischiefs.</p>
            <p>What I have then to add concerning our <hi>Church,</hi> shall be compriz'd in these particulars: That it can never be praejudic'd by the light of <hi>Reason,</hi> nor by the improvements of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> nor by the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Works</hi> of mens hands.</p>
            <p>For the proof of the First, it will be sufficient to consider its <hi>True Design,</hi> what <hi>Opinions</hi> it principally incounters, and by what <hi>Arguments</hi> it ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend itself.</p>
            <p>The true and certain interest of our <hi>Church</hi> is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive its <hi>Doctrine</hi> from the plain and unquestion'd parts of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and to keep itself in a due sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the <hi>Civil Magistrate.</hi> The Extremes which it opposes, are <hi>implicit Faith,</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasm:</hi> And it is a great mistake, if men think it cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd against these, but by the mutual <hi>Arguments</hi> of its Enemies; that it cannot withstand the <hi>Separatists,</hi> but by the Authority of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>; nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> but on the <hi>Tenents</hi> of the <hi>Separatists.</hi> The grounds on which it proceeds are different from Both: And they are no other but the Rights of the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> the imitation of the First uncorrupt <hi>Churches,</hi> and the <hi>Scripture</hi> expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Reason:</hi> From whence may be concluded, that we cannot make War against <hi>Reason,</hi> without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining our own strength, seing it is the constant wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon we ought to employ.</p>
            <p>From this I will farther urge, That the <hi>Church of England</hi> will not only be safe amidst the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a <hi>Rational Age,</hi> but amidst all the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and the subversion of old Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about <hi>Nature,</hi> and introduction of new ways
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:99266:196"/>
of Reasoning thereon. This will be evident, when we behold the agreement that is between the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Design</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and that of our <hi>Church</hi> in its beginning. They both may lay equal claim to the word <hi>Reformation</hi>; the one having compass'd it in <hi>Religion,</hi> the other purposing it in <hi>Philosophy.</hi> They both have taken a like cours to bring this about; each of them passing by the <hi>corrupt Copies,</hi> and referring themselves to the <hi>perfect Originals</hi> for their instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the one to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the other to the large Volume of the <hi>Creatures.</hi> They are both unjustly accus'd by their enemies of the same crimes, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forsaken the <hi>Ancient Traditions,</hi> and ventur'd on <hi>Novelties.</hi> They both suppose alike, that their <hi>Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> might err; and yet retain a sufficient reverence for them. They both follow the great Praecept of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> of <hi>Trying all things.</hi> Such is the Harmony between their <hi>Interests</hi> and <hi>Tempers.</hi> It cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be suspected, that the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that arose on the same Method, though in different works; that Heroically pass'd thorow the same difficulties, that relies on the same <hi>Soveraign's Authority,</hi> should look with jealous eyes on this <hi>Attempt,</hi> which makes no change in the principles of mens consciences, but chiefly aims at the increas of <hi>Inventions</hi> about the <hi>works</hi> of their hands.</p>
            <p>This was the last Particular in this Subject which I undertook to make good, That our <hi>Church</hi> can never be impair'd by the growth of the useful <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> But now I come neerer to it, I find that I may safely omit it: For the thing itself is so manifest, that there can be no ground of raising a Question about it. If our <hi>Church</hi> should be an Enemy to Commerce, Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, Discovery, Navigation, or any sort of <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics</hi>;
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:99266:197"/>
how could it be fit for the present <hi>Genius</hi> of this <hi>Nation?</hi> What greater advantage could its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries have against it? How should we be able to reconcile these two titles, which so justly belong to our <hi>King,</hi> of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> and <hi>Patron of Experimental Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in this I am not only incorag'd to promise, that our <hi>Church</hi> will be out of all danger; but to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this <hi>Enterprise</hi> to it, as that which will become its other <hi>excellencies,</hi> and is most worthy of its <hi>prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> And I shall most humbly represent to its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, that this is not only an honorable <hi>Work,</hi> but even a necessary <hi>Duty,</hi> to which it is oblig'd by <hi>Natural Affection.</hi> The present <hi>Inquiring Temper</hi> of this <hi>Age</hi> was at first produc'd by the liberty of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and searching, and reasoning, which was us'd in the first <hi>Reformation.</hi> Though I cannot carry the Institution of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> many years back, yet the seeds of it were sown in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's, and Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign: And ever since that time <hi>Experimental Learning</hi> has still retaind some vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal heat, though it wanted the opportunities of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening itself, which now it injoys. The <hi>Church of England</hi> therefore may justly be styl'd the <hi>Mother</hi> of this sort of <hi>Knowledge</hi>; and so the care of its <hi>nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment</hi> and <hi>prosperity</hi> peculiarly lyes upon it.</p>
            <p>And indeed this is an honor which seems reserv'd for it alone. From all the several sorts of <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> I fear, there cannot much help be expected towards such <hi>Works,</hi> till they shall have left off to abhor them under the Title of <hi>vain Philosophy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> of other Countries, though they have given us many men, who have been emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in this way, yet are not in a condition to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:99266:197"/>
it by themselves: For either they have not the incoragement of the <hi>Magistrate</hi>; or those that have, are cut so short in their Revenue, that they have scarce enough to support the Decence of their own Public Worship.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> has indeed of late look'd more favorably upon it. They will now condemn no man for asserting the <hi>Antipodes</hi>: The severity with which they handled <hi>Galileo,</hi> seems now very much abated: They now permit their <hi>Iesuits</hi> to bestow some labors about <hi>Natural Observations,</hi> for which they have great advantages by their Travails; and their <hi>Clergy</hi> may justly claim some share in this honor, as long as the Immortal Names of <hi>Mersennus</hi> and <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sendus</hi> shall live.</p>
            <p>But still it is a question, Whether that <hi>Church</hi> does not rather connive at, than really intend its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress. They have indeed seiz'd on some parts of <hi>New Philosophy</hi>; but perhaps it is only with the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy that we often see great <hi>Monarchs</hi> use, in retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some out-Province of their <hi>Empire</hi>; who, though they find that the benefit does not countervail the charge of keeping it, yet will not wholly quit their Interest in it, lest their <hi>Neighbors</hi> should get possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and fortifie it against them. Thus it is likely they have cherish'd some <hi>Experiments,</hi> not out of zeal to the continuance of such <hi>Studies,</hi> but that the <hi>Protestants</hi> might not carry away all the glory, and thence withal get new strength to oppose them.</p>
            <p>This undertaking therefore is wholly cast on the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which can have no jealousie of its effects, to which <hi>Ignorance</hi> is not a support, but an Enemy; which aims not at the captivity, but the freedom of mens minds; which is lately return'd to
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:99266:198"/>
a prosperous condition, and having suffer'd with the <hi>Crown</hi> in its misfortunes, does now partake of the happy Fruits of its <hi>Restoration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will <hi>Experimental Philosophy</hi> be unthankful for the assistance it shall receive: For it will enable us to provide before hand, against any alterations in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious affairs,</hi> which this <hi>Age</hi> may produce. If we compare the changes to which <hi>Religion</hi> has bin always subject, with the present face of things, we may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that whatever vicissitude shall happen about it in our time, it will probably neither be to the advantage of <hi>implicit Faith,</hi> nor of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> but of <hi>Reason.</hi> The fierceness of <hi>violent Inspirations</hi> is in good measure departed: the remains of it will be soon chac'd out of the World, by the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the terrible footsteps it has every where left behind it. And though the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> still preserves its pomp, yet the Real Authority of that too is apparently decaying. It first got by degrees into <hi>Temporal Power,</hi> by the means of its <hi>Spiritual</hi>; but now it only upholds some shadow of the <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> by the strength of the <hi>Temporal Dominion</hi> it has obtain'd.</p>
            <p>This is the present state of <hi>Christendom.</hi> It is now impossible to spread the same clouds over the World again: The universal Disposition of this <hi>Age</hi> is bent upon a <hi>rational Religion</hi>: And therefore I renew my affectionat request, That the <hi>Church of England</hi> would provide to have the chief share in its first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; That it would persist, as it has begun, to incorage <hi>Experiments,</hi> which will be to our <hi>Church</hi> as the <hi>British Oak</hi> is to our <hi>Empire,</hi> an ornament and defence to the soil wherein it is planted.</p>
            <p>Thus I have finish'd what I intended concerning
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:99266:198"/>
               <hi>Religion</hi>; wherein I desire it might not be thought that I have defended every particular <hi>Sercher</hi> into <hi>Nature.</hi> That could not be justly expected from me: For there is no man that makes an <hi>Apology</hi> for any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral way, who will take upon him to make good all the actions of all privat men who profess it. It is enough for my purpose, if it shall be granted, that however some <hi>Experimenters</hi> may be inclinable to ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion; yet this rather proceeds from their own <hi>Genius,</hi> than from any corruption that could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from these <hi>Studies</hi>; and that if the same men had profess'd <hi>Physic,</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> or even <hi>Divinity</hi> itself, they would have bin in like manner disaffected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hevenly things.</p>
            <p>I cannot deny, but that some <hi>Philosophers,</hi> by their carelesness of a Future Estate, have brought a discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit on <hi>Knowledge</hi> itself: But what condition of men is free from such accusations? or why must we strait believe that their Impiety proceeds from their <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy?</hi> It is easy for men to fall into gross errors, and to mistake the wrong causes for the True, in the judgement which they make of others opinions and inclinations: When they behold them addicted to such or such Vices, and to have withal some good Qualities, in which they themselves do not excel, they presently are apt to imagin the <hi>bad</hi> to arise from the <hi>good,</hi> and so condemn both together; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as perhaps it sprung from some other hidden cause, of which they took no notice.</p>
            <p>But let it be a true <hi>Observation,</hi> That many <hi>Modern Naturalists</hi> have bin negligent in the <hi>Worship of God</hi>: yet perhaps they have bin driven on this prophaness by the late extravagant excesses of <hi>Enthusiasm.</hi> The infinit pretences to <hi>Inspiration,</hi> and <hi>immediat Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:99266:199"/>
with God,</hi> that have abounded in this <hi>Age,</hi> have carry'd several men of wit so far, as to reject the whole matter; who would not have bin so exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, if the others had kept within more moderat Bounds. This is Natural enough to be suppos'd; for so it has commonly happen'd, that the greatest degrees of all <hi>contrary Opinions</hi> have met in the same <hi>Age,</hi> and have still heighthen'd and increas'd each other.</p>
            <p>From hence it may be gather'd, That the way to reduce a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>sober</hi> sense of <hi>Religion,</hi> is not by indeavoring to cast a veil of Darkness again over the minds of men; but chiefly by allaying the violence of <hi>spiritual madness</hi>: and that the one extreme will decreas proportionably to the less'ning of the other.</p>
            <p>It is apparent to all, That the influence which <hi>Christianity</hi> once obtain'd on mens minds, is prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously decay'd. The Generality of <hi>Christendom</hi> is now well-nigh arriv'd at that Fatal condition, which did immediatly precede the destruction of the worships of the Ancient World; when the Face of <hi>Religion</hi> in their public <hi>Assemblies,</hi> was quite different from that apprehension which men had concerning it in privat: In public they observ'd its Rules with much solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but in privat regarded it not at all. It is difficult to declare by what means and degrees we are come to this dangerous point: But this is certain, that the <hi>spiritual vices</hi> of this <hi>Age</hi> have well-nigh contributed as much towards it, as the <hi>Carnal:</hi> And for these, the most efficacious <hi>Remedy</hi> that man of himself can use, is not so much the sublime part of <hi>Divinity</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, and natural, and practicable <hi>Doctrines.</hi> The <hi>Medicines</hi> for <hi>Religious distempers</hi> must be changeable according to the <hi>Diseases</hi>: And in this
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:99266:199"/>
we may imitate <hi>Christ</hi> himself in his Method of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens Bodies: Some Cures he perform'd by his Voice, some by Prayer, but some by the Touch of his hands, and even by his Spittle mingled with Earth. In a gross and a sensual <hi>Age,</hi> the deepest Mysteries of our <hi>Religion</hi> may be proper, to purify the stupidity of mens spirits: But there must be an application of quite different and more sensible prescriptions, in a subtil, refin'd, or Enthusiastical time.</p>
            <p>Such is the present humor of the <hi>World</hi>; and such must be the cours of its cure. Men must now be told, that as <hi>Religion</hi> is a <hi>hevenly thing,</hi> so it is not utterly avers from making use of the Rules of <hi>human Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> They must be inform'd, that the <hi>True Holiness</hi> is a severity over our selves, and not others: They must be instructed, that it is not the best service that can be done to <hi>Christianity,</hi> to place its chief Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts so much out of the way, as to make them unfit for men of business. They must remember, that the chief of the <hi>Apostles became all things to all men, that he might gain some.</hi> But above all, there must be caution given, that men do not strive to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their own opinions ador'd, while they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seem zealous for the honor of <hi>God.</hi> This is a fault which is very incident to men of <hi>devotion:</hi> For when they have once form'd in themselves a <hi>Perfect Model</hi> of the <hi>Will of God,</hi> and have long confirm'd their minds by continual thinking upon it, they are apt to contemn all others that agree not with them in some particulars. Upon this, they have strait the reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Term of <hi>Atheist</hi> to cast upon them; which though it be a Title that ought only to be employ'd against the bold and insolent defyers of <hi>Heven</hi> in their <hi>words</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> yet it is too frequently us'd to express
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:99266:200"/>
the malice of any eager and censorious spirit, that has the confidence to object it.</p>
            <p>This, and all other the like <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness,</hi> are to be oppos'd by asserting the duties of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> by the use of past, and present <hi>Times,</hi> by the <hi>Analogy</hi> of human things, by <hi>Moral</hi> Virtu, by the offices of <hi>society,</hi> by the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of <hi>Gods visible Works,</hi> and such easy and rational <hi>Arguments.</hi> Next to the succor of <hi>divine Power,</hi> this is the most probable way to preserve the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> amongst us: If <hi>God</hi> has not in his wrath resolv'd to transplant it into some other quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Earth,</hi> which has not so much neglected his Goodness. This indeed were a revolution, which cannot be thought on without horror. The subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all <hi>Europe</hi> would attend it. The departure of the <hi>Christian Profession</hi> would be accompanied with as frightful effects, as those which follow'd on the Death of its <hi>Founder</hi>: When the <hi>Hevens</hi> were dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd, the <hi>Temple</hi> shook, the Veil was Rent, the Earth trembled, and the <hi>Philosopher</hi> had reason to cry out, <hi>that either Nature was dissolving, or the God of Nature dying.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Sect. XXIV. <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to Manual Arts.</hi>
               </note>I will now enter on the next member of my <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> to consider the purpose of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and the probable effects of <hi>Experiments,</hi> in respect of all the <hi>Manual Trades,</hi> which have been heretofore found out, and adorn'd. And I will dispatch this <hi>Argument</hi> in the resolution of these Four Questions.</p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>Mechanic Arts</hi> are still improveable by human <hi>Industry?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether it be likely, that they may be advanc'd by any others, besides the <hi>Mechanic Artists</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:99266:200"/>Whether there be any ground of hope from <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,</hi> towards this Work?</p>
            <p>And whether if such <hi>Arts</hi> shall hereby happen to multiply, they will not ruine those <hi>Trades,</hi> that are already setled?</p>
            <p>If in these particulars I shall Answer my Readers doubts, I trust it will be granted me, that it is not a vain or impossible Design, to indeavor the increas of <hi>Mechanic contrivances</hi>: that the enterprize is proper for a mixt <hi>Assembly</hi>: that the cours, which they observe towards it will be effectual: and that the increas of such <hi>Operations</hi> will be inoffensive to others of the same kind, that have been formerly discover'd.</p>
            <p>Before I examin these several <hi>heads</hi> apart, perhaps it will not be an impertinent labor, to take one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral survey of the Principal Degrees, and occasions, by which the several <hi>Manufactures</hi> have risen, which beautify the face of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and have brought forth so much pleasure, and plenty amongst men.</p>
            <p>The First of all human Race, when they were dispers'd into several Lands, were at first sustain'd by the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> which fell to their share. These at first they cherish'd, and us'd, not by any <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> but by that <hi>Natural sagacity</hi> which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es all men, to indeavor their own praeservation. For the peaceable injoyment of these, they combin'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Families, and little Leagues, which were the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of <hi>Civil Government.</hi> But finding that all places did not bring forth all things, for Clothing, Food, and Defence; they either violently seis'd on what their Neighbors possess'd, or else they fairly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on a <hi>mutual exchange</hi> of the productions of their soyls. This Trafic was at first made in kind:
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:99266:201"/>
And the <hi>Fruits</hi> that were thus barter'd, were either spent, or planted in other Grounds. By this means mankind was maintain'd: and several <hi>Earths</hi> were furnish'd by <hi>Labor,</hi> with what <hi>Nature</hi> bestow'd not upon them. For this <hi>Commutation</hi> of their <hi>Fruits,</hi> and of the rude effects of their first industry, they began to devise the conveniencies of <hi>Carriage</hi> by Land, and Water: And to make it still easier, and larger; they agreed on some common things, to be the universal standard of <hi>value,</hi> and <hi>price</hi>: whence arose the use of <hi>Mony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the first Original of <hi>Trade,</hi> which from a narrow commerce between the Hills, the Vallies, the Woods, the Plains, and the Rivers, that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd one upon another, is since extended to the whole compass of the <hi>Earth.</hi> For in cours of Time, the small Clans, and Natural Commonwealths, were devour'd by the strength of the greater; or else some of the wiser men reduc'd the Rude multitude into one place, and persuaded them to live quietly under <hi>Laws.</hi> From thence Mankind began to have the face of <hi>Civility,</hi> which arose at first, by that which is the best means of preserving it now, by the <hi>greatness,</hi> and <hi>enlargement</hi> of <hi>Dominion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then first, all the differences of <hi>Living,</hi> and the advantages of <hi>Strength,</hi> and <hi>Empire</hi> did shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Then some took on them to <hi>Rule,</hi> some to assist, or counsail those that Rul'd, and some were forc'd to be subject to their Power. Thus the <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> that were at first in common, were unequally divided: The Great, the Wise, or the Strong obtain'd a Principal share; and either persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or constrain'd all the rest to serve them with their Bodies. Thence sprung all the <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:99266:201"/>
and <hi>pleasure,</hi> while the one part of men would not be content to live according to the first plainess of <hi>Nature</hi>: and the other were compell'd to work with their hands, for the ease, and pleasure of their <hi>Masters lives,</hi> and the support of their own. From these beginnings the Inventions of <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>war,</hi> the delights of <hi>Cities,</hi> and <hi>Palaces,</hi> the delicacies of <hi>Food,</hi> the Curiosities of <hi>Clothing,</hi> the varieties of <hi>recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> took their rise. And these have still continued to increase, either by some casual discoveries, or by Luxury, or else as men have been driven by some new necessities, to pass on farther to attempt new ways of maintaining themselves.</p>
            <p>This is the most <hi>Natural Method</hi> of the foundation,<note place="margin">Sect. XXV. <hi>The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Arts are still improveable.</hi>
               </note> and progress of <hi>Manual Arts.</hi> And they may still be advanc'd to a higher perfection, than they have yet obtain'd, either by the discovery of new <hi>matter,</hi> to imploy mens hands; or by a new <hi>Transplantation</hi> of the same <hi>matter,</hi> or by handling the old subjects of <hi>Manufactures</hi> after a new way, in the same places.</p>
            <p>And First, we have reason to expect, that there may still arise new <hi>matter,</hi> to be manag'd by <hi>human Art,</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi>: And that from the parts of the <hi>Earth,</hi> that are yet unknown: or from the new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd <hi>America</hi>: or from our own Seas, and Lands, that have bin long search'd into, and Inhabited.</p>
            <p>If ever any more <hi>Countrys</hi> which are now hidden from us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>First by new matter from new Lands.</hi>
               </note> shall be reveal'd, it is not to be question'd, but there will be also opened to our <hi>observation,</hi> very many kinds of <hi>living Creatures,</hi> of <hi>Minerals,</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> nay of <hi>Handicrafts,</hi> with which we have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto unacquainted. This may well be expected
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:99266:202"/>
if we remember, that there was never yet any <hi>Land,</hi> discover'd, which has not given us divers new sorts of <hi>Animals,</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> of different Features, and shapes, and virtues from our own, or has not supply'd us with some new artificial <hi>Engine,</hi> and <hi>Contrivance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that our <hi>Discoveries</hi> may still be inlarg'd to farther <hi>Countrys,</hi> it is a good proof, that so many spatious shores, and Mountains, and Promontories, appear to our <hi>Southern,</hi> and <hi>Northern Sailors</hi>; of which we have yet no account, but only such as could be taken by a remote prospect at Sea. From whence, and from the Figure of the <hi>Earth,</hi> it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that almost as much space of Ground remains still in the <hi>dark,</hi> as was fully known in the Times of the <hi>Assyrian,</hi> or <hi>Persian Monarchy.</hi> So that without as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming the vain prophetic Spirit, which I lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, we may foretell, that the <hi>Discovery</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>new World</hi> is still behind.</p>
            <p>To accomplish this, there is only wanting the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Longitude,</hi> which cannot now be far off, seing it is generally allow'd to be feasible, seing so many rewards are ready to be heap'd on the <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>; and (I will also add) seing the <hi>Royal Society</hi> has taken it, into its peculiar care. This if it shall be once accomplish'd, will make well-nigh as much alteration in the World, as the invention of the <hi>Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> did before. And then our <hi>Posterity</hi> may outgo us, as much as we can travail farther than the <hi>Ancients</hi>; whose <hi>Demy-Gods,</hi> and <hi>Heroes</hi> did esteem it one of their chief exploits, to make a Journy as far as the <hi>Pillars of Hercules.</hi> Whoever shall think this to be a desperat business, they can only use the same <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> wherewith <hi>Columbus</hi> was at first made ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: if he had bin discorag'd by the Raillery of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:99266:202"/>
his adversaries, by the judgment of most <hi>Astronomers</hi> of his time, and even by the intreaties of his own <hi>Companions,</hi> but three daies before he had a fight of <hi>Land,</hi> we had lost the knowledge of half the <hi>World</hi> at once.</p>
            <p>And as for the new-discover'd <hi>America:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. XXVI. <hi>Mechanics improveable by new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from America.</hi>
               </note> 'Tis true that has not bin altogether useless to the <hi>Mechanic Arts.</hi> But still we may ghess, that much more of its bounty is to come, if we consider, that it has not yet bin shewn above <hi>Two hundred years</hi>: which is scarce enough time, to travail it over, describe, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it, much less to pierce into all its secrets. Besides this, a good part of this space was spent in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,</hi> and <hi>setling</hi> the <hi>Spanish Government,</hi> which is a season improper for <hi>Philosophical discoveries.</hi> To this may be added, that the chief design of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thither, has bin the transportation of <hi>Bullion</hi>: which being so profitable, they may well be thought to have overseen many other of its <hi>Native Riches.</hi> But above all let us reflect on the temper of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves. They suffer no strangers to arrive there: they permit not the <hi>Natives,</hi> to know more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes their slaves. And how unfit the <hi>Spanish</hi> humor is, to improve <hi>Manufactures,</hi> in a Country so distant as the <hi>West-Indies</hi>; we may learn by their practice in <hi>Spain</hi> itself: where they commonly disdain to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise any <hi>Manual Crafts,</hi> and permit the profit of them, to be carry'd away by strangers.</p>
            <p>From all this, we may make this <hi>Conclusion,</hi> that if ever that vast Tract of <hi>Ground</hi> shall come to be more familiar to <hi>Europe,</hi> either by a <hi>free Trade,</hi> or by <hi>Conquest,</hi> or by any other <hi>Revolution</hi> in its Civil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: <hi>America</hi> will appear quite a new thing to us;
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:99266:203"/>
and may furnish us with an abundance of <hi>Rarities</hi> both Natural, and Artificial; of which we have bin almost as much depriv'd by its present <hi>Masters,</hi> as if it had still remain'd a Part of the <hi>unknown World.</hi>

               </note>But Lastly to come nearer home, we have no ground to despair, but very much more <hi>matter,</hi> which has bin yet unhandled, may still be brought to light, even in the most civil, and most Peopled Countries: whose <hi>Lands</hi> have bin throughly measur'd, by the hands of the most <hi>exact Surveyors</hi>; whose under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground <hi>Riches</hi> have bin accurately pry'd into; whose Cities, Islands, Rivers, and Provinces, have bin describ'd by the labors of <hi>Geographers.</hi> It is not to be doubted, but still there may be an infinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Creatures,</hi> over our heads, round about us, and under our Feet, in the large space of the <hi>Air,</hi> in the Caverns of the <hi>Earth,</hi> in the Bowels of <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> in the bottoms of <hi>Seas,</hi> and in the shades of <hi>Forests</hi>: which have hitherto escap'd all <hi>mortal Senses.</hi> In this the <hi>Microscope</hi> alone is enough to silence all opposers. Before that was invented, the chief help that was given to the <hi>eies</hi> by <hi>Glasses,</hi> was only to strengthen the dim sight of old <hi>Age</hi>: But now by the means of that excellent <hi>Instrument,</hi> we have a far greater number of different kinds of things reveal'd to us, than were contain'd in the visible Univers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And even this is not yet brought to <hi>perfection.</hi> The chief labors that are publish'd in this way, have bin the <hi>Observations</hi> of some <hi>Fellows</hi> of the <hi>Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</hi> Nor have they as yet apply'd it to all subjects, nor tried it in all materials, and Figures of <hi>Glass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>eies</hi> therefore there may still be given a vast addition of <hi>Objects</hi>: And proportionably to all
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:99266:203"/>
all the other senses. This Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> has undertaken to make out, that <hi>Tasting, Touching, Smelling,</hi> and <hi>Hearing,</hi> are as improveable as the <hi>Sight</hi>: And from his excellent <hi>performances</hi> in the one, we may well rely on his <hi>promise</hi> in all the rest.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Increas</hi> of <hi>Manual Arts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. XXVIII. <hi>Mechanics Improvable by Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantations.</hi>
               </note> which is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to succeed, may happen by the farther <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting,</hi> and <hi>Communicating</hi> of the several <hi>Natural Commodities</hi> of all <hi>Nations,</hi> to other <hi>Airs,</hi> and other <hi>Soils,</hi> and other ways of <hi>Cultivation.</hi> That this is not yet finish'd is evident, in that there is no <hi>Land</hi> so well furnish'd, as to produce all the various sorts of things, which its ground and Temperature is capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: and also because many of the most fertil <hi>Countrys</hi> contain large spaces, that are utterly barren.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Work</hi> then may be farther advanc'd, by three kinds of indeavors.</p>
            <p>The First by <hi>Transplanting</hi> out of one Land into another, of the same scituation in respect of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi> This may be tri'd by conveying the Eastern <hi>Spices,</hi> and other useful <hi>Vegetables,</hi> into our Western <hi>Plantations.</hi> Nor can it be imagin'd, why they should thrive in one <hi>Indies,</hi> and not in the other; why the the <hi>Soil</hi> should not be as good where the <hi>Sunsets,</hi> as where it <hi>rises:</hi> Seing there are parts of both, which lye under the same influence of that, and the other <hi>Celestial Bodies,</hi> to whose kindly heat and Neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the <hi>Oriental Nations</hi> are suppos'd to owe their advantages. This also may be attempted in our <hi>Northern Climats</hi>: As for instance, the <hi>Flax</hi> of which we stand so much in need, may prosper in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in many vast Tracts of Ground, now only possessed by wild <hi>Beasts,</hi> or <hi>Tories</hi> almost as wild.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:99266:204"/>The second <hi>Advancement</hi> of this <hi>Work</hi> may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd by carrying and transplanting <hi>living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> and <hi>Vegetables</hi> from one Climat to another. This will be very beneficial, though it will be perform'd with a various success. Sometimes the <hi>Soil</hi> and the <hi>Air</hi> being chang'd, will give a new force to the new <hi>Guests</hi>; as the <hi>Arabian Horse,</hi> by mingling with our <hi>Breed,</hi> produces a more serviceable <hi>Race</hi> than either of them single. And somtimes the alteration will be for the wors; as the <hi>Vine</hi> of <hi>France</hi> brought into <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Horses</hi> and <hi>Dogs</hi> of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>France</hi>; both which are found to degenerat exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: Their <hi>Soil,</hi> and their <hi>Sun,</hi> it seems, being fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to produce things of <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>delight</hi>; and our <hi>Air</hi> and our <hi>Earth</hi> being more proper to beget <hi>valor</hi> and <hi>strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third way of <hi>communication</hi> to be try'd, is by removing the <hi>Plants</hi> and the productions of the same Country from one part of it into another; and by practising every where all the sorts of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> which are us'd in some places with success. That this is not enough perfected even in <hi>England,</hi> is manifest to every one that beholds the <hi>Kentish</hi> Orchards, and the <hi>Herefordshire</hi> Hedges; which seem to upbraid the laziness of other Countries, whose High-ways are only fenc'd with Thorns and Briars, or at the best with Hasel; while theirs are beautifi'd with Apples, Pears, and Cherries.</p>
            <p>Now then, in every one of these <hi>Transplantations,</hi> the chief Progress that has hitherto bin made, has bin rather for the <hi>collection</hi> of <hi>Curiosities</hi> to adorn <hi>Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> and <hi>Gardens,</hi> than for the solidity of <hi>Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Discoveries</hi>: Yet there may be a prodigious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage made in them all, both for the one end and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:99266:204"/>
the other. And in this it will be found, as in many other things, that if men only intend a little <hi>curiosity</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> they will reap not much more by their pains: But if they regard real use, not only the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi> but a greater <hi>delight</hi> will also follow thereon.</p>
            <p>And for our <hi>incoragement,</hi> whatever attempts of this Nature have succeeded, they have redounded to the great advantage of the <hi>Vndertakers.</hi> The <hi>Orange</hi> of <hi>China</hi> being of late brought into <hi>Portugal,</hi> has drawn a great <hi>Revenew</hi> every year from <hi>London</hi> alone. The Vine of the <hi>Rhene</hi> taking root in the <hi>Canaries,</hi> has produc'd a far more delicious juyce, and has made the Rocks and the Sun-burnt Ashes of those Islands, one of the richest spots of Ground in the <hi>World.</hi> And I will also instance in that which is now in a good forwardness: <hi>Virginia</hi> has already given <hi>Silk</hi> for the clothing of our <hi>King</hi>; and it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen hereafter to give Cloaths to a great part of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and a vast Treasure to our <hi>Kings:</hi> If the <hi>Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms</hi> shall thrive there (of which there seems to be no doubt) the profit will be inexpressible. We may guess at it, by considering what numbers of <hi>Caravans,</hi> and how many great Cities in <hi>Persia,</hi> are maintain'd by that <hi>Manufacture</hi> alone, and what mighty Customs it yearly brings into the <hi>Sophi's Revenew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if both these helps should chance to fail;<note place="margin">Sect. XXIX. <hi>Mechanics improveable by the old matter of Arts.</hi>
               </note> if nothing <hi>new</hi> should ever come into our hands; and if there could be no farther alteration made by <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting</hi>; yet we may still take comfort, and rely on the <hi>old matter</hi> itself, on which all our present <hi>Arts</hi> have bin devis'd. This certainly will take away all distrust in this business: For it may be observ'd, that the greatest part of all our <hi>New Inventions</hi> have not
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:99266:205"/>
bin rais'd from Subjects before untouch'd (though they also have given us very many) but from the most studied and most familiar things, that have bin always in mens hands and eies. For this I shall only instance in <hi>Printing,</hi> in the <hi>Circulation of the Blood,</hi> in Mr. <hi>Boyl's</hi> Engine for the sucking out of <hi>Air,</hi> in the making of <hi>Guns,</hi> in the <hi>Microscopical Glasses,</hi> and in the <hi>Pendulum Clocks</hi> of <hi>Hugenius.</hi> What might we have believ'd to be perfect, if not the <hi>Art</hi> of mens <hi>Communicating</hi> their thoughts one to another? What was neerer to them than their <hi>Blood,</hi> by which their Life subsists? And what more ready to be found out than its <hi>Motion?</hi> In what Subject had the wit of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers</hi> bin more shewn, than in the variety of <hi>Clocks</hi> and <hi>Watches?</hi> What thing was more in mens view than <hi>Glass,</hi> thorow which in the East-Countries the very Light itself is admitted, whereby we discern all things else? What more natural to us than the <hi>Air</hi> we breath? with which we form every word to express other things? What was more studied than the <hi>Art of Fighting?</hi> What little <hi>Stratagem,</hi> or <hi>Fortification,</hi> or <hi>Weapon,</hi> could one have thought to have bin conceal'd from the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> who were so curious in the <hi>Discipline</hi> of <hi>War?</hi> And yet in all these the most obvious things, the greatest changes have bin made by late <hi>Discoveries</hi>; which cannot but convince us, that many more are still to come from things that are as common, if we shall not be wanting to our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sect. XXX. <hi>Mechanics Improvable by the spred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
               </note>And this we have good reason to trust will be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, if this <hi>Mechanic Genius,</hi> which now prevails in these parts of <hi>Christendom,</hi> shall happen to spread wider amongst our selves, and other <hi>Civil Nations</hi>;
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:99266:205"/>
or if by some good Fate it shall pass farther on to other Countries that were yet never fully civiliz'd. We now behold much of the Northern Coasts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and almost all <hi>Afric,</hi> to continue in the rude state of <hi>Nature</hi>: I wish I had not an instance neerer home, and that I did not find some parts of our own <hi>Monarchy</hi> in as bad a condition. But why may we not suppose, that all these may in cours of Time be brought to lay aside the untam'd wildness of their present manners? Why should we use them so cruelly as to believe, that the goodness of their <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator</hi> has not also appointed them their season of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite and happy life, as well as us? Is this more unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to happen, than the change that has been made in the <hi>World</hi> these last seventeen hundred years? This has bin so remarkable, that if <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> should now arise in <hi>Greece</hi> again, they would stand amaz'd at the horrible divastation of that which was the <hi>Mother of Arts.</hi> And if <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> should return to life, they would scarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> to be the same which they describ'd: they would now behold them cover'd over with <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Palaces,</hi> which were then over-run with <hi>Forests</hi> and <hi>Thickets:</hi> they would see all manner of <hi>Arts</hi> florishing in these Countries, where the chief <hi>Art,</hi> that was practis'd in their time, was that barbarous one of <hi>painting their Bodies,</hi> to make them look more terrible in <hi>Battel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then being imagin'd, that there may some lucky Tyde of <hi>Civility</hi> flow into those <hi>Lands,</hi> which are yet salvage, there will a double improvement thence arise, both in respect of our selves and them: For even the present <hi>skilful</hi> parts of mankind, will be thereby made more <hi>skilful</hi>; and the other will not
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:99266:206"/>
only increase those <hi>Arts</hi> which we shall bestow upon them, but will also venture on new serches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>If any shall doubt of the first of these <hi>Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> let them consider, that the spreading of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> wider, does beget a higher and a cleerer <hi>Genius</hi> in those that injoy'd it before.</p>
            <p>But the chief Benefit will arise from the <hi>New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts</hi>: For they will not only receive from us our <hi>old Arts,</hi> but in their first vigour will proceed to <hi>new ones</hi> that were not thought of before. This is reasonable enough to be granted: For seing they come fresh and unwearied, and the thoughts of men being most violent in the first opening of their <hi>Fancies</hi>; it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they will soon pass over those difficulties about which these people that have bin long <hi>Civil,</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready tyr'd. To this purpose I might give as many <hi>Examples</hi> as there have bin different <hi>periods</hi> of <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing</hi>; that those <hi>Nations</hi> which have bin taught, have prov'd wiser and more dextrous than their <hi>Teachers.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> took their first hints from the <hi>East</hi>; but out-did them in <hi>Music,</hi> in <hi>Statuary,</hi> in <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> in <hi>Limning,</hi> in <hi>Navigation,</hi> in <hi>Horsmanship,</hi> in <hi>Husbandry,</hi> as much as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> or <hi>Assyrians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded their unskilful <hi>Ancestors</hi> in <hi>Architecture, Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi> or <hi>Geometry.</hi> The <hi>Germans,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Britains,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the modern <hi>Italians,</hi> had their light from the <hi>Romans</hi>; but surpass'd them in most of their own <hi>Arts,</hi> and well-nigh doubled the ancient stock of <hi>Trades</hi> deliver'd to their keeping.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sect. XXXI. <hi>Mechanics are improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers besides Tradesmen.</hi>
               </note>So then, the whole <hi>Prize</hi> is not yet taken out of our hands: The <hi>Mechamic Invention</hi> is not quite worn away; nor will be, as long as new Subjects may
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:99266:206"/>
be discovered, as long as our old materials may be alter'd or improv'd, and as long as there remains any corner of the <hi>World</hi> without <hi>Civility.</hi> Let us next observe, whether men of different ways of life are capable of performing any thing towards it, besides the <hi>Artificers</hi> themselves. This will quickly appear undeniable, if we will be convinc'd by <hi>Instances</hi>: For it is evident, that divers sorts of <hi>Manufactures</hi> have been given us by men who were not bred up in <hi>Trades</hi> that resembled those which they discover'd. I shall mention Three; that of <hi>Printing, Powder,</hi> and the <hi>Bow-Dye.</hi> The <hi>Admirable Art</hi> of <hi>Composing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> was so far from being started by a man of <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that it was the Device of a <hi>Soldier:</hi> And <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> (to make recompence) was invented by a <hi>Monck,</hi> whose cours of life was most avers from handling the <hi>Materials</hi> of <hi>War.</hi> The ancient <hi>Tyrian Purple</hi> was brought to light by a <hi>Fisher</hi>; and if ever it shall be recover'd, it is likely to be done by some such acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The <hi>Scarlat</hi> of the <hi>Moderns</hi> is a very beautiful Color; and it was the production of a <hi>Chymist,</hi> and not of a <hi>Dyer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed the <hi>Instances</hi> of this kind are so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that I dare in general affirm, That those men who are not peculiarly conversant about any one sort of <hi>Arts,</hi> may often find out their <hi>Rarities</hi> and <hi>Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities</hi> sooner, than those who have their minds confin'd wholly to them. If we weigh the <hi>Reasons</hi> why this is probable, it will not be found so much a <hi>Paradox,</hi> as perhaps it seems at the first Reading. The <hi>Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> themselves, having had their hands directed from their Youth in the same <hi>Methods of Working,</hi> cannot when they pleas so easily alter their custom, and turn themselves into new Rodes of Practice. Besides this,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:99266:207"/>
they chiefly labor for present livelyhood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot defer their <hi>Expectations</hi> so long, as is commonly requisit for the ripening of any <hi>new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance.</hi> But especially having long handled their <hi>Instruments</hi> in the same fashion, and regarded their <hi>Materials,</hi> with the same thoughts, they are not apt to be surpriz'd much with them, nor to have any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>Fancies,</hi> or <hi>Raptures</hi> about them.</p>
            <p>These are the usual defects of the <hi>Artificers</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: Whereas the men of freer lives, have all the contrary advantages. They do not approach those <hi>Trades,</hi> as their dull, and unavoidable, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>employments,</hi> but as their <hi>Diversions.</hi> They come to try those <hi>operations,</hi> in which they are not very exact, and so will be more frequently subject to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit errors in their proceeding: which very faults, and wandrings will often guid them into new <hi>light,</hi> and new <hi>Conceptions.</hi> And lastly there is also some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege to be allow'd to the <hi>generosity</hi> of their <hi>spirits,</hi> which have not bin subdu'd, and clogg'd by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>toyl,</hi> as the others. <hi>Invention</hi> is an <hi>Heroic</hi> thing, and plac'd above the reach of a low, and vulgar <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> It requires an <hi>active,</hi> a bold, a nimble, a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>mind</hi>: a thousand difficulties must be contemn'd, with which a mean heart would be broken: many <hi>attempts</hi> must be made to no purpose: much <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> must sometimes be scatter'd without any return: much violence, and vigor of thoughts must attend it: some irregularities, and excesses must be granted it, that would hardly be pardon'd by the severe <hi>Rules of Prudence.</hi> All which may persuade us, that a large, and an unbounded mind is likely to be the <hi>Author</hi> of greater <hi>Productions,</hi> than the calm, obscure, and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd indeavors of the <hi>Mechanics</hi> themselves: and
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:99266:207"/>
that as in the <hi>Generation of Children,</hi> those are usually observ'd to be most sprightly, that are the stollen Fruits of an unlawful <hi>Bed</hi>; so in the Generations of the <hi>Brains,</hi> those are often the most vigorous, and witty, which men beget on other <hi>Arts,</hi> and not on their own.</p>
            <p>This came seasonably in,<note place="margin">§. XXXII. <hi>Mechanics best Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </note> to stop the undeserv'd clamors, which perhaps in this humorous <hi>Age,</hi> some <hi>Tradesmen</hi> may raise against the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring within the compass of their Territories. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed to my Third <hi>Particular,</hi> which I have aym'd at in the Two former, <hi>that the surest increas remaining to be made in Manual Arts, is to be perform'd by the conduct of Experimental Philosophy.</hi> This will appear undeniable when we shall have found, that all other causes of such <hi>Inventions</hi> are <hi>defective</hi>: and that for this very reason, becaus the <hi>Trials of Art,</hi> have bin so little united with the plain labors of mens hands.</p>
            <p>I have already given this account of the former <hi>Arts</hi> that we use, that the greatest Part of them has bin produc'd, either by <hi>Luxury,</hi> or <hi>chance,</hi> or <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi>: all which must be confess'd to be mean, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble causes of the <hi>Rational Mechanics.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The First of these has bin, that vanity, and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of life, which the delights of <hi>Peace,</hi> and greatness of <hi>Empire</hi> have alwayes introduc'd. This has bin the original of very many extravagant <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Pleasure</hi>: to whose <hi>Promotion,</hi> it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit that we should give any help, seing they are already too excessive. And indeed, if we consider the vast number of the <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Luxury,</hi> compar'd to the sound, and the substantial ones of use: we shall find that the wit of men has bin as much defective in
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:99266:208"/>
the one, as redundant in the other. It has been the constant error of mens labors in all <hi>Ages,</hi> that they have still directed them to improve those of <hi>pleasure,</hi> more than those of <hi>profit.</hi> How many, and how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant have bin the <hi>Ornaments</hi> about <hi>Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es?</hi> And how few <hi>Inventions,</hi> about new frames for <hi>Coaches,</hi> or about <hi>Carts,</hi> and <hi>Ploughs?</hi> What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious expence has bin thrown away, about the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions of <hi>Cloaths?</hi> But how little indeavors have there bin, to invent new <hi>materials</hi> for <hi>Cloathing,</hi> or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect those we have? The <hi>Furniture,</hi> and <hi>magnificence</hi> of <hi>Houses,</hi> is risen to a wonderful beauty within our memory: but few or none have throughly studied the well ordring of <hi>Timber,</hi> the hardning of <hi>Stone,</hi> the improvement of <hi>Mortar,</hi> and the making of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Bricks.</hi> The like may be shewn in all the rest: wherein the solid <hi>Inventions</hi> are wont to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd by <hi>gawdiness,</hi> and <hi>superfluity</hi>; which vanity has been caus'd by this, that the <hi>Artists</hi> have chiefly bin guided, by the fancies of the rich, or the yong, or of vain <hi>humorists,</hi> and not by the <hi>Rules,</hi> and <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of men of <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second occasion that has given help to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas of <hi>Mechanics</hi> has bin <hi>Chance</hi>: For in all Ages by some casual accidents, those things have bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd, which either men did not think of, or else sought for in vain. But of this the <hi>Benevolence</hi> is irregular, and most uncertain: This indeed can scarce by styl'd the <hi>work</hi> of a man. The <hi>Hart</hi> deserves as much prays of <hi>Invention,</hi> for lighting on the herb, that cures it; as the man who blindly stumbles on any profitable <hi>Work,</hi> without foresight, or conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>The last that I shall allege is <hi>necessity.</hi> This has
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:99266:208"/>
given rise to many great <hi>Enterprises</hi>: and like the cruel Step-Mother of <hi>Hercules,</hi> has driven men upon <hi>Heroic Actions,</hi> not out of any tender affection, but hard usage. Nor has it only bin an excellent Mistress to particular men, but even to whole <hi>States</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</hi> For which reason some have preferr'd a <hi>Barren Soil,</hi> for the Seat of an <hi>Imperial City,</hi> before a <hi>Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:</hi> becaus thereby the inhabitants being compell'd to take pains, and to live industriously, will be secure from the dangerous inchantments of <hi>plenty,</hi> and <hi>ease</hi>; which are fatal to the beginnings of all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths. Yet the defects of this severe <hi>Author</hi> of great <hi>Works,</hi> are very many. It often indeed ingages men in brave attempts, but seldom carryes them on to finish what they begin: It labors at first for want of <hi>Bread</hi>; and that being obtain'd it commonly gives over: It rather sharpens than enlarges mens <hi>Wits:</hi> It sooner puts them upon small <hi>shifts,</hi> than great <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs:</hi> It seldom rises to high, or magnanimous things: For the same necessity which makes men <hi>inventive,</hi> does commonly depress, and fetter their <hi>Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now these Principal causes of <hi>Mechanic disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries</hi> being found for the greatest part to be either corrupt, or weak: It is but just, that <hi>Reason</hi> itself should interpose, and have some place allow'd it in those <hi>Arts,</hi> which ought to be the chief <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Reason.</hi> It is a shame to the dignity of <hi>human Nature</hi> itself, that either mens lusts should tempt them, or their necessities drive them, or blind fortune should lead them in the dark, into those things in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the chief <hi>Praerogative</hi> of their condition. What greater <hi>Privilege</hi> have men to boast of than this; that they have the pow'r of using, directing, changing,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:99266:209"/>
or advancing all the rest of the Creatures? This is the <hi>Dominion</hi> which <hi>God</hi> has given us over the <hi>Works</hi> of his hands. And if we will either answer the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of <hi>Heven,</hi> or deserve so high an honor, we ought rather to manage this <hi>Dominion</hi> by <hi>diligence,</hi> and <hi>Counsail,</hi> than by <hi>Chance,</hi> or <hi>Luxury,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is impossible for us to administer this <hi>power</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, unless we prefer the light of men of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> to be a constant overseer, and director, of the <hi>indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> of those that labor. The Benefits are vast, that will appear upon this conjunction. By this means the <hi>Inventions</hi> of <hi>chance</hi> will be spread into all their various uses, and multiply'd into many new advantages: By this the <hi>Productions</hi> of <hi>necessity,</hi> will be amplify'd, and compleated: By this those of <hi>Luxury,</hi> and <hi>Wantoness</hi> may be reduc'd to some solid ends: By this may be rays'd almost as certain a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to invent new <hi>Mechanics,</hi> as now any particular <hi>Mechanics</hi> can practise, to produce their own <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> By this the weak minds of the <hi>Artists</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves will be strengthen'd, their low conceptions advanc'd, and the obscurity of their shops inlighten'd: By this their thoughts will be directed to better <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,</hi> and <hi>Materials:</hi> By this their <hi>Poverty</hi> will be assisted, and they will be inabled to attempt more costly <hi>Trials:</hi> By this that will be amended, which has bin hitherto the misfortune of such <hi>Inventions,</hi> that they have commonly fallen into mens hands, who understand not their <hi>Natures, uses,</hi> or <hi>improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>: By this the conceptions of men of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which are wont to soar too high, will be made to descend into the <hi>material World</hi>: And the flegmatick imaginations of men of <hi>Trade,</hi> which use to grovell too much on the ground, will be exalted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="397" facs="tcp:99266:209"/>It was said of <hi>Civil Government</hi> by <hi>Plato,</hi> that then the World will be best rul'd, when either <hi>Philosophers</hi> shall be chosen <hi>Kings,</hi> or <hi>Kings</hi> shall have <hi>Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> minds. And I will affirm the like of <hi>Philosophy.</hi> It will then attain to perfection, when either the <hi>Mechanic Laborers</hi> shall have <hi>Philosophical heads</hi>; or the <hi>Philosophers</hi> shall have <hi>Mechanical hands</hi>: For the proof of this I need only propose one instance, with which I am furnish'd by <hi>Antiquity</hi>; and it is of <hi>Archimedes</hi>: by this example alone, we may at once chastise the sloth of all <hi>Ages</hi> since his time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the present contemners of <hi>Mechanic Knowledge.</hi> This <hi>Great man</hi> was one of the first who apply'd his skill, in the <hi>Mathematics,</hi> and <hi>Phisics,</hi> to the practices and motions of <hi>Manual Trades.</hi> And in these his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess was so prodigious, that the true contrivances of his hands did exceed all the <hi>Fabulous strength,</hi> which either the <hi>Ancient stories,</hi> or modern <hi>Romances</hi> have bestow'd on their <hi>Heroes.</hi> The <hi>weights</hi> he mov'd were so vast, and the <hi>Engines</hi> he fram'd had such dreadful effects, that his force could neither be resisted, by <hi>Seas,</hi> or <hi>Mountains,</hi> or <hi>Fleets,</hi> or <hi>Armies,</hi> which are the greatest powers of Nature, and Men. He alone sustain'd the burden of his falling Country: He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone kept the <hi>Romans</hi> at a Bay, to whom the whole World was to yield. And perhaps he had come off victorious at last, if he had not contended with the Fatal valour of <hi>Marcellus</hi>: amongst all whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, these are recorded as the Two greatest, that he first shew'd that <hi>Hannibal</hi> might be subdu'd; and that he vanquish'd <hi>Syracuse,</hi> though it was defended by <hi>Archimedes.</hi>

               <note place="margin">§. XXXIII. <hi>The inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of new Mechanics will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the old.</hi>
               </note>Thus far I hope the way is cleer as I go: I have some confidence that I have sufficiently prov'd, that the <hi>Invention</hi> of <hi>Trades</hi> may still proceed farther, and that by the help of men of free lives, and by this cours of <hi>Experiments.</hi> But yet the main <hi>difficulty</hi> continues unremov'd. This arises from the suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Tradesmen</hi> themselves: They are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infected with the narrowness that is natural to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations,</hi> which are wont to resist all <hi>new comers,</hi> as profess'd Enemies to their <hi>Privileges:</hi> And by these interessed men it may be objected, That the growth of <hi>new Inventions</hi> and <hi>new Artificers,</hi> will infallibly reduce all the old ones to poverty and decay.</p>
            <p>But to take off their <hi>fears</hi> in this particular, they are to be inform'd, That there are two sorts of <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> which the <hi>Royal Society</hi> attempts in <hi>Mechanical</hi> matters. The first will be employ'd about the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, changing, and correcting of the old <hi>Mechanics</hi> themselves: The second, about inventing of New. In the first of these they can have no ground of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie; seing they are not intended to bring others over their heads, but only to beautifie and fasten those which they already injoy. And even this is a work so necessary to be done, that if there were not a continual reparation made in them, they would soon languish, and insensibly consume away into <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barism</hi>: For the <hi>Arts</hi> of mens hands are subject to the same infirmity with <hi>Empire,</hi> the best <hi>Art</hi> of their minds, of which it is truly observ'd, that whenever it comes to stand still, and ceases to advance, it will soon go back and decreas.</p>
            <p>Hence it appears, that one part of <hi>Experiments,</hi> and that a very considerable part, is free from their
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:99266:210"/>
               <hi>Cavils.</hi> Let us then go on to the other kinds, which purpose the striking out of <hi>new Mechanics</hi>: Of these I will also assert the Innocence, in respect of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors. In few words, the <hi>Old Arts</hi> are so far from being indanger'd by the <hi>New,</hi> that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves will receive a proportionable <hi>increas,</hi> as the <hi>New</hi> shall arise. The warmth and vigour which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends new <hi>Discoveries,</hi> is seldome wont to confine it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to its own Sphere, but is commonly extended farther to the ornament of its Neighbors. This is apparent in the degrees by which all <hi>Nations</hi> use to attain to a higher <hi>civility.</hi> The ordinary method wherein this happens, is the introduction of some one or two <hi>New Arts</hi>: For they appearing with great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivity in the beginning, do not only establish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but also by stirring and inflaming mens minds, by disgracing the laziness of other <hi>Artizans,</hi> and provoking them to an aemulation, they are wont to bring an <hi>Vniversal light</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> on those <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> into whose company they are brought.</p>
            <p>It is said of the <hi>Moral Virtues,</hi> that they have such a mutual dependance, that no man can attain to <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> in any one of them, without some degree of the other. And this also is certain in the <hi>Mechanic Arts:</hi> The connexion between them is so close, that they generally use to increas in the same measure. There is no Time, nor great City, which perfectly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells in any one of them, but it is thereby made more capable of admitting the rest, or of advancing them higher if they were admitted before.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, the increas of <hi>Tradesmen</hi> is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to others, that are bred up in particular <hi>Trades,</hi> where there is no greater <hi>Employment</hi> than they can master: But there can never be an overcharge of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:99266:211"/>
               <hi>Trades</hi> themselves. That <hi>Country</hi> is still the richest and most powerful, which entertains most <hi>Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</hi> The hands of men employ'd are true <hi>Riches:</hi> The saving of those hands by inventions of <hi>Art,</hi> and applying them to other <hi>Works,</hi> will increase those <hi>Riches.</hi> Where this is done, there will never a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient matter for profit be wanting: For if there be not vent for their productions at home, we shall have it abroad. But where the ways of Life are few, the fountains of Profit will be possess'd by few; and so all the rest must live in <hi>Idleness</hi> on which inevitably insues <hi>Beggery</hi>: Whence it is manifest, that <hi>Poverty</hi> is caus'd by the fewness of <hi>Trades,</hi> and not by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>Nor is it enough to overthrow this, to tell us, that by this addition of <hi>Laborers</hi> all things will become dearer, because more must be maintain'd: For the high rate of things is an Argument of the florishing, and the cheapness of the scarcity of Money, and ill peopling of all Countries. The first is a sign of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inhabitants, which are true <hi>Greatness</hi>: The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is only a fit subject for <hi>Poets</hi> to describe, and to compare to their <hi>Golden Age</hi>: For where all things are without <hi>price</hi> or <hi>valu,</hi> they will be without <hi>Arts,</hi> or <hi>Empire,</hi> or <hi>Strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will explain all this by a Familiar and Domestic <hi>Instance.</hi> It is probable that there are in <hi>England</hi> a hundred times more <hi>Trades</hi> than the <hi>Saxons</hi> or the <hi>Danes</hi> found here in their Invasions; and withal the particular <hi>Traders</hi> live now more plentifully, and the whole Nation is wonderfully stronger than before. This also may be seen in every particular <hi>City</hi>: The greater it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more kinds of <hi>Artificers</hi> it contains; whose neighborhood and number is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:99266:211"/>
an hindrance to each others gain, that still the <hi>Tradesmen</hi> of most populous Towns are welthier than those who profess the same Crafts in Country Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> it has of late bin a universal <hi>Murmur,</hi> that <hi>Trade</hi> decays; but the contrary is evident, from the perpetual advancement of the <hi>Customs</hi>: Whence then arises the complaint? From hence, that <hi>Traders</hi> have multiplied above the proportionable increas of <hi>Trades</hi>: By this means all the <hi>old</hi> ways of gain are over-stock'd, which would soon be prevented by a constant addition of <hi>new.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The want of a right apprehending this, has always made the <hi>English</hi> avers from admitting of new <hi>Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and shorter ways of labor, and from naturallizing New-people: Both which are the fatal mistakes that have made the <hi>Hollanders</hi> exceed us in <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Trafic</hi>: They receive all <hi>Projects,</hi> and all <hi>People,</hi> and have few or no <hi>Poor</hi>: We have kept them out and suppress'd them, for the sake of the <hi>Poor,</hi> whom we thereby do certainly make the poorer.</p>
            <p>And here there is suggested to me a just occasion of lamenting the ill <hi>Treatment</hi> which has bin most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly given to <hi>Inventors</hi>; not only here in <hi>England,</hi> but in all <hi>Ages</hi> and <hi>Countries.</hi> Nor do they only meet with rough usage from those that envy their honour; but even from the <hi>Artificers</hi> themselves, for whose sakes they labor: while those that add some small matter to things begun, are usually inrich'd thereby; the <hi>Discoverers</hi> themselves have seldom found any any other entertainment than contempt and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verishment. The effects of their <hi>Industry</hi> are wont to be decry'd while they live: The fruits of their <hi>Studies</hi> are frequently alienated from their Children:
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:99266:212"/>
The little <hi>Tradesmen</hi> conspire against them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to stop the Springs from whence they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves receive nourishment: The common titles with which they are wont to be defam'd, are those of <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Projectors.</hi> I cannot deny, but many such do often mingle themselves in the noble Throng of <hi>Great Inquirers</hi>: As of old there were some that imitated <hi>Philosophers</hi> only in Beard and austerity; so I grant at this time there may false <hi>Experimenters</hi> and <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> arise, who will strive to make themselves admir'd by the loud talking of <hi>Mathematical Engines,</hi> and <hi>Glasses,</hi> and <hi>Tools</hi>; and by sounding in every place such goodly words as <hi>Chymistry,</hi> and <hi>Agriculture,</hi> and <hi>Mechanics.</hi> But though the folly of such <hi>Pretenders</hi> cannot be avoided, we must not therefore reject the sober and the judicious <hi>Observers.</hi> It is better some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to indure vanities, than out of too much nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to lose any real <hi>Invention.</hi> We ought to do with <hi>Philosophical Works,</hi> as <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>State</hi> with <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</hi> It is the wisest cours to give incoragement to all; left by shewing our selves too scrupulous of being impos'd on by <hi>falshoods,</hi> we chance to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of the <hi>knowledge</hi> of some important <hi>Truths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next <hi>Particular</hi> which I resolv'd to handle, is the advantage of <hi>Experiments</hi> in respect of <hi>Physic.</hi> On this I intended to dilate in many words, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the great weight of the <hi>Subject,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the very welfare and health of our lives, and also because it would afford me abundant matter for discours: For certainly it were easy to prove, that there may still a vast progress be made in the Tru <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Medicine,</hi> if either we consider the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Method</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Physicians</hi>; or if we observe the nature of <hi>Diseases,</hi> which alter, and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:99266:212"/>
multiply upon us every <hi>Age</hi>; or if we reflect on the <hi>Cures</hi> themselves, and how little the <hi>Invention</hi> of new ones has hitherto bin regarded.</p>
            <p>But as I was entring on this <hi>Subject,</hi> I perceiv'd that I might safely omit it, seing it is already better perform'd by Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Vsefulness of Experimental Philosophy.</hi> I will therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my Pen from this matter, which this Noble Gentleman has manag'd in the best and most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way, by using not only the force of <hi>Reason,</hi> but the conviction of particular <hi>Instances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now with so good an <hi>omen</hi> as this Gentlemans <hi>Example,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. XXXIV. <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Study for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of our Nation.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In this indeed I have much reason to applaud the <hi>generous Breeding</hi> which has been given to the <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Knowledge</hi> of this <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> above the base and contemptible <hi>Education</hi> of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all former <hi>Sects:</hi> For now <hi>Philosophy</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into our <hi>Exchange,</hi> our <hi>Church,</hi> our <hi>Palaces,</hi> and our <hi>Court,</hi> has begun to keep the best Company, to refine its fashion and appearance, and to become the Employment of the <hi>Rich,</hi> and the <hi>Great,</hi> insteed of being the Subject of their <hi>scorn</hi>: Whereas it was of old for the most part only the Study of the <hi>sullen,</hi> and the <hi>poor,</hi> who thought it the gravest part of
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:99266:213"/>
               <hi>Science</hi> to contemn the use of mankind, and to differ in <hi>habit</hi> and <hi>manners</hi> from all others, whom they slighted as madmen and fools. From this arrogant sordidness of such <hi>Principles,</hi> there could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected any <hi>Magnificent Works,</hi> but only ill-natur'd and contentious <hi>Doctrines.</hi> Whatever the <hi>Poets</hi> say of the <hi>Moral Wisdom,</hi> that it thrives best in <hi>Poverty</hi>; it is certain the <hi>Natural</hi> cannot: for in such mean and narrow conditions men perhaps may learn to <hi>despise</hi> the World, but never to <hi>know</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Now then, I will proceed not so much to exhort, as to confirm the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of our <hi>Nation,</hi> in the prosecution of this <hi>Art,</hi> to which their <hi>Purses</hi> and their <hi>generous Labors</hi> are most necessary. And for their incoragement in this way, I will briefly lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the Priveleges they have for such <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> above all the <hi>Gentry</hi> of our neighbour <hi>Nations,</hi> and above all the <hi>Nobility</hi> of former <hi>Ages</hi> in this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Principal help that they injoy, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of these Studies of Peace, is the present <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of the <hi>Interest</hi> of our <hi>Government.</hi> The chief design of the <hi>Antient English</hi> was the glory of spreading their Victories on the Continent: But this was a magnanimous mistake: For by their very <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,</hi> if they had maintain'd them, this <hi>Island</hi> had bin ruin'd, and had only become a <hi>Province</hi> to a greater <hi>Empire.</hi> But now it is rightly understood, that the <hi>English</hi> Greatness will never be supported or increased in this <hi>Age,</hi> by any other Wars but those at <hi>Sea</hi>: and for these the Service of the Multitude is fitter than of Gentlemen This we have beheld practis'd these last twenty years, wherein our <hi>Naval Strength</hi> has more than trebled it self: For though some few <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi>
               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:99266:213"/>
have still mingled themselves in those gallant actions; yet the gross of our <hi>Fleets</hi> have consisted of <hi>common men,</hi> and of <hi>Mariners,</hi> who are bred up in the rude toils of such a life.</p>
            <p>As this <hi>Observation</hi> may rais us to the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of their <hi>Valor,</hi> that such <hi>Magnanimity</hi> should be found amongst the meanest of the people; so it should also suggest to our <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who by this means are at liberty from the employments of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est danger, that they ought to undertake these, which will give them as great, though a securer <hi>honor.</hi> Nor will it be a disgrace to them, that the fighting for their <hi>Country</hi> is cast on men of lower ranks, if in the mean time they shall strive to inlighten and adorn, while the other defend it: For the same is ordain'd by <hi>Nature</hi> itself in the order and offices of her <hi>works:</hi> The <hi>Hevenly Bodies</hi> appear to move quietly above, to give light, and to cherish the World with a gentle influence; while the <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>War</hi> and <hi>offence</hi> are taken out of the <hi>Bowels</hi> of the <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the improvement of these <hi>Arts</hi> of peaceable <hi>Fame,</hi> they have indeed another Privilege, which can scarce be equall'd by any Kingdom in <hi>Europe</hi>: and that is the convenience and benefit of being scatter'd in the <hi>Country.</hi> And in truth, the usual cours of life of the <hi>English Gentlemen</hi> is so well plac'd between the troublesome nois of pompous Magnificence, and the baseness of avaricious Sordidness; that the true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of living according to the rules and pleasures of uncorrupt <hi>Nature,</hi> is more in their power than any others. To them, in this way of life, there can nothing offer itself, which may not be turn'd to a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Vse.</hi> Their <hi>Country Seats</hi> being remov'd from the Tumults of <hi>Cities,</hi> give them the best op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:99266:214"/>
and freedom of <hi>Observations.</hi> Their <hi>Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality,</hi> and familiar way of conversing with their Neighborhood, will alwaies supply them with Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. The leasure which their retirements afford them is so great, that either they must spend their thoughts about such attempts, or in more chargeable and less innocent <hi>divertisements.</hi> If they will consider the <hi>Hevens,</hi> and the motions of the <hi>Stars,</hi> they have there a quieter <hi>Hemisphere,</hi> and a clearer <hi>Air</hi> for that purpose. If they will observe the generations, breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, diseases, and Cures of <hi>living Creatures:</hi> their Stables, their Stalls, their Kennels, their Parks, their Ponds, will give them eternal matter of inquiry. If they would satisfy their minds with the advancing of <hi>Fruits,</hi> the beautifying, the ripening, the bettering of <hi>Plants</hi>; their Pastures, their Orchards, their Groves, their Gardens their Nurseries, will furnish them with perpetual <hi>contemplations.</hi> They may not only make their <hi>business</hi> but their very <hi>sports</hi> most serviceable to <hi>Experimental Knowledge.</hi> For that if it be rightly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated, will stand in need of such recreations, as much as the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> themselves: from their hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hawking, fishing, and fowling, that is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as much solid profit, as they delight.</p>
            <p>On both these accounts, the <hi>English Gentry</hi> has the advantage of those of <hi>France, Spain, Italy,</hi> or <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>: who are generally either shut up in <hi>Towns,</hi> and dream away their lives in the diversions of <hi>Cities</hi>: or else are ingag'd to follow their <hi>Princes</hi> Wills to forein Wars.</p>
            <p>Nor do they only excell other <hi>Nations</hi> in such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, but our own <hi>Nobility</hi> of all former Times. First they are now far more numerous, and so more may be spar'd from the civil business of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:99266:214"/>
Besides this, they are now bred up, and live in a quite different fashion. The cours of their <hi>Ancestors lives</hi> was grave, and reserv'd: They convers'd with few, but their own Servants: and seldome travell'd farther than their own Lands: This way serv'd well enough to keep up their <hi>State,</hi> and their <hi>Port:</hi> But not to help their understandings. For the formalities of <hi>life</hi> do often counterfeit <hi>Wisdom,</hi> but never beget it. Whereas now they are ingag'd in freer rodes of <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>: now the vast distance between them, and other orders of men is no more observ'd: now their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation</hi> is large, and general: now the <hi>World</hi> is become more <hi>active,</hi> and <hi>industrious</hi>: now more of them have seen the use, and manners of men, and more apply themselves to <hi>Trafic,</hi> and business than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>This alteration has bin caus'd in our memorie, either by so many <hi>Families</hi> being advanc'd to the highest degrees of <hi>Nobility,</hi> for their excelling in the <hi>Arts</hi> of the <hi>Gown</hi>: or by their frequent intermarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages with <hi>Citizens</hi>: or by the travails of the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Royal Family</hi>: or else by the Civil War itself; which is alwayes wont to be the cruellest <hi>Tyrant,</hi> or the best <hi>Reformer</hi>: either utterly to lay wast, or to civilize, and beautify, and ripen the <hi>Arts</hi> of all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. And still we have reason to expect, that this change will proceed farther, for the better: if our <hi>Gentlemen</hi> shall more condescend to engage in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and to regard the <hi>Philosophy of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The First of these since the <hi>King</hi>'s return, has bin carry'd on with great vigour, by the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Royal Company</hi>: to which as to the Twin-Sister of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> we have reason as we go along, to wish all <hi>Prosperity.</hi> In both these <hi>Institutions</hi> begun
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:99266:215"/>
together, our <hi>King</hi> has imitated the two most famous <hi>Works</hi> of the wisest of antient <hi>Kings</hi>: who at the same time sent to <hi>Ophir</hi> for <hi>Gold,</hi> and compos'd a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural History,</hi> from the Cedar to the Shrub.</p>
            <p>Nor ought our <hi>Gentry</hi> to be avers from the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Trade,</hi> out of any little jealousy, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they shall debase themselves, and corrupt their Blood. For they are to know, that <hi>Trafic,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce</hi> have given mankind a higher degree than any title of <hi>Nobility,</hi> even that of <hi>Civility,</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> itself. And at this time especially above all others, they have no reason to despise <hi>Trade</hi> as below them, when it has so great an Influence on the very <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the World. In former ages indeed this was not so remarkeable. The Seats of <hi>Empire,</hi> and <hi>Trade</hi> were seldom, or never the same. <hi>Tyre,</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> and <hi>Cades,</hi> and <hi>Marseiles</hi> had more <hi>Trafic,</hi> but less com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand than <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Athens,</hi> or <hi>Sparta,</hi> or <hi>Macedon.</hi> But now it is quite otherwise. It is now most certain that in those Coasts, whither the greatest <hi>Trade</hi> shall constantly flow, the greatest <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> will be establish'd. The caus of this difference between the antient times, and our own, is hard to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd: perhaps it is this, that formerly the greatest part of the <hi>World</hi> liv'd rudely, on their own <hi>Natural Productions</hi>: but now so many <hi>Nations</hi> being Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd, and living splendidly, there is a far greater consumption of all <hi>forein Commodities</hi>; and so the gain of <hi>Trade</hi> is become great enough to overbalance all other strength: Whether this be the <hi>reason,</hi> or no, it matters not: But the <hi>observation</hi> is true. And this we see is sufficiently known to all our Neighbors, who are earnestly bent upon the advancing of <hi>Commerce,</hi> as the best means, not only to inrich particular Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, but to enlarge their <hi>Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:99266:215"/>The next thing to be recommended to the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> has a neer kindred with the other: and that is the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Arts.</hi> For the want of such an easy cours of studies, so many of them have miscarried in their first years, and have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after abhorr'd all manner of <hi>sober Works.</hi> What else do signify the universal complaints of those who direct the <hi>Education</hi> of great mens Children? Why do they find them so hard to be fix'd to any manner of <hi>Knowledge?</hi> Their Teachers indeed are wont to impute it to the delicacy of their breeding, and to their <hi>Mothers fondness.</hi> But the chief caus of the mischief lyes deeper. They fill their heads with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and <hi>unintelligible Notions,</hi> which neither afford them pleasure in learning, nor profit in remembring them: they chiefly instruct them in such <hi>Arts,</hi> which are made for the beaten tracks of professions, and not for <hi>Gentlemen.</hi> Whereas their minds should be charm'd by the allurements, of <hi>sweeter</hi> and more <hi>plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Studies</hi>: And for this purpose <hi>Experiments</hi> are the fittest. Their <hi>Objects</hi> they may feel and behold: Their <hi>productions</hi> are most popular: Their <hi>Method</hi> is intelligible, and equal to their capacities: so that in them they may soon become their own <hi>Teachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor are they to contemn them for their <hi>plainess,</hi> and the homely <hi>matters,</hi> about which they are often employ'd. If they shall think scorn to foul their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers about them on this account, let them cast their eies back on the <hi>Original Nobility</hi> of all Countries. And if that be true, that every thing is preserv'd and restor'd by the same means which did beget it at first: they may then be taught, that their present <hi>Honor</hi> cannot be maintain'd by intemperate <hi>pleasures,</hi> or the gawdy shews of pomp; but by true <hi>Labors,</hi>
               <pb n="410" facs="tcp:99266:216"/>
and <hi>Industrious Virtu</hi>: Let them reflect on those great men who first made the name of <hi>Nobility</hi> vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And they shall find that amidst the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> the dispatch of <hi>Armies,</hi> and nois of <hi>Victories,</hi> some of them disdain'd not to <hi>work</hi> with a Spade, to dig the <hi>Earth,</hi> and to cultivate with Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing hands, the <hi>Vine,</hi> and the <hi>Olive.</hi> These in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were times, of which it were well if we had more footsteps, than in antient <hi>Authors.</hi> Then the minds of men were innocent, and strong, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful as the <hi>Earth</hi> in which they labor'd. Then the vices of human <hi>Nature</hi> were not their Pride, but their Scorn. Then <hi>Virtu</hi> was itself, neither adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the false Idols of <hi>Goodness</hi>; nor puff'd up by the empty forms of <hi>Greatness</hi>: as since it has bin in some Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> which are arriv'd at that <hi>corruption</hi> of <hi>manners,</hi> that perhaps some severe <hi>Moralists</hi> will think it had bin more needful for me to persuade the men of this Age, to continue <hi>Men,</hi> than to turn <hi>Philosophers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in this History I will forbear all farther <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,</hi> which are scarce acceptable to the humor of this time, even in our <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>Moral works,</hi> in which they are necessary. I therefore return to that which I undertook, to the agreeableness of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to all <hi>conditions,</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of our <hi>Nobility.</hi> If they require such <hi>Studies</hi> as are proportionable to the greatness of their <hi>Titles</hi>: they have here those things to consider, from whence even they themselves fetch the distinctions of their <hi>Gentility.</hi> The Minerals, the Plants, the Stones, the Planets, the Animals, they bear in their <hi>Arms,</hi> are the chief <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldry,</hi> by which those <hi>Houses</hi> are exalted above those of the vulgar. And it is a shame for them to boast
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:99266:216"/>
of the bearing of those Creatures they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. If they value the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of <hi>Families,</hi> and long race of <hi>Pedigrees</hi>: What can be more worthy their consideration, than all the divers lineages of <hi>Nature?</hi> These have more proof of their antient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent that any of them can shew. For they have all continued down in a right line, from <hi>Cause</hi> to <hi>Effect</hi>; from the <hi>Creation</hi> to this day. If they shall confine themselves to the <hi>Country,</hi> they have this for there cheap diversion. If they return to the <hi>City,</hi> this will afford them in every Shop occasions to inform their <hi>judgments,</hi> and not to devour their <hi>Estates.</hi> If they go forth to <hi>public service,</hi> to the leading of <hi>Armies,</hi> or <hi>Navies,</hi> they have this for their perpetual Counsai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and very often for their preserver. There are so many <hi>Natural,</hi> and <hi>Mechanical things,</hi> to be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately observ'd by the greatest Captains, as the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of different Arms, and ammunitions, the passages of Rivers, the streights of Mountains, the cours of Tydes, the signs of Weather, the Air, the Sun, the Wind, and the like: that though I will not determin the <hi>Knowledge of Nature,</hi> to be absolutely necessary to the great office of a <hi>General</hi>; yet I may venture to affirm that it will often prove a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful assistance and ornament, to the cours of <hi>Glory</hi> which he pursues.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Histories</hi> are full of Examples of the great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, which have happen'd by the ignorance of chief Commanders in <hi>Natural Motions,</hi> and <hi>effects</hi>; of these I will only instance in Three: The First is of <hi>Caesar</hi> himself, who had Conquer'd more <hi>Countries</hi> than most Travailers have seen, and gain'd more <hi>Battels</hi> than others have read of; yet he had like to have put a period to all his <hi>Victories,</hi> by the want of
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:99266:217"/>
an exact skill in one of the commonest <hi>Works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> This he himself relates in his second passage into <hi>Britain</hi>; when his Army was so dismay'd at the ebbing of the <hi>Sea</hi> from their Fleet, believing it to be a Stratagem of their <hi>Enemies,</hi> that scarce the courage and conduct of <hi>Caesar,</hi> could hinder them from being terrify'd to their own overthrow, which had bin a fatal misfortune to the <hi>Britains,</hi> as well as <hi>Romans</hi>; becaus from his victorious Arms, we first receiv'd the dawn of <hi>Civil Arts.</hi> The next instance of this kind is the mischance which befell the <hi>Christian Army</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Holy Wars.</hi> Their strength was great and irresistible, if they had only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that which every <hi>Egyptian</hi> could have taught them the cours, and the Time of the overflowing of the <hi>Nile.</hi> For the want of that slender knowledge, the bravest men of all <hi>Christendome,</hi> were led up to the neck in the River, and were forc'd to yield to their <hi>Enemies</hi> conditions without striking a stroke. This was occasion'd by the stupidity of the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> who commanded them; if he had bin less skillful in the <hi>Scholemen,</hi> and more in <hi>Nature,</hi> that dreadful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster had never happen'd. My Third <hi>Example</hi> of this kind is to be found in the <hi>Roman History:</hi> The <hi>Roman Army</hi> was just ready to join Battel, with one of their Enemies: the sign was given for their onset: their force was equal: a terrible combat had like to have insu'd: when on the sudden the <hi>Sun</hi> was <hi>Eclyps'd</hi>: of this the <hi>Romans</hi> were warn'd the day before. But this surpriz'd the other with so great affright, that they were immediately <hi>vanquish'd.</hi> So that not the bravest <hi>Men,</hi> nor the greatest <hi>Army,</hi> nor the best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of <hi>War</hi> got the <hi>Victory</hi>: but that Party which had the best <hi>Natural Philosopher</hi> on its side.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:99266:217"/>To this address which I have made to our <hi>Nobility,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§ XXXV. <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will be beneficial to our wits and Writers.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> I will add as an appendix another bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of <hi>Experiments,</hi> which perhaps it will scarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me to name amidst so many matters of greater weight: and that is, that their discoveries will be very serviceable to the <hi>Wits,</hi> and <hi>Writers</hi> of this, and all future <hi>Ages.</hi> But this I am provok'd to mention by the consideration of the present <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>English Nation</hi>; wherein the study of <hi>Wit,</hi> and humor of <hi>Writing</hi> prevails so much, that there are very few conditions, or degrees, or Ages of Men who are free from its infection. I will therefore declare to all those whom this Spirit has possess'd, that their is in the <hi>Works of Nature</hi> an inexhaustible Treasure of <hi>Fancy,</hi> and <hi>Invention,</hi> which will be reveal'd proportionably to the increas of their <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpose I must premise, that it is requir'd in the best, and most delightful <hi>Wit</hi>; that it be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on such images which are generally known, and are able to bring a strong, and a sensible impression on the <hi>mind.</hi> The several subjects from which it has bin rays'd in all Times, are the <hi>Fables,</hi> and <hi>Religions</hi> of the <hi>Antients,</hi> the <hi>Civil Histories</hi> of all <hi>Countries,</hi> the <hi>Customs</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> the <hi>Bible,</hi> the <hi>Sciences,</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> the several <hi>Arts</hi> of their hands, and the works of <hi>Nature.</hi> In all these, where there may be a resemblance of one thing to another, as there may be in all, there is a sufficient Foundation for <hi>Wit.</hi> This in all its kinds has its increases, heigths, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays, as well as all other human things: Let us then examin what Parts of it are already exhausted, and what remain new, and untouch'd, and are still likely to be farther advanc'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:99266:218"/>The <hi>Wit</hi> of the <hi>Fables</hi> and <hi>Religions</hi> of the <hi>Ancient World</hi> is well-nigh consum'd: They have already serv'd the <hi>Poets</hi> long enough; and it is now high time to dismiss them; especially seing they have this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>imperfection,</hi> that they were only <hi>Fictions</hi> at first: whereas <hi>Truth</hi> is never so well express'd or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify'd, as by those Ornaments which are <hi>Tru</hi> and <hi>Real</hi> in themselves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Wit</hi> which is rais'd from <hi>Civil Histories,</hi> and the Customs of <hi>Countries,</hi> is solid and lasting: The <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes</hi> it affords are substantial, and equal to the minds of men, being drawn from themselves and their own actions. Of this the wittiest Nations have always made the greatest use; their writings being adorn'd with a <hi>Wit</hi> that was free of their own <hi>Cities,</hi> consisting of <hi>Examples,</hi> and <hi>Apothegms,</hi> and <hi>Proverbs,</hi> derived from their <hi>Ancestors.</hi> This I allege, because this kind is scarce yet begun in the <hi>English Language</hi>; though our own <hi>Civil History</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds as much as any other, with great <hi>Examples</hi> and memorable Events, which may serve for the ornament of Comparison.</p>
            <p>The Manners and Tempers, and Extravagances of men are a standing and eternal foundation of <hi>Wit</hi>: This if it be gather'd from particular <hi>Observations,</hi> is call'd <hi>Humor</hi>: And the more particular they are, they are still the pleasanter. In this kind I may well affirm that our <hi>Nation</hi> excells all others, as our <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Poetry</hi> may witness.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Wit</hi> that may be borrow'd from the <hi>Bible</hi> is magnificent, and as all the other Treasures of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> it contains, inexhaustible. This may be us'd and allow'd without any danger of prophaness. The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hethens</hi> did the same: They made their <hi>Divine
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:99266:218"/>
Ceremonies</hi> the chief Subjects of their <hi>Fancies</hi>: By that means their <hi>Religions</hi> had a more awful impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, became more popular, and lasted longer in force than else they would have done. And why may not <hi>Christianity</hi> admit the same thing, if it be practis'd with <hi>sobriety</hi> and <hi>reverence?</hi> What irreligion can there be in applying some <hi>Scripture-expressions</hi> to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things?</hi> Why are not the one rather exalted and purifi'd, than the other defil'd by such applications? The very <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> themselves, who are wont to start at such <hi>Wit</hi> as <hi>Atheistical,</hi> are more guilty of its excesses than any other sort of men: For whatever they allege out of the <hi>Historical, Prophetical,</hi> or <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Writings,</hi> and apply it to themselves, their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or their Country, though they call it the mind of <hi>God,</hi> yet it is nothing else but <hi>Scripture-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison</hi> and <hi>Similitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sciences</hi> of mens brains are none of the best Materials for this kind of <hi>Wit.</hi> Very few have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily succeeded in <hi>Logical, Metaphysical, Grammatical,</hi> nay even scarce in <hi>Mathematical Comparisons</hi>; and the reason is, because they are most of them conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant about things remov'd from the Senses, and so cannot surprise the <hi>fancy</hi> with very obvious, or quick, or sensible delights.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Wit</hi> that is founded on the <hi>Arts</hi> of mens hands is masculine and durable: It consists of <hi>Images</hi> that are generally observ'd, and such visible things which are familiar to mens minds. This therefore I will reckon as the first sort, which is still improvable by the advancement of <hi>Experiments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this I will add the <hi>Works of Nature,</hi> which are one of the best and most fruitful Soils for the growth of <hi>Wit.</hi> It is apparent, that the defect of
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:99266:219"/>
the <hi>Antients</hi> in <hi>Natural Knowledge</hi> did also streighten their <hi>Fancies:</hi> Those few things which they knew, they us'd so much, and appli'd so often, that they even almost wore them away by their using. The sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Flowers, and Fruits, and Herbs, they had quite devour'd: They had tir'd out the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> with their Similitudes, more than they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy them to be wearied by their daily journeys round the <hi>Hevens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is now therefore seasonable for <hi>Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> to come forth, and to give us the <hi>understanding</hi> of new <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Qualities</hi> of things; which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their fellow-creatures, that have long born the burden alone, and have long bin vex'd by the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of <hi>Poets.</hi> This charitable assistance <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments</hi> will soon bestow. The Comparisons which these may afford will be intelligible to all, becaus they proceed from things that enter into all mens Senses. These will make the most vigorous impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on mens <hi>Fancies,</hi> becaus they do even touch their <hi>Eyes,</hi> and are neerest to their <hi>Nature.</hi> Of these the variety will be infinit; for the particulars are so, from whence they may be deduc'd: These may be always new and unsullied, seing there is such a vast number of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Mechanical things,</hi> not yet fully known or improv'd, and by consequence not yet sufficiently apply'd.</p>
            <p>The use of <hi>Experiments</hi> to this purpose is evident, by the wonderful advantage that my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> receiv'd from them. This excellent Writer was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly recompenc'd for his Noble Labors in that <hi>Philosophy,</hi> by a vast Treasure of admirable <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> which it afforded him, wherewith to express and adorn his thoughts about other matters. But I
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:99266:219"/>
will not confine this <hi>Observation</hi> to one single <hi>Author,</hi> though he was one of the first and most artificial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers of this way of <hi>Wit.</hi> I will venture to declare in general of the <hi>English Tongue,</hi> That as it contains a greater stock of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Mechanical Discoveries,</hi> so it is also more inrich'd with beautiful <hi>Conceptions,</hi> and inimitable <hi>Similitudes,</hi> gather'd from the <hi>Arts</hi> of mens hands, and the <hi>Works of Nature,</hi> than ever any other <hi>Language</hi> could produce.</p>
            <p>And now I hope what I have here said will prevail somthing with the <hi>Wits</hi> and <hi>Railleurs</hi> of this <hi>Age,</hi> to reconcile their Opinions and Discourses to these <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>: For now they may behold that their Interest is united with that of the <hi>Royal Society</hi>; and that if they shall decry the promoting of <hi>Experiments,</hi> they will deprive themselves of the most fertil Subject of <hi>Fancy</hi>: And indeed it has bin with respect to these terrible men, that I have made this long digression. I acknowledge that we ought to have a great dread of their power: I confess I believe that <hi>New Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> need not (as <hi>Caesar</hi>) fear the pale, or the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, as much as the humorous, and the merry: For they perhaps by making it ridiculous, becaus it is <hi>new,</hi> and becaus they themselves are unwilling to take pains about it, may do it more injury than all the Arguments of our severe and frowning and dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical <hi>Adversaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to gain their good will, I must acquaint them, That the Family of the <hi>Railleurs</hi> is deriv'd from the same Original with the <hi>Philosophers.</hi> The Founder of <hi>Philosophy</hi> is confess'd by all to be <hi>Socrates</hi>; and he also was the famous Author of all <hi>Irony.</hi> They ought therefore to be tender in this matter, wherein the honor of their <hi>Common Parent</hi> is concern'd: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

them to remember, that it is the fault, and not the excellence of <hi>Wit,</hi> to defile its own Nest, and not to spare its own Friends and Relations, for the sake of a jest.</p>
            <p>The truth is, The Extremes of <hi>Raillery</hi> are more offensive than those of <hi>Stupidity:</hi> It is a work of such a tender and subtil spirit, that it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently perform'd by all pretenders to it: Nor does it always agree well with the Temper of our <hi>Nation</hi>; which as it has a greater corage than to suffer <hi>derision,</hi> so it has a firmer virtu than to be wholly taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout deriding of others. Such men are therefore to know, That all things are capable of abuse from the same <hi>Topicks</hi> by which they may be commended; they are to consider, That Laughter is the easiest and the slendrest fruit of <hi>Wit</hi>; they are to understand, That it proceeds from the observation of the <hi>defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> of things; but that there is a nobler and more masculine pleasure, which is rais'd from beholding their <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Beauty:</hi> From thence they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, how great the difference is between them, and the real <hi>Philosophers</hi>: For while <hi>Nature</hi> has only form'd them to be pleas'd with its irregularities and monsters, it has given the other the delight of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and studying its most <hi>beautiful Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In plain terms, a universal abuse of every thing, though it may tickle the fancy never so much, is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human madness</hi>; as one of the <hi>Ancients</hi> well expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it, who calls such mirth <hi>humanis Bacchari rebus.</hi> If all things were made the subjects of such humour, all worthy designs would soon be laugh'd out of the World; and for our present sport, our <hi>Posterity</hi> would become barbarous. All good Enterprises ought to find assistance when they are begun, applaus when
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:99266:220"/>
they succeed, and even pity and prais if they fail. The true <hi>Raillery</hi> should be a defence for <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Virtuous Works,</hi> and should only intend the derision of extravagant, and the disgrace of vile and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable things. This kind of <hi>Wit</hi> ought to have the nature of <hi>Salt,</hi> to which it is usually compar'd; which preserves and keeps sweet the good and the sound parts of all Bodies, and only frets, dries up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys those humors which putrify and corrupt.</p>
            <p>This pleasant but unprofitable sort of men being thus dismiss'd with this fair <hi>admonition</hi>;<note place="margin">§ XXXVIII <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of our Nation.</hi>
               </note> It now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the last place, that I examin the Universal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the <hi>English Nation,</hi> and consider what effect the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> are like to have upon it, by what means their <hi>Labors</hi> may serve to encreas our advantages, and correct our imperfections. In the entrance of this Subject there are so many things presented to my thoughts, which are worthy to be declar'd to my <hi>Countrymen,</hi> that I rather think it ought to be largely manag'd by itself, than to be hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled up in the end of this <hi>Treatise</hi>: And certainly there is scarce any matter that more deserves to be handled by the best of our <hi>English Wits,</hi> than the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> of their <hi>Country.</hi> I do therefore take the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to recommend it to their hands; and to beseech them to rais their thoughts from slighter businesses, from unmanly flatteries, or vanities of <hi>Love,</hi> or use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>Burlesque,</hi> to this grave and this Noble <hi>Argument</hi>; and to remember, that if <hi>Themistocles</hi> was in the right, when he praefer'd the making of a small <hi>City</hi> great, before the playing on a <hi>Fiddle,</hi> then certainly it is the bravest employment for a worthy mind, to endeavor to make a great <hi>Kingdom</hi> greater.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="420" facs="tcp:99266:221"/>There are very many things in the <hi>Natural Genius</hi> of the <hi>English,</hi> which qualify them above any other for a <hi>Governing Nation.</hi> The scituation of our <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> is most advantageous for <hi>Command:</hi> Its native productions are most serviceable for <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:</hi> The disposition of the people is bold in dangers, severe in Discipline, valiant in Arms, virtuous in Life, relenting to the afflicted, and merciful in Conquest. The unfortunat Divisions by which our <hi>Force</hi> has bin of late distracted, are but of one or two <hi>Ages</hi> growth; the Vices to which we are subject are not natural to our <hi>Soil,</hi> but imported hither from forein <hi>Countries</hi>: The <hi>English</hi> Generosity, Fidelity, Magnanimity, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, Integrity, they ow to themselves; their Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, their Debauchery, their Divisions, their Spiritual Schisms, they have receiv'd from abroad.</p>
            <p>And now what can be a greater work than the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of all these matters? Here the <hi>Writer</hi> might have occasion of doing right to the honor of his <hi>Country,</hi> and yet reproving its faults with a just cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: He might explain the weaknesses and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of our <hi>Kingdom</hi>: He might remove the one, and confirm the other: He might compare the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our <hi>Ancestors</hi> with the Manners of this <hi>Time,</hi> and shew by what degrees this dissolution of <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> crept in: He might with a generous and tender hand, apply himself to the cure of our <hi>Religious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers</hi>: He might with irresistible <hi>Arguments</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to amend what is amiss, restore the <hi>good,</hi> and by the power of Domestic Examples reduce us back to the ancient sincerity of <hi>dealing,</hi> and <hi>innocence</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and union of <hi>Interests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The desire of seing this work perform'd, sits so much on my mind, that I cannot but once more represent it
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:99266:221"/>
to the consideration of the many eloquent and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Authors,</hi> with whom our <hi>Nation</hi> is now more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly furnish'd than ever. But if neither the necessity nor usefulness of the Subject, nor the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their Native Land, will prevail with them to set upon it; it is my purpose to excite them by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, which will indeed be hazardous to my own <hi>reputation,</hi> yet perhaps may take effect. I will try the same stratagem which I have often seen unskilful Singers use, to make those who have excellent voices shew their <hi>Art:</hi> For as they by ill <hi>singing</hi> some excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Tune are wont to provoke the others to <hi>sing,</hi> when no persuasions could move them; so do I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at my first leasure, by ill handling of this <hi>Noble Subject,</hi> to stir up men of greater abilities to imploy their skill and their judgment about it.</p>
            <p>Having thus taken this task on my self, it will not be needful here to insist long upon it before hand: I will only in few words declare, That it is the Tru concernment of <hi>England</hi> to secure itself from the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> of <hi>Strangers,</hi> both <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi>; to advance its Industry in peaceful <hi>Arts</hi>; to increas its <hi>people</hi>; to improve its own <hi>Manufactures</hi>; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the forein, of which our soil is capable; to make use of the two <hi>Kingdoms</hi> that are joyn'd with it under the same <hi>Monarch,</hi> for those productions which grow not at home; to obtain a union of mind, both in <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Matters</hi>; and to preserve the ancient form of <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all these I will only touch upon those parts of our <hi>Interest</hi> which have reference to the design of the <hi>Royal Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first thing that ought to be improv'd in the <hi>English Nation,</hi> is their <hi>Industry.</hi> This, it is tru, has
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:99266:222"/>
of late years bin marvellously advanc'd: as may be shewn, by the enlarging of <hi>Trafic,</hi> the spreading of many <hi>Fruits,</hi> the plantations of <hi>Trees,</hi> and the great improvement of <hi>Manual Arts.</hi> But it is evident, that it may still admit of farther warmth, and activity: as we may conclude, by the want of employment for yonger Brothers, and many other conditions of men; and by the number of our poor, whom <hi>Idleness,</hi> and not <hi>infirmities</hi> do impoverish. The way to compass this, is not alone by <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> and good <hi>Laws</hi>: whose force will soon be evaded by present Craft, and interpretation, or else will be <hi>antiquated</hi> by time. This perhaps our <hi>Country</hi> has found above all others: If our <hi>Laborers</hi> had bin as diligent, as our <hi>Law-givers,</hi> we had prov'd the most laborious Nation under <hi>Heven.</hi> But the tru Method of increasing <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,</hi> is by that cours which the <hi>Royal Society</hi> has begun in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> by <hi>Works,</hi> and <hi>endeavors,</hi> and not by the praescriptions of <hi>words,</hi> or <hi>Paper Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing whose promoting is so easy as <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,</hi> when it is once set on foot. This does not only propagat <hi>works</hi> but <hi>workers</hi>: Though at first it may begin on <hi>necessity,</hi> yet it will afterwards proceed upon <hi>pleasure</hi>: So that the farther it goes, the swifter it advances becaus <hi>willing works</hi> are sooner perform'd than those to which we are compell'd. This I will demonstrate by an <hi>instance</hi> which I have already al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, and it is of the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> For we may fetch <hi>examples</hi> of <hi>virtu</hi> from our own Countrymen, but of <hi>Industry</hi> from them. At first they were as lazy as the worst of ours: their hands were unus'd to labor: their manner of life was much like that of the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Britains</hi>: their Coasts lay desolat to the Sea, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:99266:222"/>
Bancks, or Towns, or Ships, or harbors: and when the <hi>Roman Emperor</hi> gather'd Cockles there, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there was litle else worth gathering. But when by the number of their people they were forc'd to look abroad, to Trade, to Fish, to <hi>labor</hi> in <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics</hi>; they soon found the sweetness as well as the toyl of their <hi>diligence</hi>: their successes and riches still added new heat to their minds; and thus they have continued <hi>improving,</hi> till they have not only disgrac'd but terrify'd their <hi>Neighbors,</hi> by their <hi>Industry.</hi> Nor will it suffice to tell us, that they ow this activity to the form of their <hi>Government.</hi> That supposition may presently be confuted by the Example of <hi>France,</hi> the most absolute <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Christendome.</hi> There it is apparent by the prodigious toyls of their people, both upon the Earth, and in their Shops, that <hi>diligence</hi> may thrive in a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as well as a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if ever the <hi>English</hi> will attain to the <hi>Mastery</hi> of <hi>Commerce,</hi> not only in <hi>discours,</hi> but <hi>reality</hi>: they must begin it by their <hi>labors,</hi> as well as by their <hi>swords</hi>: they must do it by awakening their minds, by rouz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves from this Lethargy, by <hi>action,</hi> by <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi> by <hi>working</hi>: Unless this be done, they will in vain be <hi>Victorious</hi>: At the end of their <hi>Wars</hi> they will cool again, and lose all the fruits of their <hi>Valour.</hi> The <hi>Arts</hi> of peace, and their <hi>Improvements,</hi> must proceed in equal steps with the success of their <hi>Arms</hi>: The <hi>works</hi> of our Citizens, our Plough-men, our Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, our Wood-men, our Fishers, our diggers in Mines, must be equally advanc'd with the <hi>Triumphs</hi> of our <hi>Fleets</hi>: or else their blood will be shed in vain: they will soon return to the same poverty, and want of <hi>Trade,</hi> which they strove to avoid. For as <hi>Tully</hi> professes, <hi>neminem video eloquentem factum esse victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riâ:</hi>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:99266:223"/>
So I will affirm, <hi>that we shall never be made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious by Victory alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second thing to be corrected in the <hi>English humor,</hi> is an inclination to every <hi>Novelty,</hi> and vanity of forein <hi>Countries,</hi> and a contempt of the good things of our own. This fondness is the usual fault of yong <hi>Travailers,</hi> but it has also ill effects on men of full <hi>Age.</hi> For this they are wont to allege the excuse of good <hi>Breeding.</hi> But if we could not study, or understand our own Country without the imputation of ill manners, good <hi>Breeding</hi> were the most pernicious thing in the World. For there was never yet any <hi>Nation</hi> great, which only admir'd the Customs of other people, and wholly made them the Pattern of their imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This wandring, and affected humor <hi>Experiments</hi> will lessen, above all other <hi>studies.</hi> They will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our thoughts, about our Native conveniences: they will make us intend our minds, on what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd within our own Seas: and by considering, and handling them more, will also make them more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our consideration.</p>
            <p>The Third <hi>imperfection</hi> is on the other extream, and that is a <hi>narrowness of mind,</hi> and a <hi>pusillanimous confining</hi> our thoughts to our selves, without regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing that is forein, or believing that any of their <hi>Arts,</hi> or <hi>Customs</hi> may be preferr'd before our own. This indeed is a perversness, of which the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> are not wholy to be acquitted: it being proper to <hi>Islands,</hi> and to such <hi>Countries</hi> that are divided from the rest of the <hi>World.</hi> This will be cur'd by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual <hi>Demonstrations</hi> that the <hi>Society</hi> will give, of the benefit of a universal <hi>Correspondence,</hi> and <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</hi> And this according to their Method, will be done without falling into the other vice of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:99266:223"/>
forein <hi>habits,</hi> and <hi>manners,</hi> and <hi>gestures.</hi> In these the <hi>English</hi> need not be beholding to others: but in their Fruits, in their Manufactures, in their Engines, in their works in Gold, and Silver, and Brass, and Iron, we may follow their practice, and emulate their Curiosities, without affectation.</p>
            <p>There is one instance which will shew how our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to outlandish things is to be regulated. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the <hi>French</hi> for every litle fashion of Cloaths, and to equal their <hi>Nobility</hi> in their way of life, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our honor, nor profit. For the difference between their <hi>Gentry</hi> and ours, and their <hi>Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and ours is so great; that the same manners will not be decent in us, which become them well enough. But to learn from them their <hi>skill</hi> in <hi>Horsemanship,</hi> and <hi>Arms,</hi> their <hi>Building,</hi> their <hi>Cultivation of Fruits,</hi> the <hi>Parsimony,</hi> and <hi>Industry</hi> of their <hi>Tradesmen,</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable: for in these things we are defective, and they excell. It is therefore the admiration of forein <hi>extravagances,</hi> and not the imitation of their <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies</hi> that is to be condemn'd. If we will rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately be content with our own store, than borrow what is good from abroad: we flatter our selves with the same foolish imaginations, that all <hi>Countrys</hi> had while they were barbarous. To them their <hi>Acorns,</hi> and their <hi>Cottages</hi> were at first the utmost ends of their ambition. They knew no more, nor aspir'd to any farther addition: But as soon as a new light sprung forth amongst them, they despis'd themselves and their former condition; and then they first began to understand their <hi>wants,</hi> when they perceiv'd how they might be supply'd. As long as we find, that all parts of our <hi>Country,</hi> are not Ingenious, Inventive, and Industrious alike: we cannot praesume, that we
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:99266:224"/>
have already got beyond all possibility of <hi>amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> by others patterns. As long as we behold any <hi>Citty,</hi> or <hi>Province,</hi> or <hi>Family,</hi> or <hi>Street</hi> of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, exceed the worst of ours, I will not say the best in easiness of <hi>life,</hi> or pleasantness, and smoothness of <hi>manners</hi>: we have no reason to arrogat too much to our selves; but we rather should conceive it to be a less disgrace to tread in their <hi>footsteps,</hi> than to want their perfections. As long as there remains any room for our most civil <hi>People</hi> to grow more <hi>Civil,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of Forein <hi>Inventions</hi> is not only <hi>pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> but <hi>necessary:</hi> For such is the nature of <hi>Civility,</hi> that as it increases, it still requires more <hi>Arts,</hi> though it contents itself with less Forms of living.</p>
            <p>The Fourth mischief by which the greatness of the <hi>English</hi> is suppress'd, is a want of union of <hi>Interests,</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi> This is originally caus'd by a Natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedness, to which our Temper is inclin'd: but it has bin heighten'd by our <hi>Civil differences,</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious distractions.</hi> For the sweetning of such dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is not best at first to meet, and convers about affairs of state, or spiritual controversies. For those did first occasion our <hi>animosities,</hi> and the more they are rubb'd, the rawer they will prove. But the most effectual remedy to be us'd is, first to assemble about some <hi>calm,</hi> and <hi>indifferent</hi> things, especially <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> In them there can be no cause of mutual <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperations:</hi> In them they may agree, or dissent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faction, or fierceness: and so from induring each others <hi>company,</hi> they may rise to a bearing of each others <hi>opnions</hi>; from thence to an exchange of good <hi>Offices</hi>; from thence to real <hi>Friendship</hi>: Till at last by such a Gentle, and easy <hi>Method,</hi> our several <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests</hi>
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:99266:224"/>
and <hi>Sects</hi> may come to suffer one another, with the same peaceableness as men of different <hi>Trades</hi> live one by another in the same <hi>Street.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it the least commendation the <hi>Royal Society</hi> deserves, that designing a union of mens <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Reasons,</hi> it has proceeded so far in uniting their <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>: For there we behold an unusual sight to the <hi>English Nation,</hi> that men of disagreeing parties, and ways of life, have forgotten to hate, and have met in the unanimous advancement of the same <hi>Works.</hi> There the <hi>Soldier,</hi> the <hi>Tradesman,</hi> the <hi>Merchant,</hi> the <hi>Scholar,</hi> the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> the <hi>Courtier,</hi> the <hi>Divine,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> the <hi>Papist,</hi> the <hi>Independent,</hi> and those of <hi>Orthodox Iudgment,</hi> have laid aside their names of distinction, and calmly conspir'd in a mutual agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>labors</hi> and <hi>desires</hi>: A Blessing which seems even to have exceeded that Evangelical Promise, <hi>That the Lion and the Lamb shall ly down together</hi>: For here they do not only endure each others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence without violence or fear; but they <hi>work</hi> and <hi>think</hi> in company, and confer their help to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Inventions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last part of the <hi>General Interest</hi> of our <hi>Nation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§ XXXIX. <hi>Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge will not hinder Obedience.</hi>
               </note> in which I will survey the influence of <hi>Experiments,</hi> is <hi>Obedience to the Civil Government</hi>: And we ought to be very watchful that they prove not offensive to the <hi>Supreme Power</hi>: For seing the <hi>King</hi> has honor'd them with His <hi>Royal Patronage,</hi> it is but just that the <hi>Praerogatives</hi> of His <hi>Crown</hi> should be no losers by their increas. It is indeed a common accusation, which is wont to be made against all manner of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> by those who have it not, That it renders men mutinous, arrogant, and incapable of <hi>Superiors:</hi> But if this be
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:99266:225"/>
admitted, we shall aspers <hi>human Nature</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> with the greatest calumny. This weer to affirm, That men can not exercise their <hi>Reason</hi> without being <hi>factious</hi> and <hi>unruly</hi>; and that <hi>Civil Government</hi> will be insupportable to all but ignorant men and fools: which is so far from being tru, that it were easie to prove that those <hi>Nations</hi> which are void of all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> cannot be properly said to pay a right <hi>Obedience</hi> to their <hi>Soveraigns</hi>; but that the subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under which they live, rather deserves to be styl'd the stupidity and slavery of Beasts, than a just and a manly submission.</p>
            <p>But to limit this Question to the particular kind of <hi>Knowledge</hi> which is now under debate, it is certain that the skill of <hi>Nature</hi> ought so little to be suspected for making men pervers and ungovernable, that it is the best praeservative against <hi>disobedience.</hi> One of the principal Causes of this is a misguided <hi>Conscience,</hi> and opposing the pretended Dictates of <hi>God</hi> against the Commands of the <hi>Sovereign.</hi> This I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy shewn, that these <hi>labors</hi> will moderat and reform, by abolishing or restraining the fury of <hi>Enthusiasm.</hi> Another is idle poverty, which drives men into ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leness, melancholy, discontent, and at last into resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>lawful Authority.</hi> To this <hi>Experiments</hi> will afford a certain cure; they will take away all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of idleness, by a constant cours of pleasant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors; they will employ men about profitable <hi>Works,</hi> as well as <hi>delightful</hi>; by the pleasure of their <hi>Discoveries</hi> they will wear off the roughness, and sweeten the humorous peevishness of mind, whereby many are sowr'd into <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the most fruitful Parent of <hi>Sedition</hi> is <hi>Pride,</hi> and a lofty conceit of mens own <hi>wisdom</hi>; whereby
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:99266:225"/>
they presently imagine themselves sufficient to direct and censure all the <hi>actions</hi> of their <hi>Governors.</hi> And here that is true in <hi>Civil affairs,</hi> which I have already quoted out of my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> concerning <hi>Divine:</hi> A litle <hi>Knowledge</hi> is subject to make men headstrong, insolent, and untractable; but a great deal has a quite contrary effect, inclining them to be submissive to their <hi>Betters,</hi> and obedient to the <hi>Sovereign Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Science</hi> that is acquir'd by <hi>Disputation,</hi> teaches men to cavil well, and to find fault with accurate subtilty; it gives them a fearless confidence of their own judgments; it leads them from contending in sport, to oppositions in earnest; it makes them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that every thing is to be handled for, and against, in the <hi>State,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Schools.</hi> But the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feign'd and laborious <hi>Philosophy</hi> gives no countenance to the vain dotages of privat <hi>Politicians</hi>: that bends its <hi>Disciples</hi> to regard the benefit of mankind, and not the disquiet: that by the moderation it prescribes to our thoughts about <hi>Natural Things,</hi> will also take away all sharpness and violence about <hi>Civil</hi>: The <hi>Work</hi> of that is so vast, that it cannot be perform'd without the assistance of the <hi>Prince</hi>: It will not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore undermine his <hi>Authority</hi> whose aid it implores: that prescribes a better way to bestow our time, than in contending about litle differences, in which both the Conquerors and the Conquer'd have always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to repent of their success: That shews us the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of ord'ring the very motions of senseless and irrational things; and therefore how much harder it is to rule the restless minds of men: That teaches men <hi>humility,</hi> and acquaints them with their own <hi>errors</hi>; and so removes all overweening haughtiness of mind, and swelling imaginations, that they are better able
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:99266:226"/>
to manage Kingdoms than those who possess them. This without question is the chief root of all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness of <hi>Subjects</hi> to their <hi>Princes.</hi> The World would be better govern'd, if so many did not prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that they are fit to sustain the cares of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Transgression of the <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>Idolatry:</hi> The <hi>reason</hi> of mens contemning all <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> proceeds from their Idolizing their own <hi>Wit</hi>: They make their own Prudence omnipotent; they suppose themselves <hi>infallible</hi>; they set up their own <hi>Opinions,</hi> and worship them. But this vain <hi>Idolatry</hi> will inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably fall before <hi>Experimental Knowledge</hi>; which as it is an <hi>enemy</hi> to all manner of fals <hi>superstitions,</hi> so especially to that of mens <hi>adoring themselves,</hi> and <hi>their own Fancies.</hi>

               </note>I have now at last brought my Reader, by a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous compass, to the end of our Journey: And here I desire him to look back, and to make a reflection on the matters of which I have treated. In the first part of my Discours I have alleg'd the Causes by which these <hi>Studies</hi> were suppress'd in all former <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>; which have bin Interest of <hi>Sects,</hi> the violence of <hi>Disputations,</hi> the plausible Arts of <hi>Speech,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Controversies,</hi> the <hi>Dogmatical Opinions,</hi> the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi> of the <hi>Vndertakers,</hi> and the want of a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al race of <hi>Experimenters.</hi> In the Second I have shew'd by what steps the <hi>Royal Society</hi> arose, what it has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to attempt, what cours it has taken to make its <hi>Observations</hi> universal and perpetual; what assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance has bin afforded it to that purpose, and about what particulars it has bin conversant. In the Third I have try'd to free it from the false scandals of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and the praejudices of several ways of life, and
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:99266:226"/>
to prove that its effects will more immediatly refer to our own Country.</p>
            <p>My Reader now beholds an Assembly setled of many eminent men of all Qualities: who have ingag'd to bestow their labors, on a design so public, and so free from all suspicion of mean, or private Interest. What foundation they have within themselves, for defraying the expence of their <hi>Trials,</hi> and <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> may be ghess'd by their <hi>Number,</hi> which at this present, amounts very neer to <hi>Two Hundred</hi>; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this following <hi>Catalogue,</hi> which I have rang'd <hi>Alphabetically.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The places of their <hi>Residence</hi> they have appointed to be two: One a <hi>College,</hi> which they design to build in <hi>London,</hi> to serve for their <hi>Meetings,</hi> their <hi>Laborato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> their <hi>Repository,</hi> their <hi>Library,</hi> and the Lodgings for their <hi>Curators</hi>: The other the <hi>College</hi> at <hi>Chelsey,</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> has bestow'd on them; where they have a large Inclosure, to serve for all <hi>Experiments</hi> of <hi>Gardning</hi> and <hi>Agriculture</hi>: and by the neighbourhood of the <hi>River</hi> they have excellent opportunity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all <hi>Trials</hi> that belong to the Water.</p>
            <p>And now as I have spoken of a <hi>Society</hi> that prefers <hi>Works</hi> before <hi>Words,</hi> so it becomes their <hi>History</hi> to endeavor after real <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>effects.</hi> I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude by recommending again this <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking</hi> to the <hi>English Nation</hi>; to the <hi>bravest People,</hi> the most <hi>generous Design</hi>; to the most zealous lovers of <hi>Liberty</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Privileges that our <hi>Kings</hi> Dominions enjoy for this end, appear to be equal'd by no other <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> The men that we have now living to employ, are excellently furnish'd with all manner of abilities: Their Method is already setled, and plac'd out of the reach of calumny or contradiction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:99266:228"/>The work it self indeed is vast, and almost incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible, when it is consider'd in gross: But they have made it feasible and easie, by distributing the burden. They have shew'n to the World this great secret, That <hi>Philosophy</hi> ought not only to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a select company of <hi>refin'd Spirits.</hi> As they desire that its productions should be <hi>vulgar,</hi> so they also declare, that they may be promoted by <hi>vulgar hands.</hi> They exact no extraordinary praeparations of <hi>Learning:</hi> to have sound <hi>Senses</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> is with them a sufficient Qualification. Here is enough bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness for <hi>Minds</hi> of all sizes: And so boundless is the variety of these <hi>Studies,</hi> that here is also enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to recompence the Labors of them all, from the most ordinary capacities, to the highest and most searching <hi>Wits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here first they may take a plain view of all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things, their kinds, their order, their figure, their place, their motion: And even this naked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect cannot but fill their thoughts with much satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, seing it was the first pleasure which the <hi>Scripture</hi> relates <hi>God</hi> himself to have taken at the <hi>Creation</hi>; and that not only once, but at the end of every days work, when he saw all that he had made, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd it to be good. From this they may proceed to survey the difference of their Composition, their Effects, the Instruments of their Beings and Lives, the Subtilty and Structure, the decay and supply of their parts; wherein how large is the space of their delight, seing the very shape of a <hi>Mite</hi> and the sting of a <hi>Bee</hi> appears so prodigious. From hence they may go to apply things together, to make them work one upon another, to imitate their productions, to help their defects, and with the Noblest duty to assist <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
               <pb n="436" facs="tcp:99266:229"/>
our common mother, in her <hi>Operations</hi>: From hence to all the works of mens hands, the divers <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices</hi> of several <hi>Ages,</hi> the various Materials, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of <hi>Trades,</hi> the advancement of <hi>Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi>: In which last alone there is to be found so great content, that many Mighty Princes of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and present Times, amidst the pleasures of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> which are no doubt the highest in the World, have striven to excel in some <hi>Manual Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this spacious field their <hi>Observations</hi> may wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, And in this whatever they shall meet with, they may call their own. Here they will not only injoy the cold contentment of <hi>Learning,</hi> but that which is far greater, of <hi>Discovering.</hi> Many things that have bin hitherto hidden, will arise and expose themselves to their view: Many Methods of advancing what we have already, will come in their way: Nay, even many of the lost <hi>Rarities</hi> of <hi>Antiquity</hi> will be hereby restor'd. Of these a great quantity has bin over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd in the ruines of <hi>Time:</hi> And they will sooner be retreiv'd by our laboring anew, in the material Subjects whence they first arose, than by our plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding everlastingly on the ancient <hi>Writings.</hi> Their <hi>Inventions</hi> may be soonest regain'd the same way by which their <hi>Medals</hi> and <hi>Coins</hi> have bin found; of which the greatest part has bin recover'd, not by those who sought for them on purpose in old rubbish, but by digging up Foundations to rais new Buildings, and by plowing the Ground to sow new Seed.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Work</hi> we propose to be incorag'd, which at once regards the discovering of new <hi>Secrets,</hi> and the purifying and repairing all the profitable things of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> The Supply that is needful to finish it, will neither impoverish Families, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:99266:229"/>
a mighty income. So neer is Mankind to its happiness, that so great an <hi>Attempt</hi> may be plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indow'd by a small part of what is spent on any one single Lust, or extravagant Vanity of the Time. So moderat is the <hi>Society</hi> in their desires of assistance, that as much Charity as is bestow'd in <hi>England</hi> in one year, for the relief of particular Poverty and Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, were enough for ever to sustain a <hi>Design,</hi> which indeavors to give aid against all the infirmities and wants of <hi>human Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If now this <hi>Enterprise</hi> shall chance to fail for want of <hi>Patronage</hi> and <hi>Revenew,</hi> the World will not only be frustrated of their present expectations, but will have just ground to despair of any future <hi>Labors,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the increas of the <hi>Practical Philosophy.</hi> If our <hi>Posterity</hi> shall find, that an <hi>Institution</hi> so vigorously begun, and so strengthen'd by many signal advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, could not support itself: They will have reason in all times to conclude, That the long barreness of <hi>Knowledge</hi> was not caus'd by the corrupt method which was taken, but by the nature of the <hi>Thing</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. This will be the last great indeavor that will be made in this way, if this shall prove ineffectual: and so we shall not only be guilty of our own <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> but of the <hi>Errors</hi> of all those that come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us.</p>
            <p>But if (as I rather believe and praesage) our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> shall lay hold of this opportunity, to deserve the applause of Mankind, the force of this <hi>Example</hi> will be irresistibly praevalent in all <hi>Countries</hi> round about us; the State of <hi>Christendom</hi> will soon obtain a new face; while this <hi>Halcyon Knowledge</hi> is breeding, all <hi>Tempests</hi> will cease: the oppositions and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious wranglings of <hi>Science</hi> falsly so call'd, will soon
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:99266:230"/>
vanish away: the peaceable calmness of mens <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> will have admirable influence on their <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>; the sincerity of their <hi>Vnderstandings</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their <hi>Actions</hi>; their <hi>Opinions</hi> will be less vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and dogmatical, but more certain; they will only be <hi>Gods</hi> one to another, and not <hi>Wolves</hi>; the value of their <hi>Arts</hi> will be esteem'd by the <hi>great things</hi> they perform, and not by those they speak: While the old <hi>Philosophy</hi> could only at the best pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Portion of <hi>Nepthali, to give goodly words,</hi> the New will have the Blessings of <hi>Ioseph</hi> the yonger and the belov'd Son; <hi>It shall be like a fruitful Bough, even a fruitful Bough by a Well, whose Branches run over the wall: It shall have the blessings of Heven above, the blessings of the deep that lies under, the blessings of the breasts and of the womb</hi>: While the Old could only bestow on us some barren Terms and Notions, the New shall impart to us the uses of all the <hi>Creatures,</hi> and shall inrich us with all the Benefits of <hi>Fruitfulness</hi> and <hi>Plenty.</hi>
