            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Cousin Iohn Thomas, ap Rise, ap Morgan, ap
Davis, ap William, as you are my very good
Cousins, as you know very well, by Evan
Davis of Penquelthy, Morgan and Rise of
Llavibither, as also by our Cousin William of
Abereustwith, and David Thomas Her Father
of Wales, and all over Gentlemen.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE Her came to <hi>London,</hi> Her was meet with great many
strange Sights, and Prave things, whereof Her thought to give
some account to Her Friends in the Country, that they might
know more then they do, or more then Her did before Her came
to the Inn of Law, called here an Inn of Court, but when Her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
you, and a many of Her Friends had been in <hi>London,</hi> your
selves. Her forbore for Her thought you were as wise (and knew
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60745:2"/>
much) as Her self, but now just now is come strange things to
light, then ever were Dream'd on, in the darkest Night that ever
was, such Villanous and horrid Treasons, and Rogueryes that was
never hear the like, a company of Ploody Plood-hound Rogues,
had layd PLOTS and Devises, and Contrivances, and Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and Designs, and Twenty more vile wicked Trickes, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
in their Hearts and their Heads, and their mindes, and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Resolutions: To take away the Life of our Gracious
Good King, and his Prave Brother the good Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and
God knows how many more, for no more Reason, that Her can
hear of, then Her have to prake her Head to peices against a Flint-Wall,
or cut her own Throat with a Razor to save her Life from
the Hangman, and this hath made such a Noyse, a Quile, and Clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
here in <hi>London,</hi> that Her am afraid it will Ring in your Eares
there before Her can make an end of Her Letter, and therefore
Her was begin to tell. Her as fast as ever Her can, but by the way
her must know how to Effect these great Villanyes, and Mischeifes,
and they knew and Considered, they could not shoot without a
Gun, therfore they bought and provided Thunderbusses, and other
Busses with strange, and wicked Out-landish and Popish Names,
which they say will speak almost as loud as a Cannon, and Her am
sure Her never Read of any such Names in <hi>Wales,</hi> nor all Cristen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
over, and then to see how God bless our Good King; there
come a man and tell all the PLOTS, and devices and <hi>stratagems</hi>
(that's a hard word) to the King before a knew a word on't, which
made the King, God bless Her, look about Her, and find out the
Traytors, and as soone as a have her, take and lock her up safe
in one good place or other, some in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and some in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi>
and others good strong Chests, and Coffers, which was find
to keep her till her have occasion for her, and then take out 3.
or 4. as her has a mind to make use on her, as for example there
was some needs to use some of them t'other day, and so go pull
out Fower notable Choice peices of that Quoin, but when was
come to be Tryed, was all prove very Rascals, and good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Hangman, and there they prove one to another
Face, that they were all Traytors, every one of them. For there
were some that heard it who had more Law then Her have. And
yet Her have been getting, on't this seven Years, who told Her all
this Roguery, and Villanyes would bring Her to the Gallows,
or to as bad a place, and indeed they told her as true as if they had
been fortune-tellers, or as cunning as the Old Woman of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomoery.</hi>
For after a while, that a dozen of honest men had
Considered of the matter, Her quickly told Her what Her should
trust too, and after that they found it true enough, for upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60745:2"/>
one of the <hi>Frydays</hi> in the very next week following, according
to your Brittish account, three of the worst of them Rode out
of Town into the Country, but before they had gone very far,
most of their Company quitted Her, for the two Chief or
Ring-leaders of that Gang, deliver'd them over to the Hangman
(as Her told Her before) and he us'd them like Doggs; But stay
a little before the Hangman playd his part, they began to prate,
and talke after such a rate, that had Her been there Her would have
taken them to be all Welsh-men, for Her tuake very strangly, and
tell never a word of truth, but onely lyes, and perfect falshood
and storyes, for they said they knew of no PLOT, nor no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies,
or Treasons, and were about to dye wrongfully, and
very Innocent and good Protestant Subjects, but at last was better
bethinke themselves, when they saw awle would not safe her
Lifes, was make a good End of a pad matter, and like true <hi>English-Prittains</hi>
declared the truth of the Story, and acknowledged
themselves to be Wicked Notorious Traytors, but still wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
main good Christians and Protestants, tho Her scarce beleive her
yet her said her Prayers, and fulfilled the <hi>English</hi> provarb confess
and be Hang'd and there was an End of these three. The next
day after, not before, Her was find creat Hurly-Burlys and Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ubs,,
in <hi>Holborne</hi> and <hi>Lincolnes-Inne-Feildes,</hi> which made Her
peep out to see what was the Cases, where was find new matter,
as bigg as the t'other, nay Marry and Pigger too, for the two
Ring-leaders of all such sights, are two such as the King, and
Kingdom will have very good honest men, they call them Sheriffs
of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Middelsex</hi> (that stands for <hi>Middelsex</hi>) these
two (as Her told Her before) brought along with them another
of the what-you-callems, a very creat Her know not what beside
Lord and Traytor, and put him up upon a Stage like a Mounte-Bank,
but was show such Trickes which Her don't lik, nor shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
indure her self to shew, for her came thither with a very faire
Head to her body, but before they had done with her, her was
fain'd to go away without. And now Her will tell Her how it was,
This Lord was found faulty by those Her told Her of before, who
sate there to hear them tell their Tailes, and a dozen more good
Men and True, none of your old Ignorant-musses, of old times
and amongst them, they told him plainly what he must come to,
(as they did the rest) and they told Her truth, for these two
Sheriffs brought Her to the same End they did the other, and Her
did much like them and Dyed as good a Protestant Atheist as
any of them, but before Her Death, Her must do as Her Yoake-fellows
had done, and made a short <hi>Harangue</hi> (another hard
word) if Her take notice, wherein Protestant like Her protested
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60745:3"/>
himself Innocent, and Ignorant of any PLOT or Conspiracy or
any kind of Treason, against the King and Government, and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave
all that did accuse him, or were witness against him, because
they told tales out of Schoole, Contrary to their Oath of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresy
(a pretty Equivocation to say a mans forsworn) and you
would have thought (as a Thousand others have done since) that
this man had dyed a Martyr. But like a Man of a special good
Conscience, for he did conceive (because he had begun with
such horrid lyes) what ever he should say afterward, would not
find beleif with any that should heare him, and therfore he gave
it under his own hand (as some say, but none beleive) in a
Paper which he delivered to the Sheriffs, as his Last Will and
Testament, wherein he bequeathes the Prosecution of the PLOT
to those of the confideracy he hath left behind, but he was Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of every thing but Treason, and Ignorant of any thing but
Contrivances, Designs and Practises and Insurrections to destroy
the King, and subvert the Government, a very small thing not
amounting to a Crime; but onely to <hi>Misprision,</hi> an hard word
of his own but sure he was mistaken in it, for that word did not
signify any thing in this Case without Treason. And since it was
but a mistake, we will e'ne change with his Lordship and so let
it go. Now this being over he said some Prayers too, and so dyed
like a—Jesuited Puritan or a Canting Equivocateing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
of the new Stamp, this is as much as the Post will Carry
for Sixpence; but Her hope Her shall have more worke for Her
shortly; in the same affair, wherefore Her will now take Her leave
and remain.</p>
