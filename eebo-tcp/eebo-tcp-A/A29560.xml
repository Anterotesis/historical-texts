            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY LORDS, YOU have here before you in this Bill of Indempnity the most important Business that perhaps the House of Peers
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47247:3"/>
hath at any time had in deliberation; it is that upon which the Honour or eternal Reproch of the Nation abroad, and its Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse or Confusion at home, seems (next under Gods inscru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table providence) most principally to depend. For on the one side, how abhorr'd a Nation must we needs be to all others, if the Infamy of our Sovereigns Murther should not be throughly washed away by Justice in the bloud of the guilty? And on the other, what happiness or quiet can we hope for at home, nay, what new combustions ought we not to apprehend, if the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal and the Misled (between whom the Eye of the Law can make little distinction) making up so numerous a part of the Nation, their fears, which might urge them to new Crimes, should not be secured by the firmest assurances of Impunity? Punishing and Securing are certainly the two principal ends of this Bill, and wherein as certainly every one of Your Lordships doth concur; but whether the means of attaining those ends have been sufficiently lighted upon by the House of Commons <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n this Bill, That I suppose is the present Question; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> I think my self in duty obliged to expresse unto Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>mission unto Yours.</p>
            <p>As for that part of the Bill which relates to Our Sovereigns <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rther, I find it so short and so much out of the way, of what <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e owe, both to the severity and solemnity of that Revenge, <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>t I cannot but think it in some sort (pardon the expression) <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rophanation of the due Rites of that sacred Expiation, to <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ndle it in the same Bill promiscuously with other more vulgar things.</p>
            <p>My Motion therefore shall be, That there be forthwith a Committee appointed, to consider of all things fit to be done for the washing away of that Stain from the Nation, and from the Age wherein we live; and to draw up an Act purposely and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47247:3"/>
solely for that end. In confidence that this Motion will either be embraced by Your Lordships, or that, if it be opposed, I shall have the liberty to fortifie it by my Reasons, I shall set that business apart, and apply my discourse to what concerns this Bill in all other relations: In which I shall not make nice to tell Your Lordships, that I think it defective in many things reasonable, and redundant in some things unreasonable; and yet, notwithstanding, not onely my humble Motion, but my most earnest pressure, as far as with humility I may, shall be, That We may proceed immediately to the Passing of this Bill, with little or no alteration.</p>
            <p>This, my Lords, may appear a surprising motion from a Person thought to be, as indeed I am, as much inflamed as any man living with Indignation at the detestable proceedings of the late usurped Power, so pernicious to the Publick, and so injurious to my own particular; in whom the motion may seem yet more surprising, when I shall have told You with truth, That I am irreparably ruined in my fortune for my Loyalty, (if this Bill of Indempnity to others for their Disloyalty should passe as it is here offered unto Your Lordships.) But the ground I go upon is, this received Maxime as to all publick Sanctions, <hi>Better a Mischief than an Inconvenience: yea, Better innumerable Mischiefs to particular Persons and Families, than one heavy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to the Publick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lords, I profess unto You I find my self set on fire, when I think that the bloud of so many vertuous and meritorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Peeres and others of all ranks, so cruelly and so impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously shed, should cry so loud for vengeance, and not finde it from Us.</p>
            <p>That many of the wickedest and meanest of the people should remain as it were rewarded for their Treasons, rich and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47247:4"/>
triumphant in the spoiles of the most eminent in Vertue and Loyalty of all the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>What generous Spirit can make reflection on these things, and not find his heart burn into rage within him?</p>
            <p>Here it is, My Lords, that we sufferers have need of all Our Philosophy.</p>
            <p>But when I consider that these are mischiefs only to the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, and that to insist upon a remedy might perhaps expose the publick to an irreparable inconvenience, I thank God I find in an instant all my resentments calmed and Submitted to my primary duty.</p>
            <p>My Lords, We have here in Our view a Kingdom tossed and rowling still with the effects of past Tempests; and though, God be thanked, the storm be miraculously ceased, we can not say that the danger is, untill we get into Still Water: That Still, that Smooth Water is only to be found in the Generalities se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity from their guilty feares, and in the Two Houses Union between themselves, and with their Soveraign.</p>
            <p>Whether the latter may not be endangered if we should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Controversie upon the particulars of this Bill, I leave unto Your Lordships to judge. But certainly as to the former, there can be no hopes of raising Moneys, of disbanding Armies, or of settling that Happiness and Tranquillity which We all sigh for, of being governed under Our Gracious Soveraign by the Ancient and known Lawes of the Land, whilst universal feares shall subsist by the delay in passing this Bill.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I shall summe up unto Your Lordships my whole drift in a few words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47247:4"/>I think that in this Bill there are many things wanting which solid and important reasons would require to be added, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things inserted into it, which Justice to His Majesties inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests and to particular persons would require to be omitted of rectified: But I conceive at the same time that the mischiefs of the delay in passing it do far out-weigh all the advantages of improving it.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I shall conclude my discourse and Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships trouble with the application to this purpose of a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble saying of that Illustrious Minister, the Cardinall <hi>Mazarins,</hi> at a Council in the Wars of <hi>France,</hi> whereunto I had the honour to be called. It was, That in the great affaires of the World He had not known any thing do more hurt then these two words, <hi>Faisons Mieux,</hi> let us do better. For, said he, whilst good Wits endeavour by debates to bring good Counsels to a greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, they do for the most part lose the opportunity of time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things rightly, which in great actions is of far more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance then the preference according to refined reason betwixt Good and Better.</p>
            <p>Upon this ground my conclusion is, that, that part which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Kings death being put in the way proposed, we should proceed to the speedy passing of this Bill without losing any time in emendations; but if we be destined to so fatall a losse by rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into particulars, I shall in that case desire leave to offer unto Your Lordships therein my reflections also.</p>
