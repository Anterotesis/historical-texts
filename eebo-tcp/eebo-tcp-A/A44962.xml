         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY Lord, and you his Brethren, and the reſt of the
Common-Council of the City of <hi>London;</hi> it hath
pleaſed the Parliament to Order this meeting by
you, to give you notice of the Proceedings now
on foot in this Nation: And whereas in your Petition, and
Declaration to the Parliament; you have ſet forth your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to them, and your Willingneſs to joyn with them
in the Affairs of the Nation: And you were pleaſed to put
them in mind of ſeveral Particulars, worthy of their Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
in which, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd in many others, the Parliament have
made a good progreſs, though they found a great alteration
in the ſtate of Affairs, ſince the time they were, (as you
mention in your Petition;) and the truth is, with Violence
Interrupted; for when they met again, they found a great
alteration, by a vaſt expence of treaſure, a great decay, and
loſs of Trade, and Wars begun with Forrain Nations, and
chiefly to ſupport the intereſt of a ſingle Perſon: Yet however
the Parliament were willing to look forward for the carrying
on of Affairs in theſe Nations, and put all in Oblivion that
was paſt in the late ſeveral changes of Government, a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d now
deſired to ſettle a Common-wealth, and thereupon paſt an
Act of Indempnity; but they were informed at their firſt
meeting and coming together, of a deſign of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:99813:3"/>
and his Agents, to deſtroy this Nation of their Freedome,
and ſettlement of this Common-wealth; this was carried
on during the laſt Convention, and was managed by ſome
Members of that Convention, which hath appeared Acters
in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore it hath taken a great part of their time to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their wicked practices: At that time there was <hi>Maſſey</hi> and
divers others, as parties imployed to carry on that Deſign; and
here in <hi>London,</hi> they had their Councels, and ſecret meetings
to carry on that buſineſs, In it was alſo Mr. <hi>John Mordant,</hi>
who made a narrow eſcape for his Life, at his Tryal before
the High Court of Juſtice, yet is faln again into this Deſign,
that is ſo laboured, and endevoured to be carried on; for it
appears manifeſt, that Mr. <hi>Mordant</hi> is gone over as their
Agent here, to <hi>Charles Stuart;</hi> and hath received direction, and
was ſupplied with monies, for the carrying on of this deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
buſineſs now on foot in <hi>England:</hi> There are many others,
as Mr. <hi>Newport,</hi> lately taken priſoner in <hi>Shrewsbery</hi> there was
alſo Letters intercepted, directed to the Lady <hi>Howard,</hi> and
another to the Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> and divers others, amongſt
which, were ſome from <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> as hath appeared by
the Examination and Confeſſion of ſeveral perſons now taken
priſoners: ſo that this Deſign is evidently made forth, that
they endevour to ſet up <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> to reign in Tyranny
amongſt us, and to deſtroy this State and Common-wealth;
for there hath been ſeveral Meetings and Randezvouz appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by them in ſeveral places of this Nation; but by the care
and diligence of the Parliament, and Council of State, with
the help of their forces at home and abroad, meeting with
them in divers places, they have diſappointed them, and taken
divers priſoners, being fruſtrated in theſe parts, there hath
another party appeared in a Body in an open Hoſtile manner
in <hi>Cheſhire, Lancaſhire,</hi> and thoſe parts, (as I preſume you
have all heard,) there are with them, (and joyned in this
Deſign,) divers eminent Commanders and Officers, as <hi>Randal
Egerton,</hi> and <hi>Robert Werden,</hi> and others that were in the late
Kings Army, and with them there hath joyned Sir <hi>George
Booth,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> and are all in actual Arms,
having taken <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and <hi>Carrick Caſtle,</hi> and have proclaimed
<hi>Charles Stuart</hi> to be King in <hi>Warrington,</hi> and thoſe parts; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99813:4"/>
what their Deſign is, is evident by their actions; this is their
buſineſs and their Deſign, to ruin and imbroil this Common-wealth
in blood; but the Parliament having pleaſed by
their Authority, and their Council, have taken care, that a
conſiderable Force hath been ſent forth under the conduct of
the Lord <hi>Lambert,</hi> and they are far on their march to thoſe
parts to ſuppreſs <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hoſe Rebels, yet thoſe in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> have been
working to ſee what may be done in procuring Aſſiſtance in
this City of <hi>London</hi> for their help in carrying on this deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Deſign; it appears fully by many examinations taken by
the Council, and as it appears by ſome taken by your
Lordſhip, and ſome of you worthy Gentlemen; ſo that you
ſee their Deſign is to make a diſturbance in this famous City,
that your Houſes and your Goods may be brought into the
hands of the Spoilers; There Deſign was to have fired the
City in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ivers parts of it, and to plunder the City, and to
bring an utter Deſtruction upon this famous City; which I
doubt not, but the Lord will preſerve, and have a care of:
And therefore we hope that you will all have a great care in
this buſineſs, and be very careful to joyn with thoſe that have
the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ommon-wealth; therefore it
muſt be your endevours herein, that ſo you may be Examples
to others. The Parliament therefore finding this City thus
deeply concerned in the Affairs of this Common-wealth, have
thought good, things might be im<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ed to you the Lord
Maior, and Aldermen, and the reſt, the Common-Council
of your City, by reaſon there are ſuch deſigens among you,
that it is plain and evident, by ſome parties ingaged among
you in this Deſign; therefore it is your duty, and we doubt
not of your care, but that you will joyn in this buſineſs,
though there are divers of your Apprentiſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s gone forth to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
thoſe perſons, that intend ruine upon this City. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
you that are Commiſſioners of the <hi>Militia</hi> of this City,
you have taken a great deal for care for the forming of a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi>
for your own preſervation, you have raiſed ſome Horſe
and ſome Foot; The Parliament hope you will go on, for
your own ſakes, for your own protection, as well as the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99813:4"/>
Publick. It is the duty of the Parliament to take care of
all their Forces, in a ſpecial and peculiar manner, for the
preſervation of this City, and of your Safeties, and of the
ſafety of your Wives and Children, And therefore they
thought good to let you know the ſtate of things and deſigns
abroad; They have teſtified their intention of advancing of
the Trade of this Nation, and their putting an end to all their
Troubles; It is their Duty, It is their Truſt, but you cannot
but be ſenſible of their Interruption. Gentlemen, we are
all envolved in one and the ſame cauſe, it is a Righteous cauſe,
a Juſt cauſe, it is a ſettlement of peace, a ſetling of you and
your poſterity, that you may not be under the Yoak of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany,
and made Vaſſal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, but that you may be a free people,
and your Freedome advanced, your Peace preſerved, and your
Rights and Liberties continued; ſo that if we be united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the cauſe it ſelf, we ſhall not need to fear the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
it ſelf, but hope, that that God that hath appeared hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
will ſtill appear for us, in a cauſe ſo juſt, and which we ought
to maintain: And therefore Gentlemen, being the minor of
the Parliament, they have been pleaſed to paſs a Proclamation,
which I ſhall read to you.</p>
            <p>WHereas the old and Implacable Enemy
having for ſome time before the reſtoring of
this Parliament, formed a Deſign for the bringing
in of <hi>Charls Stewart,</hi> to the Deſtruction of all the
faithful and conſtant Aſſerrors of the Parliaments
moſt Iuſt and Righteous cauſe, and had brought it
to ſuch ripeneſſe, that (by the Confeſsion of divers
Engaged) the day was prefixed, the firſt of this
inſtant <hi>Auguſt</hi> for their Riſing in Arms; but
through the good Providence of the Lord, were ſo
timely diſcovered, that their Deſign was in a great
meaſure diſappointed. Nevertheleſs it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the only wiſe God, to ſuffer the ſaid Deſign ſo
far to break forth, that <hi>Randolph Egerton</hi> a Major
General, and <hi>Robert Werden</hi> a Colonel, with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99813:5"/>
divers others, Officers and Commanders in the
War under the late King, together with Sir <hi>Tho.
Middleton,</hi> Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> and other Apoſtates,
in proſecution of the ſame Deſign, have proclaimed
<hi>Charls Stewart</hi> to be King, Levied Actual War,
and poſſeſt themſelves of <hi>Cheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament doth therefore Declare and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the ſaid <hi>Randolph Egerton, Robert Werden,</hi>
Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> and
their Adherents in this War, to be Rebels and
Traytors.</p>
            <p>And becauſe it is not probable that the ſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhould, upon what ſpecions pretences ſoever,
undertake ſo wicked a Deſign without expecting
Aſſiſtance from others, The Parliament, to the end
that no more of the people of this Common-wealth
be ſeduced into any Compliance with them, do alſo
Declare, That whoſoever ſhall from henceforth any
ways Aſſiſt, Abet or Conceal the carrying on of
their ſaid Deſign, be Deemed and adjudged Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
and Traytors, and ſhall be proceeded againſt
accordingly.</p>
            <p>This Proclamation the Parliament having paſt, thought it
ſeaſonable to communicate to you: Thus briefly you have heard
