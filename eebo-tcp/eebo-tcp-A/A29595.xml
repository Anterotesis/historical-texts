         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Engliſh were? the Hollanders told
them they were Chriſtians: Thereby
they did not only render the Engliſh
odious, but the very name of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
abominable to the Natives. But
when they came to underſtand the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and behaviour of the Engliſh to
them, they had a very great love for
them, and did much Honour the King
of <hi>England:</hi> the Orankies being often

            <p>

and defaming the Grandeur and Power
of the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> But when the
Natives found by experience how the
King of <hi>England,</hi> and his Subjects were
abus'd, they did ever after perfectly hate
the name of a Hollander.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1614. The Hollanders planted
themſelves in a Province or Port of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi>
having purchas'd the Charts and
Maps of <hi>Hudſon,</hi> and all his right which
he had acquir'd by that Voyage, and
call'd it by the name of <hi>Nieu-Nederlandt.</hi>
But being queſtion'd by Sir <hi>Tho. Argal,</hi>
then Governour of <hi>Virginia</hi> for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47911:5"/>
of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> were told, that
they muſt quit the poſſeſſion of that
place, or elſe pay Tribute to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty;
for that <hi>Hudſon</hi> was an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and licenſed to diſcover thoſe Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
parts by the King of <hi>England,</hi> and
could not alienate or diſmember it from
the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Complaint
hereof being made to the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
it was declar'd by them in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llck
Inſtrument, that they were no ways
concern'd in the Action; but 'twas a
private undertaking of the Weſt-Indian
Company of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> And though
the Hollanders did ſeem willing to be
gone; yet taking advantage of the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
which not long after happened in
<hi>England,</hi> they have not only kept poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
thereof, and built a Fortreſs, and
call'd it by the name of <hi>Orang-Fort,</hi> which
was Garriſon'd, and planted with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
but fell in with the Natives, and
furniſhed them with Arms, and taught
them how to uſe their Weapons,<note place="margin">The Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Natives in the <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> in the uſe of arms.</note> with

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47911:6"/>
and wicked act, not only tending to the
damage and diſcouragement of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Adventurers, but even unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation
of all Chriſtians out of all thoſe
Countries. But the beſt is, they were
the firſt which ſmarted by it. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
thus arm'd and train'd, fell foul
upon them, deſtroy'd their houſes, and
forc'd them to betake themſelves to their
Ports and Faſtneſſes. But upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
expreſſed their kindneſs and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ormus,</hi> an Iſland in the entrance of
the Perſian Gulf, in the poſſeſſion of
the Portuguez, <hi>Anno</hi> 1506. was made
the Staple of their Trade for the Indian
Merchandizes, and ſo inrich'd the ſame,
that the Revenues of the Kings there,
though Tributaries and Vaſſals to the
Portugals, amounted unto 140000
Shirifes yearly. In this flouriſhing eſtate
it ſtood, till the Year 1622. when <hi>Abas</hi>
the Sultan of <hi>Perſia</hi> having received ſome
affronts at the hands of the Portuguez,
and being deſirous to remove the Trade
of <hi>Ormus</hi> to ſome part of his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47911:6"/>
gave order to <hi>Emangoti Chares</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Shiras,</hi> to lay Siege unto it
with his Army. But ſeeing no hopes of
maſtering it by his Land Forces only,
furniſhed himſelf with Ships and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of ſome Engliſh Merchants, and
by the aſſiſtance of the Engliſh preſently
ſubdu'd it. The City was utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
the Cannons removed to <hi>Lar,</hi>
the wealth thereof to his own Treaſury
of <hi>Shiras,</hi> the materials of the houſes to
<hi>Gunbroon,</hi> about nine miles from <hi>Ormus,</hi>
then a poor village; but ſince the fall of
<hi>Ormus,</hi> a rich and populous place, and of
vaſt Trade. For this Service, ſo much
honour was given to the Engliſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that he gave
to the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
of all Strangers which ſhould
traffick thither; and by his Agent which
reſideth at <hi>Gunbroon,</hi> ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
The Hollanders who have a vaſt
trade thither, they being ſtrangers, and
not trading to the Gulf, till ſome time
after, for ſeveral years paid their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms;
but ſince the Troubles in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

Strangers pay to the Engliſh reſident
there) which may be reaſonably eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
at 20000<hi>l. per annum:</hi> and have
been detained by them, from the King
of <hi>Great Britain</hi> about 30 years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1671. when the King of <hi>Great
Britain</hi> at his own charges (for a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Traffick and Commerce, not only
for his own Subjects, but for thoſe of
other Kings and Princes in Europe)
made a War againſt the Pyrates of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi>
and by his Naval Forces were
much diſabled, and brought to a Treaty.
The Hollanders writ to their good
Friends of <hi>Argiers,</hi> that they ſhould
conclude no Peace with <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers writ to the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of <hi>Argiers</hi> not to make Peace with <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> for
they wanted Proviſion, and could not
continue long at Sea.</p>

The Reputation of a Prince

Reputation are the ſame in judgment of

a King, its an affront to a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for in the Honour of the King, is
wound up the ſafety and reputation of
the people: and not only his own
Subjects, but all Kings and Princes are
obliged to vindicate his Majeſties Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Its not enough for a Prince to be
great among his own Subjects, but he
muſt carry a <hi>Grandezza</hi> amongſt Kings:
there's his Glory; which by the art and

They have diſturbed the Factories of his

with much zeal againſt the Portuguez in

which they uſe to aſſert their

Sword and Cannon. I do aſſure you
they are ſmart Arguments. But we may
ſee, that the unwarrantableneſs of an

            <p>And thoſe men which ſhould

            <p>Now they begin to be look'd upon as
