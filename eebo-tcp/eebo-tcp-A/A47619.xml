            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SECOND CONSIDERATIONS
Concerning the Regulation of the High Court of
CHANCERY.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing, during the sitting of the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
assured of a strong endeavour to have
the late Ordinance of his Highness and his
Councel for Regulation and Limitation of
the Chancery repealed, or with silence to
fall to the ground, to the great prejudice of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
I took the boldness (though against my judgment, as
to publication of any of mine own observations or concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
to cause a small Pamphlet to be imprinted to give notice
to the Commonwealth of the prejudice it was like to suffer
by the repeal or expiration of that Ordinance, with desire that
all good People of this Common-wealth would address
themselves to the late Parliament to take the Ordinance and
Regulation of the Chancery into consideration, and before
the ending thereof, to take some course for the Regulation
of that Court; That Matters there might not return to
the former Incertainties, Delayes, Absurdities and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences;
which was aimed at by those persons (who ought out
of Conscience and Duty to the Common-wealth to have
been more just and kind thereto) that nevertheless have
occasioned that evil and mischief since befallen the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
by obtaining an Act for the Ordinance to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
no longer then until the ending of the late Parliament.</p>
            <p>But that mischief that I then foresaw, being by the sudden
dissolution of the late Parliament happened, I have now again
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65747:3"/>
ventured to revive my former Observations, professing that
as in all my actions hitherto I have had no unjust aimes or
ends to the disadvantage or detriment of any; so my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
at this present is onely for the honour of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and his Council, and the good and welfare of the
Common wealth, which all consciencious men in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ought to promote.</p>
            <p>I have very many years been a Suitor and a sufferer in that
Court, and thereby some experience is beaten into me; that
I am able to observe a great deal of difference between the
chargeableness, tediousness and other inconveniences for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
there, and the great benefit and ease the People have
enjoyed by the Ordinance: and if in relation to it I say <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
est esse hic;</hi> I am confident I shall have the concurrent
desires and suffrage of every judicious honest person in the
whole Nation.</p>
            <p>For indeed, amongst the many things that Time and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
had made the object of Reformation in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nothing had more need of a Regulation and Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then the High Court of Chancery; which was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and especially of later times, so chargeable to Suitors in
the prosecution and defence of their Causes; And so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and uncertain in the practise thereof, That instead of a
Sanctuary to the Oppressed, it was become a most intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
burthen to the Nation; And (notwithstanding all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to the long Parliament) so continued, until the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
which began in the year 1653. (which was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of persons, though perhaps not very learned States-men,
yet doubtless men of very good and honest intention, and
very sensible of the Burthen of the Nation, by whom it
was Voted to be taken away:) But that Parliament dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it pleased his Highness to continue that Court, it being
indeed of very excellent use for the Nation, and without
which it cannot subsist as the Common Law now stands;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65747:3"/>
And both it and the Common Law being challenged by
the People as their indubitate Birth-right.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding his Highness was pleased to appoint
divers of the long Robe to consider of a way for the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and Reformation of that Court: But they, (for what
reason I know not) did not effect that good work, so much
longed for, and needed by the People of this Land.</p>
            <p>Whereupon his Highness by advice of his most H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Council (notwithstanding the other great and important
business for the Government and Safety of the Nation laid
on them) did make an Ordinance for the Regulation and
Limitation of that Court, a better, or more accurate and
excellent this Land and Nation never saw, which after
much strugling, almost a year after the making thereof, was
put in execution; Whereat (as no good man could take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
so) none but those concerned in point of a Corrupt
interest, could, or did speak against: And it may be well
observed, that since the same was put in execution, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
have been heard against it from the People, for whose
good and ease chiefly the same was made.</p>
            <p>Yet nevertheless since the beginning of the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
some unnecessary, burthensome Officers, which either
had part of their former unconscionable gain taken from
them, or else their Office set aside as unnecessary, have
been indefatigable in their endeavours, to get that most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Ordinance expelled.</p>
            <p>And a Committee of Parliament being appointed for the
view of the Ordinance made by his Highness in the interval
of Parliaments, that Ordinance was most especially struck at,
through the clamours of those late unnecessary Officers of
that Court, who aimed not at the good of their Countrey,
but their own unconscionable gain.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless it pleased the Parliament to refer the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to another Committee to amend that Regulation, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65747:4"/>
by the Ordinance (if they saw cause) and to send for
Parties, Papers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Committee accordingly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Attorneys by command, and the late Six Clerks at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
them; where the Counsel for the Six Clerks was
heard in a most tedious and impertinent discourse: And
the Attorneyes receiving then a command from that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
to prepare their reasons in writing; And to set
forth wherein the Ordinance was good or bad for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and a very short time given them to that purpose, they
(as I have heard) accordingly prepared their Reasons, and
attended to have presented them to the Committee.</p>
            <p>But the Committee not afterwards meeting, the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
Reasons could not be presented to them; and the
Ordinance being since by Act of Parliament onely
to continue during the sitting of the Parliament; The
Parliament being dissolved, the late Six Clerks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Right or Authority have re-assumed the places by
them formerly held, though the Office of a Six Clerk is
utterly abolished by the Ordinance of Regulation, and the
Act of Parliament for confirmation thereof, although indeed
the Ordinance be unhappily expired through the art and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
of those whom the Common-wealth hath no reason
to thank for their pains.</p>
            <p>And those unnecessary Officers do again contrary to the
Order of the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners
of the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> made after two solemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
by learned Counsel on both sides, exact the unconscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
exorbitant Fees by them formerly taken, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to introduce the former corrupt and dilatory way of
practice and proceedings in that Court, to the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>It therefore concerneth all honest-minded People of this
Nation, That they make their Humble addresses to his
Highness and his most Honourable Councel; That they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65747:4"/>
take the Ordinance into consideration; And that what shall
appear to be good therein may be confirmed; And what
shall be found therein to be short for the intended welfare
of the Nation, may be supplied; And what appeareth to
them to be any way discommodious to the People (if any
such thing there be) may be amended; that so, so good a
Constitution may not fall to the ground unregarded, which
hath with so much deliberation and resolution, been appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the good and ease of the people.</p>
            <p>And to the end the people may be the better informed of
the advantage they have, and shall receive by that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
It were to be wished that those Reasons that the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torneys
or Clerks of the Chancery had provided to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the Committee of Parliament, were made publick:
But as there is just cause to fear that in them the Arrow was
not drawn to the head (in their composing, there being a
great opposition, as I have been informed, even amongst
themselves) So without doubt they are now suppressed
through the influence and awe the before-mentioned unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Officers have over the abject and private spirits of
the present Attorneys.</p>
            <p>The Ordinance in the first place provides a convenient
number of Attorneys, who are to solicite and manage the
Clients cause for 3 <hi>s—4 d.</hi> a Term, which Fee was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
received by the Six Clerks, for doing nothing at all for
the benefit of the Client, who was forced either to imploy a
Solicitor to manage his business, to his great loss, or else to
manage it himself: whereby his cause oftentimes miscarried
through (either his own or his Solicitors) ignorance.</p>
            <p>For the other matters formerly done by the Six Clerks,
it is by the Ordinance provided to be done by three Chief
Clerks, who have Fees amounting to 500 l. a year apiece,
which is a competent allowance for their labour, they being
to file the Pleadings and Records, to have an inspection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65747:5"/>
the Attorneys, to make Certificates of matters referred
to them by the Court, touching the Regularity of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to set down Causes for hearing, and Tax-costs; all
which was better done by them, than ever it was done by
the Six Clerks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saving that the chief Clerks, who were three
of the late Six Clerks, did not in some things pursue the
Ordinance according to their duty.</p>
            <p>Now this and the abatement of Fees, are the things that
were struck at by the late Six Clerks, and other useless Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
whose pretence is, That their places, and the Old
Fees are their Free-hold, and therefore ought not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from them; That they purchased their places, and that
they are of great Antiquity.</p>
            <p>As to their Freehold, I wonder whose Freehold their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
had been, if the Little Parliament had passed an Act for
taking away the Court, as the former Parliament did for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away the Star-Chamber, and High-Commission Court;
and this Parliament the Court of Wards: in which divers
as useful Officers as they, without reparation lost their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as much their Free-hold as the Six Clerks, and also
purchased at as dear rates. But the Six Clerks may see
their own unjust practice justly retaliated on them, that used
at their pleasures, without cause, to turn out the Clerks
bred up there into the wide world, to sterve, if they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else to live upon.</p>
            <p>Besides, they cannot chuse but know there is a Law still in
force against buying of Offices; which Law (if they bought
their places) they have transgressed, and thereby <hi>ipso facto</hi>
forfeited them: but they may please to remember that
those places were conferred on Four of the Six by the late
long Parliament for a temporary supply in regard of their
alledged losses, the same being sequestrated or taken away
for delinquency from the former Six Clerks, two whereof
are still alive, and have more reason to complain then those
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65747:5"/>
who by the profits of the places, and the labours of other
men have not onely been repaid what ever they lost, but
have exceedingly enriched themselves.</p>
            <p>And for their Antiquity, it is very apparent that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Clerks or Attorneys of that Court was in old times
uncertain, sometimes more, sometimes less, as the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Court required: for in <hi>Edward</hi> the First<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s time
they were Six; afterwards they were reduced to Three:
and in <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's time they were increased to Six
again, in which number they found the means to continue;
and at first did the business of the Court and Client, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiated
as Registers and Examiners, and sometimes made
Motions in Court; but for above an hundred years past have
ceased to act as Attorneys, and onely acted as Prothonotaries
in other Courts, being an oppression both to the People and
over their Clerks, who have ever since performed the Office
of Attorneys, and done the business of the Court, and Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
who retained, imployed, and trusted them, and not the
Six Clerks. And the business of the Court being now so
much increased that Six Clerks cannot possibly do it, it is
hoped that is no more injustice to increase the number of
Attorneys now, than it was in times past. And certainly
the Office of an Attorney being not executable by a Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Six Clerks can no more claim to be Attorneys,
than the Prothonotaries of other Courts.</p>
            <p>And I hope the Six Clerks will be so ingenuous as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that besides the impossibility for them to sollicite the
Clients Causes, not one or all of them togethe are able to
do any thing belonging to an Attorney or Clerk to do,
<hi>viz.</hi> To draw all special Writs, Commissions, Decrees,
Dismissions, and to make and write all other Writs, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Records. This being true, why should they be paid for
what they neither do, or know how to do; or monopolize
the place of an Attorney which they cannot execute?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65747:6"/>
Thus I hope it is apparent their removal is no injustice,
and that the increase of the number of Attorneys is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to the Common-wealth; and there is no doubt but if
the Ordinance, as to the Officers, Clerks, and Attorneys of
the Court, were put more strictly and duly in execution, it
would be of admirable benefit to all Suitors, and those
that are sued in that Court; for the tediousness of Suits is by
the Ordinance very well provided against, as also divers
Writs, as <hi>Subpoena's</hi> to make a better answer, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn,
are taken away; as likewise whereas before, when
Witnesses were examined in Court, or by Commission <hi>ex
parte</hi> it was ordinarily two or three Termes before publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could passe, now it is provided in the Ordinance to pass
in a Week. Not to speak of the Plaintiffs giving security,
because I think little use was made of it, and it was a great
trouble and charge to the Party: But yet there is an Act
of Parliament for it in <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixths time, and so it was
but an old Law newly revived, and that and the filing of
Bills before the awarding of the <hi>Subpoena's</hi> according to the
Prayer of the Bill, was a means to hinder men from bringing
frivolous and vexatious suits; a thing too often practised in
that Court.</p>
            <p>And the taking of Answers in the Country by Masters
extraordinary is of great use to the People, the same being
formerly done by a Commission wherein the Tenor of the
Bill was included, for which the Client paid Six-pence a
sheet, though the same were of no use at all, there being a
Copy of the Bill taken, by which the Defendants answer
was alwayes drawn, before the Commission was opened:
but if the Commission were amended, and the Clause of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the Tenor of the Bill, omitted, I believe it would
be a greater ease to the People, who were often enforced to
travel many miles to a Master extraordinary, to swear to
their answers; &amp; would also save some charges and expences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65747:6"/>
Likewise the making of all Writs open cannot but be
a great satisfaction to the People, they being thereby ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to see whether the Writ have any mistake in it or not,
whereas while they were close, the Client was often put to a
deal of fruitless charge, especially in the Commissions, to
examine Witnesses, as I my self have found by experience;
and likewise it is left by the Ordinance at the Clients liberty
to execute a Commission in any place, which without doubt
is, and may be of good consequence for the amicable ending
of suits, especially if the Commissioners be men of judgment
and integrity.</p>
            <p>And there are some abuses which may be committed in
the Examiners Office, which is impossible to be discovered
when it is done: for a man may be examined in his own
cause, and may procure his own witnesses to be cross exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
on the other side, and so prevent any exceptions to their
persons or testimony, of both which there hath been of late
complaints; which enormity is impossible to be committed at
the execution of Commissions.</p>
            <p>Also the frequent renewing of Commissions, tending
onely to delay, is well provided against by the Ordinance,
and the Defendants having a Duplicate, is of advantage to
him, especially in cases where his witness are ancient and
sickly.</p>
            <p>Likewise the granting of Injunctions meerly upon the
course of the Court, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the Defendants taking a
Commission to answer sitting in contempt, or making an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
answer, was heretofore a great grievance to the
Nation, but very well provided against by the Ordinance,
to be granted onely upon sound and satisfactory grounds.</p>
            <p>And also whereas heretofore a Defendant could hardly
put in any answer but the Plaintiff would put in exceptions
so it, which were referred to a Master, who usually favoured
the Plaintiff, and so the Client was put to a double charge;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65747:7"/>
Now by the Ordinance it is provided that only the Master of
the Rolls shall hear them: and the most honourable and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Gentleman the present Master of the Rolls hath so
impartially heard those matters, that it is believed the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in of frivolous exceptions have little encouragement
thereto for the future, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is also a great ease to the People.</p>
            <p>Likewise the making of Orders upon whispering Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is provided against, and Orders to be made onely upon
Motion in Court; and therein also the Right Honorable the
Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal are much to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
for their Order of Notice upon Motions.</p>
            <p>And the Provisions in the Ordinance concerning Mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
are very just and impartial, and the Mortgager hath
thereby a convenient time for redemption of his Land, and
the other a sure way for recovery of his just debt, which
formerly he received by minute parcels, whereas his Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
money was lent in grosse, and the Mortgager often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to an accompt after twenty years possession, to his
great and intolerable damage.</p>
            <p>Also the provision for References to be determined by
three of the Six Masters of the Chancery in Ordinary toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is most excellent: the benefit to the people by it is
very apparent, and I my self cannot but recompt it as bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
in my particular Cases, with gratitude for the justice
by them done. And I shall not much insist on this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
because the grievances formerly were crying, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
known and felt, and the parties that did the wrong are
deceased, and therefore I wish their doings may be buried
with them; and I have so much Charity as to hope they
did according to their judgments: and it shall be my prayer
that the Ordinance may be punctually observed, and
neither Masters nor their Register, for any respects
whatsoever, recede from their directions in and by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65747:7"/>
and then it must be a new generation that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
against them (I have good reason to hope this will not)
if they have done, and shall persevere to do according to the
Ordinance.</p>
            <p>It is also provided by the Ordinance, that the Registers
places shall not be executed by Deputies, which I hope no
man will speak against; for what reason is there that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
person should have a tribute out of the labour of men
who spend a great part of their age in attaining to ability in
their Profession, and then take a great deal of pains to do
the Clients business? Why should the poor Client pay Fees
to another by whom he receives no benefit? and the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
yielded to the Labourer there, by the unnecessary ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
Officer, so mean, that if the Client had not yielded a
supply, there was not a sufficient recompence for the care
and labour taken by those that were Deputies formerly, but
now stand on their own leggs: And sure I am that if the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
as concerning the Registers be duly and conscionably
observed, none will find fault but those persons, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
art or conscience would thrust themselves into places
they are not able to execute.</p>
            <p>The Ordinance also provides well that the chief Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
do examine all the Witnesses themselves, and not by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties,
and if they are not able so to do, either through
their own incapacity, or the multiplicity of business, if the
present Examiners be removed, or others of ability and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
be added to them, I hope it will not be a grievance
worthy of any complaint.</p>
            <p>The great cry against the Ordinance under colour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the cashiered Officers have thrust in this head of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine
complaints, is, that the Court must not relieve against
new Bonds, and that Legacies shall be sued for at Law: I
conceive that at the making of the Ordinance a provision
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65747:8"/>
was intended in those cases for a relief to be had at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law.
But if upon second thoughts the Chancery
shall be thought the fittest Court to give relief therein, I
wish the Suitors speec'y and just relief there.</p>
            <p>Likewise the Fees are lessened to half what they were
before, or less, which I hope will be confessed to be an ease
to the people.</p>
            <p>And I much wonder that the Six Clerks and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Court should presume to claim a Free-hold in the
old unconscionable Fees, for they took them formerly but
by prescription, which is by the Ordinance and Act for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of it, not onely interrupted, but a new establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made, and since that Law is now expired, there is no
absolute power in any to demand any Fees; but those who
do the Clients business, may properly demand satisfaction
for their labour as much as they shall honestly deserve, to be
allowed by the Lords Commissioners for the Great Seal, who
are the sole Judges of the Court; &amp; the useless Officers who
do nothing for the Client have no right to any thing at all.</p>
            <p>I shall not grudge at the Fees given to Counsel, and onely
pray that those Gentlemen may have pity and compassion
on the poor Suitors to the Court, and that they press not an
evil cause too far.</p>
            <p>I could have wished that some abler Pen might have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the usefulness of this Ordinance to the People, being my
self, I confess, insufficient to do it: But by this imperfect
Discovery, the perfection of that excellent Constitution
may in part appear. And the drift of this endeavour being
for the information of the People, and for their good and
advantage, I hope the imperfections thereof will be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and that the adversaries of the Peoples welfare will
not prevail against this Ordinance, which was by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Magistrate of this Common-wealth, and his Councel,
with so great wisdom and exactness provided for their good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:65747:8"/>
And if I am censured for that herein I do seem to adhere
unto the right and interest of the Attorneys, I shall give this
reason, that I am sensible of the care and pains by them ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the business wherewith they are intrusted, and in my
judgment the Labourer is worthy of his wages: and as at
first what was given was but for the satisfaction of the party
that did the business; so I think still, he that doth my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
ought to have what in conscience he merits for it, and
not that the Six Clerks, who never in the least assist me in
managing my cause, should have the greatest part of the
Fees I pay.</p>
            <p>But I shall leave the Attorneys to assert their own interest,
who being sworn into a Calling and Imployment, I conceive
cannot be legally devested thereof during their lives, unless
they demean themselves amiss, which I hope they will be
careful to prevent.</p>
            <p>And I much desire a strict Government in that Court, and
a Super-intendency over the Attorneys; for surely although
the Six Clerks practice was heretofore so, and will be so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
(if they are admitted into their former places) yet the
Attorneys ought not to do as they list. And it being the
office of the Master of the Rolls to be Super-Intendent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Clerks of the Court, he having now many other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
if he appoint one chief Clerk, or Secondary, to do those
things appointed by the Ordinance to be done by the three
chief Clerks, I think it just that such Super-Intendent Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
have a recompence suitable to the honour of the place
he is employed in: But as to have many Governours is no
blessing to a Common-wealth, so I think one experienced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-seeing
Clerk will suffice to do what is appointed by the
Ordinance to be done by the chief Clerks, and a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
will onely breed confusion, and be an unnecessary bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and charge upon the Suitors.</p>
