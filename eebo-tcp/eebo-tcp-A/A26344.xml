            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is good sometimes to hunt the Wolfe, though it is better to fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sheep. They speake of a drowning man, <hi>Etiam ad Novaculam,</hi> that he will rather take hold of a knife, then of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

Man being cast out of Paradise, and that Paradise guarded with a sword in the hand of a Cherub, durst not attempt a re-entry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was guilty. But Commonwealths that have lost any part of their Territories, or just Priviledges, by forraign invasion, and hostile vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,

may justly venture upon the sword, and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope for a recovery, because they are innocent; <hi>&amp; hanc picem amolire gladio. Irene</hi> signifies <hi>Peace;</hi> Yet the Turke could sacrifice his beuteous <hi>Irene</hi> to the God of Warr. If Warr in it self were utterly unlawfull, God would never have accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Title, <hi>The Lord of hostes.</hi> Yet in this stile he takes such delight, that he is oftner called <hi>the God of hoasts</hi> in the former Testament, then by any other Title. In those two prophesies of <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> it is given him no lesse then an hundred and thirty times.</p>
            <p>All creatures are mustered, and trained, put into garison, or brought forth into the field by his command. Which way can we look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his Armies? If upward into heaven, there is a band of Souldiers; <hi>even a</hi>

               <hi>multitude of the heavenly host praising God.</hi> If to the lower hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, there are a band of Souldiers: it <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 2. 1.</note> was <hi>universa militia coeli,</hi> to which those Idolaters burnt incense. On the earth, not only men are martialled to his service; so <hi>Israel</hi> was called <hi>the host of the living God:</hi> but even the brute Creatures are ranged in arrayes. So God did levy a band of flyes against the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; and a band of frogs that marched into their bedchambers. He <note n="c" place="margin">Pro. 30. 37.</note> hath troops of <hi>locusts,</hi> and armies of <hi>caterpillers.</hi> Not only the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots and horsemen of heaven, to defend his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, but even the basest, the most indocible, and despicable creatures, wherewith to confound his enemies. If <hi>Goliah</hi> stalke forth to defile the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62298:4"/>
God of <hi>Israel,</hi> he shall be confuted with a pebble. If <hi>Herod</hi> swells up to a God, God will set his vermine upon him, and all the Kings guard cannot save him from them. You have heard of r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s that could not be beaten off, till they had destroyed that covetous Prelate, and of a flie that killed Pope <hi>Adrian.</hi> God hath more ways to punish, then hee hath creatures.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Lord God of hostes</hi> is not properly a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Creation, but of providence. All crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have their existence from God, as their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: and so have they also their order from him, as their Governour. It referrs not so much to their being, as to their martialling; not to their naturall, but militant estate: Nor only as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do they owe him for their making, but as they are souldiers, for their managing. Their order is Warlike, and they serve under the colours of the Almighty. So that here, God would be respected, not as a Creator; but as a Generall. His anger therefore seems so much the more fearfull, as it is presented to us under so great a Title; <hi>The Lord God of hostes is angry.</hi> They talke of <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> that hee could daunt his enemies, with the very look of his countenance: oh then what terrour dwells in the countenance of an offended God? The reprobates shall call to the rocks to hide them <note n="d" place="margin">Rev. 6. 16.</note> 
               <hi>from the wrath of the Lamb:</hi> If <hi>Ira Agni,</hi> the wrath of the <hi>Lamb</hi> doth so affright them, how terrible is <hi>Ira Leonis,</hi> the wrath of the Lyon? It may justly trouble us all to hear, that <hi>the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62298:5"/>
Lord God of hostes is angry:</hi> in the sense wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Prophet breaks forth here into this expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; <hi>O Lord God of hostes, how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have these five propositions, or inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies naturally arising out of the text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God may bee <hi>angry;</hi> for that is manifestly implyed in the Text; He is <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That his <hi>anger</hi> may last a great while: <hi>O Lord, how long wilt thou be angry?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That his anger may extend to the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>how long wilt thou be angry with the people,</hi> all the people</p>
            <p n="4">4. That his anger may fall upon his owne people, even his peculiar and chosen flock; <hi>How long wilt thou be angry with thy people?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That his anger may dwel upon them in their devotions, and not be removed by their very prayers. <hi>How long wilt thou be angry with the people that prayeth?</hi> Yea, <hi>against their prayer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now God is never angry without a cause: he is no froward God, of no techy and pettish nature: a cause there must be, or he would neverbe angry. There can be no cause but sin; we never read that God was angry for any thing else. Some he hath corrected without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto sin, as he did <hi>Job:</hi> but he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver angry with any man, but for the sin of that man. It is the sin of the people that hath thus grieved God, and it is the anger of God that hath
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62298:5"/>
thus grieved the people. Sin must be supposed to run along with his anger throughout the text, as the eclyptick line does thorow the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it were not for sin, God would not be <hi>angry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If it were not for the continuance of sin, he would not be so <hi>long angry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If it were not for the universality of sinne, he would not be <hi>angry with the whole people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. If it were not for the unnaturall ingratitude of sinne, he would not be <hi>angry with his own people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If it were not for the base hypocrisie of sin, he would not be <hi>angry with his people that prayeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus then the argument lies fair and plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is sin that makes <hi>God angry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 It is the continuance of sin that makes him <hi>long angry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 It is the generalty of sin that makes him <hi>angry with the whole people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It is the unthankfulness of sin, or the sin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse, that makes him <hi>angry with his owne people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Lastly, it is the hypocrisie of sin, or the sin of hypocrisie, that makes him so <hi>long angry with his people that prayeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. We provoke him by our rebellions, and he is angry.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62298:6"/>
2. We continue our provocations against him, and he is <hi>long angry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Wee provoke him universally, and so he is <hi>angry</hi> with us all; not with some offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders here and there, but <hi>with the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We provoke him by our un kindnesse; for whom he hath done so much good, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom hee hath heaped so many blessings; and so hee is <hi>angry with his own people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Lastly, we provoke him by our dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; approaching to him with our lips, and keeping back our hearts: we pray un to him, and yet live against him: we call upon his Name, and rebell against his will: and so he is angry, and <hi>long</hi> angry, and long angry <hi>with the whole</hi> people, and long angry <hi>with his own people,</hi> and long angry with his people <hi>that prayeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. God may be <hi>angry,</hi> and sin is the cause of his anger; thats the first Proposition. Man may be angry without sin, not without perturbation: God is angry without either preturbation or sin. His anger is in his nature, not by anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popathie, but properly; being his corrective Justice, or vindicative Justice. <hi>Iratus videtur, quia tunquam iratus operatur.</hi> Our anger is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent passion: His a most clear, free, and just operation. By this affection in our selves, wee may guesse at the perfection that is in God. The dissolute securitans think that God doth but smile at the absurdities of men; that <hi>ludit in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manis:</hi> that their drunkennesse and adulteries ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62298:6"/>
make him merry then <hi>angry.</hi> Like some carnall father, that laughs at the ridiculous beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of his children <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

But the continuance of an affliction sends us to God, and calls upon us to ask for a reckoning.

               <hi>ceased.</hi> One contrary is ever cured by another: take away the cause, and the effect will cease. Prayer is very powerfull, but doing of Justice more availeable. The whole Congregation were at their prayers, and those prayers were steeped in tears; yet still the plague raged, and Gods anger continued. But when <hi>Phinehas</hi> had run those two adulterers through with his Javelin, in the <note place="margin">Nam. 25. 8.</note> act of their sin; the plague was stayed. So bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a thing is it for any nation, that Justice is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially executed.</p>
            <p>Thus the universality of sin calls for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of repentance, or else it will provoke Gods anger to strike us with universall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If the <hi>whole people</hi> be guilty, the <hi>whole people</hi> must fall to deprecation. Such was the Nivites repentance, <hi>every man turning from</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jon. 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>his evill ways.</hi> We have sinned, even the whole
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62298:13"/>
nation: and as if we had not sins enough of our own, we borrow of our neighbours. What nation under heaven do we trade withall, from whom the sinnes of that Nation are not brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And those are merchandizes that might be well spared. Are we all in the transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and do we lay the burden of repentance upon some few? If we expostulate with God, <hi>Lord hath one man sinned, and wilt thou be wrath with the whole Congregation?</hi> May he not more <note place="margin">Num. 16. 22.</note> justly expostulate with us; Hath the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation sinned, and is it enough for one man to repent? Is the whole garment fowle, and must only the skirts be washed? Is the whole building ruinous, and do we think it a sufficient reparation to patch up one corner of it? No, the plaister of our repentance must be fully as large as the orifice of our wickednesse; or we cannot be healed. But stil God wil be angry with us, yea though we were his <hi>own people:</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="4">4. God may <hi>be angry with his own people;</hi> which is the fourth proposition. <note n="a" place="margin">Psa. 89. 33</note> 
               <hi>I will visit their sins with a rod, and their iniquity with scourges; but my mercy I will not utterly take from them.</hi> Though he do not take his mercy from them, yet he may be angry with them. He is our father, and never did Father in sweeter terms entertaine the dearest trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of his blood, then God doth us, when he vouchsafes to call us <hi>His people:</hi> yet did you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see a father angry with his child? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is great difference between that wrath of God which is toward his <hi>own people,</hi> and that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62298:13"/>
which <note n="b" place="margin">Col. 3. 6.</note> 
               <hi>comes upon the children of disobedience.</hi> They differ three ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In respect of continuance: his anger upon reprobates is eternall; not extinguished with their bloods, but pursuing them from earth to hell. To <hi>his people</hi> it is but temporary, it lasts but a moment: <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 30. 5.</note> 
               <hi>weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Psal: 103. 9.</note> 
               <hi>He will not alwayes chide, nor will he keep his anger for ever.</hi> When he was very angry with his Idolatrous Israel, <note n="e" place="margin">Exo. 32. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Moses</hi> does but put him in mind that <hi>they were his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and he was pacified. <note n="f" place="margin">Isa. 54. 8.</note> 
               <hi>For a moment in a little wrath, he hides his face from us.</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Mic. 7. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Rejoyce not against me, O mine enemy; for though I fall, I shall rise again.</hi> But for the wicked, <note n="h" place="margin">John 3. 36.</note> 
               <hi>his wrath abideth on them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In respect of the measure: It is milder to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his <hi>own people,</hi> then to others. For the unrighteous, he proportions his Judgements, not to their strengths, but to their deserts: For <hi>his own people,</hi> he proportions his corrections, not to their deserts, but to their strengths. For the former, he minds not what they can beare by their powers, but what they have deserved by their sinnes. For the other, he considers not what their sinnes deserve, but what their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits can sustaine. His most bitter wrath to <hi>his own people,</hi> is always sweetned with his mercy. <note n="i" place="margin">Pia 99. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.</hi> He brings a scourge in one hand, and a pardon in the other: and while he draws blood of the flesh, he forgives the soul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In regard of the end. <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 9. 22.</note> The wicked are <hi>the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62298:14"/>
vessels of wrath:</hi> and as their sin makes them fit for Gods anger, so his anger makes them <hi>sit for destruction.</hi> But for his <hi>own people;</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 32</note> 
               <hi>They are chastened of the Lord, that they might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world.</hi> Whether he inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them punishments for sinne, or suffer them to fall into sin for punishments, yet <hi>all shall work to their good.</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 12. 11.</note> his corrections are but medicines, <hi>bringing forth the quiet fruit of righteousnesse.</hi> He lets them fall into some hainous crime, but it is to waken their repentance. Small spots upon a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are not minded; we seldome are so curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to wash out them. But when a great spot comes, a fowle staine, we then scower and elense it, to get out that; and so wee get out all the little spots too. Sinnes of a lesser size never trouble us; we mind not the washing out of them with our sorrowfull tears: But when a great sin comes, and disquiets the conscience, then repentance, that old landresse is called for: and in that lardar we wash out both the great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and all the rest. So God suffers us to fall into some grosse and grievous sinne, as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffers his little child to burne his finger in the flame, that his whole body may not fall into the fire.</p>
            <p>All these differences are exprest by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Isaiah.</hi> 1. Forthe time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Isa. 28. 24</note> 
               <hi>Doth the plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man plough all the day to sow?</hi> God doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ploughing all day long furrows upon our backs, but when he hath broken up the fallow grounds of our hearts, he thensowes in the seed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62298:14"/>
of his comforts. 2. For the measure; <note n="r" place="margin">Isa. 27 7.</note> Hath he plagued Israel, as he hath plagued the enemies of Israel? He sinites his Israel in the <hi>branches,</hi> and in the bunches; cuts down some of her superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous boughes, and plucks off clusters of her rotten grapes: But the wicked he smites at the very root. 3. For the end; <note n="s" place="margin">Isa. 27. 9.</note> The fornace of his wrath shall but purge away our drosse, and make us pure metall, fit for the stampe of his owne I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this, God hath been grievously angry with <hi>his own people:</hi> Yea, their sins an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger him most of all; because together with wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse, there is unkindnesse. As dearly as he loves them, their sinnes may provoke him. Our interest in God is so far from excusing our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, that it aggravates them. Of all others, the transgression of his <hi>own people</hi> shall not passe unpunished. The nearer we are to him, the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer do our offences touch him; as a man more takes to heart a discourtesie done by a friend, then a great injury by a stranger. Pagans may blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, and bezzle, and defile the marriage-bed, and yet God let them alone: but he will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure these sinnes in <hi>his own people.</hi> The more hee loves us, the greater should our love be to him: now love and unkindnesse cannot stand together. If we revolt from our Maker, as <hi>Absolom</hi> thought <hi>Hushai</hi> had renounced <hi>David,</hi> may he not justly expostulate with us, <hi>Is this thy Kindnesse to thy friend?</hi> there is no such irksome disobedience, as where God looks for service. <note n="t" place="margin">John 1. 11.</note> 
               <hi>He came unto
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62298:15"/>
his own, and his own received him not:</hi> O, that could not chuse but trouble him. As <hi>Demades</hi> said to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and at a time when he well deserved it; <hi>Cùm fortuna tibi Agamemnonis personam imposuerit, nonne pudet te Thirsitem agere?</hi> When fortune hath made thee an <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> art thou not ashamed to play <hi>Thirsites?</hi> When God hath honoured us for <hi>his own people,</hi> with the noble name of Christians is it not a shame for us to play the Pagans? <hi rend="sup">u</hi> 
               <hi>Happy are the people that be in such a case, yea blessed are the people that have the Lord for their God.</hi> Yet that people may so farre an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger him, that he will take away not onely their temporall, but even their spirituall happinesse. Those seven Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> were Gods <hi>owne people:</hi> yet the Gospel was not fastned to their territories; as the old Romans pinnioned their goddesse <hi>Victoria,</hi> or their apish posterity doe the Catholick faith, to their own infallible Chaire. But as they had a time to breathe, so a time to expire: and so hath my fourth proposition. There is but one gradation more.</p>
            <p n="5">5. God may be angry with <hi>his people that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> Wherein we have two main observations. First, The wonder, that God will be angry at <hi>our prayers.</hi> Secondly, the answer, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves the wonder; shewing why our very <hi>prayers</hi> may anger him. Either of these is back'd with three circumstances. 1. For the wonder, that <hi>God is angry with his people that prayeth.</hi>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:62298:15"/>
1. All the other conclusions are easily granted: God may be <hi>angry,</hi> and angry very long, and angry with <hi>the whole people,</hi> and angry with <hi>his own people;</hi> all this because of their sins: But that he should be angry at <hi>their prayers,</hi> this is the wonder. He hath commanded us to <hi>pray,</hi> and will he be offended with us for doing his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? <hi>Angry against our prayer!</hi> He hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us <hi>Prayer,</hi> as the only means to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage his anger: and yet is hee angry at our <hi>Prayer?</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Psa. 106. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Phinehas prayed, and his anger was pacified:</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Num. 16. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Aaron prayed,</hi> and the plague ceased: and will he now be angry with <hi>the people that prayeth?</hi> He is a God that heareth prayer: <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 65. 2.</note> 
               <hi>O thou that hearest prayer, to thee shall all all flesh come:</hi> and does he now reject <hi>prayer?</hi> He hath so stiled his own house; <hi>Oratorium, the house of prayer:</hi> and to them that pray unto him in his house, he hath promised peace; <note n="d" place="margin">Hag. 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>In this house will I give peace, saith the Lord of hostes.</hi> Peace and wrath are contraries: how should <hi>prayer</hi> procure peace, when God is angry at <hi>prayer? Prayer</hi> is so noble, that under it is comprehended the whole worship of God: <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 10. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Whosoever calleth on the name of the Lord, shall be saved:</hi> and yet wil God be angry at the prayer of his people? It is a great honour that God will vouchsafe to speake unto man: but a far greater honour, that man is allowed to speak unto God: the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels stand in admiration of it: and yet what comfort is there in that, when God is angry <hi>at the prayer of his people?</hi> What blessing is there,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62298:16"/>
which our <hi>prayers</hi> cannot infeoffe us in? Wee send up <hi>Prayer</hi> to God with the same confidence, that <hi>Adoniah</hi> sent <hi>Bathsheba</hi> to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">1 Kin. 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>the King will deny thee nothing:</hi> and will God bee angry <hi>at prayer?</hi> It is the onely means we have to pacifie him, <hi>Prayer:</hi> and shall our <hi>Prayer</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger him? Alas, what hope is left us, when God is angry at <hi>Prayer?</hi> This hath often turned away his wrath, and does it now incense his wrath? If we should not <hi>pray,</hi> he would then be angry: and when we do <hi>pray,</hi> is he angry too? What, neither way pleased? What is the reason why there is so much empty cask in Gods cellar, but for want of <hi>prayer?</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Jam. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Ye have not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ye ask not:</hi> and shall not <hi>prayer</hi> obtain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? <note n="h" place="margin">Josh. 7. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Oh Lord, what shall I say</hi> (it was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of <hi>Joshua) when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies?</hi> So, what shal we say, what shall we do, when God turneth back our <hi>prayers?</hi> Why is it called <hi>the throne of Grace,</hi> before which wee present our <hi>prayers;</hi> if that throne send forth nothing but beams of wrath? We look for grace, and a favourable audience of our petitions; but alas, what shall become of us, when God is angry at our very <hi>prayers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. How wonderfull is the power of <hi>prayer?</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Exo. 32. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Let me alone,</hi> saith God to <hi>Moses:</hi> who would look for such a word from God to man, as <hi>let me alone?</hi> As yet <hi>Moses</hi> had said nothing: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he opens his mouth, God prevents his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, as foreseeing the holy violence of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62298:16"/>
               <hi>prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moses</hi> stood trembling before the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of his Maker, as fearing his dire revenge: and, yet that Maker doth (after a sort) sollicite <hi>Moses</hi> for leave to revenge; <hi>let me alone.</hi> As it was afterwards said of Christ, concerning some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that <hi>he could do no miracles there, because of their unbelief:</hi> So one would think, that God could do no Judgements here, because of <hi>Moses</hi> his faith. <hi>Let me alone;</hi> why, what can resist God? Yes, <hi>Prayer</hi> can resist him.

What is there that God can do, which <hi>Prayer</hi> cannot do? O mighty, I had almost said, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty <hi>Prayer!</hi> What a hand is that which can hold omnipotence?

               <hi>Thou hast covered thy selfe with a thick cloud, that our prayer should not passe thorow.</hi> This is a wofull condition of our souls, when the Lord is angry at our <hi>prayers:</hi> when he will not hear them, not answer them, it is a cause of sadnesse in us; but much more, when he is angry with them. <note n="s" place="margin">Eze. 8. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore will I deale in fury: though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.</hi> This is fury indeed: Before, the ancients of Israel had said, <hi>The Lord se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us not, he hath forsaken the earth:</hi> There they deny God eyes, and here he denyes them ears. A burning wrath; as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall hath it; <hi>How long wilt thou smoak against the prayer of thy people?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And of <hi>thy people:</hi> this encreaseth the wonder. For God to stopp his ears against the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62298:17"/>
prayers of the Heathen, to reject the petitions of Idolaters, to despise a devotion done before painted blocks and Images, is no marvel. For they dishonour him in their <hi>prayers;</hi> and God will be angry with any thing that eclipseth his glory. But he does not use to slight those that serve him, and continue in his holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. It is strange that hee should bee angry at the <hi>prayer of his own people:</hi> Angry with them whom hee hath chosen; angry with them long, and angry with them at their very <hi>prayers.</hi> This must bee some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary wrath: and so you have all the circumstances that may advance the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Now for the Answer that takes off this admiration; and satisfies us with some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, why God may bee angry <hi>with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that prayeth.</hi> God is never angry at his people without a cause: and it must be a great cause that makes him angry with them in their devotions: whereof wee have three considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There may be infirmities enough in our very <hi>Prayers,</hi> to make them unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As if they bee, 1. <hi>Exanimes,</hi> without life and soul: when the heart knowes not what the tongue utters. 2. Or <hi>Perfunctorie;</hi> for God will none of those prayers, that <hi>come out of fained lips.</hi> 3. Or <hi>Tentativae;</hi> for they that will <hi>petere tentando,</hi> tempt God in prayer, shall go without. 4. Or <hi>fluctuantes,</hi> of a wild and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62298:18"/>
wandring discourse, ranging up and down; which the Apostle calls, <hi>beating the aire:</hi> as huntsmen beat the bushes, or <hi>Saul</hi> sought his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers asses. Such <hi>prayers</hi> will not stumble upon the Kingdome of Heaven. 5. Or if they bee <hi>Praeproperae,</hi> run over in hast: as some use to choppe up their prayers, and thinke long till they have done. But they that <hi>pray</hi> in such hast, shall bee heard at leisure. 6. Or <hi>sine fiducia:</hi> the faithlesse man had as good hold his peace, as pray. Hee may babble, but <hi>prayes</hi> not: hee prayes infectually, and receives not. He may lift up his hands, but hee does not lift up his heart. Onely <hi>the prayer of the righteous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth,</hi> and onely the beleever is righteous. But the formall devotion of a faithlesse man, is not worth that crust of bread which hee askes. 7. Or <hi>sine humilitate:</hi> so the Pharisees prayer was not properly <hi>Supplicatio,</hi> but <hi>superlatio.</hi> A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous <hi>Prayer</hi> profanes the Name of God, in stead of Adoring it. All, or any of these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects may marre the successe of our <hi>Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But such is the mercy of our God, that he will winke at many infirmities in our devotions: and does not reject the <hi>Prayer</hi> of an honest heart, because of some weaknesse in the petitioner. It must bee a greater cause then all this, that makes God angry <hi>at our prayers.</hi> In generall, it is sinne. <note n="t" place="margin">Joh. 9. 31.</note> 
               <hi>We know that God heareth not sinners: but if a man doth his will, him he heareth.</hi>

up the passage of our <hi>prayers.</hi> It is not the vast distance between Heaven and earth, not the thick clouds, not the threefold regions, nor the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Orbes, nor the firmament of starrs, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our sinnes, that hinder the ascent of our prayers. <hi>When you make many prayers, I will not hear you;</hi> Why? <note n="a" place="margin">Isa. 5. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Because your hands are full of blood.</hi> God will none of those petitions, that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to him with bloody hands. Our <hi>prayers</hi> are our bills of exchange; and they are allowed in Heaven, when they come from pious and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearts: But if wee bee broken in our religion, and bankrouts of grace, God will protest our bills, hee will not bee wonne with our <hi>prayers.</hi> Thus sinn is the generall cause.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In particular, it is the hypocrisie of sinne, or the sinne of hypocrisie, that makes God so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with our <hi>prayers.</hi> When wee honour him with the prostration of our bodies, and sollicite him with the petitions of our lips, and yet stil dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him in our sinfull lives, is not this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie? When we speak before him in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as suppliants, and sinne against him abroad like rebells, is not this hypocrisie? Like the outlaw, that sues to the King for a pardon, and yet resolves to live in rebellion. We will not part with our beloved sinnes, and yet begge the removall of Judgements; will not this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation make God angry with our very <hi>prayers?</hi> If wee shall, <hi>Judas-</hi>like, kisse his Throne with the Devotion of our lipps, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62298:19"/>
his Honour with the wicked works of our hands, should he not be angry at our prayers? Wee make as if we did lift up our hands unto him, but indeed we stretch out our hands against him: if this be <hi>prayer,</hi> it is such a one as deserves an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Fear can make the Divell himselfe fall to his prayers; <note n="b" place="margin">Lu. 8. 28.</note> 
               <hi>I beseech thee, torment mee not.</hi> Another request he made, which Christ granted; but it was in wrath, not in favour. The pride of our hearts, the covetousnesse of our hands, the blasphemy of our mouthes, the uncleannesse of our lusts, the wickednesse of our lives; these make God angry with our <hi>prayers.</hi> If wee could bee throughly angry at our sinnes, God would cease to be angry at our prayers. But so long as wee run on in those sinful courses upon earth, let us look for no favourable audience from heaven. Doe good, and continue it: then <hi>pray</hi> for good, and have it. It hath been said, <hi>loquere ut te videam,</hi> speak that I may see thee: so saith God to man; <hi>Operare ut te audiam,</hi> worke that I may heare thee. If we dishonour Gods Name by our oaths and blasphemies, and upon every triviall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion tosse it in our profane mouthes; in vaine we <hi>pray, Sanctificetur Nomen tuum, Hallowed be thy Name.</hi> If we heare the Gospel preached, and receive no instruction by it, nor give any regard or obedience to it; in vaine wee <hi>pray, Adveniat regnum tuum, thy Kingdome come.</hi> If the current of our affections and actions runs crosse to the will of God; in vain we <hi>pray, Fiat voluntas tua, Thy will be done.</hi> If we extort the bread of the poor
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62298:19"/>
out of their hands, or seek to live by violence or oppression; in vain we <hi>pray, Panem nostrum da no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis quotidianum, Give us this day our daily bread:</hi> For this is to attempt to have it whether God will or no: he does not give it, but we snatch it. Whiles we are indulgent to our darling sinnes, and will not part with the deare delight of our bloods, in vain we <hi>pray, Dimitte nobis debita nostra, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our trespasses.</hi> Whiles we seek to revenge our wrongs upon others, and bear malice in our hears; our <hi>Sicut nos dimittimus, As wee forgive them that trespasse against us,</hi> doth but begge for vengeance upon our own heads. All the while that we listen to the suggestions of Satan, and like the allurements of the world, and awaken our owne lusts to tempt our selves; it is but a mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>pray, In tentationem ne nos inducas, lead us not into temptation.</hi> While we seek that which is evill, and study that which is evill, and runne with greedinesse into evill; in vaine we pray, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a nos à malo, Deliver us from evill.</hi> We do but flatter God, and complement with him, when we conclude with <hi>Tuum est regnam, potentia, &amp; gloria; Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory;</hi> for it is our own glory we seeks after, not his. All this cannot keep him from being angry with our <hi>prayers.</hi> So long as his people rebelleth, he <hi>wil be angry with his people that prayeth.</hi> For some Use.</p>
            <p>If God be angry with them that <hi>pray,</hi> what will he be with them that do not pray? With them that break his laws, and never cry him mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,

            <p>If God be sometimes angry at our <hi>prayers,</hi> how will he brooke our curses? If he beat back our petitions, how will he take vengeance on our blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies? <hi>Out of the same mouth proceedeth bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>

Think this, ye that (if it were possible) would swear God out of his Throne, and the Judge of all the world out of his Tribunall: your very <hi>prayers are abominable:</hi> your blasphemous breaths have put a stink into all your sacrifices. That tongue is fit for nothing but flames, which so flameth with oaths and execrations. Your <hi>prayers</hi> cannot be heard, by reason of your sins: but your blasphemies shall be heard and plagued, notwithstanding your <hi>prayers.</hi> If the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument gives a harsh sound, there is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in stead of inusick: a jarring organ grates the eares, rather then delights them. Our sinues have put all our Instruments out of

            </p>
            <p>There is no way to take off his anger, but by turning from our wickednesse. If we break off our sinnes, <hi>he will leave a blessing behind</hi>

               <hi>him, even a meat-offering, and a drink-offering to the Lord:</hi> he will both give, and take our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Let us do thus, and <hi>prove him, whether</hi>

Prayer</hi> is <hi>vox fidei,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> Baptist was <hi>vox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti:</hi> if we mourne, and do not pray, our faith hath lost her voice: and prayer without faith, is <hi>John</hi> without Christ, a <hi>voice</hi> without a <hi>word.</hi> Faith is the soul, and repentance is the life of Prayer; and a prayer without them, hath neither life nor soul. If we beleeve not, <hi>we are yet in our sinnes:</hi> if we repent not, our sinnes are yet in us: and so long as this state continueth, no wonder <hi>if God be angry with his People that prayeth.</hi> But <hi>first will I wash mine hands in innocency, and</hi>

Then the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers

Then Saint <hi>John</hi> sees twelve gates in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, all open, and all day open, to entertain such suitors.</p>
            <p>This is our refuge, and that a sure one. Although the Enemy begirts a City with never so straight a siege, and stop up all the passages; yet he cannot block up the passage to Heaven: So long as that is open, and God in league with us, there may bee reliefe and succour had from thence by <hi>prayer.</hi> Faith is a better engineer then was <hi>Dadalus;</hi> and yet he could make a shift to frame wings; with which hee made an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape over those high walls, wherein he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned. <hi>Restat iter coelo, tentabimus ire.</hi> Let <hi>Pharaoh</hi> bee behind, the red sea before, the high rocks and mountaines on every side; yet <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> can find a way for all that. When there is no other way to escape danger, a Christian can go by heaven, and avoid all by <hi>prayer.</hi> As it is the heaviest malediction, <hi>Let his prayer be turned into sin:</hi> so it is a happy blessing, when our sinne <note place="margin">Psal. 109. 7.</note> is turned into <hi>prayer;</hi> when sinne is so done away, that <hi>prayer</hi> may take place.

The Saints that have overcome the hill, be singing above: we that are climbing up, must be groaning all the way. The Anthems in-the up per Quire, the Church Triumphant, are all Hymns of joy: the militant part must bee content with sad tunes in this valley of tears. Not that the blessednesse of Immortality is no more perfect, but that it needs a foil of perplexity to set it off. Not that the joy of heaven is no more sweet, but that it needs the sowreness of the world to give it a tast. Not that the peace and plenty of Canaan, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the wants and molestations of this wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to commend it. But so it pleaseth the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty King, who of his own free grace doth give the preferment, to interpose the conditions: that the sorrow and ingloriousnesse of this world, should be the throughfare to the glories and joyes of his Kingdome.

They that do not finde some joy in their sorrows, some comfort in their dejections, in this world, are in a fearfull danger of missing both in the next. But as it is said in case of bodily sicknesse; If the patient and the disease joyne, then in vaine is the Physician: if the disease and the Physician con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire, then wo be to the patient: but if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and the Physician accord, then vanisheth the disease. So we may observe in spirituall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers: if the soul and sorrow desperately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, then the Spirit departs, the Physician is grieved: if God and sorrow joyne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in anger, in anguish; the former justly, the other sharply, then wo to the soul, for that cannot be comforted: but if the soul by faith, and God by grace, unite themselves, then away flies sorrow, for that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. Here <hi>Davids</hi> soul joynes it self with the spirit of consolation; and sorrow loseth the day, the end is comfort. <hi>In the multitude of my thoughts within mee, thy comforts delight my soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a twofold Army, one marching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another: <hi>Seditio,</hi> and <hi>Sedatio:</hi> an insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and a debellation; a tumult, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing of it: a band of thoughts assaulting, and an Host of <hi>comforts</hi> repelling, resisting, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting. There is a <hi>multitude</hi> of those thoughts, and no lesse is the number of these comforts. Those troublous thoughts have got into the citadel of the heart, <hi>Apud me, within me:</hi> and these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solatory forces have entred as farr, even into the soul; <hi>They delight my soul.</hi> Those thoughts
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62298:24"/>
fight under the colours of flesh and blood, but these comforts under the Banner of God; They are <hi>My</hi> thoughts, but <hi>Thy</hi> comforts: the cogitations of man, the consolations of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Look upon the adversary power; <hi>In the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of my thoughts within me.</hi> 1. O that they were some externall grievances, a forraign warr, no domestick, intestine, civill broiles; not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent <hi>thoughts.</hi> 2. Or if they be thoughts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, heart-breaking cogitations; yet that there were but some few of them, that they might be sooner suppressed; not so numerous, not a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thoughts. 3. Or if they must bee thoughts, and a multitude; yet that they had chosen some other place to rise in, not my Heart, the Fort, or Court, or Bedchamber of my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that they had not presumed unto so bold approaches, as to mutine <hi>Apud me, within my heart,</hi> nearer and closer to mee then mine owne bowels. But now, to bee <hi>Thoughts,</hi> of so tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous a nature: <hi>Multitudes,</hi> of so mighty a number: <hi>Within me,</hi> of so fearfull a danger; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vent, composition, or quiet; here is a ful anxiety.</p>
            <p n="2">2. View the defensive forces; and in the midst of this conspiracy make room for preservation; <hi>Thy comforts delight my soul.</hi> 1. They are <hi>comforts:</hi> against litigions and unquiet thoughts, a work of peace; <hi>Comforts.</hi> 2. They are not scant &amp; niggardly; but against amultitude of thoughts, many <hi>Comforts;</hi> and every one able to quell a whole rout of distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. 3. They are <hi>thy</hi> comforts; not proceeding

men or Angels, but immediately from the Spirit of consolation: against <hi>My</hi> sorrows, <hi>Thy</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. 4.

there is tranquility: in the number of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many comforts, there is sufficiency: in the owner of them, being <hi>Thy</hi> comforts, there is omnipotency: in the effect of them, <hi>delighting the soul,</hi> there is security. There is no fear in them, for they come for peace; they are <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</hi> There is no weaknesse in them, for they come in troopes, they are many comforts.

The stomack by the vertue it receiveth, is made able to digest: the liver, to concoct the nutriment into blood: the spleen like a spunge, by sucking up the melancholy spirits, to purge the vital parts. So the soul breeds all these creatures, gives life to all these <hi>thoughts;</hi> yet according to their severall acts and offices, they have several names. If they be sensitive, we call them passions: if sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall, lusts: if fantasticall, Imaginations: if reasonable, arguments: if reflective, consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: as they are evill, the suggestions of Satan: as good, the motions of the holy Ghost. As the world produceth vipers, and serpents, and venemous creatures, wormes and caterpillars, that would devour their parent: so the soul breeds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious and mutinous <hi>thoughts,</hi> that are like an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in her bowels; and whiles they maintain civil broiles and factions, one against another, she feels the smart of all.</p>

Some <hi>thoughts</hi> be the darts of Satan; and these <hi>Non nocent, sinon placent:</hi> we cannot keep theeves from looking in at our widowes, we need not give them entertainment with open doors.

Other <hi>thoughts</hi> are the motions of Gods spirit; and these must not only be guests, but familiar friends: salutation is not here enough, but glad entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, welcome, and indulgence. Let no man like himself the better for some good <hi>thoughts:</hi> the praise and benefit of these motions is not in the receit, but in the retention. Easie occasions will fright away good <hi>thoughts</hi> from a carnall heart: like children, which if a bird do but flie in their way, cast their eye from their book. But <hi>Davids thoughts</hi> here were anxious, commotive thoughts; otherwise they stood not in such need of comforts. It is likely that they were either <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moris,</hi> fearfull thoughts; or <hi>Doloris,</hi> sorrowfull thoughts: Thoughts of fear for what might bee, or thoughts of sorrow for what already was.</p>
            <p>The <hi>thoughts</hi> of fear are troublesome enough
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62298:27"/>
as the ill affections of the spleen do mingle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with every infirmity of the body: no lesse doth fear infinuate it self into every passion of the mind. <hi>David</hi> might find this complication in his thoughts: I will please <hi>Saul</hi> with my harpe: but then fear replies, he will strike me through with his Javelin. He will give me his own daughter in marriage: but fear says again, How if this prove a fatall dowry, if this match be my snare! I will refuge my self with <hi>Achish</hi> at <hi>Gath:</hi> yet what trust is there in Infidels? I will lie hidden in <hi>Keilah,</hi> or <hi>Hachilah;</hi> but fear suggests, How if the <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites</hi> discover me? What shall I do? whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall I go? where shall I rest? These were thoughts that stood in great need of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>The <hi>thoughts</hi> of sorrow are yet more distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; and such were this royall Prophets: as our vulgar reads; <hi>In the multitude of the sorrowes that I had in my heart.</hi> What was the cause of those griefs: <hi>The slipping of his foot,</hi> his errors, his deviations, his sinnes. Other sorrowes may disquiet the soul: none but these have the promise to be comforted. As in martyrdome, it is not the sword or torture; not what we suffer, but why, that makes us martyrs. So in our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, it is not how deep they penetrate, or how sharply they cruciate, but wherefore, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves their goodnesse. If our sins be the <hi>why</hi> of our sorrowes, we are blessed. <hi>Blessed are they that</hi> thus <hi>mourne, for they shall be comforted.</hi> Vaine <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 4.</note> are the sighes and groanes that proceed onely

from the thought of worldly losses. A medicine that cureth the eyes, we say, was made for the eyes, and for nothing else. We lose our wealth, and sorrow for it; will sorrow recover it?<note place="margin">Chrys.</note> wee are despised or abused, and grieve for it I: will grief right us? We bury our friends, and mourn for them; will mourning restore them to us? we are crossed by our unruly children, and weep for it: will weeping rectifie them? We are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in our bodies with paines and sickness, and are sorry for it: will sorrow heal us, nay wil it not rather hurt us? All our thoughts, and cares, and griefes, and tears can do us no good, no relief in these calamities: sorrow was not made for these things. But we sin, and offend the Lord; and we are sorrowfull for it; here is the disease for which sorrow is the proper remedy: penitent sorrow shall take away sin. <hi>Quamvis peccavit David, quod silent reges: tamen poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam egit,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. The number of them is a <hi>multitude:</hi> wee may say of sorrows, as it is said of shrewd turnes; they seldome come single.

            <p>Let him be our instance, that spake what he felt, and felt what he spake; sorrowes enough to break any heart, but that which God had framed according to his own. His sonne <hi>Amnon</hi> ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth his own sister, and is murdered by his own
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62298:28"/>
brother: that murder is seconded with Treason, that Treason with an incestuous constupration: the insurrection of his own son hath driven him from his house, from his throne, from the Arke of God all this went near him: that son is slain by his servant, and that went nearer him. In what a miserable perplexity may wee thinke the heart of this good King all the while? Here was thought upon thought, thought against thought; how at once to spare the sonne of <hi>David,</hi> and to save the Father of <hi>Absolom:</hi> fear against hope, north against south, wind against tide, <hi>Arma armis contraria, flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctibus undae;</hi> a <hi>multitude</hi> of thoughts, able to rend the heart in pieces, but for that recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of mercy, <hi>Thy comforts delight my soul.</hi>

            <p>Not seldome fares it thus with us; Thought calls to thought, jealousie to fear, fear to sorrow, sorrow to despaire; and these furies leap upon the heart as a stage, beginning to act their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall parts. Man hath more wheels moving in him then a clock: onely the difference is, that the wheeles of a clocke move all one way; whereas his faculties, like the epicycles, have a rapt motion: his sensitive appetite gives him one motion, his fantasie another, his reason a third, and his imperious, impetuons will crosseth them all, driving the chariot of his affections with the fury of <hi>Jehu:</hi> he desires, and thinks, and chuseth, argues, consents, and dislikes, and makes more businesse then time it self.

            <p n="3">3. The Captaine of this troublesome rout is himselfe; <hi>My</hi> thoughts. From what suggestion soever our thoughts come, wee call them our own: Whosoever begot the babe, the mother calls it her own child.

Bad sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, though they proceed from Satan, we call them our own, because they are bred in the womb of our natural corruption: stubble is blown by the winde into the fire, and being inflamed, it becomes fire.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62298:29"/>
that all his sorrowes proceed from his sins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My</hi> thoughts: thus easie is it with God to make a man become his own punisher. Under whose regiment are all these troubles? Under my selfe, <hi>My</hi> thoughts. As God threatens <hi>Tyre,</hi> that ancient and glorious City; that <hi>her owne feet shall carry her a farre off to sojourne:</hi> Our own <note place="margin">Isa. 23. 7.</note> feet shall carry us, our own creatures torment us: like diamonds, we are cut with our own dust. When David had numbred the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>his own heart smote him:</hi> God finds the rod within us, wherewith to scourge us. As some vapor engendred in the cavernes of the earth, struggles for vent; and being barred of free passage, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth an earthquake in the foundations that bred it.

               </gap>ers it self to the world with a dreadful noise. So the griefs and perturbations begotten by our own lusts, become terrours within us, and rend our very hearts, till they get vent by confession and repentance: thus do we muster up forces against our own peace. We pray, Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from our enemies; and in that number we do wrap up our unthought of selves: for we are our own enemies. <hi>Turn thine hand upon mine enemies:</hi> for thou canst do it with the turning of an hand: <hi>Deliver me from the evil man:</hi> who is that? saith S. <note place="margin">Psal. 81. 14.</note>

destruction upon mine owne soul: no enemy could hurt us, if we were our own friends.</p>
            <p>But we must not extend it so farre upon this holy King: they were thoughts indeed, and thoughts of sorrow, but of godly sorrow: and he calls them his own, to shew his neere acquaintance with them, <hi>My</hi> sorrowes. He was not a stranger to his own soul, his heart was not dead flesh. Satan had given him a fall, and he felt not that: sin had given him diverse falls, and he felt not them, neither: at last God undertakes him, wrastles with him, and he gives him a fall too: he felt that, yea and that made him feel all the rest. Now is he sensible of every pang and stitch: the least thorne makes him smart, and he cryes out of the multitude of his sorrowes. There be some that can drowne their griefes in wine and musick, as they did in <hi>Hinnom,</hi> the cry of the Infants with the noise of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments: as if they would forget that they are the owners of their own thoughts, because they trouble them. Many deale with their soules, as some old women do with looking glasses: they turne the wrong side toward them, that they might not see the furrowes of their own faces. They are loath to think of a reckoning, least they should despaire of making even the arrerages. Men have the courage to dare to sin, but they dare not look on their soules as they are polluted with sin. I have heard of a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly man, that would not beleeve he had a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62298:30"/>
head, till his Physician made him a hat of lead, and put it on: which with the weight infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to cry, O his head. So men lost in sensuall pleasures, scarce remember that they have a soul within them, untill miseries, like talents of lead, or quarries of stone, with their heavy pressure squeese out a confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>Nothings be so neer as a man and his soul: <hi>Tot a domus duo sunt;</hi> the whole houshold is but two: yea, why should they be called two? we may say in a right sense, <hi>Mens cujusque is est quisque:</hi> every mans soul is himselfe.

But that man and his soul be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously fallen out, that will not speak one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: when he shall passe a whole day, and not aske his soul how she does? this were too much betwixt man and wife: when he shall he down in his bed, as the beast doth in his litter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bidding his soul good-night: when he shall have fowled and besmeared his soul with the nasty aspersions of lusts, and not sweep out the dust before he shut the door, not wash his soul with tears, before his eye-lids be closed down with slumber: yea, when he shall have wounded his soul with blasphemies and uncharitable injuries, and then throw it down in a deluge of drinke, as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62298:31"/>
it were weltring in the own gore, without cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for repentance, the Chirurgion to dresse it. What madnesse and selfe-hatred is this? When the soul may not have leave to think over her own thoughts; to reflect upon her self, to search her own bruises, to survey the multitude of her sorrowes, and feel in what need she stands of comforts? That, <hi>Plerisque notus, ignotus mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur sibi?</hi> But the children of God have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to commune with their own hearts, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine every thought, and to weigh every desire in the balance of the Sanctuary. Whether they find themselves pensive or joyfull, they wil search the cause: As <hi>Rebecca</hi> said, when she felt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren struggle in her wombe, <hi>Why am I thus?</hi> Whether fear or hope, joy or pain have inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Gen. 25. 22.</note> my thoughts, let me aske my soul the reason, <hi>Why am I thus?</hi> The Fathers were excellent good at this: they had their confessions and Soliloquies, familiar conferences with their own hearts; that when a man reads them, hee would think they kept no other company but themselves. Conference with others may make us wise or learned, but conference with our selves is the way to make us holy. Tell thy conscience of all suggestions, as the chast wife (after some peremptory denyalls to her impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Tempter) professed to tell her husband of those sollicitations: such and such be my thoughts, thus and thus they haunt me, what shall I do with them?

The seat of sorrow is the soule; but it will overflow the boundaries. <hi>Why art thou cast downe, O my soule?</hi> None aske their eyes why they weep, or their voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">Psalm 43. 5.</note> why they lament, or their hands why they wring themselves: but <hi>Anima, quare tam tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis?

               <hi>Consolation</hi> then is made for sorrow; and not for every sorrow neither.

Many weep, as <hi>Rachel</hi> did in <hi>Ramah,</hi> for her children, <note place="margin">Matth. 2. 18.</note> because they were not: but they neither are, nor ever will be comforted. There are tears that got sinfull <hi>Esau</hi> nothing, and there be tears that got sinfull <hi>Mary</hi> salvation.

God may let us bleed for a while, till we be throughly humbled: but then, like the woman, the pangs of whose travell be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the sonne of joy shall be borne in our souls, even that son which the blessed Virgin bore from her womb; <hi>Filius dilectionis, Filius delectationis,</hi> Jesus Christ.</p>

Let your Christian experience supply here my defects of remonstance: I will summe up these comforts in a word: <hi>The Lord is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and mercifull, slow to anger, and of great kindnesse, and repenteth him of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</hi>

Drink at the first fountain, <hi>The Lord is gracious,</hi> free in his favours: if your thirst be not satisfied, go to the second; He is <hi>mercifull,</hi> he hath bowels of commiseration: if not yet, presse to the next; He is <hi>slow to anger,</hi> hard to conceive it, not willing to retaine it: wish we more? Hee is <hi>of great kindnesse,</hi> in the number and measure of his blessings: There is yet another well of <hi>comfort</hi> behind; <hi>Repenting him of the evill:</hi> full often doth he turne aside his blowes, and is easily intreated to have the rod pull'd out of his

            <p>How happily do these <hi>comforts</hi> meet with those sorrowes! we are troubled with the sense of our sins, and of Gods Judgment upon them: how should his Justice acquit us? yet there is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; the Lord is gracious,</hi> and cannot deny himself. But we are unworthy of this grace, because wee have turned it into wantonnesse: yet there is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:</hi> he is <hi>mercifull,</hi> and sheweth most pity where is most need. But we have multiplied offences, and continued in our sins to our gray hairs: yet there is <hi>comfort:</hi> He is <hi>slow to anger,</hi> evermore bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for his long sufferance. But our iniquities be not of an ordinary quality, they are hainous and intolerable: yet there is <hi>comfort,</hi> for he is <hi>of great kindnesse;</hi> our wickednesse cannot be so great as his <hi>kindnesse:</hi> of that there is no comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.

The mercies of God pass'd over in a grosse summe, breed no admiration; but cast up the particulars, and then Arithmetick is too dull an art to number them.

The Prophets servant rising early in the morning, sees the City besieged with a fearfull host of foot, horse, chariots: his eyes could meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but woods of pikes, walls of harnesse, and lustre of metalls, and hee runs in with this affrighting newes to his Master, <hi>Alas, what shall wee doe?</hi> Quiet <hi>Elisha</hi> sits in his <note place="margin">2 Kings 6. 16.</note> chamber as secure, as if all these had been the

But the taske is easie, if the next words find beleefe; <hi>They that be with us, are more then they that be with them.</hi> If the eyes of our faith be as open as those of our sense, to see Angels as well as Syrians, to perceive <hi>comforts as well as sorrowes,</hi> we cannot be appalled with the most unequall number of enemies. <hi>Many, O Lord, are thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull works which thou hast done for us, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reckoned.

Who can reconcile a man fallen out with himself? yea, fallen from himself? None but the God of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: who when the earth was void, without form, darknesse on the face of the deep; day and night, land &amp; water undistinguished, could reduce all this mishapen chaos of the world to form and order: when father, mother, brethren, kinred, friends, negh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and a mans own heart forsakes him, then God takes him up. The structure of <hi>Jericho</hi> was not more pleasant, then the waters were unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and thereby the soile corrupt: <hi>Elisha</hi> cures them with a cruse-full of salt: Our hearts are ful of thoughts, but they be noxious: yet if God throw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those fountains a handfull of saving grace, we shall bee whole. Our sorrowes too often would break our hearts, but (O God) for thy comforts: it is thou onely that canst make these weake vessels hold such scalding liquours, and not burst.</p>
            <p>There is combustion of these thoughts within us, til God part the fray, and pacifie the tumult: as when scholers are loud in brawls, the very sight of their master husheth them. When my heart, like the sea in a storm, is troubled; the winds raging, the waves roring; <hi>Thy</hi> comforts, like Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62298:37"/>
turns all into a calme. <hi>I thought on thee in the night season, and received comfort.</hi> In the night, the region of fear: in darknesse, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of despaire: in solitarinesse, the full advantage of sorrow: upon an unsleeping bed, the field of troublous thoughts: yet I did but think on thee, and before I came to meditate, to pray, to send up my soul unto thee, in that first thought <hi>I received comfort.</hi> O how short do all worldly things come of this sufficiency? If the heart bee wounded with sorrow, in vain is all the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of nature. Gold is no restorative, riches no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, yea they may be a corrosive: wee say to wine, thy spirits are dull; to laughter, thou art mad: musick grates the ear, and physick loathes the palate: company is tedious, and solitude dangerous: alas, what hope can there be, till the God of comfort comes? <hi>Sauls</hi> evil spirit will not leave him, til he be dispossessed by <hi>Davids</hi> harpe: wee finde as much ease, when wee rest our hearts upon temporall things, as hee that laid him downe to rest upon the cold earth, with a pitcher under his head: and finding the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low too hard, he rose and stopped it with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, thinking that then it would be wondrous easie. So be all temporary things to the soul, even when they are filled with the choicest mirth, nothing but vanity and vexation of spirit: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanity in their entertainment, but vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their farewell. Yet, O Lord, <hi>Thy</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Delight the soul;</hi> which is the last circumstance,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62298:38"/>
the effect of all. All Gods warre is for peace: <hi>Pacem habet voluntas, bellum necessitas.</hi> Wee should never have felt such a conflict, if God had not intended us such a conquest. Sin disquiets the heart; yet through his grace, this disquiet breeds repentance, repentance procureth forgiveness, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse restoreth peace, and peace <hi>delights the soul.</hi> The sharpenesse of the trouble advanceth the sweetnesse of the joy: as <hi>Christs sufferings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, so his comforts superabound.</hi> Every peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent tear that falls from the eye, springs up a flower of comfort. Look how full the vessells were of water, so full doth our Saviour ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">John 2. 7.</note> them of wine. In hell are all sorrowes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any comforts: in heaven are all comforts, without any sorrowes: on earth, good and bad, sweet and sowre, miseries and mercies, sorrowes and comforts are blended together. If here were nothing but sorrows, earth would be thought hell; if nothing but comforts, it would bee thought heaven. But that we may know it to be, as indeed it is, neither heaven nor hell, but between both, and the way to either; we have a vicissitude of troubles and delights. That as of old they painted King <hi>Solomon;</hi> because lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men were divided in their opinions of him; some casting him to hell, others advancing him to heaven: therefore a third moderate sort pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him halfe in heaven, and halfe in hell: so the Christian, in regard of his sorrowes, seems halfe confounded; and in respect of his comforts, halfe saved. But as indeed, <hi>Solomon</hi> after all his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62298:38"/>
errors found mercy; so the Christian after all his sorrowes shall find comfort. His beginning may seem troublesome, his proceeding not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightsome, but his later end is peace. <hi>Marke the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the end</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psalm 47. 37.</note> 
               <hi>of that man is peace.</hi> His heart was troubled, his <hi>soul</hi> shall be <hi>delighted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the grievances of the soul bee most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in respect of their nature, so they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so abundant in their number. Therefore let our care be to seek out that great <hi>Elixar,</hi> that most soveraign and universall Antidote and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall.</p>
            <p>One soul complaines; I have obloquies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, calamniations cast upon me; which <note place="margin">1.</note> render me contemptible to good societies. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality would thus argue with the heart. Bee these imputations, thus charged upon me, true or false? If true, let the integrity of thy future conversation so convince thy associates, that they shall both suspect those reports, and rest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of thy constant goodnesse.</p>
            <p>But the Divine grace applies a more virtuall medicine to thy conscience, which shall revive, either thy patience, or thy repentance. The soul shall argue with it self: If these imputations be true, here is work for my repentance; I will <hi>weep in secret for my sins.</hi> If false, let them not trouble me: It is the slanderers sin, not mine: neither am I bound to father anothers bastard. But still upon this calumnie, the world condemns me: but thy faith and patience assures thee,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62298:39"/>
that thou shalt <hi>not be condemned with the world.</hi> Yea, there is yet a higher degree of honour belonging to thy patience. Have not the best men been traduced? Was not the best of men, God and man blasphemed? yea even upon the Crosse, he was jeered when he dyed, by some of them for whom he dyed. Thus do the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of God requite thee; that in all this thou art (in thy measure) <hi>conformable to the sufferings of Christ.</hi> So dost thou allay all these furious tempests with one breath of faithfull ejaculation; <hi>Thy comforts delight my soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another complains; I am fallen from an affluent estate, to deep indigence. I have kept <note place="margin">2.</note> hospitality, to entertain friends: and made charity the Porch of my house, to relieve the needy ones. The vessell of my meanes is now drawn out to the bottom, there is not sufficient provision left for my own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p>Inquire of thy heart, whether this decay did not come by thy own riot, or through the vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious affectation of an abundant hospitality. If this, or that, or any other habituall sin, were the cause of it, begin with mortification there. First, mourne for thy sinnes: then faithfully depend upon thy Creators providence, and thou canst not faile of convenient suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>But it may be, that this is not the complainants case: he is not taken with a tabe or wasting of his substance; like a scarce sensible consumption of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62298:39"/>
his bodily vitalls. But his fall is with a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice; from a sublime Pinacle of honour, to a deep puddle of penury. Such was <hi>Jobs</hi> condition, so did he fall; from being rich and happy in the Adverb, to be poor and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable even to a Proverb. He had not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of good about him; but <hi>Omnia bene,</hi> all went well with him. Yet how suddenly did he fall from this abundant prosperity, to the depth of miserable poverty! Did he now follow the suggestions of that corrupt nature, which lay in his bosome, and whispered to him on his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; <hi>Curse God and die?</hi> No, but he apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the inspiration of grace; <hi>Blesse God, and live.</hi> So his last dayes were better then his first. That infinite mercy did so crown his patience with triumph, that his temporall estate was doubled. Yea, but what posterity had hee left to enjoy it after him? Yes, for even the number of his children was doubled too. For besides those seven Sons and three Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which were now with his Father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; he had also seven Sons and three Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with himselfe upon Earth. Piety and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience cannot bee cast downe so low, but that the hand of mercy can raise it up againe. <hi>In the multitude</hi> of all my losses and crosses, O Lord <hi>thy Comforts have delighted my soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But another, that hath heard all this sad Story, and seen the comfortable end sent <note place="margin">3</note> of the Lord, is not satisfied, because
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62298:40"/>
himself is not redressed. Like a coward in wars that looks for the victory, before he gives one stroke in the battell. What merchant looks to be landed in the place of traffick, before he hath past his adventure upon the seas? Still saith such a repiner; I am in distresse, and want even ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries. But still, thou, and we all, must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much more, before it can be said of us, <hi>Here is the faith and patience of the Saints.</hi> Still O my soul, wait thou upon the Lord, thy most faithfull Creator: he will in his good pleasure, open his hand, and <hi>fill thee with plenteousnesse.</hi> Be thou penitent before him, patient under him, confident in him, and thou shalt have a bundant cause to bee thankfull to him: <hi>Thy end shall bee peace,</hi> and <hi>comfort in Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, even now, in this dead low waters of fugitive fortunes, my soul confesseth, that I have the highest wealth. For Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is my riches, his merits is my inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible exchequer, his blood hath filld my veins with most lively vigour.

            <p>It is anothers complaint; I am shut up in a close prison, where I can neither converse with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">4.</note> abroad, nor let in others to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with me, in this my confined home. The sparrow on the house-top hath more freedome then I; For that, though wanting a mate, hath
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62298:40"/>
an open aire to flie in, and may so invite company to solace her, I have no society, but my discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate thoughts: no friend, to ask me so much, as how I do?</p>
            <p>Yet is thy soul at liberty: no barricadoed walls, no iron-gates or grates, no darke dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons can imprison that. The Jail is a strong prison to thy body, and thy body is but (in a metaphoricall phrase) a prison to thy soul; Thy body may not walke abroad, thy soul can. Spite of all thy cruell creditors, and some unmercifull Jailors; she can break Prison: She hath wings that can mount her through clouds and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, through orbs and constellations, and (like to <hi>Enoch) walke with God,</hi> in a heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of his infinite goodnesse. My ears cannot hear those airy Choristers, singing their Creators praise in the groves: my soul, in specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, can hear the Anthems of Angels in heaven. I may not hear the <hi>Hosanna's</hi> of the Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant in our materiall Temples below: I may conceive, that my soul hears the <hi>Halleluiahs</hi> of the Church triumphant above. I may not walk in the green pastures, and flowry medows on earth: my soul may move in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and melodious galleries of heaven. Thus O Lord, though in my strictest confinement here below, thou hast given me large liberty above. Still I will glorifie thee for all thy mercies, for <hi>thy comforts delight my soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anothers complaint is; I am vexed with a <note place="margin">5.</note>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:62298:41"/>
multitude of troubles. Not the law of the sword, but the sword of the law hath disquieted me. Let thy soul aske thy conscience this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: who did first breake the peace? If thou hast first overwhelmed that truth, which should bee apparent, thou art thine own enemy: For truth smothered in wet straw, will at length o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the danknesse of that suppression, and set on fire the smotherers. Thou hast forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the truth, and art therefore forsaken of peace.</p>
            <p>There bee two chief preservers of the soul, under the Almighty Creator of it; Truth and Peace. How invaluable are they together; Parted, how miserable! truth is the precious stone: Peace, the gold, wherein it is both set and preserved. Truth is the glorious light of the Sun; Peace, a clear and serene heaven. Peace is a most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full body, whilst it containes Truth, that more lovely soul. Truth brings downe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us, Peace bears us up to heaven. Both are sisters, the daughters of one Father, God himself.</p>
            <p>Do thou first recover truth: by continuall labour seeke it, with prayers and teares begg it, with the expense of much sorrow buy it, and then peace will come in to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: Gods <hi>comfort</hi> shall again <hi>delight thy soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another complaines; I am cast out of <note place="margin">6.</note> doors: I have no harbour but the hedges; nor
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62298:41"/>
lodging, but the fruitless ground. Poverty hath sent out her excommunication against me: all that have an estate, are forewarned to shun my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>Consider, when had <hi>Jacob</hi> so sweet a nights rest, as when the pillow he laid his head upon was a hard stone? Then was that ladder set by him, by which his soul might climbe up to heaven in a vision, whereof before he had but the speculation. The Angels were dancing those measures, and singing those raptures about him, which did in a manner angelifie him. His body lay on the bare earth, his soul with those spirituall wings of faith and love, was mounted above the clouds, above the orbs, even conversant in the highest hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</p>
            <p>When had <hi>Elias</hi> more excellent provision then when his breakfast was brought him in the morning, and his supper in the evening, by a raven? The messenger was homely, but the dyet was heavenly. It came from the table of that great King, whose hospitality feeds, not only men; but even the fouls of the air, the beasts upon earth, and the fishes in the sea. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets lodging was but a Field-bed, yet even then and there, the Lyons were a guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, the tutelar Angels did round him, and the Divine providence preserved him.</p>
            <p>If we be destitute of other lodging, and be driven to the common earth, yet we have a house
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62298:42"/>
over our heads, <hi>not made with hands,</hi> but <hi>an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall mansion in the heavens.</hi> There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a canopy for us, a roof arched over with the two Poles, and set with innumerable gliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring starrs. Yea; there is an omnipotent love that protects us; a materiall heaven encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing us, and a spirituall heaven within us, the peace of a good conscience, assuring us, of our eternall salvation through Christ Jesus. This is a softer lodging then the cabbins of merchants, or the Hamachs of sea-farers; yea then the most curious beds that the harbengers can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for Princes. O how sweetly doth the Christian rest, when he hears that voice from the Oracle of goodnesse; <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee, My comforts shall delight thy soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But anothers complaint is; I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed <note place="margin">7.</note> with sicknesse: I am a marke against which paine shoots his arrows: I wast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with languishments, as ice is dissolved by heat into water. Rest patient; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption shall be consumed. Death, that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall executioner of mankind, shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted. Time shall cut off Death, and Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shall make an end of Time. Death shall have no grave left for his monument, or trophee of his victories: and <hi>the Angel hath sworn, that time shall be no more.</hi> Thy sicknesse may outlast thy Physician, but thy soul shall outlive thy sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and nothing shall outlive thy soul.</p>
            <p>But the pangs of my body are so violent, that they assault me with distraction. Fear not:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62298:42"/>
they may beleaguer thee with distrust, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver overcome that faith, which thou puttest in this God of consolation. He is a most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Creator, and will <hi>servare depositum,</hi> keep that soul safe, with which the beleever hath instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted him. The breaches of the body are the souls windows, and afford her a more clear prospect into heaven, inkindling her with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent desire to be with God in glory. <hi>Jobs</hi> abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant sores would have bred in him a continui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of sorrowes; but for that antidote of faith, and saving cordiall of hope, that his <hi>eyes</hi> should see his <hi>Redeemer</hi> in blessednesse.</p>
            <p>The smiling Sunne flatters the traveller out of his cloake, whereas the robustious wind causeth him to wrap it the closer about him. God forbid that Christian Religion should bee but a cloake: yet the outward profession of it is somwhat loosned by wanton healths; and sickness wins it more inwardly to the heart. Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced merchants tell us, that in the hottest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, they find most comfort in the hottest drinks. A wonder to us that live in the cold cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates: but that the Suns adventitions heat so sucks out the radicall moisture and spirits, that it leaves the heart feeble, and destitute of the naturall comforts. It is a maxime in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, that one heat avocates another: the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the lesse. The heat of the Sun drawes forth the heat of the heart, and leaves it fainting. Poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> with his scraps and scabs, was yet in a better condition then the rich man with his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62298:43"/>
Princely Wardrobe, and his costly Viands. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued health hath maintained wanton desires and delights upon earth: but sicknesse hath sent many souls up to Heaven. Yea Lord, even with sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse afflict my body, so that thy Heavenly <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts do delight my soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a generall complaint; Afflictions environ me. In my short pilgrimage, through the sharp <note place="margin">8.</note> wildernesse of this world, on the one side the Thorns wound me, the Briers and Brambles scratch me on the other. This is not only the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served penalty of sinfull nature; <hi>Man is born to trouble as the sparks flie upwards,</hi> But even a kind of fatality inseparable to militant grace; <hi>All that will live godly in Christ, shall suffer persecution.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 12</note> That is a rare path upon earth, which hath never a rub: and a calm passage by water, that escapes all molestation. But more,</p>
            <p>Be there not some Afflictions, that conduce much to our preservation? We have found, that the falling into one grievous sin, the worst of all dangers, hath brought us to repentance, one of the best preservatives. I have heard some Seamen report by experience, that in a tempest, some raging billow hath swept a man from off the Decks into the maine Ocean: yet another wave on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, hath tossed him up into the ship again: so that he was only drenched; but not drowned. The violent pressure of one Affliction hath sunk a man to distrust in God: another with a more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Storme hath left him destitute of all earthly succour: He now resolves, the world hath forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62298:43"/>
me, I will never look for relief from it. But my God hath not forsaken me, he never will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake them that trust in him through Jesus Christ. To him I flie, upon him I rely: he will not suffer me to perish. Still, O Lord, in all my extremities <hi>Thy comforts delight my soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not offering to number mans grievances, which be innumerable; there is yet the last, and it may prove the best, complaint remaining.</p>
            <p>I am perplexed with the wofull consideration <note place="margin">9</note> of my sins; those <hi>bitter things which God writes against me,</hi> the irkesome recollection of my transgressions. I can argue with Philosophers, consult with Politicians, hear the ingenious fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Poets, reason in domestick concernments, enjoy the company of morall and harmless friends with delight. I can pray with confidence to be heard, and satisfied; I do hope with some assurance of salvation; I sleep upon a peacefull pillow, Thus far I am in a calm and serene hemisphere, and quiet be all my thoughts.</p>
            <p>But after all this Sunshine, there ariseth a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest. When I do recollect, or be represented unto my conscience, my innumerable, incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, intollerable sinnes; the remembrance of them is so frightfull, the burden of them is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable, that I dare not even look up unto Heaven. Faith lies fainting, hope is in a swoon, fear stands by the bed side, despaire lies ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at the chamber door, my soul is in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie. I am weary of all company, but those that speak of mercy. I sit mourning all the day
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62298:44"/>
long: Sorrow and solitude are my associates: I do shed some tears, and would weep tears of blood for my sins. I lament because my sorrows are not greater for offending my God.</p>
            <p>Well, yet hear the Physician of souls speaks to thee from Heaven. Weep on, bleed on, this bleeding shall not be unto death. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath a Balsome, that shall not onely stanch thy bleeding, but fill the veins of thy soul with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. His blood is an Antidote for thine. One drop of that shall satisfie for more sins, then ever thou hast committed.</p>
            <p>Weep on for thy Transgressions: Those flouds of tears shall not drown thee. Yea rather, like the waters of that universall Deluge, in that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Arke Christ Jesus, they shall bear up thy soul higher towards Heaven. They shall not drowne thee, yea they shall rather save thee from being drowned. This is that <hi>Secunda Tabula,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shipwrack; the main plank that shall preserve thee from perishing, emergent repentance.</p>
            <p>There be two most Valiant and Puissant soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that are the Souls Champions, Faith and Repentance. They fight not only against lust and sin, those Gyants of the world: but even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Principalities and Powers, those infernall spirits of darknesse. Faith hath her weapons and Forces, but Repentance hath many disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Other Souldiers fight standing, she kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: They in a posture confronting their enemies, she in humiliation, though not tergiversation from
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62298:44"/>
her opposites. They send forth their messengers of death in thundring ordnance: all her thunder is sighs and groans sent up to Heaven for mercies. They let flie their fiery Engines of destruction: she hath only her ejaculations: Her most piercing darts, be broken hearts. Their shafts are winged with fire, her arrows are feathered with water, her own soft tears. They swallow up the hope of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory with insulation: she in an humble prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion expects pity. Yet the God of all power and mercy, whom she beleaguers in Heaven, yeilds her the conquest. He comes from his inpregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Throne by his most gracious favour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of confounding her as a Rebel, he useth her as a Friend, or Daughter. He takes her up from her knees, he wipes away all her tears, he folds her in his armes, he seals her a pardon of all sins, and assures her of an everlasting Kingdom in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. O victorious Repentance! yea rather, O triumphant Goodnesse! O God, <hi>Teipsum vincis,</hi> thou even overcomest thy self, that <hi>thy Comforts may delight our souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is reported of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that when he thought (and did but think so) he had conquered all this world, he fell a weeping, that there were no more worlds to conquer. But there was remaining ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, a better then ever <hi>Alexander</hi> discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But this was not for an <hi>Alexander</hi> by force of Armes, but for a <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> by force of tears, to overcome.</p>
            <p>It is true, that <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven suffers violence:</hi> but the way of Conquest is not through
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62298:45"/>
the blood of bodies, but through a floud of tears, gushing out for our sins. This is such a stratagem of war, such a policy of Conquest, as the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of the world never understood: Yet even this <hi>through faith overcomes the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faith hath a plot, which shee hath taught her daughter Repentance, <hi>Concedendo superare,</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by yeilding. It is a stratagem among Wrastlers, that if a man can get himself under his antagonist, he lifts him up, the sooner to cast him down; yea, to give him the greater fall. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance stoops as low as she can: she lies, like <hi>Joshuah,</hi> upon the bare earth, yea wollowes in dust and ashes. She holds her self not worthy to be Gods foot-stool: let him trample upon her, and tread her under his feet, she still holds him by the feet, washeth them with her tears, and wipeth them with the hairs of her head, and kisseth them, though she be spurned by them. Doth this humble prostration provoke fury? No, it rather invites mercy. <hi>Parcere prostratis scit nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis ira Leonis:</hi> The Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> will spare such Lambs of humiliation; and in the pastures of consolation; he will both feed and preserve them. That thunder which dissolves the stubborn mettall, yet spares the yeilding purse: When power and policy have spent their spirits, submission is found the only way of Conquest. The feafull thunder of vengeance is resisted by the soft wool of repentance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yet hath this blessed grace another disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Faith, the chief of all the Forces, may
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62298:45"/>
be somtimes benighted, through the conglomeration of the clouds condensed by our sins. Hope may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed, by the interposition of the earth, our worldly imaginations, betwixt us and that great luminary of heaven, <hi>the Sun of righteousnesse;</hi> The century of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conscience, may be overcome with security. Sin is a subtile enemy, and his father, the Divel wil shew him the opportunity. Now is the time of invasion: seise on them, and cut all their throats. What shal repentance now do, when faith, the great Lady general droops; and Hope, her Lieutenant general is fainting? when the whole century is overcome with slumber?</p>
            <p>Yes, there is a watchman in the tower of the soul, that doth seldom sleep; holy Fear. He wakens conscience, conscience cals up faith, faith rouzeth hope, hope cryes aloud to repentance, repentance troops all the spiritual forces, the martial musick gives the alarm, the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are in battel-array, the enemies flie, the mind is at peace, because Gods <hi>comforts have delighted the soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. One disadvantage more makes dangerous work for repentance. The troops of faith are routed, one wing of hope is cut off. Yet this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Queen of the <hi>Viragines,</hi> or maiden-graces, alwayes bears up the Rear, and never appeares till the day be almost lost. When those great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, Innocency and Righteousnesse are foiled, and beaten, and have their Queen the soul, in danger to bee taken and slain by sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, her old adversaries; Then this <hi>Virgo, Virago,</hi> that all this while lay in expectation of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; this martiall Maid, victorious Repentance comes in with her Reserve, sets upon the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62298:46"/>
with her fresh forces, rescues the Queen, our soul, puts the great generall Satan to flight, and does impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial execution upon all his souldiers, which be our sins.</p>
            <p>Thus one grace begets another, by a supernatural generation, til they increase in number and measure, by the Divine inspiration. Faith calls up repentance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance brings in pardon and forgivenesse, pardon leads in comfort, and thus, O my God, <hi>Thy comforts delight my soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. When God, by the preaching of his law, hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up the fallow ground of our hearts, and by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of his Gospel hath sown the seed of eternal life in those furrows, he lookes that we should bestow our labour in the watering of this plantation. The ground is his, for he made it: the seed is his, for he gives it: the harvest is his, and he owns it. Yet such is the bounty of his goodness, that he gives his farmers the fruits of it. The rent of that great Landlords glory being truly payed, the product is ours, even the comfort and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our poor souls. All our pains is, but to hook up the weeds, that would hinder the growth of the corn, and dew the furrows with our tears, that it may spring up with chearfulness. But when the reaping-time comes, the whole crop is ours: and we come home singing with joy and thankfulness; <hi>Thy comforts have delighted our souls.</hi> When those glorious reapers, the Angels shal bear up our souls to heaven, like sheaves into the barn, we shal sing <hi>harvest-home,</hi> &amp; glorifie our infinite good God, and our sweetSaviour JesusChrist.</p>
            <p>To conclude, crosses are but the pursuivants to fetch in repentance: and afflictions, but Gods letters, missive formortification. When we are fallen into some
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62298:46"/>
hainous transgressions, we may better say then in our other trouble, this will cost hot water: For so it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: it wil cost the hot waters of our tears from our eyes, or it will cost the warm blood of our hearts. Our godly sorrow for our sins, is like the Pool of <hi>Bethesda:</hi> when that Angel from heaven, gracious repentance hath troubled the waters, the lazarous soul does but step into them, and is cured. For all our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual diseases, this is the remedy, upon which we may safely write, <hi>Probatum est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have made our selves sick by sinning: God is the Physician, and he prescribes: Affliction is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, and he prepares: the Medicine is Repentance, and that infallibly cures. It is a broken heart that makes us whole. God loves a true heart, and a clean heart, and an honest heart, and an humble heart: yea and he loves a broken heart too. <hi>The broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart, O God thou wilt not despise.</hi> It is true, that we <note place="margin">Psa. 54. 17</note> are bound to love him with our whole heart: but if it be broken with penitential sorrow for sin, he wil heal the fracture, redintegrate the heart, and reaccept it wholly to himself. A contrite heart, broken in peices with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and pickled up in brinish tears, is a sacrifice that God will not reject.</p>
            <p>Whosoever hath such a heart, let him make much of it: It is a dish for the king of kings. Sin, Repentance and Pardon, are like to the three vernall months of the yeer, <hi>March, April,</hi> and <hi>May.</hi> Sin comes in like <hi>March</hi> blustering, stormy, and full of bold violence. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance succeeds like <hi>April,</hi> showring, weeping, and full of tears. Pardon follows like <hi>May,</hi> springing, singing, ful of joys, and flowers. If our hands have been ful of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62298:47"/>
               <hi>March,</hi> with the tempests of unrighteousnesse: our eyes must be ful of <hi>April,</hi> with the sorrow of repentance: &amp; then our hearts shal be ful of <hi>May,</hi> in the true joy of forgivenesse.</p>
            <p>His <hi>soul;</hi> as there be no comforts like those of God; so there is nothing to which comforts are so welcom, as to the <hi>soul.</hi> The pleasure which the body takes, is but the body, yea scarce the very shadow of pleasure: the soul of pleasure is the pleasure of the soul. There bee many things pleasing to the body, wherein the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied soul takes no delight, especially in the day of trouble. In calamity, good nourishments are confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, good words are comfortable, good friends are comfortable, the Physician is comfortable, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine comfortable, a good spouse specially comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but in respect of these <hi>comforts,</hi> which passe all understanding, we may say of the rest, as <hi>Job</hi> did to his visitant friends, <hi>Miserable comforters are ye all.</hi> But blessed are the souls upon whom this Sun of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort shineth: and happy are those showers of fears and sorrows, that shall be dryed up with such beams of comforts: and <hi>blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort.</hi> To whom, with the Son, and Holy Ghost, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 3.</note> be all praise and glory, for ever and ever.</p>
