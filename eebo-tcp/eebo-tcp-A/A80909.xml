         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Declaration of His Highneſs, inviting the people of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> to a day of Solemn Faſting and Humiliation.</head>
            <p>THat We all in theſe Nations have more than ordinary cauſe to humble Our ſelves, and to lay Our mouths in the duſt in Faſting and Prayer before the Lord at this time, will undoubtedly be agreed by all.</p>
            <p>Amongſt many others let theſe following motives induce Us to be very ſolemn and ſerious in this Duty.</p>
            <p n="1">I. We having made Peace with all Our Neighbour Nations, and upon righteous grounds deeply engaged in a War with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> with whom We had no peace, but where he pleaſed, and from whom we could obtain none for the future, without ſubjecting the Lives, Liberties and Eſtates of the People of theſe Nations trading thither, to the bloody Inquiſition, and other Papall determinations, nor unleſs we would quit Our claims of ſatisfaction for multiplied injuries done Us, in ſhedding the innocent blood of this people, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſing them out of divers Iſlands, of which they were juſtly poſſeſſed, as is more at large expreſſed in the late Declaration, holding forth the grounds and reaſons of Our undertaking againſt them. The Lord hath been pleaſed in a wonderful manner to humble and rebuke Us, in that expedition to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> which although we apprehend was not in favour of the Enemy, yet gives Us juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear, that We may have either failed in the ſpirit and manner wherewith this buſineſs hath been undertaken, or that the Lord ſees ſome abomination, or accurſed thing, by which he is provoked thus to appear againſt Us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That whileſt the Lord has thus abaſed Us (inſtead of humbling Our ſelves under the mighty hand of God, and each man ſearching and repenting of the plague and evil of his own heart, and mourning for ſo great an affliction upon the whole Land, and more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally on the intereſt and profeſſion of the Goſpel in all the world) ſome moſt unnaturally rejoice, others are apt haſtily to apply accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their fancies; being too forward to give a reaſon of the Judgements of God, which are ſo great a deep, and particularly to aſſign the reaſon of this ſharp diſpenſation, not conſidering that the Lord may for tryal as well as in judgement, exerciſe the faith of his people. Others imputing the cauſe onely to the evil of the Magiſtrate, who profeſs (if there were no other provocation) even for their own ſins juſtly to have incurred all this, and much more, and hope they can in ſome meaſure deſire to redeem the loſſe ſuſtained by this heavy ſtroke, with their lives, deſiring nothing more than a conviction from the Lord. And have appointed this day of Humiliation, that the Magiſtrate, together with all ſuch as fear the Lord, may deal impartially with their own ſouls, before the Lord, in a matter of ſo great Concernment.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That the People of God continue ſtill in their animoſities, and improve not ſuch ſtrokes unto Love and Union, whileſt by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereof, the common Enemy, both at home and abroad, take encouragement to hope, that the time haſtneth wherein they ſhall ſwallow Us up; but inſtead thereof, ſome of the ſame faith in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, upon private thoughts of their own, hold up ſtill a quarrel with, and oppoſition to their Brethren, about Chriſts Kingdome, or rather their own underſtanding of the time, and manner of it, We mean thoſe of them, who will not give way that others wait upon the Spirit of God for light in this matter. Others ſtill differing about forms, even to the breach of the Royal Law. Others repining at the preſent begun Reformation, though having much tendency to good, both as to the comfort and ſecurity of the Godly, and diſcountenance of wicked men, and wickedneſs; wherein through God it hath had ſome ſmall effect, and alſo, which (which is moſt ſad) even becauſe it hath had the ſucceſs to unite more good men upon the old principles of Love and Truth than any expedient the providence of God hath brought forth ſince theſe troubles.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That ſtill We murmur and are unquiet, unthankful to the Lord, weary of our Peace, making it a light thing to run again into blood; We deſpiſe Magiſtracy, and are become weary of the preaching of the Goſpel, and other Ordinances of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Oathes, prophaneneſs, unmercyfullneſs, oppreſſion covetouſneſs, and ſeeking great things in ſuch ſhaking times, not mourning when the Lord calls to it, nor being ſenſible of our condition.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many more are juſt cauſes and provocations to us to mourn; eſpecially taking in this aggravation that the Lord hath done for us, yea even for his people here, above what he hath done for any people.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Adde to theſe the condition of the Proteſtant Churches abroad, the members whereof have very lately been maſſacred in <hi>Piedmont</hi> without ſparing age or ſex, are bleeding in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> divers there having been put to death for no fault, but being Proteſtants; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes upon the whole intereſt by the Popiſh party almoſt in all places of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the grounds of their quarrel and perſecution for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, more clear and avowed then in many years before.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. And laſtly, That the Lord would pardon the iniquities both of Magiſtrate and People in theſe Lands, wherein the Magiſtrate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires firſt to take ſhame to himſelf and ſind out his provocation, as well as lay it upon others, and that the Lord would pardon our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and convert us unto himſelf, and bleſs our poor friends in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and go out with our Fleets, and proſper our undertakings as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by his own bleſſed preſence, and unite us in love, cauſing mercy and truth to meet together, and righteouſneſs and peace to kiſs each other, and thereby exalt his own great name, make our Land glorious and bleſs his cauſe and people in all the world, and haſten the time of the pulling down of Antichriſt, and expelling out of theſe Lands the unclean Spirit, Is this day of ſolemn humiliation and prayer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be upon <hi>Friday</hi> the 28. of <hi>March</hi> 1656.</p>
