            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Christian Readers: More especially to those who belong unto
my Charge; for whose Help this Book
is principally intended.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Dear Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Hope none of you will think me
so vain, as to publish this Little
Book for this Reason, That I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
there are not many better of
the same Subject, and for the same Use,
already abroad in the World. I well
know, that there be very many; and
not a few of them so <hi>excellent,</hi> that if
you had them, and knew how to use
them, this that I now present you with
might well seem to be superfluous, if
not contemptible. But, I hope, till
you can be better provided, it may be
very useful to you, at least in this.
<pb facs="tcp:93871:3"/>
that it may help to fit you for the
using of those better: and if this only be
the use of it, you ought not to despise it.</p>
            <p>The true Reasons then, why I thus
tender you my Service, are those,
which some of your selves have often
prompted me with. When you have
been admonished to prepare your
selves carefully for the worthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of this Holy <hi>Sacrament,</hi> you have
been ready to say, That you wanted
good helps and Books for that purpose,
and you continue ignorant for want of
Instruction; for though you hear <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
and have been <hi>Catechized</hi> in
publick, and have been examined and
instructed privately too by the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
yet your Understandings being
dull, and your Memories weak, you
are not much better for all this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you want such <hi>Books</hi> to read as
may help you more fully to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
your Duty. This is a <hi>Pretence,</hi>
and no more than so, in very many,
whose Love to Sin, and Carelessness
of their Souls and all their spiritual
Concerns, is indeed the real cause of
<pb facs="tcp:93871:3"/>
their Ignorance and Unfitness for this
and all other religious Duties. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
this <hi>Pretence,</hi> and that you may
not delude your selves to your utter
undoing, by thinking you have a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Excuse for not doing so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
a Duty, when you have none, is
the cause of my presenting you with
this help to the doing of it.</p>
            <p>Some of you say, <hi>That the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
of those Books already extant to
this purpose, are too dear, and you are
not able to buy them.</hi> Herein some of
you speak the Truth; such I mean as
have not wherewith to buy Bread for
their Mouths, or Cloaths for their
Backs. But the most of them who
thus plead their Poverty, say no more
in effect but this: That they think
their Money better bestow'd in a <hi>Lace</hi>
or <hi>Riband,</hi> a Cup of <hi>Ale,</hi> or a Game
at <hi>Cards,</hi> than on their <hi>Souls,</hi> which
were so dear to <hi>Christ,</hi> that he paid
his most precious Blood to redeem
them.</p>
            <p>Others say, <hi>That those Books are too
learned and hard for their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:93871:4"/>
and they should be no wiser for them
if they had them.</hi> And indeed there is
too much Truth in this: yet are there
not wanting such as are so plain and
easie, that it can be nothing but your
unacquaintedness with the very <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ples
of Religion,</hi> that makes them
seem hard. If you were concern'd to
understand any other Language than
that of the <hi>Plow</hi> and <hi>Cart,</hi> or thought
it as needful to discourse sometimes of
matters relating to <hi>God</hi> and your own
<hi>Souls,</hi> as to talk to your <hi>Horses</hi> and
<hi>Oxen,</hi> you might soon learn much
Good from the Books you thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some of these Books,</hi> you say, <hi>are too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
long and tedious.</hi> And it is true, that
some of them are longer than they
should be for the use of the weaker
sort of Christians. But it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if every good Book seem too long
to them who have no Delight in
Goodness, and to them that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of hearing a short Sermon of an
Hour, or it may be not so much. A
Book that will cost them some days to
<pb facs="tcp:93871:4"/>
read it over understandingly, must
needs be very tedious indeed. They
that think all their time little enough
to trade and drudge in for the World,
or their swinish Lusts, cannot spare
much of it for their Souls without
grudging and wearisomness.</p>
            <p>Now that you may not hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
have any colour for such Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
I here offer you one that is, if
I mistake not, every way fitted to
your Condition and Capacity, for it
is <hi>cheap,</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> and <hi>short;</hi> and yet,
I hope, sufficient to teach and direct
you in your Duty. I herein endeavour
to manifest my hearty Love and Care
for your Souls and everlasting Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:
and if I had no other Reason for
writing and publishing it but this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that I desire to shew my Readiness
to serve you, and to cast in my small
Mite amongst those that offer more
largely out of their Abundance, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the enriching of your Souls, I
may, I hope, be at least excusable.</p>
            <p>But, alas, what better will you be
for my Kindness if you will not make
<pb facs="tcp:93871:5"/>
use of it! This Book, nay all the Books
in the World, will not make you
<hi>Christians,</hi> or <hi>worthy Communicants,</hi>
by lying by you, or by a careless
reading, without understanding, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,
and practising, no more than
your Meat will nourish you without
eating it. Some few Years ago I gave
you, for the same Reasons which move
me now to give you this, a small Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
both of your Faith and Duty,
called, <hi>Christianity in short;</hi> which
hath with very many found a welcome
much above my Hope or Expectation;
the worst Entertainment it hath met
with, is from some of you for whose
Benefit it was chiefly intended, and
who had it <hi>gratis.</hi> The Reason why
it hath been so coldly entertained at
home whilst it was so welcome abroad,
I am apt to think is this, That you
know me better than Strangers do,
and seeing my Infirmities daily, do
more slightly regard my Endeavours
than they who see them not. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
I pray you, it is the <hi>Doctrine</hi>
of your Blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> that in both
<pb facs="tcp:93871:5"/>
that little Book, and this I commend
unto you, and not my own <hi>Example.</hi>
Make but use of that as you ought, and
my Failings, what hurt soever they do
my self, shall not hurt you.</p>
            <p>One thing you are to be here mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of: You read things of this nature
so imperfectly and so heartlesly, that
little of what you read remains with
you. An obscene <hi>Ballad</hi> or <hi>idle Tale-Book</hi>
you can read with Delight; and
though imperfectly at first, yet you
read them so often, till you grow too
perfect in them to your own great
Hurt. Why take you not the like
Pains in these Helps of Religion? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you take no Pleasure in Religion,
nor care much what becomes of <hi>God's</hi>
Honour, or the Salvation of your Souls.
This is too sad a Truth, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny it. Your drowsie reading
makes all good Books mere Non-sense
to you.</p>
            <p>If it were not so, you would never
be weary of learning your <hi>Christian
Duty,</hi> nor of practising it neither; and
you would particularly never rest till
<pb facs="tcp:93871:6"/>
you understood the right way of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
worthily to this heavenly <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,</hi>
unto which I here direct you.
Whenever men are <hi>Christians</hi> indeed,
they will set a greater Price than now
they do upon this unvaluable Token
of <hi>Divine Love;</hi> and they will be
ashamed to think that the <hi>Table of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi>
should have so many Guests, and
the <hi>Table of the Lord</hi> so few.</p>
            <p>I have here very plainly, shunning
all Disputes and Niceties, laid the
whole Duty before you, with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of it, and the way to perform
it aright; I have also removed out of
your way all the Rubs and Mormoes
which are apt to hinder or affright
you. Nothing can be wanting but a
<hi>Will</hi> in you to be <hi>Christians,</hi> and to
live so now as that you may live eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.
This is that which I cannot
give you, but must not cease to beg it
for you of the only Giver of all good
Gifts, nor to beseech you, by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of <hi>God,</hi> that you will by all
means endeavour after it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93871:6"/>
To the Grace of <hi>God</hi> I do mo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
heartily commend you in my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
beseeching him to bless this poor
Endeavour to the eternal Good of
your Souls.</p>

            </p>
            <p>When dying for us, he bequeathed

and his Kindness therein to

how shall we then look him in the

us, his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> the most choice

            <p>Thus would <hi>He</hi> have us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

            </p>
            <p>Two solemn <hi>Rites</hi> he hath institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

and the <hi>Supper of the Lord;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are to own him openly before

<hi>Covenant</hi> with him. As he then that
refuseth to be <hi>Baptized,</hi> refuseth to be
a <hi>Christian;</hi> so he that having been
<hi>baptized</hi> refuseth this other <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
doth in effect renounce his <hi>Baptism,</hi>
disown the <hi>Covenant,</hi> apostatize from
<hi>Christ,</hi> and cast off the Profession of

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93871:9"/>
He hath not commanded us many
chargeable and troublesome Sacrifices,
such as the <hi>Iews</hi> offered; nor the
Blood of our Sons and Daughters,
which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> grudged not to
offer unto <hi>Devils.</hi> The Cost we are
put to is of a little <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine;</hi>
the Pains we are put to, is, with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and thankful Hearts to <hi>take, eat,</hi>
and <hi>drink,</hi> in Remembrance of our

a Command of the <hi>God</hi> of Heaven

the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of Sinners, the only <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
of Souls, and not renounce <hi>God,</hi>
our <hi>Saviour,</hi> the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion,
and all our claim to Salvation? No,
'tis very plain, that tho' the want of
this Sacrament, when it is desired but
cannot be had, is no Sin, if not occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by our Sin; yet the wilfull ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
of it is no less than a damning
Sin, unless there be no such thing as
Damnation, and the Gospel be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
from which blasphemous thought

            <head>CHAP. II. The Necessity and Way to Receive
worthily.</head>
            <p>HE that eateth not at the <hi>Lord's
Table</hi> must dye, and he that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
unworthily is in danger of Death:
so St. <hi>Paul</hi> assures us; <hi>Whosoever shall
eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the
Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the
Body and Blood of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 27.
and again, v. 29. <hi>He eateth and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Damnation</hi> [or Judgment] <hi>to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this seem hard to us, it is only
because we are unreasonable, and
had rather not do any Duty at all,
than be at the Pains to do it as we
ought. As the Duty is necessary, and
yet very reasonable and not burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
so to do it worthily is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and no less reasonable or easie
if we have a Mind to be <hi>Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Direction how to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<hi>worthily</hi> we have in these words,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93871:10"/>
               <hi>Let a Man examine himself, and so let
him eat of that Bread, and drink of that
Cup, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 28. They who are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
and are not sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
cannot examine themselves,
and therefore may not eat, and they
who, either because they are afraid to
awaken their Consciences and not be
able to sin in Quietness, or because
they are loath to be at the Pains, or
take so much time from their worldly
Business or Pleasures, will not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
themselves, may not presume to
eat.</p>
            <p>What then must such Persons do, for
if they eat not they die? The ignorant
must be <hi>Catechised</hi> and learn: if they
be ashamed of this, they are ashamed
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and must perish for hating
Instruction. They that will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
themselves, must consider how
they can dwell with everlasting Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<hi>Eat</hi> or <hi>Die, Examine</hi> or <hi>eat not,</hi>
that's all the Choice our Sins have
left us.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Examination</hi> is not a thing
commanded for it self, but in order
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93871:11"/>
to something else. Counterfeit Gold
is of no more worth than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for being examined or tryed by
the Touch-stone. We must examine
our selves, that we may know what
we are. <hi>Examine your selves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you be in the Faith; prove your
own selves: Know you not your own
selves, how that Iesus Christ is in you,
except you be Reprobates?</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 5.
We might know whether we be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
or no, would we try our selves,
and not be content, like false Gold,
to make a shew only. And to this
end must we by Examination learn to
know our selves, that we may be
able to approve of our selves in our
own Consciences before <hi>God,</hi> that we
are sincere <hi>Christians,</hi> that we may
not think our selves to be something
when we are nothing, and so deceive
our selves, <hi>let every Man prove his own
Work, and then shall he have rejoycing
in himself,</hi> Gal. 6. 4.</p>
            <p>In short, we are to examine what
<hi>Graces</hi> God hath given us, and be
truly thankful; what is yet amiss in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93871:11"/>
us, and amend it; what we yet want,
and endeavour to obtain it.</p>
            <p>The difficulty of this Duty affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
many from this <hi>Sacrament:</hi> and
indeed, considering how most of us
live, it is no wonder that it seemeth
difficult. But we should remember,
<hi>first,</hi> That this <hi>Self-Examination</hi> is a
Duty, necessary, not only now and
then before a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but at all
times, that we may understand how
far we are <hi>Christians</hi> indeed; and
therefore the Difficulty may as well
affright us from being <hi>Christians</hi> as
from this <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and so I fear it
doth too many, who therefore abstain
from the <hi>Lord's Table,</hi> because they
have no mind to be <hi>Christians</hi> any
farther than in Name only. And
then, <hi>secondly,</hi> We must remember,
that whatever Difficulty there is in
this Duty, it is of our own making,
and we may make the Duty more
easie if we will. For,</p>
            <p>1. We continue willingly ignorant
of the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and its use; and
it must needs be hard for us to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93871:12"/>
our selves by a <hi>Rule</hi> which we
understand not. But let us take pains
to learn perfectly the particulars of
our Christian <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> gathered
from the Sacred <hi>Scriptures</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
in easie <hi>Catechisms,</hi> and often
beg the <hi>Minister's</hi> help for the right
understanding and due applying
thereof to our selves, opening freely
to him all our Ignorances and Doubts,
and this part of the Difficulty will
be removed.</p>
            <p>2. We live loosly and carelesly, not
observing well our own Tempers and
Actions; and having let them slip
without any notice of them, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
recall to mind and examine what
we never regarded. Let us but once
every day take a little time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what <hi>Inclinations</hi> in us have that
day shewn themselves, and what have
been our <hi>Thoughts, Words,</hi> and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and comparing them with the
Rule of Life, observe how they agree
or disagree with it: and heartily bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>God</hi> for any Good that by his help
we have done, humbly bewailing,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93871:12"/>
confessing, and begging Pardon for all
our Failings of Omission or Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
praying devoutly and seriously
for more Strength and Grace to live
better, resolve to do our utmost En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to amend and improve daily;
we shall soon find all the Difficulty
over: especially if we would, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as we find cause to doubt of any
thing, open our Souls freely to our
Spiritual Guides, <hi>God's Ministers,</hi> for
their Assistance. Which course till i
be taken, we shall every where find
too few <hi>Christians:</hi> but if we would
do thus, we should learn to know our
selves so well, that it would be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
easie matter to examine our selve<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

against a <hi>Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that we may be <hi>worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants,</hi>
we must examine our selve

or no, and, whether we be rightly

Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We must be of <hi>Christ's</hi> Family,

are solemnly admitted into the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> by <hi>Baptism,</hi>
wherein we are dedicated to <hi>God</hi> the
<hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the Bond of a sacred <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
with the ever Blessed and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Trinity.</hi> So long as we continue
faithful in this <hi>Covenant,</hi> so long are
we <hi>Christians;</hi> and therefore this is
first to be enquired into, Whether or
no we faithfully stand to this <hi>Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Covenant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Then are we duely disposed for
this Duty of <hi>Communicating,</hi> when
understanding the <hi>Nature, Ends,</hi> and
<hi>Benefits</hi> of this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> we find the
Affections of our Hearts in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
suitable thereunto. And to this
purpose it is, that we are more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
before our Approaches to the
<hi>Lord's Table</hi> to examine our selves.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. How to examine our Selves about our

            <p>THE faithful keeping of our <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal
Covenant</hi> is our <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
We are therefore impartially to
enquire both how we understand it,
how we have kept it, and how we
resolve to keep it.</p>
            <p>1. To help us to understand it, we
must know <hi>four</hi> things; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 27.</note> That our Good <hi>God</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made man a <hi>rational</hi>
Creature in <hi>his own Image,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 29.</note> and given
him an <hi>immortal</hi> Soul, void of any
Inclination to Evil, with sufficient
Knowledge to understand his Duty,
and Power enough to do it, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
him to live in perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to <hi>God</hi> his Maker, whereby he
and his might live for ever happy in
the Love of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. Rom. 5. 12.</note> the first
Man and common Father of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93871:14"/>
us all, by the Temptation of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
disobey'd this Command, and
thereby brought us all into a state of
Weakness, Sin, and Death: And
now in such a Condition
we come into the World,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7, 8.</note>
that, left unto our selves, we would
do nothing but sin against <hi>God,</hi> and
run upon our own Destruction.</p>
            <p>3. That our gracious <hi>God,</hi> when
he might justly have cut off at once
the whole Race of Mankind in <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve,</hi> or have left all their Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to perish by their own Doings; of
his wonderful Goodness and Mercy
took pity on Sinners, and opened <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
to us a new way to Salvation, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
for us a <hi>Saviour,</hi> even GOD
the SON, the only begotten of the
FATHER, who in our Flesh having
taught us what God now requireth of
us if we will be saved, laid down his
Life for us to satisfie for our
Sins and free us from Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,<note place="margin">Mat. 1. 21.</note>
               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 1. 10.</note>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 16. 16.</note>
and offereth us a
full Pardon on Condition
that we will <hi>believe</hi> in him and be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93871:14"/>
               <hi>baptized,</hi> so signifying our Consent to
the new <hi>Covenant</hi> which <hi>God</hi> is pleased
to make with us in him.</p>
            <p>4. The meaning of which <hi>Covenant</hi>
is this: That though we cannot now
be <hi>innocent,</hi> and so can never hope for
Life by obeying and fulfilling the <hi>Law</hi>
of <hi>Innocence</hi> given to <hi>Adam;</hi> yet, if
we will <hi>first,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 3. 19.</note> truly <hi>repent,</hi>
and <hi>secondly,</hi>

of CHRIST,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 9.</note> and <hi>third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 10.</note>
sincerely obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<hi>God</hi> will yet be <hi>our God,</hi> and
take us for his <hi>People;</hi> and for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<hi>Son Iesus Christ's</hi> sake <hi>pardon</hi> our
Sins, and sanctifie us by his holy <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi>
and finally, <hi>glorisie</hi> us with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in Heaven.</p>
            <p>II. Next we must examine how we
have <hi>kept</hi> this <hi>Covenant.</hi> And here,
seeing we were <hi>baptized</hi> in our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,</hi>
and what was promised on
our parts, was promised by others
in our Name; we are to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</p>
            <p>1. Whether we have, since we
came to Understanding, at any time
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93871:15"/>
own'd and confirmed this Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and taken upon our selves the
Performance of it. Our <hi>Church</hi> hath
well provided, that no Person shall
be admitted to the LORD's <hi>Supper</hi> till
he be <hi>Confirmed,</hi> or have declared his
willingness to be <hi>confirmed;</hi> that is,
till he have satisfied the <hi>Church,</hi> that
he understands the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi>
and declareth his Resolution to
keep it.</p>
            <p>2. If we have thus own'd our <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal</hi>
Engagement, we must dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
examine how we have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
performed it in all the Parts of it,
viz. <hi>Repentance, Faith,</hi> and <hi>sincer<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Obedience.</hi> And this we are to do
by posing our selves in the several
<hi>Articles</hi> of our Christian Faith, and
in the <hi>Commandments</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> If we
find that we have not been faithful
to <hi>God</hi> in this <hi>Covenant,</hi> we must not
come to this <hi>Sacrament</hi> till we have
unfeignedly repented of our unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
and seriously renewed our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
to keep it henceforward
Therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93871:15"/>
III. We must examine how we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to keep it for the time to come:
And here we are to see to these
things:</p>
            <p>1. That it be a <hi>serious, deliberate,</hi>
and <hi>well grounded</hi> Resolution, not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up dissemblingly, nor rashly, nor
for weak Reasons. But being clearly
convinced and become sensible of <hi>God's</hi>
absolute Right in and to us and all
our Services, his sovereign Authority
to govern us and command us, and
his wonderful Goodness and Love to
us, more especially declared in his
<hi>Son Iesus Christ;</hi> this Sense and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of <hi>God's</hi> being our <hi>Maker,</hi> our
<hi>Governour,</hi> and our <hi>Benefactor,</hi> should
be the reason and ground of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to be wholly <hi>his,</hi> to be ruled
by <hi>him,</hi> and love and honour <hi>him</hi> above
all.</p>
            <p>2. That it be a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat
Resolution,</hi> that we use no <hi>Ifs</hi> or
<hi>Ands,</hi> or rest in some faint <hi>Purposings;</hi>
but we must be throughly determined
and fixed upon it. That whatever we
may lose or suffer by it in this World,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93871:16"/>
we will by <hi>God's</hi> help go through
with it, without any Exception or
Limitation whatsoever, doing the
whole Will of <hi>God</hi> from the Heart.</p>
            <p>3. That it be a <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
without any proud Trust
or Confidence in our own natural
Strength to make it good; but yet
with all Trust and Confidence in the
Goodness of <hi>God,</hi> that if we conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
use the means of Grace and
Strength which he hath ordained, as
he hath wrought in us <hi>to will,</hi> so he
will strengthen us <hi>to do</hi> his good Will,
and finally, reward us according to
his infinite Mercy.</p>
            <p>When we have thus considered our
<hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> and are thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
by <hi>God's</hi> help, to keep it, we
should earnestly pray unto <hi>God</hi> for his
Assistance: and, if we are not already
<hi>Confirmed,</hi> it is fit that we humbly
offer our selves to <hi>Confirmation</hi> so soon
as we can. The very sense of Shame
to break a <hi>Covenant</hi> after this solemn
Engagement in the Face of the <hi>Church</hi>
to keep it, and the Fear of drawing a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93871:16"/>
greater <hi>guilt</hi> upon our Souls, by
breaking a <hi>Covenant</hi> so renewed, must
needs be some Restraint upon us to
keep us from breaking it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, we have good Cause to
hope, that the Prayers of the <hi>Church,</hi>
and the Blessing of <hi>God's Minister,</hi> the
<hi>Bishop,</hi> who by his Office blesseth in
<hi>God's</hi> Name, shall very much conduce
to our greater Strength and growth in
<hi>Christianity.</hi>

            <p>1. If we believe them <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</hi>
To be satisfied herein, we
should do well to have the Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Judgment of <hi>God's Minister.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If we believe them with a <hi>divine</hi>
Faith, because of the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi>
of <hi>God</hi> who hath revealed them.
Be perfect therefore in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
that you may know they are taught
therein by <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. If we believe them <hi>firmly,</hi> so that
we are persuaded we dare even lay
down our Lives for the Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:93871:20"/>
4. If we believe them <hi>effectually</hi> and
<hi>practically,</hi> so that this Belief doth fill
our Hearts with the <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>

aright, or whether the thing be
a divine Truth, or whether our Faith
be firm and strong, or have sufficient
Influence on our Hearts and Lives,
that should dismay us: but whilst we

us on in a <hi>Christian</hi> Course of Life,
trusting our Souls in well doing to the

<hi>turning</hi> and change of Heart
and Mind, that, being
brought to the Knowledge
of the true <hi>God</hi> and our Duty to him,
we renounce our former course of Life,
and resolve to serve and honour God
according to his Word. This fits us

so little in love with the World, that
nothing therein can tempt me to
dishonour God or wrong my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
or bear Malice or Hatred against
any man, or break the Bond of Love
and Charity, or to neglect the care
of my Soul?</p>
            <p>These are the chief Branches of our
<hi>Christian Duty,</hi> whereby we may also
know our <hi>Sins,</hi> and what we have
more especially to repent of. And
here we are to note some things ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
needful to be observed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:93871:29"/>
1. That though we are to aim at
the Perfection of Duty in all we do,
and not to satisfie our selves with
low degrees of Holiness, but to be
greatly humbled by the sense of our
Failings, and restlesly to strive after
better things; yet it is not a perfect
Obedience without Sin, but a sincere
Obedience without feigning and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
that is the Gospel-condition
of our Salvation through <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
It is not our duty to be perfectly inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
but it is our duty to labour after
Perfection. Tho then we find that
we offend in many things, and do all
that we do very weakly and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
we are not to discourage our
selves thereby, so long as we can find
our hearts sincerely bent to keep Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with <hi>God,</hi> and to honour and
serve him more perfectly.</p>
            <p>2. That we are therefore narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to search our hearts, to see that we
are sincere in our obedience. We are
to see, that all our obedience flow
from a true Love of God in our hearts,
and a sense of his Right to command,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93871:29"/>
and our Obligations to obey; that
our great design in all things be to
please God and to enjoy his Love,
and not any of those low ends of
pleasing men, or securing our own
Reputation, or our worldly Peace,
Profit, or Safety. And if our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
be thus sincere, then do we
make a Conscience of those which
men account little Duties as well as
of greater, of shunning little Sins as
well as grosser Sins, of governing our
Thoughts and Desires, as well as
Words and outward Actions; we are
as religious in private as in publick,
where it is costly as where it is cheap,
where 'tis painful as where it is easie,
where it is against our natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
as where it suits with our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Temper, where it is discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced,
derided, or persecuted, as where
it is countenanced, commended, and
rewarded by men.</p>
            <p>3. That having discovered our Sins,
we seek not any Excuses or Pretences
to cloak or lessen them, but endeavour
to view them in their ugliest and most
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93871:30"/>
affrighting Shapes; as contrary to
the Purity of <hi>God,</hi> and the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of man as well as his Happiness:
against so much goodness, long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and patient Forbearance of <hi>God;</hi>
against so many Encouragements of
his present Bounty and rich Promises

and Threatnings, so many father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Chastisements and Corrections, so
much Light and Knowledge, so many
means, helps, and opportunities, so
many vows and engagements, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
admonitions by Friends, and checks
by our own Consciences: after all this,
so long continued in, so much time,
strength, estate, wasted thereby; so
little of all this left to serve God
with, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By such Considerations
must we labour to humble our proud
Hearts, and bring them to a perfect
Hatred of Sin.</p>
            <p>4. That our Repentance be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned,
and rest neither in confessing
our Sins, nor sorrowing for them, nor
begging Pardon, nor in any thing
else, till it come up to a hatred of Sin,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93871:30"/>
and a full Resolution to forsake it.
When it is come to this, we will be
very angry at our own Folly that we
have so long continued in it, very
thankful to God for any Chastisement,
thinking our selves mercifully dealt
with, whatever our Condition be, so
long as we are not in Hell; use cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
all helps and means, how hard
or sharp soever, to mortifie our Lusts;
thank any man that will reprove us
and shew us our Faults; watch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
against all Temptations, avoid
carefully all occasions of Sin; observe
jealously our Thoughts, Words, and
Actions; pray devoutly for more
Grace and Strength; abridge our
selves of many things lawful, and
punish our selves by crossing our own
Wills; not be ashamed to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
satisfaction to the <hi>Church</hi> where
it is required, nor to open our Breasts
freely to the Guide of our Souls for
our own Satisfaction. We will do
any thing, or suffer any thing, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<hi>sinning against God.</hi>

<hi>and St.</hi> Paul <hi>saith,</hi> which is broken for

for the Remission of Sins. (<hi>St.</hi> Luke

as ye drink it, in remembrance of me:
For as often as ye eat this Bread, and

the Lord's Death till he come.</p>
            <p>By these Words of the <hi>Evangelists</hi>
and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> we may understand what
the meaning and use of this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is.</p>
            <p>1. It is a <hi>holy Christian Feast,</hi> not
much unlike the <hi>Feast</hi> of the <hi>Passover</hi>
among the <hi>Iews,</hi> at which this was
instituted by <hi>Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exodus 12.</note> When
they were in Bondage in
<hi>Egypt, God,</hi> in order to their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
destroyed all the first-born in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93871:32"/>
               <hi>Egypt,</hi> commanding them to kill in
each Family a Lamb, and to strike the
Blood thereof upon the Door-posts of
their Houses, and so to feast upon it,
promising, that when he saw the
<hi>Blood</hi> he would <hi>pass over</hi> their Houses,
and not destroy their first-born. In
thankful Remembrance whereof, they
yearly kept the like Feast, called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Lord's Passover.</hi> Thus by the
Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> we being all brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Bondage and Slavery under Satan,
it pleased <hi>God</hi> to destroy the Power of
the <hi>Devil,</hi> and deliver us by the <hi>Death</hi>
of JESUS CHRIST, <hi>the
Lamb of God which taketh
away the Sins of the World;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 29.</note>
               <hi>to redeem us by his precious
Blood as of a Lamb without Blemish and
without Spot:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 19.</note>
so that <hi>Christ is our Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
sacrificed for us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 7.</note> Therefore are
we to keep the <hi>Feast,</hi> eating our <hi>Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi>
the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> in a
thankful Remembrance of this our
<hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Deliverance</hi> by his once
offering himself to <hi>God</hi> a Sacrifice for
our Sins.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:93871:33"/>
In like manner, when according to
the Law, Men sacrificed <hi>Peace-offerings</hi>
unto <hi>God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 7. 20.</note> they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to <hi>feast</hi> before <hi>God</hi>
on part of the same; to signifie, that
<hi>God</hi> now admitted them to an intimate
<hi>Communion</hi> and Friendship with <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
feasting them at <hi>his own</hi> Table,
of that meat which by their <hi>Oblation</hi>
was now in a special manner his. So
<hi>Christ,</hi> whom all the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the
Law did shadow forth and typifie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
offered once for all a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of
<hi>Atonement</hi> for our Sins, calleth us
Christians to feast upon this Sacrifice,
though it was a <hi>Sin-offering;</hi> and even
upon the <hi>Blood</hi> of it (as the <hi>Iews</hi> were
not allowed to do in their Feasts) in
token of a more intimate <hi>Communion</hi>
and Friendship with <hi>God</hi> through <hi>him,</hi>
who hath made our Peace. This <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
then is a sacred Feast, and
that upon the <hi>sacrificed Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi>
of <hi>Christ:</hi> and as <hi>bodily</hi> we eat and
drink the broken <hi>Bread</hi> and poured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Wine,</hi> the <hi>Symbols</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> and
<hi>Blood;</hi> so <hi>spiritually</hi> we eat his <hi>crucified
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93871:33"/>
Body</hi> and drink his <hi>poured-out Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The great <hi>end</hi> of this <hi>Feast</hi> is, to
keep up in the <hi>Christian Church</hi> a fresh
and joyful <hi>Remembrance</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
and of all that he did and suffered in
the Flesh for us. <hi>This do,</hi> saith he,
<hi>in remembrance of me.</hi> It is his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that we more signally and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
commemorate thus the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of his Death by a lively Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of it at this Feast of Love,
and so <hi>shew his Death till he come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We <hi>shew</hi> it hereby to our own
<hi>Hearts,</hi> for the stirring them up to an
holy rejoycing in Christ, praising him,
believing in him, loving him and
obeying him, and to bring them to
true Repentance and a perfect hatred
of <hi>Sin</hi> which crucified the <hi>Lord of
Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We <hi>shew</hi> it to the <hi>World,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to the Honour of our holy <hi>Iesus</hi>
what great things he hath done for
our Souls; that we are not ashamed
of a crucified <hi>Saviour,</hi> that we glory
before the World and rejoyce in him,
that <hi>he</hi> is the <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Gladness</hi> of our
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93871:34"/>
Souls, that we are resolved to be
faithful unto him whilst we live, and
are ready to dye a bloody Death for
him if he shall call us to it.</p>
            <p>3. We <hi>shew</hi> it unto <hi>God,</hi> laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him in our Prayers the <hi>Death</hi> of
his only begotten <hi>Son,</hi> as the most
powerful Argument, and all indeed
that we have, to prevail with him
for <hi>Pardon,</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Glory;</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
our Persons and our Services
to the <hi>Father</hi> as acceptable unto him in
the Vertue of this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> only.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Benefits</hi> of this <hi>Sacrament</hi>
must needs be many, seeing herein
our blessed <hi>IESUS</hi> giveth <hi>himself</hi> unto
us to be the food of our Souls His <hi>Body,</hi>
which was broken for us, he here bids
us <hi>take</hi> and <hi>eat.</hi> His <hi>Blood,</hi> which was
<hi>shed</hi> for us, he here bids us <hi>drink, The
Cup of Blessing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor 10. 16.</note> 
               <hi>which we bless, is
it not the Communion</hi> or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication]
<hi>of the Blood of Christ?
The Bread which we break, is it not the
Communication of the Body of Christ?
Christ,</hi> and all the Benefits of his <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
are freely communicated to the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93871:34"/>
worthy Partakers of this <hi>Bread</hi> and
this <hi>Cup.</hi> The <hi>Cup</hi> of which we
drink, <hi>is the New Testament in his
Blood. Covenants</hi> were of old made
and confirmed with <hi>Sacrificings</hi> and
<hi>Feastings:</hi> the <hi>new Covenant</hi> of Grace
and Salvation was established with us
through the <hi>bloody Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Iesus
Christ,</hi> and is renew'd and confirm'd
by our <hi>feasting before God</hi> on this <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. This <hi>Blood</hi> was shed for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Sins,</hi> and by our worthy
drinking of it, we receive an Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<hi>That our Sins and our Iniquities
God will remember no more,</hi> Hebrews
8. 12.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>God,</hi> by admitting us to his <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
to feast on this <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> owns us as
Members of his proper <hi>Family;</hi> and
will accordingly provide for us and
protect us. <hi>He will be to us a God, and
we shall be to him a People,</hi> Hebrews
8. 10.</p>
            <p>3. The Promise of the <hi>Covenant</hi> was
this,<note place="margin">Hebrews 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>I will put my Laws</hi>
(saith God) <hi>into their,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93871:35"/>
Minds, and write them in their Hearts:
God</hi> will give the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi>
and the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Grace;</hi> not only <hi>teach</hi>
us, but incline our Hearts to <hi>love</hi> and
<hi>delight</hi> in his Laws. Here is <hi>Life</hi> and
strength of Grace promised, but all
through <hi>Iesus Christ; he is the bread of
God which giveth Life unto the World;
and this bread is his Flesh which he gave
for the Life of the World, and he that
eateth this bread shall never hunger nor
die,</hi> John 6. 33. 51. 35.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Bond</hi> of <hi>Vnion</hi> betwixt <hi>Christ</hi>
our <hi>Head,</hi> and us his <hi>Members,</hi> is
hereby strengthned. <hi>He</hi> (saith he)
<hi>that eateth my Flesh and drinketh my
Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him,</hi>
Joh. 6. 56.</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
preserved and maintain'd; by this
we declare, that <hi>we being many are one
Bread and one Body; for we are all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of that one Bread,</hi> 1 Corinth.
10. 17.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Our</hi> Faith <hi>of the</hi> Resurrection <hi>is
hereby confirm'd;</hi> Whoso eateth my
Flesh (<hi>saith Christ</hi>) and drinketh my
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93871:35"/>
Blood, hath eternal Life, and I will raise
him up at the last day, <hi>John</hi> 6. 54.</p>
            <p>So many and inestimable are the
<hi>Benefits</hi> of the <hi>New Testament</hi> in
<hi>Christ's Blood</hi> by this <hi>Sacrament</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
unto every worthy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant.</p>

the Lord's Body, is to put a sufficient
Difference between this <hi>Divine Feast</hi>
and other <hi>common</hi> Feasts, both in our
<hi>Iudgment, Affection,</hi> and <hi>Behaviour.</hi>
How we are to judge of it, hath been
already shewn. We are next to see
what <hi>Affections</hi> it calls for.</p>
            <p>We come not here to feast with
<hi>Men</hi> only, but with <hi>God;</hi> nor to feed
our <hi>Bodies</hi> with a little <hi>Bread</hi> and
<hi>Wine,</hi> but our <hi>Souls</hi> on the <hi>Body</hi> and
<hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> Let us then enquire,</p>
            <p>1. Are we deeply sensible of our
spiritual Wants, and our great need
of this divine Food? <hi>Except we eat the
Flesh and drink the Blood of the Son of
Man, we have no Life in us,</hi> John
6. 53.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:93871:36"/>
2. Are we highly sensible of <hi>God</hi>'s
wonderful Goodness in providing so
graciously for our Wants? <hi>God so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the World, that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Son, that whosoever bel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

him should not perish, but have everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Life. All things</hi> (saith he) <hi>are now
ready, come ye to the Marriage.</hi> John
3. 16. Mat. 22. 4.</p>
            <p>3. Do we verily believe, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
cometh preparedly shall be
kindly welcome? <hi>Him that cometh to
me</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>I will in no wise cast
out,</hi> John 6. 37.</p>
            <p>4. Have we longing Appetites and
ardent Desires to this food of our
Souls? <hi>Blessed are they that hunger and
thirst after Righteousness, for they shall
be filled,</hi> Matt. 5. 6.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Do we empty our Souls of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and worldly Thoughts and Cares
and Desires?</hi> Labour not for the Meat
which perisheth, but for that Meat which
endureth unto everlasting Life, which
the Son of Man shall give unto you, for
him hath God the Father sealed. <hi>John</hi>
6. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:93871:37"/>
6. Are we not ready to lay hold
on vain Excuses borrow'd from our
worldly Businesses of Pleasures? <hi>None
of those Men</hi> (saith God) <hi>shall taste of
my Supper,</hi> Luke 14. 24.</p>
            <p>7. Do we labour to put our selves
into a fit habit and posture of Soul for
so divine a Feast? He that came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his <hi>Wedding-garment was bound
hand and foot, and cast into outer Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
Matt. 22. 13.</p>
            <p>Now therefore we are as it were to
new trim up all our Graces, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
with them before God in their
greatest Brightness, having our Souls
adorned, and adorning the <hi>Gospel</hi> of
<hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Let the Consideration of the
Odiousness of Sin to God, which he
would not pardon without the <hi>Death</hi>
of his <hi>only begotten Son,</hi> and of the
astonishing Love of <hi>God</hi> to Sinners
Souls, so that he would send his Son
to die rather than they should perish,
give Life to our <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Let this Consideration, that
<hi>Christ</hi> hath not only left us the <hi>History</hi>

of his Life, Death, and Resurrection,

<hi>festival</hi> Commemoration of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which hath been constantly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in his <hi>Church</hi> in all Ages,
wherein what by the <hi>Word</hi> is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to our <hi>Ears</hi> is lively represented to

evidently set forth crucified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 1.</note> set our Faith on work.</p>
            <p>3. Let the wonderful <hi>Love</hi> of the
<hi>Father</hi> in giving his <hi>only Son,</hi> of the
<hi>Son</hi> in shedding his precious <hi>Blood</hi> for
us ungodly <hi>Sinners,</hi> rebellious <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>

Hearts with the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Iesus

            </p>

and nourish our <hi>Hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Let the numerous Benefits of
<hi>Christ</hi>'s Death, thus signally exhibited
and assured unto us, fill our Hearts
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93871:38"/>
with <hi>Thankfulness,</hi> remembring that
this <hi>Sacrament</hi> is the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> a
thankful Commemoration of <hi>Christ,</hi>
and this Cup the <hi>Cup of Blessing,</hi> Praise,
or Thanksgiving.</p>
            <p>6. Let our Deliverance from the
Vassalage of Sin and Torments of Hell,
and our new Title to the Kingdom of
Heaven,<note place="margin">Ps. 116. 3.</note> fill our Hearts with
spiritual Joy. Let us take the
<hi>Cup of S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Name of the Lord, in joyful Songs and
Hymns of Praise.</p>
            <p>7. As <hi>God,</hi> whom we have so often
provoked to Wrath and Indignation,
doth graciously condescend in <hi>Christ
Iesus</hi> to renew his Covenant of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

            <head>CHAP. VIII. How we are to behave our selves at this
Sacrament.</head>
            <p>¶<hi>AS</hi> thou goest to the Church, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
all the way, or discourse
with thy Company of the Goodness of
God in inviting poor Sinners to his own
Table: Say thus with thy self.</p>
            <p>O my sinful Soul, taste and see that
the <hi>Lord</hi> is good! O what a Love and
Goodness is this! that such wicked
Prodigals as we, who have so long
abused all the good Gifts which our
heavenly <hi>Father</hi> hath bestowed upon
us, in a vain, foolish, and sinful way
of living, should have such Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
as these to return to our
offended <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Father!</hi> I will go
unto him, and say, <hi>Father,</hi> I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
against Heaven and before thee,
and am not worthy to be called thy
Son, or to appear and feed amongst
thy Children. <hi>O Lord,</hi> not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what thou hast made me, a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93871:40"/>
Creature, to know, love, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
thee my great and good <hi>God,</hi> I
have used my self like a Beast, and
have fed with Greediness and Delight
amongst swinish Sinners, upon empty
Husks and Vanities. O blessed be thy
Name, who hast brought me to my
self again, to see, and lament, and hate
my past Folly. I am now in all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
coming to feast my Soul with
thee in thy House, where there is
ever bread enough and to spare, even
the Bread of Life, my ever blessed
JESUS. O send out thy Light and
thy Truth! let them lead me, let them
bring me unto thy holy Hill and to
thy Tabernacles; then will I go unto
the <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> unto <hi>God</hi> my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Joy, and with all my Soul
will I praise thee <hi>O God, my God.</hi> I will
enter into thy Gates with Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and into thy Courts with
Praise, I will be thankful unto thee and
bless thy Name: For the <hi>Lord</hi> is good,
his Mercy is everlasting, and his
Truth endureth to all Generations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:93871:40"/>
¶Entring into the Church, have
such Thoughts as these before the Service
begin.</p>
            <p>O how dreadful is this place!
This is no other but the House of
<hi>God,</hi> and the Gate of Heaven. Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>O God,</hi> becometh thine House
for ever. One day in thy House is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than a thousand. Blessed is the man
whom thou choosest and causest to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
unto thee, that he may dwell
in thy Courts. I come, <hi>O Lord,</hi> into
thy House in the multitude of thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and in thy Fear will I worship
thee in thy holy Temple. I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Habitation of thy House,
and the place where thine honour
dwelleth. O let me be abundantly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with the Fatness of thy House,
and make me drink of the River of thy
Pleasures.</p>
            <p>¶Ioyn devoutly with the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Prayers of the Church, and
attend diligently to <hi>God's Word</hi> read
and preached. And when the <hi>Minister</hi>
is going to the Table, <hi>say thus:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:93871:41"/>
Blessed be God for affording us Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and Teachers: O how beautiful
are the Feet of them that preach the
Gospel of Peace, and bring glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of good things! O Lord bless
and assist this thy Servant in this
holy Ministration. Thou, O <hi>Lord,</hi> art
our Shepherd, we can want nothing;
thou preparest a Table before us, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Goodness and Mercy shall follow
us all the days of our Life.</p>
            <p>¶When the Bread and Wine are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon the Table, and thou art preparing
thine Offering, say thus:</p>
            <p>O gracious Lord, what a miracle
of Divine Love do we here behold!
We have sinned against thee, and
yet thou callest not upon us for Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and burnt Offerings, but hast pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
a Body for thy eternal Son, that
he in that might do thy Will, live
among us, and die a Sacrifice for us,
and here feed us on that Sacrifice of
himself to eternal Life. I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
deserved to be at this time in
Hell amongst the Devils, and dost
thou yet vouchsafe to feast me at thy
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93871:41"/>
Table, amongst thy Children, on the
<hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of thy dearest <hi>Son?</hi>
O astonishing Love! Let this thy love,
O <hi>God,</hi> pierce my Heart, and do thou,
O blessed JESUS, dwell therein for
ever.</p>
            <p>The Earth is thine, O Lord, and
the fullness thereof. What can I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unto thee for all thine inestimable
Benefits. My Goodness extendeth
not unto thee, but to the Saints that
are in the Earth. Thou, O <hi>God</hi> of thy
Goodness, hast prepared for the poor.
Accept, I beseech thee, of my poor
Mite, receive this my humble Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of thy Bounty to me
poor Sinner, whereby I confess and
declare my self and all that I have, to
be at thy Command and Service, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of me for <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> his sake.</p>
            <p>¶When the Exhortation is read,
mind it well, and observe whether you
come so duely prepared as is therein said
you ought to be. <hi>Then say,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Search me, O <hi>God,</hi> and know my
heart; try me and know my thoughts,
and see if there be any wicked way in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93871:42"/>
me, and lead me in the way everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Who can understand his Errors?
Cleanse thou me from my secret
Faults.</p>
            <p>¶When you are bid to draw near,
do so, both with Body and Soul, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</p>
            <p>My Heart is ready, O <hi>God,</hi> my Heart
is ready; I will wash my hands in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
and so will I compass thine
<hi>Altar,</hi> O <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come, O my <hi>God</hi> I come, for whom
have I in Heaven but thee, and there
is none upon Earth that I desire besides
thee. O hide not thy comfortable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
from me.</p>
            <p>¶Then humbly joyn in the Confession
of Sins, saying after the Minister, and
receive in the humblest Posture the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi>
as from <hi>Christ</hi> himself interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for you at <hi>God's right hand</hi> and
blessing you. Draw Comfort from the
<hi>Sentences</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> read unto you,
and lift up your Hearts with joyful Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
unto God, as you are called upon to
do, heartily joyning in the following De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:93871:42"/>
When the Minister consecrateth the
Elements, fix your Eye upon the whole
Action, and your Heart upon your cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
<hi>Jesus,</hi> considering with what Pains
and Tortures on the Cross he finished
your Redemption.</p>
            <p>When the Minister draweth near you
with the Bread, say;</p>
            <p>Create in me a clean Heart, O God,
and renew a right Spirit within me.</p>
            <p>¶When you take the Bread, say;</p>
            <p>With all Humility and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of heart I take this sacred Pledge
of thy Love, O dearest <hi>Saviour.</hi> Be it
according to thy Word, with thy cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Body feed my Soul to Life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p>¶Then eating the Bread, say;</p>
            <p>O <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> one
<hi>God blessed for ever,</hi> I am wholly thine
and not my own; reign in me, rule
over me, O blessed <hi>Iesus,</hi> now and for
ever. By thee I live, through thee
let me grow in Grace and Goodness.
Keep me from hungring any more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sin and Vanity. <hi>Lord,</hi> evermore
give me this Bread till thou bring me
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93871:43"/>
to thy eternal Supper in thy Kingdom
of Glory.</p>
            <p>¶Receiving the Cup, say,</p>
            <p>I will receive the Cup of Salvation,
and call upon the Name of the
Lord.</p>
            <p>¶Having drunk of it, say,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Soul was a-thirst for the living
God;</hi> let thy Blood, O holy <hi>Lamb</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> cleanse me and this whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
from all Sin. Let thy <hi>holy
Spirit</hi> be in us a Well of living Water
springing up into everlasting Life. I
have confessed my Sin, and thou art
faithful and just to forgive my Sin, and
to cleanse me from all Unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Take now, my blessed <hi>Lord,</hi> a
full and everlasting possession of thy
dear Purchase. As I believe we have
Redemption through thy <hi>Blood,</hi> even
the Forgiveness of Sins; so do I here
deny my self, and resolve by thy As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
to follow thee even unto
Death. And, O thou <hi>God</hi> of Peace,
that brought'st again from the dead
our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> that great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
of the Sheep, through the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93871:43"/>
Blood of the everlasting Covenant,
feed, govern, and protect thy whole
Flock the Universal <hi>Church,</hi> make us
perfect in every good Work to do thy
Will, working in us that which is
well-pleasing in thy Sight, through
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to whom be Glory for
ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶During the time of the <hi>Distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
if no <hi>Psalm</hi> be sung, (or, if a
<hi>Psalm</hi> be sung, then, during the <hi>Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
or at any other vacant times) employ
your selves in such Meditations as these
following.</p>
            <p>O how wonderful is the Love of
<hi>God!</hi> How doth the <hi>Lord</hi> triumph in
his Goodness, and rejoyce in his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy!
We that have a thousand times
over deserved to be weeping, and
wailing, and gnashing of Teeth in
everlasting Fire, are here admitted to
feast and rejoyce at the <hi>Table</hi> of the
<hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O astonishing Love of the blessed
<hi>Iesus!</hi> O abominable Sins of us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Wretches! Was thy holy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
my dearest <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> thus
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93871:44"/>
broken and torn, they precious Blood
thus shed and poured out for our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Souls? And shall we not abhor
those cursed Sins of ours, and with all
due Hatred and Indignation cast them
off for ever? Shall we not renounce all
Kindness to our beastly Lusts, loath
our selves for our Iniquities, and give
our selves entirely to thy Service
(which is perfect Freedom) for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more?</p>
            <p>O ravishing Love, that moved the
eternal <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to rescue us from
everlasting Torments, by the sharpest
Pains and Tortures of his spotless Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the bitterest Agonies of his
purest Soul! That moved the blessed
and only Potentate, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi>
and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> to condescend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Sufferings, Shame, and Death, and
to be made a Curse for us, that we
might be made the Righteousness of
<hi>God</hi> in him?</p>
            <p>Wast thou, O blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
for our sake to be despised and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
of men, to become a Man of
Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93871:44"/>
and have we so long hid, as it were,
our Faces from thee? Hast thou been
despised, and yet have not we esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee? Surely thou hast born ou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Griefs, and carried our Sorrows; thou
wast wounded for our Transgressions,
and bruised for our Iniquities; the
Chastisement of our Peace was upon
thee, and with thy Stripes we are
healed. All we, like Sheep, have
gone astray, we have turned every
one to his own way, and the <hi>Lord</hi>
hath laid on thee the Iniquity of us all.
Thou wast oppressed and afflicted,
yet did'st thou not open thy Mouth;
thou wast brought as a Lamb dumb to
the Slaughter; thou wast cut off out
of the Land of the Living; for the
Transgression of thy People wast thou
stricken.</p>
            <p>O holy <hi>Iesus,</hi> I do most stedfastly
believe, that thou art the Lamb of
<hi>God</hi> that takest away the Sins of the
World; that thou hast in thine own
Body born our Sins upon the Tree;
and that in the Body of thy Flesh,
through Death, thou hast reconciled
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93871:45"/>
us who were Enemies, to present us
holy and unblameable in <hi>God's</hi> sight.
Thou wast not ashamed to call us Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
and because the Children are
Partakers of Flesh and Blood, thou <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
thy self tookest part of the same,
and through Death hast destroy'd him
that had the power of Death, the
Devil.</p>
            <p>We have not an High-priest which
cannot be touch'd with a feeling of
our Infirmities, but was in all Points
tempted as we are, yet without Sin.
Therefore may we come boldly unto
the Throne of Grace, that we may
obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help
in time of need. Thou, O blessed <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
being made perfect through Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
art become the Author of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
unto all that obey thee.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Lord,</hi> I poor Sinner fly for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
to lay hold on the Hope now
set before us. Thou art able to save
them to the uttermost that come unto
<hi>God</hi> by thee, seeing thou ever livest
to make Intercession for us. By thine
own Blood hast thou entered in once
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93871:45"/>
into the holy place, having obtained
eternal Redemption, for us. Thou art
entered into Heaven it self now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the Presence of <hi>God</hi> for us.
Thou art our <hi>Advocate</hi> with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
the <hi>Propitiation</hi> for our Sins, and
we look for thee to appear the second
time without Sin unto Salvation.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Lord,</hi> seeing thou hast given us
Boldness to enter into the holiest
by the Blood of <hi>Iesus,</hi> by a new and
living way which he hath consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for us through the Vail, that is
to say, his Flesh: and having such an
High-priest over thine House, I here
draw near with a true Heart, in full
Assurance of Faith, having my Heart
sprinkled from an evil Conscience,
and resolving by thy Grace to hold fast
the Profession of my Faith without
wavering.</p>
            <p>I do here, O <hi>Lord,</hi> in all Humility,
offer up my self to be a living Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
holy and acceptable unto thee
in vertue of the Sacrifice of thy dear
<hi>Son,</hi> desiring to glorifie thee with
my Body and Spirit which are thine.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93871:46"/>
Confirm, I beseech thee, now unto
my Soul, and to all here present, the
Covenant sealed in his Blood. Enable
us to continue stedfast therein for

               </gap>ver.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord,</hi> make all that profess thy
Name zealous of good Works, unite
us in the same Faith and Love, and
let us keep the Unity of the Spirit in
the Bond of Peace. Let us never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the assembling of our selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
to celebrate the Memorial of
thy loving-Kindness, and shew thy
Death till thou come. Put thy Laws
into our Hearts, and write them in
our Minds, and enable us to cleanse
our selves from all filthiness of Flesh
and Spirit, and to perfect Holiness in
the fear of <hi>God.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. IX. The pretended Reasons for neglecting
this Sacrament briefly answered.</head>
            <p>NO good man will seek an Excuse,
no wicked man can find one,
for not endeavouring to do his Duty;
and a Duty it is <hi>to do this in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of Christ.</hi> The Benefits are such
as cannot be slighted by a wise man,
the Necessity is such as cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
with by any man. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
men are too apt to deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out of their Duty and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
at once by something that they
call Reason, and where they have no
good Excuse are ready to make a bad
one; in charity to their Souls, their
Vanity herein is to be shew'n them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. We eat the Flesh and drink
the Blood of Christ spiritually by Faith
out of this Sacrament; what need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can there be of this Sacrament, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therein we are but to do the same?</p>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is all one as to say, We
do some part of our Duty, what need
is therefore of doing the rest? Or,
We believe in <hi>Christ,</hi> what need i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
there to obey his Commandments?
It is enough to a <hi>Christian,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi>

            <p>That <hi>Faith</hi> whereby we eat the
<hi>Flesh</hi> and drink the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually,
implieth Obedience to the
<hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> and it is an especial
Command of the <hi>Gospel</hi> to <hi>do this.</hi>
He then that neglects the doing of
this, neglects to obey the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and
therefore falsly pretends that he <hi>eats</hi>
and <hi>drinks spiritually</hi> the <hi>Flesh</hi> and
<hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> Whatever therefore
the Christian doth more in this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
than out of it, the willful Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecter

Poison, or choak himself, or surfeit

receiving is not so: Will you
prevent an uncertain danger of Death,
by killing your self?</p>
            <p>If a man receive without Faith and
Repentance, he receiveth Damnation;
and so he doth if he do not believe
and repent, tho' he receive not this
<hi>Sacrament.</hi> What better is he then
for not receiving it? He perisheth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, receiving or not receiving
it.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Communicant</hi> that being a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Believer comes to the <hi>Lord's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
without due Preparation and suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Affections, may receive thereby
<hi>Iudgment,</hi> (so the Word translated
<hi>Damnation</hi> may be englished) that is
some <hi>Chastisement,</hi> such as <hi>Weakness,
Sickness,</hi> or <hi>Death, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 30. and
<hi>he is thus chastened, that he may not be
condemned,</hi> v. 32. But even this may
be prevented by <hi>judging our selves,</hi> or
duely examining our selves, <hi>v.</hi> 31. And
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93871:48"/>
now which is safer, to judge our selves
and eat, or to neglect our Duty and
perish?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. But I am afraid I am unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
and therefore dare not come to this
Sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> In a strict sense, we are all
unworthy, even so much as to eat or
live, being Sinners, and deserving
Damnation.</p>
            <p>In another sense, he is <hi>unworthy</hi> that
is ignorant, an Unbeliever, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or no good <hi>Christian,</hi> and must not
come. But say,</p>
            <p>Are you a <hi>sincere Christian,</hi> or a <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
Hypocrite?</hi> If the former,
prepare your self and come; if the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
be ashamed of it and repent, for
otherwise you perish.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. I doubt of my Sincerity, and
he that doubteth is damned if he eateth,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To do a thing, doubting that
it is an unlawful thing or a Sin, is that
which deserveth Damnation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that Text. But you cannot
fear that the receiving of this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:93871:49"/>
is a Sin, it being a necessary Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
That which you doubt of is your
own Sincerity. If you be indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincere,
that is, a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> and a
<hi>Dissembler,</hi> you are not to receive it:
if you be sincere you may, there can
be no doubt of this. But you doubt
whether you be a <hi>sincere Christian.</hi> And
if this Doubt be so prevalent that you
rather judge you are not, I shall not
advise you to come to this Sacrament
till you be better satisfied of your Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.
But then consider,</p>
            <p>Will you contentedly rest in this
doubtful Condition? Can you be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
in your Mind, till you find cause
to hope you are a <hi>Christian,</hi> and shall
be saved? If you find no cause to hope
this, why should you not forbear all
other Christian Duties as well as
this?</p>
            <p>Why do you not lay open your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
freely and impartially to your
spiritual Guide, and take his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of your Sincerity? If you use
not this or any other means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your self, but rest contentedly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93871:49"/>
your Doubts, and plead them as
an Excuse for not doing your Duty,
you are certainly no <hi>sincere</hi> Christian.</p>
            <p>But if you are troubled that you
know your self no better, and are
above all things desirous to be a good
Christian, and endeavour by all means
to be so, and to know that you are so,
and give your self no rest, but mourn,
and pray, and examine your self, and
crave Advice, and set your self in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
about the Duties of <hi>Christianity,</hi>
these are good signs of <hi>Sincerity;</hi> and
you ought to receive this <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
and wait upon <hi>God</hi> for a farther Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. I fear I have not a saving
Faith, I have no Assurance of my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Though such <hi>Assurance</hi> may
be had, yet I verily think, that the
far greater number of <hi>good Christians</hi>
want it, and are but <hi>working out their
Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> To
labour after it is our <hi>Duty,</hi> to have it
is our great <hi>Comfort,</hi> but no <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:93871:50"/>
Do you believe the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that he
that believeth and is baptized shall be
saved? that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of all them that, repenting of their
Sins, trust in his Merits, and live in
Obedience to his Government and
Laws?</p>
            <p>Do you accordingly consent to be
saved by him upon these terms; and
striving against Sin, earnestly desire
and endeavour to live according to
his <hi>Gospel,</hi> and trust to him for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
This is <hi>saving Faith,</hi> whether
you have full <hi>Assurance</hi> or no, and
you are to receive this <hi>Sacrament</hi> for
the strengthning of your Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 6. Faith worketh by Love, <hi>Gal.</hi>
and I fear I do not love <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Are you convinced, that <hi>God</hi>
is the chief good, and ought to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
above all things? And do you so
value him above all things?</p>
            <p>Are you thereupon resolved to do
any thing, to part with any thing,
to suffer any thing, thereby to honour
him and enjoy his Love?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:93871:50"/>
Do you thus practice, and can you
deny your self and your own Will to
do his? This is Love, that you keep
his Commandments. And though

if you have this <hi>prizing</hi> and <hi>over-ruling</hi>
Love, that you do prefer his Will and
his Favour above other things, you
are to use this <hi>Sacrament</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Can you <hi>hate</hi> them and <hi>avoid</hi>
them; and do you in Obedienee to
<hi>God,</hi> and of Love to him, shun all
Temptations, and watch against them?
If so, though your Eyes be dry, <hi>God</hi>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> So you shall whilst you live,
more or less. But do you not feed and
cherish them? Do not you delight
in them, nor obey and fulfill them?
Do you, on the contrary, check and

restrain them, and use all the means
of subduing and mortifying them? If
you find it thus, come to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

and do your Duty and be saved.
If you be not in charity, how dare
you pray for the Forgiveness of your

Plead not Sin as an Excuse for

            <p>Would not the frequent Celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <head>CHAP. X. The Stumbling-blocks cast in our way,
removed.</head>
            <p>WE may well say here, as <hi>Christ</hi>
said in another Case, Some
there be who will neither enter into
the <hi>Church</hi> to receive this <hi>Sacrament</hi>
themselves, nor suffer those to enter
in that would, but are very busie in
laying such stumbling-blocks in their
way as they are not able to remove.
So that either they keep away from
this blessed <hi>Sacrament</hi> to their great
hurt, or struggle through their doubts
and scruples with much Galling and
Uneasiness, to their great disquiet. In
pity therefore to the weak, these also
ought to be removed.</p>
            <p>1. Some have been made to think it
unlawful to receive the Sacrament where
it is administred with a prescribed form of
Words.</p>
            <p>Not to prove here the <hi>Lawfulness</hi>
and <hi>Vsefulness</hi> too of <hi>set</hi> and <hi>prescribed</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:93871:54"/>
Forms of Prayers in the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>God,</hi> it will be sufficient, in
reference to this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thus much.</p>
            <p>1. That when our blessed <hi>Iesus</hi>
commanded this to be done in <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him, he neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
nor forbad it to be done by a
<hi>set</hi> or <hi>prescribed</hi> Form: it is therefore
certainly left to the Discretion and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of the <hi>Church</hi> to consider which is
most expedient and conducing to Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
a <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>no Form;</hi> and to
act accordingly. The thing <hi>must</hi> be
done, and <hi>with</hi> a prescribed Form or
<hi>without</hi> one, it must be done. <hi>Christ</hi>
hath not told us which way, and who
shall determine the matter but they
to whom he hath committed the
ordering of all such things in the

            </p>
            <p>2. If in any part of the publick

it must be in this. 'Tis the Feast

the best of them) for the most part
<hi>unintelligible</hi> to the greater number of
<hi>Communicants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, seeing, to the great Grief of
all good <hi>Christians,</hi> the Devil and his
Instruments have ever been very busie
to <hi>deform</hi> this holy Ordinance, and to
turn this <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Union</hi> into a
bone of <hi>Contention;</hi> it well becometh
the <hi>Church</hi> to use all care, that nothing
be said or done in this Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but what is according to <hi>Truth</hi>
and <hi>Godliness.</hi> And certainly it would
be no good sign of such Care, to
leave every <hi>Minister</hi> to his own
Discretion, to use his own <hi>affected,</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:93871:55"/>
and perhaps <hi>erroneous,</hi> Way and
Words.</p>
            <p>II. Others are made afraid to <hi>kneel</hi> in
receiving this Sacrament, because th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Apostles at the first Institution did not so <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
and because the Papists doing so <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
the Bread and Wine.</p>
            <p>If the Apostles <hi>kneeled</hi> not, yet they
neither <hi>sate</hi> nor <hi>stood.</hi> And if they
used a <hi>Supper-gesture,</hi> it was on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>Passover</hi> whereat this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
was instituted. <hi>Christ</hi> hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that <hi>this be done,</hi> that is, that
<hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> be <hi>blessed</hi> and <hi>broken</hi>
and <hi>distributed, taken, eaten,</hi> and <hi>drank
in Remembrance of him;</hi> but he hath
not commanded any <hi>Gesture,</hi> nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
forbidden any. This therefore
also must be left to the Prudence of
the <hi>Church,</hi> as all other Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this sacred Action, till it can be
shewn that the bare <hi>Example</hi> of the
<hi>Apostles</hi> did oblige us perpetually to
imitate it; which here cannot be
shewn: and therefore to say it did, is
to <hi>add</hi> to the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and to lay
a Snare before Mens Consciences; it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93871:56"/>
being hard, for <hi>most</hi> men at least, to
give a reason, why their Example in
this Circumstance of <hi>Gesture,</hi> should
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore oblige us than in others of <hi>Time,
Place, Number,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kneeling</hi> is a Gesture of <hi>Humility,</hi>
and that better becometh vile Sinners
offering their <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praises</hi> at
the Throne of Grace in the Vertue of
the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> than any Posture
of <hi>Familiarity,</hi> such as <hi>sitting</hi> especially
is. However, seeing, it is enjoyned,
were it less convenient, yet he hath
certainly no very great Love or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
to this divine Food, who will
rather want it than receive it on his
<hi>Knees,</hi> and chooseth rather to disobey
<hi>Christ</hi> in not doing <hi>this</hi> at all, than
obey the <hi>Church</hi> in doing it <hi>thus,</hi>
when there is no Divine Law to the
contrary.</p>
            <p>And if the <hi>Papists</hi> do <hi>kneel</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the <hi>Elements,</hi> may not we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>kneel</hi> to worship <hi>Christ?</hi> The
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
against worshipping the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
and if she knew you did
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93871:56"/>
so, would cast you forth as <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. But we must thus communicat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
with Sinners in a mix'd Congregation
and we are forbidden so much as to eat
with such, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. and commanded
to withdraw from every Brother that
walketh disorderly, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 6. and to
come out from among them and be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
            <p>You must come out from <hi>Heathens,</hi>
and be separate from <hi>Idolaters,</hi> such as
were those <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 14,
15, 16. But none but <hi>baptized</hi> Persons
and <hi>Professors</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the <hi>Lord's Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You must also withdraw your selves
from <hi>disorderly Walkers,</hi> as you are
commanded, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 6. not famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
to converse them, so as to partake
with them, or countenance them in
their Wickedness or <hi>Idleness;</hi> but set
a note of Disgrace upon them by
shunning their Company and Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to make them, if possible, <hi>ashamed</hi>
of themselves. Yet must we not look
upon them as Enemies, but admonish
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93871:57"/>
them as Brethren, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. All this
plainly relates to our <hi>ordinary Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
with such men, and nothing is

but are unruly and will not be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
(1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 14.) and such as
cause. <hi>Divisions</hi> and <hi>Offences</hi> contrary
to the Doctrine that they have learnt,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17.</p>
            <p>In the same sense we must not <hi>eat,</hi>
that is, <hi>familiarly converse</hi> with wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. For that it
is <hi>ordinary Conversation</hi> that is there
meant seems plain, because 'tis such a
keeping Company with them, as the
<hi>Apostle</hi> allows them with <hi>Heathens</hi> and
<hi>Idolaters, v.</hi> 10. which cannot be at the
<hi>Lord's Table</hi> whither they are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
but only Professors of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:93871:57"/>
Though we are to withdraw from
such wicked and disorderly Persons,
so far as not to countenance them, but
endeavour to make them ashamed o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
their Sins; yet must we

and as becometh <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>

And this you do not, if you stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

to this Sacrament?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No, not if they be <hi>notorious,</hi>
and have not declared their <hi>Repentance.</hi>
They ought to be <hi>admonished,</hi> and if
stubborn, <hi>cast</hi> out of the <hi>Church</hi> by
those to whom it belongs to do it.
Leave that to your <hi>Governours,</hi> and do
you the Duty of <hi>private Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Remember <hi>Charity</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no evil,<note place="margin">1 Cor 13. 5. 7.</note> but believeth

judge any one wicked.</p>
            <p>Take heed also of spiritual Pride in

            <p>See that you count not any man a
wicked man only because he is not of
your <hi>Opinion,</hi> or because he is not of
your <hi>Party,</hi> or dares not <hi>separate</hi> from
the <hi>Church</hi> as you do, or <hi>censure</hi> other
men as boldly as you do, or have as
high an Opinion of his own <hi>Godliness</hi>
as you have: it is no good sign of that
<hi>Purity</hi> which some pretend to, that
they scruple at a <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Ceremony,</hi>
but not at being <hi>drunk,</hi> or being <hi>unjust</hi>

<hi>censuring</hi> the whole <hi>Church;</hi>
or, that they dare not come to the
<hi>Lord's Table</hi> with wicked men, but
dare go to the <hi>Ale-house</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>See that you have discharged a good
Conscience towards your Brethren, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you abandon their Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:93871:58"/>
Have you friendly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

               </gap>
admonished them again before two or
three Witnesses? If this prevail not,
have you told the <hi>Minister</hi> and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his help to reform these Sinners?
If he cannot reclaim them, have you
endeavour'd to have them cast out of
the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Excommunication?</hi> If
you have not done this, where's your
<hi>Charity</hi> to your Brother? where's
your <hi>Obedience to God?</hi> Where's your
<hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Church's Purity?</hi> You have
more cause to be afraid of your own
Sins, than of other mens: nay, you
become by this neglect, Partakers of
other mens Sins, which you pretend
to be the very thing you are so greatly
afraid of.</p>
            <p>Obj. You say, perhaps, you have done
all this, and yet these Sinners are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
but admitted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:93871:59"/>
If it be so, it is not well; yet it is
not your Fault that they are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but it is your Fault if you will
not do your Duty because other men
will not do theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But I shall so profess Communion
with the wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> By the course you have taken
you have done what was your Duty,
to avoid their Communion. You come
not to communicate with the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but with sincere Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But by so doing I shall countenance
them, and seem to own them as good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> By what you have done to
amend them, and by what you may
still do in continuing to reprove them,
you prevent that danger.</p>
            <p>There were very wicked Persons
in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> such as the
Apostle orders to be cast out and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to <hi>Sitan;</hi> yea at the <hi>Sacrament</hi>
there were <hi>Divisions</hi> and <hi>Factions,</hi> and
some were <hi>drunk.</hi> These things St.
<hi>Paul</hi> reproves them for; but you no
where hear him bid others abstain
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93871:59"/>
from the <hi>Sacrament</hi> because of such
men, but he bids them examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and eat.</p>
            <p>IV. But you say; you dare not receive
this Sacrament at the hand of a wicked
Minister, and you take yours to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
such.</p>
            <p>It is not well if he be such indeed;
and if he be openly such and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
some others are to blame as
well as he. Have you admonished
him? Have you again admonish'd
him? If that would not do, have
you complained of him, and used all
the means in your power to have him
either reformed or turn'd out? If this
be not done, you have not done your
Duty either to him, or your own
Soul, or the Church of God. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
not then of his Wickedness, but
your own.</p>
            <p>Have you used all these means in
vain to reform or remove him?
Then if you can conveniently you
may remove to some place where
you have a better. If you cannot,
you are to be content, and receive
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93871:60"/>
the Food of your Soul from a dirty
hand, rather than want it. You
would not refuse the King's Pardon
though a Drunkard or a Swearer
brought it you. This Meat nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not by vertue of the hand of him
that ministreth it unto you, but by the
Blessing of God that giveth it. Take
it as from the hand of <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and have Faith in him, and when
you have done what legally you can
to get a good Minister, you shall
fare no worse for a bad one in the
end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But though I can find no great
Fault otherwise with the Minister, yet
this I like not, that he admits scandalous
Sinners to the Communion.</p>
            <p>He is indeed to charge all such to
abstain from this Sacrament till they
declare their Repentance. He is not
to admit such, if he know them, till
they have declared their Repentance,
and made such Satisfaction as the
Church requireth. Do you certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know then that he doth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
and have you acquainted him
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93871:60"/>
who they are, and satisfied him that
they are so indeed? Usually such men
keep most out of his way, and he is
least acquainted with them, and hath
at most but an uncertain Report of
their Vices; and they that bring him
this Report, refuse to prove the Truth
of it; and when he enquires of the
Persons themselves they deny it, and
he dare not deny them the Priviledges
of <hi>Christians,</hi> till he have better
grounds to go upon. Or if you are
sure the Minister was not ignorant of
their wicked Life, are you sure also,
that they have not, before they were
admitted, given him all the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he could in reason demand in
such a case?</p>
            <p>You ought to be sure of these things
before you censure him so hardly.
And if you be sure he is guilty, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of him, after due Admonition,
and I am confident this Fault will be
amended. But if unfit Persons be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by him ignorantly, and you
know of it, and do not inform him
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93871:61"/>
better, it is your selves on whom this
Guilt will lye.</p>
            <p>The good Lord grant that we may
all more conscientiously do our
Duties in our several Stations,
that his Name may be glorified,
his Church may flourish in Truth
and Purity, and Peace and Love
may abound amongst Christians.</p>

sense.</p>
            <p>Most great and good <hi>Good,</hi> the
searcher of Hearts and trier of the
Reins, who art every where present,
and from whom no Darkness can hide
us; thou compassest my Path, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93871:63"/>
my lying down, and art acquainted
with all my ways: there is not a word
in my Tongue, nor a thought in my
Heart, but thou know'st it altogether.
My heart, O <hi>God,</hi> is deceitful above
all things, and I cannot find it out,
neither understand the errors of my
ways, nor the sincerity of my Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
without the help of thy holy <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
Help me, O my <hi>God,</hi> help me, I
beseech thee, to know my self and the
true frame and temper of my Soul;
shew thou me wherein I have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee in Thought, Word, or Deed;
grant me a true and a humbling sight
and sense of all my Sins; let not my
Ignorance blind me, nor self-love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
me, nor the common practice of
the World delude me into a false Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of my self and my own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:
but enable me, I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee, to find out all my Sins, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with all the Aggravations of
my Guilt; make me truly vile in
mine own Eyes, and heartily sorry
for all my Failings; enable me to hate
and forsake every evil way, and to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93871:64"/>
turn unto thee by an unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and a sincere Obedience to
all thy holy and good Laws; that I
may have my fruit unto Holiness, and
the end everlasting Life, through <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ</hi> my only <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour.
Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After every Question pause a while,
and impartially judge your self; and where
you think you have done any part of your
Duty, say;</p>
            <p>Blessed be my good <hi>God</hi> through <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> who by his holy <hi>Spirit</hi> hath
enabled me either to will or to do any
good thing in his Sight. O <hi>Lord,</hi> I
have done all very weakly and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
and most humbly beg thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
If I have done any thing well,
not unto me, O <hi>Lord,</hi> not unto me,
thy very unprofitable Servant, but
unto thy Name, be the Glory, through
<hi>Iesus Christ</hi> my <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where you see your sin, lay it in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
to your Heart, and say;</p>
            <p>O <hi>Lord,</hi> I have herein sinned most
grievously against Heaven and before
thee, and am not worthy to be called
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93871:64"/>
               <hi>thy</hi> Child: <hi>God</hi> be merciful to me poor
Sinner who deserve nothing but Hell
and Damnation: O grant me Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
unto Life, and enter not into
Judgment with thy Servant, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
my Sin, and lead me in the ways
of thy Commandments to eternal life,
through <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you have offended or injured any
man, note it well, and take some sit time
to confess it to him, satisfie him, and beg
his Pardon.</p>
            <p>If your Sin be publick and scandalous,
think not you have done enough till you
have publickly testified your Repentance,
as the Church shall require it of you.</p>
            <p>When you are in any doubt, resort again
to the Minister, confess your Sin freely
to him, and crave his Iudgment and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
            <p>After Examination, pray earnestly to
this effect:</p>
            <p>O most holy and just <hi>God,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
hatest all Iniquity, and will not
have Mercy on any impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
how should so vile and polluted
a Wretch as I am dare so much as to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93871:65"/>
take thy holy Name into my defiled
Mouth. O <hi>Lord,</hi> I am a most grievous
and abominable Sinner, and do alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
deserve thy fierce Wrath and
heavy Indignation. It is a very great
wonder of Mercy, that thou sufferest
me yet to live, and hast not long since
cast me into Hell, and given me the
Wages of Sin for which I have so long
labour'd. How many and foul are the
Sins which thou hast now enabled me
to discover in my self! even the least
of this black number is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
me to endless Torments; and
whither then would not such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of foulest Transgressions sink me,
if thy Mercies were not infinite, and
thy Patience truly wonderful! Yet
alas! how few are all these in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of those which have escaped my
Observation, but cannot be hid from
thine all-seeing Eye? And if I appear
so vile in my own Eyes, how loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and abominable a thing must I
needs be in thine? My Sins (O <hi>God</hi>)
are not a few but many, no small Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
but very heinous Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93871:65"/>
few of them rare with me, but
most of them very often repeated, long
continued in, and become even fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
customary, and habitual. Yea,
O <hi>Lord,</hi> with shame and confusion of
Face I confess, that I have had so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
regard to thy Will, that I have
even sinned, as I eat and drink, with
all greediness and delight. Though
thou hast never been wanting to me
in any help to enable me, or any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer
to mind me, or any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to invite me, or any Bounty or
Promise to encourage me; yet have I
made a very bad use of all thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
and by that very Patience and
Forbearance which should have led me
to Repentance, I have encouraged my
self to sin the more freely, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear, and I may justly fear, to the
great hardening of my Heart. Tho
I have lived long under the bright
Light of thy Gospel, and have thy
Word sounding in my Ears daily, and
have thy Ministers ready at hand to
instruct me; yet am I very ignorant,
and have even hated Knowledge and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93871:66"/>
despised Instruction, and cast thy
Words behind. Though I have had
many seasonable Monitors of my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and felt many motions of thy good
<hi>Spirit,</hi> and suffered many Checks from
my own Conscience; yet have I turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my Back upon thee, and done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
none of thy Commandments.
Nay, after the most solemn Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Covenants, and Vows, I have
treacherously revolted from thee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
against thee, and set at naught
all thy Goodness to me. I have a false
and treacherous Heart, which hath
never yet kept Faith with thee. I find,
to the great discomfort of my Soul,
that I have dissembled with thee, and
gone about to mock thee by feigned
Professions, counterseit Repentances,
and hypocritical Devotions. Even
now, O <hi>Lord,</hi> I feel not that deep
Humiliation, that piercing Grief, that
Anger, and Hatred, and Indignation,
against my Sins, and my self for che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
them, that I ought to have:
neither do I find in my Heart, that
servent Love of thee, that true Zeal
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93871:66"/>
for thy Honour, that hungring desire
of Righteousness and Holiness that
should be in me. And now, O my
<hi>God,</hi> what can I have to say for my
self after all this? Why should'st thou
not deal with me as I have justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and reward me with Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Wrath, Tribulation and
Anguish? If thou should'st even now
instead of accepting my Confession,
throw me, in thy just Fury, into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
Flames with the Devil and
his Angels, thou wert most just in so
doing, and even merciful in taking Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of me so late, when I had so
often and long provoked thy Wrath
before. O <hi>Lord,</hi> I have nothing to
plead in my own Excuse, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to fly unto, but that Mercy of
my good <hi>God</hi> which I have so long
abused. O hide not thy Face away
from me, but humble my Soul yet
more for my Unworthiness; break
my Heart into true Contrition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
it may yet be an acceptable Sacrifice
unto thee; give me not over unto vile
Affections, nor a reprobate Mind;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93871:67"/>
break the dominion Sin hath got over
me, for the earnest desire of my Soul
is to be thy Servant, and only thine
for ever. O gracious <hi>God,</hi> we have an
Advocate at thy right hand, even <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ</hi> the righteous, and he is the
Propitiation for our Sins; him thou
sentest into the World to be the <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
of lost Sinners, and hast promised,
that no Man shall perish or be rejected
that cometh unto thee by him: for
his sake pardon me, for his sake have
Mercy upon me; by the bitter Death
and Passion of thy dearly beloved <hi>Son</hi>
in whom thou art well pleased, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee, O holy <hi>Father,</hi> to look
graciously upon me, and blot out all
my Transgressions, and restore unto
me the Joy of thy Salvation. Cleanse
and purifie my sinnful Soul in his
Blood, receive me graciously into the
number of thine adopted Children, rid
me and set me free from the power of
Sin, and slavery of my Lusts; let thy
holy <hi>Spirit</hi> rule for ever in my Heart,
and deliver me from the Law of Sin
and Death in my Members. O speak
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93871:67"/>
Peace unto thy Servant, and let me yet
live to praise thy Name; let me not
return any more with the Dog to his
Vomit, nor with the Sow to her wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
in the Mire; but work in me a
perfect Hatred of all that thou hatest,
and a true Love to all that thou lovest.
Strengthen me by thy Grace to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
all Temptations, and to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
and grow in Faith and Love, and
all Goodness, to deny all Ungodliness
and worldly Lusts, and to live hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
righteously, soberly, and
godly in this present World; patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and comfortably looking for that
blessed Hope, and the glorious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of the great <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Iesus Christ,</hi> who gave himself
for us, that he might redeem us from
all Iniquity, and purifie unto himself
a peculiar People zealous of good
Works. In his blessed Name and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

all the Desires and Needs of my poor

               <p>O Most merciful <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Father</hi>
in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who of thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Love and Goodness to our poor
perishing Souls, hast provided for us
all things that be needful to us in our
polluted and miserable Condition,
whereinto we have brought our selves
by Sin and shew'st Mercy unto us
even when we would have no Mercy
on our selves: I am here, O <hi>Lord,</hi>
prostrate at thy Foot-stool, a vile
Wretch, that have again and again
deserved to be punished with everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Destruction from thy presence.
And will the great <hi>God</hi> of Heaven and
Earth vouchsafe to look upon such a
Dog as I? Shall the so often offended,
dishonoured, provoked <hi>Majesty</hi> of the
glorious <hi>God,</hi> condescend even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
and beseech so traiterous a Rebel
as I have been, to accept of Pardon
and Salvation? And shall I yet despise
thy loving-kindness, O my gracious
<hi>God,</hi> and neglect so great Salvation as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93871:68"/>
this that thou daily tenderst unto us in
the <hi>Son</hi> of thy <hi>Love</hi> and our blessed
<hi>Saviour Iesus Christ?</hi> When we were
gone astray from thee the <hi>God</hi> of our
Life, and were going head-long to
Destruction, thou wert pleased to open
unto us a new and living way by the
Death of thy only begotten Son. When
we lay polluted in our Filth, and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to thy pure Eyes, thou opened'st
for us, in his precious Blood, a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
for Sin and for Uncleanness. Thou
hast not disdain'd to admit me poor
Sinner into thy holy <hi>Church</hi> and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by <hi>Baptism,</hi> and into a sacred Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace and Peace with thy
self through the Blood of the blessed
Mediator. And even now after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
careless and even willful Violations
of this holy Covenant, thy Mercy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
me with fresh Offers of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
and thou hast invited me to a
Feast of Love in thy House, and at thy
own Table, and on the Body and
Blood of thine own dear <hi>Son</hi> and my
blessed <hi>Redeemer.</hi> O my most bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>God,</hi> how long have I plaid the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93871:69"/>
ed Prodigal, and pleased my self in
Sin and Vanity, and delighted in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying
thy Commandments? How
often have I set light by the Bread of
Life in the House of my <hi>Father,</hi> and
preferred the Trash of this World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it? How often have I boldly and
presumptuously, without due Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
approached unto thy holy <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi>
And how often have I return'd
thence with the same unclean Heart
and unmortified Lusts which I carried
thither? When I consider this, I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to think what Entertainment such
a monstrous Sinner as I have been,
might expect from thee. O let me not
any longer, through Impenitence and
Negligence, lose the Benefits of thy
rich Mercy in <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> For his
sake pardon all my former Neglects,
Misbehaviours, and Breaches of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with thee, and grant me now,
good <hi>God</hi> I beseech thee, such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of thy Grace as may fit me for this
sacred Ordinance. Once more most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>God,</hi> I am preparing to come at thy
gracious Call, but what can I do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93871:69"/>
thy Help? I am clogged with Sin
and Corruption, I have suffered my
Lusts to get the upper hand, and to
lead me Captive; O! shew thy
Strength in my weakness, pull down
every proud and unruly thing in me
that exalteth it self against thy holy
Spirit; strengthen me henceforward
for ever to do thy Will. Awaken and
stir up my dull Affections to love thee,
and praise thee for thy wonderful love
in redeeming us by the Sacrifice of thy
beloved <hi>Son.</hi> O <hi>Lord,</hi> I do now renew
most heartily my so often broken
Vows and Promises to be wholly
thine, O <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi>
for evermore. Accept of me, O my
<hi>God,</hi> and let not my great Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
provoke thee to reject thy poor
Servant whose Soul panteth after thee.
Enable me, amongst those that keep
Holyday in thy House, worthily to
shew forth the Death of our blessed
<hi>Iesus,</hi> even as he hath commanded us,
in a joyful and truly thankful Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of his inestimable Love, in an
absolute and entire Dedication of our

selves to his Service and Government,
in a total Reliance upon thy Mercy
through his Merits, in a cordial Love
to him our Head, to all his Members,
yea to all Mankind, and even our
Enemies for his sake. And do thou,
O merciful Father, for thy dear <hi>Son</hi>'s
sake, herein seal unto our Souls the
Pardon of all our Sins, confirm and
strengthen us in all Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and bring us by the constant and
conscientious use of this and all other
Instruments of Grace, to everlasting
Life, through <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> our <hi>Lord,</hi>
in whose holy Words I farther beg
whatever is needful for my self and
for thy whole Church. <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
