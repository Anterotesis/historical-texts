            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1655. Maſter <hi>Whiting</hi> and Maſter <hi>Spelman</hi> came to
<hi>Richard Hodgkinſonne</hi> to treat about the printing of Judge <hi>Crookes</hi> [or Sir
<hi>George Crookes</hi>] Reports; deſiring the ſaid <hi>Hodg.</hi> to tell him truly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſly,
what he would print it for by the ſheete and finde Paper? The
ſum the ſaid <hi>Hodgkinſonne</hi> then pitcht unto them was a farthing a ſheete, the
number printed being two thouſand upon each ſheete, and the Paper to bee
worth five ſhillings a Reame (<hi>viz.</hi> five ſhillings and ſix pence perfect) ſo for that time they
parted: But ſhortly after Maſter <hi>Whiting</hi> came to the ſaid <hi>Hodg.</hi> with one Maſter <hi>Bacon,</hi> and
deſired the ſaid <hi>Hod.</hi> to make ſome Proves, which he accordingly did.</p>
            <p>About the 12 of <hi>September</hi> 1656. M. <hi>Jo. Whiting,</hi> and M. <hi>Clem. Spelman</hi> went to the
Warden of the <hi>Stationers;</hi> where M. <hi>Whiting</hi> deſired to have Sir <hi>G. Crookes</hi> Reports en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
to the ſaid <hi>Hodgkinſonne,</hi> declaring unto the ſaid Warden that he had agreed with the
ſaid <hi>Hodg.</hi> for printing them, and therefore willed him to take a care that none elſe ſhould
meddle with the printing of them.</p>
            <p>The 15 day M <hi>Whiting,</hi> M. <hi>Spelman</hi> and <hi>Hodg.</hi> went to the Clerk, where M. <hi>Whiting</hi>
declared the ſame words he had done before to the Warden, but the Clerke refuſed Entrance
to the ſaid <hi>Hodg.</hi> upon pretence of a former entry to one <hi>Warren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 16 day M. <hi>Whiting,</hi> and M.<hi>Spelman</hi> went to Stationers-hall, and there at a publique
Court M. <hi>Whiting</hi> diſclamed the Entrance of <hi>Warren,</hi> as ſurreptitious, and declared his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with <hi>Hodg.</hi> as formerly he had done to the Warden and the Clerke, but no Entry was
made as deſired.</p>
            <p>The 16 day of <hi>October</hi> M. <hi>Spelman</hi> M. <hi>Richiſon,</hi> M. <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap> went with <hi>Hodg.</hi> to the
Hall, where he preſented the Copy, and required Entrance, but was put off.</p>
            <p>The 5 of <hi>January</hi> M. <hi>Spelman</hi> and M. <hi>Whiting</hi> went with <hi>Hodg.</hi> again to a publique Court,
where he preſented the Copy requiring Entrance, but was put off again, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This cauſed M. <hi>Whiting</hi> to complain to the Lord chiefe-Juſtice of the <hi>upper-Bench,</hi> who
(accompanied with 3 or 4 other of the Judges) after hearing all that could be ſaid by the
Company, for neglecting to enter to <hi>Hodg.</hi> as alſo what <hi>Warren</hi> could ſay for his pretended
claim; <hi>unâ voce</hi> Ordered, That the former pretended Entry to <hi>Warren,</hi> ſo ſurreptitiouſly
obtein'd, ſhould be <hi>obliterate,</hi> and the ſaid Copy be Entred <hi>de novo</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Hodgkinſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 20 of <hi>October</hi> 1657. the 17 yeers of King <hi>Charles</hi> began to be printed, during the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof, M. <hi>Whiting</hi> hath divers times declared to the ſeveral Workmen, and to ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Perſons (before them in the Work-houſe) which he hath brought thither to ſee that work,
and Printing; That he had agreed with M. <hi>Hodgkinſ.</hi> for printing of Sir <hi>Georg Crooks</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
and that the book, then in hand, of King <hi>Charles</hi> his 17 yeers; was not a third part of
it: for there was beſide 22 yeers of King <hi>James</hi> his time, and 11 yeers of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
time; Before the ſaid Workmen, the ſaid M. <hi>Whiting</hi> hath often been angry with the ſaid
<hi>Hodg.</hi> for finiſhing what work he had before, and forbad him to entertain any other worke;
aſſuring him that he would finde him worke for 7 yeers, with the books aforeſaid; And hee
hath driven Cuſtomers from his the ſaid <hi>Hodg.</hi> houſe that have come to him about work.</p>
            <p>The 23 of <hi>March,</hi> two Book-ſellers came into the Workhouſe of the ſaid <hi>Hodg.</hi> and in the
preſence of the Workmen, did much importune the ſaid <hi>Hodg.</hi> to take and print for them what
number of ſheets he pleaſed of the Lord <hi>Hubbards</hi> Reports; but <hi>Hodg.</hi> told them he could
not entertain their work untill he had acquainted M. <hi>Whiting,</hi> and obtein'd his conſent.</p>
            <p>The 26 day, M. <hi>Whiting</hi> being in the Workhouſe, the ſaid <hi>Hodg.</hi> moved him for his conſent;
but he refuſed, ſaying, That there were Reports of one <hi>Bulſtrode Whitlocks</hi> printing, which he
would not for 100 l. ſhould come out before his 11 yeers of King <hi>James;</hi> and therefore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the ſaid <hi>Hodg.</hi> not to think of entertaining any other worke, but to finiſh the 17 yeers of
King <hi>Charles</hi> with all ſpeed, and to print for him the 11 yeers of king <hi>James</hi> by <hi>Michaelmas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after <hi>Hodg.</hi> told M. <hi>Whiting</hi> that King <hi>Charles</hi> was neer done, and deſired to know
if the Copy for King <hi>James</hi> his time were ready or not; if it were not, and that the preſſe, for
want-thereof, ſhould ſtand ſtill, it would be very chargeable: Whereupon within a day or
two after M. <hi>Whiting</hi> brought the ſaid Copy into the ſaid Workhouſe, where <hi>Hodg.</hi> caſt it off,
and concluded that the laſt 11 yeers of King <hi>James</hi> ſhould make a ſecond Volume.</p>
            <p>About the 30 of <hi>May</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> was finiſhed, and <hi>Hod.</hi> asking M. <hi>Whiting</hi> for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of King <hi>James</hi> his time, to goe in hand with all; M <hi>Whiting</hi> told him it was in Juſt. <hi>Hales</hi>
hand for peruſall, but promiſed faithfully to bring it to him in a fortnight: The ſaid Maſter
<hi>Whiting</hi> came again within 2 or 3 dayes and deſired <hi>Hodg.</hi> to provide worke for a Moneth, if
he could; for (being tyred) he had a mind to goe into the Country; and then promiſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
faile to bring the ſaid Copy to him, within a moneth; but failed then as before.</p>
