            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Who, as if he had been one of those Tutelar, changeable <hi>Deities,</hi> which used to be enticed, and called over from one side to another, they still entertained the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they who most zealously pretended to him, had him most. And that however he be the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> &amp; <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> among men, yet in favour of his owne <hi>Cause,</hi> he would for a while be content to change his <hi>nature,</hi> and become the <hi>God of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, Disorder,</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi> too.</p>
               <p>The better to worke this perswasion into the minds of the <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi> their first piece of policy was to draw the <hi>Prophets</hi> into their <hi>Faction</hi> This is exprest to us in the 25. verse of this Chapter. Where 'tis said of <hi>Jerusalem, There is a conspiracy of her Prophets, in the midst thereof.</hi> And truely, 'twas a Conspiracy so unfit for <hi>Prophets,</hi> that the resemblance of it was never yet found in any but those Men of a much unholier stile, of whom the Historian saies, <hi>Est aliquod etiam inter Latrones &amp; Sicarios foedus,</hi> that <hi>Theeves</hi> and <hi>Robbers</hi> hold League and friendship amongst themselves. For 'tis said in the following words of that verse, that 'twas a Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy <hi>like the roaring of a Lion, ravening the prey.</hi> A <hi>Conspiracy,</hi> by which <hi>they devoured Soules, and took to themselves the Treasure and pretious things of the Land.</hi> And because pillage of this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Nature, could hardly be gained without the Death, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Owners,</hi> 'tis said in the close of that verse, That <hi>they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94064:3"/>
made her many Widdows in the midst thereof.</hi> To which if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had added these two <hi>words</hi> of pity, the <hi>Fatherlesse</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane</hi> too, nothing could have beene added to the calamity of the Description.</p>
               <p>Nor is there a much more favourable Character stuck by the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost,</hi> upon the <hi>Priests</hi> of those times. For by that which is said at the 26 verse of this Chapter, (And 'tis well worth your marking) you may perceive that the <hi>Disorder</hi> to which things were brought in the <hi>State,</hi> sprung first from the <hi>Disorder,</hi> to which things were brought in the <hi>Church.</hi> For 'tis there said, That <hi>The Priests had violated the Law,</hi> and <hi>prophaned the holy Things; That they did put no difference between the Holy, and Prophane, nor made any Distinction between the unclean, and the cleane.</hi> In briefe, the Legall, well establisht <hi>Service,</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> of God was at a kinde of losse, and <hi>Indifferency.</hi> 'Twas referred to every mans <hi>Fansie,</hi> to make to himself his own <hi>Religion. Blemisht,</hi> and <hi>unblemisht Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> began to be sacred alike. And the <hi>Scripture</hi> of another <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> became quite altered; He that <hi>offered a Swine,</hi> was thought as religious as he that <hi>slew an Oxe;</hi> And he that <hi>cut off a Dogs neck,</hi> was thought as liberall a <hi>Sacrificer,</hi> as he that brought a <hi>Lambe</hi> to the <hi>Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, having taken the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> so far into their <hi>plot,</hi> as to mingle and confound the <hi>Services</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> they made it one part of their <hi>policy,</hi> more, to make them lend Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to their proceedings in the <hi>State.</hi> This is plainly intimated to us, by that which is said at the 27. verse of this chapter, cohering with that which is said in the words of my Text. For there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of certaine <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Next, we have here, the <hi>Frailty,</hi> and <hi>Weaknesse,</hi> and <hi>Deceiveable nature</hi> of such <hi>pretences.</hi> How plausible soever they seemed to the deluded <hi>vulgar,</hi> and however they might a while, not onely serve to cover, and veile foule purposes, but to set them off with a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Lustretoo, yet this could not be lasting. <hi>Dishonest projects</hi> thus adorned were but so many <hi>painted Rui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, for the effecting of this, we have here a very strange <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse</hi> of their <hi>Ministery</hi> and <hi>Function,</hi> set downe to us in three <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,</hi> having every one of them something of the <hi>Forme,</hi> but nothing of the <hi>Reality</hi> of a <hi>Prophet</hi> in them.
