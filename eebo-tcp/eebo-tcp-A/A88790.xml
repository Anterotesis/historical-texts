            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all the Honeſt, Wiſe, and Grave-Citizens of
<hi>London,</hi> but more eſpecially to all thoſe
that challenge an intereſt in
the <hi>Common-Hall.</hi>

            <p>YOU cannot but account it an extraordinary great bleſſing from God, that a day
of Right, or rather of Inheritance (as I may call it to every Citizen) ſhould offer it
ſelfe unto you, the 24. day of this inſtant <hi>June,</hi> for a common-Hall: Time hath
now put that into your hands, which Petition upon Petition could not obteine,
for ſuch is our miſeries, that thoſe which had Power had not Will to grant our Requeſts, and
experience hath not only ſatisfied mee, but (I thinke) every honeſt man, that the ground of our
neglects or rather denyalls, are ſelfe intereſts, and private reſpects, which indeede are and
have beene, from time to time, the very fludgates to let in our miſeries, and the very choake
Peare to Peace, the bleſſed ground of all our happineſſe: for who more averſe to any motion
or Petition for Peace in this City, then they that are inveſted in places of power and
profit, and what greater unhappineſſe can befall us then this, that our grand Truſtees, ſhould
as much as in them lyes, bring King, Kingdome, and Citie into an everlaſting undoing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
then you gallant and brave Citizens, and know that it is yet in your power (through the
mercies of our God) to prevent a finall ruine, of this diſtreſſed, diſtracted, dying Kingdome;
and the better to effect it, let it bee your firſt worke on the Hall-day (and bee ſure to doe it
the firſt) remove the cauſes, and the effects will ceaſe, bee not over-power'd with policie, nor
with enforcement of arguments, nor with the approach of Souldiers, and Troopers; the two
firſt may ſeeme to perſwade you, the latter may terrifie you into an everlaſting undoing, but
I ſay firſt preſſe on to the marke, leſt you ſhut the ſtable doore when the ſteede is ſtoln; which
is, to point out the Acans that trouble your Citie, for it is to bee feared, except thoſe wicked
(I had like to have ſaid accurſed) things bee removed, this City and Kingdome will hardly bee
eſtabliſhed in Peace; Oh! what maddeſſe is it for you to nurce ſuch ſerpents in your boſomes
as would (not many moneths agoe) have totally deſtroyed you? putting their helping hands to
introduce a mercileſſe, and blood thirſtie Armie into the bowels of this famous Citie, ſuch now
you have in high places and high Offices, but roote them out, and make choyce of thoſe that
will (all ſiniſter ends ſet apart) act for the peace and proſperity of this languiſhing Citie, and
Kingdome, you may bee hold to doe this, for it is your right, granted in your Charter, to
locate, or diſlocate, place, or diſplace, any Officer that is in this City; therefore grave Citizens
betray not your own immunities, looſe not your priviledges, ſtand for truth and peace, and
according to your oathes of allegiance, your proteſtation, your late Covenant, pittie the ſad
condition of your moſt religious, and gracious King <hi>Charles,</hi> preſſing hard that a petition may
bee forthwith drawn, for a ſpeedy Perſonall Treaty with his Majeſty: the beſt way in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
apprehenſion to eſtabliſh Peace, and prevent thoſe dangers, which ſeeme to approach neer
unto us. Looke, Oh looke! with an impartiall eye, and yet with the eye of pittie (before it bee
too late) upon the diſtemper of the whole Kingdome, and conſider how this Citie is almoſt
hated of all, beloved of few: What black curſes there are againſt you abroad, what diſtempers
and murmurings within, your daily actions hourely diſſever you from the love of ſtrangers,
that know you not, and from the love of your neighbors and friends that know you, witneſſe
<hi>Surrey, Kent,</hi> and <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides looke towards the North, and you ſhall ſee a cloud, ſo full of darkeneſſe moving
this way, that it ſeemes to threaten our finall ruine; but ſome may ſay, wee neede not feare
for wee have money, and men, and Amunition enough, and this Fort, and that Tower; but
good Citizens bee not lulled aſleepe with careleſſe ſecuritie, for what can money, and men, and
Ammunition doe, ſo long as Acans trouble your Citie? goe on then boldly (in the name of
God) to your own worke, and in the election of Officers let mee give you this caution.</p>
            <p>In no waies to truſt any <hi>Generall</hi> with full power in this great and populous <hi>City,</hi>
that dares not truſt his Wife, Children, Family and Fortunes in it. Truſt not your Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of Exciſe. Truſt not any man that hath place of great profit; as you tender the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
well-fare of your Selves, your Wives and Children; and as you tender the well-fare
of this Glorious <hi>City,</hi> Let none ſnch beare Office in this Choice: This done, a ſhort
time may make you and the Kingdome happy in a well grounded Peace:</p>
            <closer>Which ſhall ever bee the Prayer of
<signed>your well-willing Friend and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Citizen
