            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hence men came to scan the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> by the Letter, and in the Covenant ofour Redemption, magnifi'd the external signs more then the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and yet looking on them through their own guiltinesse with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile feare, and finding as little comfort, or rather terror from them againe, they knew not how to hide their Slavish approach to <hi>Gods</hi> behests by them not understood, nor worthily receav'd, but by cloaking their Servile crouching to all <hi>Religious</hi> Presentments, somtimes lawfull, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Idolatrous, under the name of <hi>humility,</hi> and terming the Py-bald frippery, and oftentation of Ceremony's, decency.</p>

Spot without the Scratch, or crosse impression of a Priests fore-finger: and that feast of free grace, and adoption to which <hi>Christ</hi> invited his Disciples to sit as Brethren, and coheires of the happy Covenant, which at that Table was to be Seal'd to them, even that Feast of love and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-admitted fellowship, the Seale of filiall grace became the Subject of horror, and glout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adoration, pageanted about, like a dreadfull Idol: which sometimes deceve's wel-meaning men, and beguiles them of their reward, by their voluntary humility, which indeed, is fleshly pride, preferring a foolish Sacrifice, and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the world, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Colos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> explaineth, before a savory obedience to <hi>Christs</hi> example. Such was <hi>Peters</hi> unseasonable Humilitie, as then his Knowledge was small, when <hi>Christ</hi> came to wash his feet; who at an impertinent time would needs straine courtesy with his Master, and falling troublesomly upon the lowly, alwise, and unexaminable intention of <hi>Christ</hi> in what he went with resolution to doe, so provok't by his interruption the meeke <hi>Lord,</hi> that he threat'nd to exclude him from his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Portion, unlesse he could be content to be lesse arrogant, and stiff neckt in his humility.</p>
            <p>But to dwell no longer in characterizing the <hi>Depravities</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and how they sprung, and how they tooke increase; when I recall to mind at last, after so many darke Ages, wherein the huge overshadowing traine of <hi>Error</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

Then was the Sacred BIBLE sought out of the dusty corners where prophane Falshood and Neglect had throwne it, the <hi>Schooles</hi> opened, <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> rak't out of the <hi>embers</hi> of <hi>forgotten Tongues,</hi> the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi> trooping apace to the new erected Banner of <hi>Salvation;</hi> the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> with the unresistable <hi>might</hi> of <hi>Weaknesse,</hi> shaking the <hi>Powers</hi> of <hi>Darknesse,</hi> and scorning the <hi>fiery rage</hi> of the old <hi>red Dragon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The pleasing pursuit of these thoughts hath oft-times led mee into a serious question and debatement with my selfe, how it should come to passe that <hi>England</hi> (having had this <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> from GOD to bee the first that should set up a Standard for the recovery of <hi>lost Truth,</hi> and blow the first <hi>Evangelick Trumpet</hi> to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> holding up, as from a Hill, the new Lampe of <hi>saving light</hi> to all Christendome should now be last, and most unsettl'd in the enjoyment of that <hi>Peace,</hi> whereof we taught the way to others; although indeed our <hi>Wicklefs</hi> preaching, at which all the succeding <hi>Reformers</hi> more effectually ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            </p>
            <p>But I shall cheifly indeavour to declare those Causes that hinder the forwarding of <hi>true Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> which are among our selves. Orderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding will divide our inquirie into our <hi>Fore-Fathers dayes,</hi> and into <hi>our Times.</hi> HENRY the 8. was the first that rent this <hi>Kingdome</hi> from the <hi>Popes</hi> Subjection totally; but his Quarrell being more about <hi>Supremacie,</hi> then other faultinesse in <hi>Religion</hi> that he regarded, it is no marvell if hee stuck where he did. The next default was in the <hi>Bishops,</hi> who though they had renounc't the <hi>Pope,</hi> they still hugg'd the <hi>Popedome,</hi> and shar'd the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96875:7"/>
Authority among themselves, by their sixe bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Articles persecuting the <hi>Protestants</hi> no slacker then the <hi>Pope</hi> would have done. And doutles, when ever the <hi>Pope</hi> shall fall, if his ruine bee not like the sudden down-come of a Towre, the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> when they see him tottering, will leave him, and fall to scrambling, catch who may, hee a Patriarch-dome, and another what comes next hand; as the French Cardinall of late, and the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath plainly affected.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. Dayes, why a compleate <hi>Reform</hi> was not effected, to any considerate man may appeare. First, he no sooner entred into his Kingdome, but into a Warre with <hi>Scotland;</hi> from whence the Protector returning with Victory had but newly put his hand to repeale the 6. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> and throw the Images out of <hi>Churches,</hi> but Rebellions on all sides stir'd up by obdurate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and other Tumults with a plaine Warre in <hi>Norfolke,</hi> holding tack against two of the Kings <hi>Generals,</hi> made them of force content themselves with what they had already done. Hereupon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd ambitious Contentions among the <hi>Peeres,</hi> which ceas'd not but with the Protectors death, who was the most zealous in this point: and then <hi>Northumberland</hi> was hee that could doe most in <hi>England,</hi> who little minding <hi>Religion,</hi> (as his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacie well shew'd at his death, bent all his wit how to bring the Right of the <hi>Crowne</hi> into his owne Line.

            <p>Nor was this the first time that they discover'd to bee followers of this World; for when the Protectors Brother, Lord <hi>Sudley,</hi> the Admirall through private malice and mal-engine was to lose his life, no man could bee found fitter then Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi> (like another Doctor <hi>Shaw)</hi> to divulge in his Sermon the forged Accusations laid to his charge, thereby to defame him with the People, who else was thought would take ill the innocent mans death; unlesse the Reverend <hi>Bishop</hi> could warrant them there was no foule play.

Yet Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> one of the Executors, and the other <hi>Bishops</hi> none refusing, (lest they should resist the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland)</hi> could find in their Consciences to set their hands to the disinabling and defeating not onely of Princesse MARY the <hi>Papist,</hi> but of ELIZABETH the <hi>Protestant,</hi> and (by the <hi>Bishops</hi> judgement) the Lawfull Issue of King HENRY.</p>
            <p>Who then can thinke, (though these <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> had sought a further <hi>Reformation)</hi> that the least wry face of a <hi>Politician</hi> would not have hush't them.

And these perhaps were the cheife impeachments of a more sound rectifying the <hi>Church</hi> in the Queens Time.</p>
            <p>From this Period I count to begin our Times, which, because they concerne us more neerely, and our owne eyes and eares can give us the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler scope to judge, will require a more exact search; and to effect this the speedier, I shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish such as I esteeme to be the hinderers of <hi>Reformation</hi> into 3. sorts, <hi>Antiquitarians</hi> (for so I had rather call them then <hi>Antiquaries,</hi> whose la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are usefull and laudable) 2. <hi>Libertines,</hi> 3. <hi>Polititians.</hi>

To the votarists of Antiquity I shall think to have fully answer'd, if I shall be able to prove out of Antiquity, First, that if they will conform our Bishops to the purer times, they must mew their feathers, and their pounces, and make but curt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd Bishops of them; and we know they hate to be dockt and clipt, as much as to be put down outright. Secondly, that those purer times were corrupt, and their Books corrupted soon after. Thirdly, that the best of those that then wrote, disclaim that any man should repose on them, and send all to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>First therfore, if those that over-affect Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will follow the square therof, their Bishops must be elected by the hands of the whole <hi>Church.</hi> The ancientest of the extant Fathers <hi>Ignatius,</hi> writing to the Philadelphians saith, <hi>that it belongs to them as to the Church of God to choose a Bishop.</hi> Let no man cavill, but take the Church of <hi>God</hi> as meaning the whole consistence of Orders and Members, as S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles expresse, and this likewise being read over: Besides this, it is there to be mark'd, that those Philadelphians are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to choose a Bishop of <hi>Antioch.</hi> Whence it seems by the way that there was not that wary limitation of Dioces in those times, which is confirm'd even by a fast friend of Episcopacie, <hi>Camden,</hi> who cannot but love Bishops, as well as old coins, and his much lamented Monasteries for antiquities sake. He writes in his description of <hi>Scotland, that over all the world Bishops had no
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96875:12"/>
certaine Dioces, till Pope</hi> Dionysius <hi>about the yeare</hi> 268. <hi>did cut them out,</hi> and <hi>that the Bishops of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>executed their function in what place soever they came indifferently, and without distinction till King</hi> Malcolm <hi>the third, about the yeare</hi> 1070. whence may be guest what their function was: was it to goe about circl'd with a band of rooking Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, with cloke bagges full of Citations, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses to be serv'd by a corporalty of griffonlike Promooters, and Apparitors? Did he goe about to pitch down his Court, as an Empirick does his banck, to inveigle in all the mony of the Con<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey? no certainly it would not have bin permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to exercise any such function indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wherever he came. And verily some such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was as want of a fat Dioces that kept our Britain Bishops so poore in the Primitive times, that being call'd to the Councell of <hi>Ariminum</hi> in the yeare 359. they had not wherewithall to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the charges of their journey, but were fed; and lodg'd upon the Emperors cost, which must needs be no accidentall, but usuall poverty in them, for the author <hi>Sulp. Severus</hi> in his 2 Booke of Church History praises them, and avouches it praise-worthy in a Bishop, to be so poore as to have nothing of his own. But to return to the ancient election of Bishops that it could not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be without the consent of the people is so expresse in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and so often to be met with, that to cite each place at large, were to translate a good part of the volume, therfore touching the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96875:12"/>
chief passages, I referre the rest to whom so list peruse the Author himselfe: in the 24. <hi>Epist. If a Bishop</hi> saith he, <hi>be once made and allow'd by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and judgement of his collegues, and the people, no other can be made.</hi> In the 55. <hi>When a Bishop is made by the suffrage of all the people in peace.</hi> In the 68. marke but what he saies, <hi>The people chiefly hath power, either of choosing worthy ones, or refusing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy:</hi> this he there proves by authorities out of the old and new Testament, and with solid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: these were his antiquities.</p>
            <p>This voyce of the people to be had ever in Episcopal elections was so well known, before <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi> time, even to those that were without the Church, that the Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd to have his governours of Provinces chosen in the same manner, as <hi>

to suppresse the licence of false Brethren, and the extravagancy of still-new opinions, a time not imitable for Church government, where the temporall and spirituall power did not close in one beleife, as under <hi>Constantine.</hi> I am not of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to thinke the Church a <hi>Vine</hi> in this respect, because, as they take it, she cannot subsist without clasping about the Elme of worldly strength, and felicity, as if the heavenly City could not support it selfe without the props and buttresses of secular Authoritie.

it will be good to see further his knowledge of <hi>Religion</hi> what it was, and by that we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise guesse at the sincerity of his Times in those that were not Hereticall, it being likely that hee would converse with the famousest <hi>Prelates</hi> (for so he had made them) that were to be found for learning.</p>
            <p>Of his <hi>Arianisme</hi> we heard, and for the rest, a pretty scantling of his Knowledge may be taken by his deferring to be baptiz'd so many yeares, a thing not usuall, and repugnant to the Tenor of <hi>Scripture, Philip</hi> knowing nothing that should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Eunuch</hi> to be <hi>baptiz'd</hi> after <hi>profession</hi> of his <hi>beleife.</hi> Next, by the excessive devotion, that I may not say Superstition both of him and his Mother <hi>Helena,</hi> to find out the Crosse on which <hi>Christ</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, that had long lien under the rubbish of old ruines, (a thing which the Disciples and Kindred of our Saviour might with more ease have done, if they had thought it a pious duty:) some of the nailes whereof hee put into his Helmet, to beare off blowes in battell, others he fasten'd among the studds of his bridle, to fulfill (as he thought, or his Court <hi>Bishops</hi> perswaded him) the Prophesie of <hi>Zachariah; And it shall be that that which is in the bridle shall be holy to the Lord.</hi> Part of the Crosse, in which he thought such Vertue to reside, as would prove a kind of <hi>Palladium</hi> to save the <hi>Citie</hi> where ever it remain'd, he caus'd to be laid up in a Pillar of Porphyrie by his Statue. How hee or his Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers could trifle thus with halfe an eye open

upon Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Principles, I know not how to imagine.</p>
            <p>How should then the dim Taper of this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours age that had such need of snuffing, extend any beame to our Times wherewith wee might hope to be better lighted, then by those Luminaries that God hath set up to shine to us far neerer hand. And what <hi>Reformation</hi> he wrought for his owne time it will not be amisse to consider, hee appointed certaine times for Fasts, and Feasts, built stately Churches, gave large Immunities to the Clergie, great Riches and Promotions to <hi>Bishops,</hi> gave and minister'd occasion to bring in a Deluge of Ceremonies, thereby either to draw in the Heathen by a resemblance of their rites, or to set a glosse upon the simplicity, and plainnesse of Christianity which to the gorgeous solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Paganisme,</hi> and the sense of the Worlds Children seem'd but a homely and Yeomanly <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> for the beauty of inward Sanctity was not within their prospect.</p>

The last point wherein the <hi>Antiquary</hi> is to bee dealt with at his owne weapon, is to make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that the ancientest, and best of the Fathers have disclaim'd all sufficiency in themselves that men should rely on, and sent all commers to the Scriptures, as all sufficient; that this is true, will not be unduly gather'd by shewing what esteeme they had of Antiquity themselves, and what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity they thought in it to prove Doctrine, or Discipline. I must of necessitie begin from the second ranke of Fathers, because till then Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie could have no Plea. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his 63. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle.</hi> If any, saith he, of our Auncestors either ignorantly or out of simplicity hath not observ'd that which the Lord taught us by his example (speaking of the Lords Supper) his simplicity <hi>God</hi> may pardon of his mercy, but wee cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd for following him, being instructed by the Lord. And have not we the same instructions, and will not this holy man with all the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistorie of Saints and Martyrs that liv'd of old
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96875:19"/>
rise up and stop our mouthes in judgement, when wee shall goe about to Father our Errors, and opinions upon their Authority? in the 73. <hi>Epist.</hi> hee adds, in vaine doe they oppose custome to us if they be overcome by reason; as if custome were greater then Truth, or that in spirituall things that were not to be follow'd, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd for the better by the holy Ghost. In the 74. neither ought Custome to hinder that Truth should not prevaile, for Custome without Truth is but agednesse of Error.</p>
            <p>Next <hi>Lactantius,</hi> he that was prefer'd to have the bringing up of <hi>Constantines</hi> children in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Booke of <hi>Institutions,</hi> Chap. 7. &amp; 8. disputes against the vaine trust in Antiquity, as being the cheifest Argument of the Heathen against the Christians, they doe not consider, saith he, what Religion is, but they are confident it is true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Ancients deliver'd it, they count it a trespasse to examine it. And in the eighth, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they went before us in time, therefore in wisedome, which being given alike to all Ages, cannot be prepossest by the Ancients; wherefore seeing that to seeke the Truth is inbred to all, they bereave themselves of wisedome the gift of God who without judgement follow the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and are led by others like bruit beasts. St. <hi>Austin</hi> writes to <hi>Fortunatian</hi> that he counts it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the bookes of whomsoever to reject that which hee finds otherwise then true, and so hee would have others deale by him. He neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted,
<pb facs="tcp:96875:20"/>
as it seems, those Fathers that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor himselfe, nor others of his rank, for men of more then ordinary spirit, that might equally deceive, and be deceiv'd. and oftimes, setting our servile humors aside, yea <hi>God</hi> so ordering, we may find Truth with one man, as soon as in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> agrees 71. Epist. <hi>Many things,</hi> saith he, <hi>are better reveal'd to single persons.</hi> At <hi>

            <p>Now remains it to shew clearly that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers referre all decision of controversie to the Scriptures, as all-sufficient to direct, to resolve, and to determine. <hi>Ignatius</hi> taking his last leave of the Asian Churches, as he went to martyrdome exhorted them to adhere close to the written doctrine of the Apostles, necessarily written for posterity: so farre was he from unwritten tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as may be read in the 36. <hi>c.</hi> of <hi>Eusebius</hi> 3. <hi>b.</hi> In the 74. Epist. Of <hi>Cyprian</hi> against <hi>Stefan</hi> Bish. of <hi>Rome</hi> imposing upon him a tradition, <hi>whence,</hi> quoth he, <hi>is this tradition? is it fetcht from the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Christ in the Gospel, or of the Apostles in their Epistles: for God testifies that thosi things are to be done which are written:</hi> and then thus; <hi>what obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie, what presumption is this to preferre humane Tradition before divine ordinance?</hi> And in the same Epist. <hi>If we shall return to the head, and beginning of divine tradition</hi> (which we all know he means the

But it will be reply'd, the Scriptures are difficult to be understood, and therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the explanation of the Fathers, 'tis true there be some Books, and especially some places in those Books that remain clouded; yet ever that which is most necessary to be known is most
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96875:21"/>
easie; and that which is most difficult, so farre expounds it selfe ever, as to tell us how little it imports our <hi>saving knowledge.</hi> Hence to inferre a generall obscurity over all the text, is a meer suggestion of the Devil to disswade men from reading it, and casts an aspersion of dishonour both upon the <hi>mercy, truth,</hi> and <hi>wisdome</hi> of. <hi>God:</hi> We count it no gentlenesse, or fair dealing in a man of Power amongst us, to require strict, and punctual obedience, and yet give out all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ambiguous and obscure, we should think he had a plot upon us, certainly such commands were no commands, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nares. The very essence of Truth is plainnesse, and brightnes; the darknes and crookednesse is our own. The <hi>wisdome</hi> of <hi>God</hi> created <hi>understanding,</hi> fit and proportionable to Truth the object, and end of it, as the eye to the thing visible. If our <hi>understanding</hi> have a film of <hi>ignorance</hi> over it, or be blear with gazing on other false glisterings, what is that to Truth? If we will but purge with sovrain eyesalve that intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual ray which <hi>God</hi> hath planted in us, then we would beleeve the Scriptures protesting their own plainnes, and perspicuity, calling to them to be instructed, not only the <hi>wise,</hi> and <hi>learned,</hi> but the <hi>simple,</hi> the <hi>poor,</hi> the <hi>babes,</hi> foretelling an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary effusion of <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit upon every age, and sexe, attributing to all men, and requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them the ability of searching, trying, examining all things, and by the Spirit discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is good; and as the Scriptures
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96875:22"/>
themselvs pronounce their own plainnes, so doe the Fathers testifie of them.</p>
            <p>I will not run into a paroxysm of citations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in this point, only instance <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his fore-mention'd first page; <hi>the knowledge of Truth,</hi> saith he, <hi>wants no humane lore, as being evident in it selfe, and by the preaching of Christ now opens brighter then the Sun.</hi> If these Doctors who had scarse half the light that we enjoy, who all except 2 or 3 were ignorant of the Hebrew tongue, and many of the Greek, blundring upon the dangerous, and suspectfull translations of the Apostat <hi>Aquila,</hi> the Heretical Theodotion, the Judaiz'd <hi>Symmachus;</hi> the erroneous <hi>Origen;</hi> if these could yet find the Bible so easie, why should we doubt, that have all the helps of Learning, and faithfull industry that man in this life can look for, and the assistance of <hi>God</hi> as neer now to us as ever. But let the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be hard; are they more hard, more crabbed, more abstruse then the Fathers? He that cannot understand the sober, plain, and unaffected stile of the Scriptures, will be ten times more puzzl'd with the knotty Africanisms, the pamper'd meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fors; the intricat, and involv'd sentences of the Fathers; besides the fantastick, and declamatory flashes; the crosse-jingling periods which cannot but disturb, and come thwart a setl'd devotion worse then the din of bells, and rattles.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, for the love of holy <hi>Reformation,</hi> what can be said more against these importunat clients of Antiquity, then she her selfe their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronesse

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96875:23"/>
transparent streams of divine Truth, they would plunge, and tumble, and thinke to ly hid in the foul weeds, and muddy waters, where no plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met can reach the bottome. But let them beat themselvs like Whales, and spend their oyl till they be dradg'd ashoar: though wherfore should the Ministers give them so much line for shifts, and delays? Wherfore should they not urge only the Gospel, and hold it ever in their faces like a mirror of Diamond, till it dazle, and pierce their misty ey balls? maintaining it the honour of its absolute sufficiency, and supremacy inviolable: For if the Scripture be for <hi>Reformation,</hi> and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity to boot, 'tis but an advantage to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, 'tis no winning cast: and though Antiquity be against it, while the Scriptures be for it, the Cause is as good as ought to be wisht, Antiquity it selfe sitting Judge.</p>
            <p>But to draw to an end; the second sort of those, that may be justly number'd among the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of <hi>Reformation,</hi> are Libertines, these suggest that the Discipline sought would be intolerable: for one Bishop now in a Dioces we should then have a Pope in every Parish. It will not be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit to Answer these men, but only to discover them, for reason they have none, but lust, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnes, and therfore answer can have none. It is not any Discipline that they could live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it is the corruption, and remisnes of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline that they seek.

Must Church government that is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96875:25"/>
appointed in the Gospel, and has chief respect to the soul, be conformable, and pliant to civil, that is arbitrary, and chiefly conversant about the visible and external part of man? this is the very maxim that moulded the Calvs of <hi>Bethel</hi> and of <hi>Dan,</hi> this was the quintessence of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> policy, he made Religion conform to his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick interests, &amp; this was the sin that watcht over theIsraelites till their final captivity If this State principle come from the Prelates, as they affect to be counted statists, let them look back to <hi>Elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and see what he thought of the policy of <hi>England;</hi> being requir'd by <hi>Lucius</hi> the first Christian King of this Iland to give his counsel for the founding of Religious Laws, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thought he of this sage caution, but bids him betake himselfe to the old, and new Testament, and receive direction from them how to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster both Church, and Common-wealth; that he was <hi>Gods</hi> Vicar, and therfore to rule by <hi>Gods</hi> Laws, that the Edicts of <hi>Caesar</hi> we may at all times disallow, but the Statutes of <hi>God</hi> for no reason we may reject. Now certaine if Church-gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be taught in the Gofpel, as the Bishops dare not deny, we may well conclude of what late standing this Position is, newly calculated for the altitude of Bishop elevation, and lettice for their lips. But by what example can they shew that the form of Church Discipline must be minted, and modell'd out to secular pretences? The ancient Republick of the Jews is evident to

Seeing that the Churchmans office is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to teach men the Christian Faith, to exhort all, to incourage the good, to admonish the bad, privately the lesse offender, publickly the scanda lous and stubborn; to censure, and separate from the commuuion of <hi>Christs</hi> flock, the contagious, and incorrigible, to receive with joy, and father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compassion the penitent, all this must be don, and more then this is beyond any Church au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96875:27"/>
               <hi>Pilate</hi> heard once our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> professing that <hi>his Kingdome was not of this world,</hi> he thought the man could not stand much in <hi>Caesars</hi> light, nor much indammage the Roman Empire: for if the life of <hi>Christ</hi> be hid to this world, much more is his Scepter unoperative, but in spirituall things. And thus liv'd, for 2 or 3 ages, the Successors of the Apostles. But when through <hi>Constantines</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish Superstition they forsook their <hi>first love,</hi> and set themselvs up two Gods instead, <hi>Mammon</hi> and their Belly, then taking advantage of the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al power which they had on mens consciences, they began to cast a longing eye to get the body also, and bodily things into their command, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which their carnal desires, the Spirit dayly quenching and dying in them, they knew no way to keep themselves up from falling to nothing, but by bolstering, and supporting their inward rottenes by a carnal, and outward strength. For a while they rather privily sought opportunity, then hastily disclos'd their project, but when <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> was dead, and 3 or 4 Emperors more, their drift became notorious, and offensive to the whole world: for while <hi>Theodosius</hi> the younger reign'd, thus writes <hi>Socrates</hi> the Historian in his <hi>7th</hi> Book, 11. chap. now began an ill name to stick upon the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who beyond their Priestly bounds now long agoe had stept into principality and this was scarse 80. years since their raising from the meanest world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condition. Of courtesie now let any man tell
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96875:27"/>
me, if they draw to themselves a <hi>temporall strength</hi> and <hi>power</hi> out of <hi>Caesars</hi> Dominion, is not <hi>Caesars</hi> Empire thereby diminisht? but this was a stolne bit, hitherto hee was but a Caterpiller secretly gnawing at <hi>Monarchy,</hi> the next time you shall see him a Woolfe, a Lyon, lifting his paw against his raiser, as <hi>Petrarch</hi> exprest it, and finally an open enemy, and subverter of the Greeke Empire. <hi>Philippicus</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> with divers other Emperours after them, not without the advice of their <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi> and at length of a whole Easterne Counsell of 3. hundred thirty eight <hi>Bishops,</hi> threw the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges out of <hi>Churches</hi> as being decreed idolatrous.</p>
            <p>Upon this goodly occasion the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> not only seizes the City, and all the Territory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout into his owne hands, and makes himselfe Lord thereof, which till then was govern'd by a Greeke Magistrate, but absolves all <hi>Italy</hi> of their Tribute, and obedience due to the Emperour, because hee obey'd Gods Commandement in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolishing Idolatry.</p>
            <p>Mark Sir here how the Pope came by S. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrymony, as he feigns it, not the donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi> but idolatry and rebellion got it him. Yee need but read <hi>Sigonius</hi> one of his owne Sect to know the Story at large. And now to shroud himselfe against a storme from the Greek Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and provide a Champion to beare him out in these practises, hee takes upon him by Papall sentence to unthrone <hi>Chilpericus</hi> the rightfull K. of <hi>France,</hi> and gives the Kingdome to <hi>Pepin</hi> for no

            <p>Having thus made <hi>Pepin</hi> his fast freind, he cals him into <hi>Italy</hi> against <hi>Aistulphus</hi> the <hi>Lombard,</hi> that war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To bee short, under shew of his zeale against the errors of the Greeke Church, hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceast baiting, and goring the Successors of his best Lord <hi>Constantine</hi> what by his barking curses, and Excommunications, what by his hindering the Westerne Princes from ayding them against the Sarazens, and Turkes, unlesse when they hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd him; so that it may be truly affirm'd, he was the subversion, and fall of that <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which was the hoisting of him; this, besides <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch,</hi> whom I have cited, our <hi>Chaucer</hi> also hath

and famous men have suspected, and fear'd the Protestant <hi>Episcopacie</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as those that have fear'd the Papall.</p>
            <p>You know Sir what was the judgement of <hi>Padre Paolo</hi> the great Venetian Antagonist of the <hi>Pope,</hi> for it is extant in the hands of many men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he declares his feare, that when the Hierarchy of <hi>England</hi> shall light into the hands of busie and audacious men, or shall meet with Princes tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Prelacy, then much mischiefe is like to ensue.

            <p>Surely there is not any Prince in <hi>Christendome,</hi> who hearing this rare Sophistry can choose but smile, and if we be not blind at home we may as well perceive that this worthy Motto, No <hi>Bishop,</hi> no <hi>King</hi> is of the same batch, and infanted out of the same feares, a meere ague-cake coagulated of a certaine Fever they have, presaging their time to be but short: and now like those that are sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

they catch round at that which is likeliest to hold them up. And would perswade Regall Power, that if they dive, he must after. But what greater debasement can there be to Royall Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whose towring, and stedfast heighth rests upon the unmovable foundations of Justice, and Heroick vertue, then to chaine it in a dependance of subsisting, or ruining to the painted Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and gaudy rottennesse of Prelatrie, which want but one puffe of the Kings to blow them down like a past bord House built of <hi>Court-Cards.</hi> Sir the little adoe, which me thinks I find in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking these pleasant Sophismes, puts mee into the mood to tell you a tale ere I proceed further; and <hi>Menenius Agrippa</hi> speed us.</p>
            <p>Upon a time the Body summon'd all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <note place="margin">A Tale.</note> to meet in the Guild for the common good (as <hi>Aesops</hi> Chronicles averre many stranger Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents) the head by right takes the first seat, and next to it a huge and monstrous Wen little lesse then the Head it selfe, growing to it by a narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er excrescency. The members amaz'd began to aske one another what hee was that took place next their chief; none could resolve. Whereat the Wen, though unweildy, with much adoe gets up and bespeaks the Assembly to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. That as in place he was second to the head, so by due of merit; that he was to it an ornament, and strength, and of speciall neere relation, and that if the head should faile, none were fitter then himselfe to step into his place; therefore hee
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96875:30"/>
thought it for the honour of the Body, that such dignities and rich indowments should be decreed him, as did adorne, and set out the noblest Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. To this was answer'd, that it should bee consulted. Then was a wise and learned Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher sent for, that knew all the Charters, Lawes, and Tenures of the Body. On him it is impos'd by all, as chiefe Committee to examine, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse the claime and Petition of right put in by the Wen; who soone perceiving the matter, and wondring at the boldnesse of such a swolne Tumor, Wilt thou (quoth he) that art but a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of vitious and harden'd excrements, contend with the lawfull and free-borne members, whose certaine number is set by ancient, and unrepeala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Statute? head thou art none, though thou receive this huge substance from it, what office bearst thou? What good canst thou shew by thee done to the Common-weale? the Wen not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dash't replies, that his Office was his glory, for so oft as the soule would retire out of the head from over the steaming vapours of the lower parts to Divine Contemplation, with him shee found the purest, and quietest retreat, as being most remote from soile, and disturbance. Lour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, quoth the Philosopher, thy folly is as great as thy filth; know that all the faculties of the Soule are confin'd of old to their severall vessels, and <hi>ventricles,</hi> from which they cannot part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dissolution of the whole Body; and that thou containst no good thing in thee, but a heape of

hard, and loathsome uncleannes, and art to the head a foul disfigurment and burden, when I have cut thee off, and open'd thee, as by the help of these implements I will doe, all men shall see.</p>
            <p>But to return, whence was digress't, seeing that the throne of a King, as the wise K. <hi>Salomon</hi> often remembers us, <hi>is establisht in Justice,</hi> which is the universall <hi>Justice</hi> that <hi>Aristotle</hi> so much praises, containing in it all other <hi>vertues,</hi> it may assure us that the fall of Prelacy, whose actions are so farre distant from <hi>Justice,</hi> cannot shake the least fringe that borders the royal canopy: but that their standing doth continually oppose, and lay bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to regal safety, shall by that which follows easily appear. Amongst many secondary, and accessory causes that support Monarchy, these are not of least reckning, though common to all other States: the love of the Subjects, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and valor of the people, and store of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. In all these things hath the Kingdome bin of late sore weak'nd, and chiefly by the Prelates. First let any man consider, that if any Prince shall suffer under him a commission of autority to be exerciz'd, till all the Land grone, and cry out, as against a whippe of Scorpions, whether this be not likely to lessen, and keel the affections of the Subject.

Now wheras the only remedy, and amends against the depopulation, and thinnesse of a Land within, is the borrow'd strength of firme alliance from without, these Priestly policies of theirs having thus exhausted our domestick forces, have gone the way also to leave us as naked of our firmest, &amp; faithfullest neighbours abroad, by disparaging,

            <p>Thus as they have unpeopl'd the Kingdome by expulsion of so many thousands, as they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor'd to lay the skirts of it bare by disheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and dishonouring our loyallest Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates abroad, so have they hamstrung the valour of the Subject by seeking to effeminate us all at home. Well knows every wise Nation that their Liberty consists in manly and honest labours, in sobriety and rigorous honour to the Marriage Bed, which in both Sexes should be bred up from chast hopes to loyall Enjoyments; and when the people slacken, and fall to loosenes, and riot, then doe they as much as if they laid downe their necks for some wily Tyrant to get up and ride. Thus learnt <hi>Cyrus</hi> to tame the <hi>Lydians,</hi> whom by Armes he could not, whilst they kept themselves from Luxury; with one easy Proclamation to set up <hi>Stews,</hi> dancing, feasting, &amp; dicing he made them soone his slaves. I know not what drift the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats</hi> had, whose Brokers they were to prepare, and supple us either for a Forreigne Invasion or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick oppression; but this I am sure they took the ready way to despoile us both of <hi>manhood</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> at once, and that in the shamefullest and ungodliest manner upon that day which Gods Law, and even our own reason hath consecrated, that we might have one day at least of seven set apart wherein to examin and encrease our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, to meditate, and commune of our

Faith, our Hope, our eternall City in Heaven, and to quick'n, withall, the study, and exercise of Charity; at such a time that men should bee pluck't from their soberest and saddest thoughts, and by <hi>Bishops</hi> the pretended <hi>Fathers of the Church</hi> instigated by publique Edict, and with earnest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour push't forward to gaming, jigging, was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailing, and mixt dancing is a horror to think. Thus did the Reprobate hireling Preist <hi>Balaam</hi> seeke to subdue the Israelites to <hi>Moab,</hi> if not by force, then by this divellish <hi>Pollicy,</hi> to draw them from the Sanctuary of God to the luxurious, and ribald feasts of <hi>Baal-peor.</hi> Thus have they trespas't not onely against the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but of Heaven also, as others, I doubt not, can prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute against them.</p>
            <p>I proceed within my own bounds to shew you next what good Agents they are about the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vennues and Riches of the Kingdome, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares of what moment they are to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or what availe. Two Leeches they have that still suck, and suck the Kingdome, their Ceremonies, and their Courts. If any man will contend that Ceremonies bee lawfull under the Gospell, hee may bee answer'd otherwhere.

What can we suppose this will come to? What other materials then these have built up the <hi>spirituall</hi> BABEL to the heighth of her Abominations?

            <p>We know that <hi>Monarchy</hi> is made up of two parts, the Liberty of the subject, and the supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of the King. I begin at the root.

Thus then wee see that our Ecclesiall, and Politicall choyses may consent and sort as well together without any rupture in the STATE, as Christians, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders. But as for honour, that ought indeed to be different, and distinct as either Office looks a severall way, the Minister whose <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>end</hi> is spirituall, ought to be honour'd as a Father and Physitian to the Soule (if he be found to be so) with a <hi>Son-like</hi> and <hi>Disciple-like</hi> reverence, which is indeed the dearest, and most affectionate <hi>honour,</hi> most to be desir'd by a wise man, and such as will easily command a free and plentifull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of outward necessaries, without his furder care of this world.</p>
            <p>The Magistrate whose Charge is to see to our Persons, and Estates, is to bee honour'd with a

more elaborate and personall Courtship, with large Salaries and Stipends, that hee himselfe may abound in those things whereof his legall justice and watchfull care gives us the quiet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment.

            <p>Then shall the Nobles possesse all the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Offices of temporall honour to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, sole Lords without the improper mixture of Scholastick, and pusillanimous upstarts, the <hi>Parliament</hi> shall void her <hi>Vpper House</hi> of the same annoyances, the Common, and Civill <hi>Lawes</hi> shall be both set free, the former from the controule, the other from the meere vassalage and <hi>Copy hold</hi> of the <hi>Clergie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And wheras <hi>temporall Lawes</hi> rather punish men when they have transgress't, then form them to be such as should transgresse seldomest, wee may conceive great hopes through the showres of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Benediction, watering the unmolested and watchfull paines of the <hi>Ministery,</hi> that the whole Inheritance of God will grow up so straight and blamelesse, that the Civill Magistrate may with farre lesse toyle and difficulty, and far more ease and delight steare the tall and goodly <hi>Vessell</hi> of the Common-wealth through all the gusts and tides of the Worlds mutability.</p>
            <p>Here I might have ended, but that some Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which I have heard commonly flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, presse mee to the endevour of an answere.

            <p>Let us not dally with God when he offers us a full blessing, to take as much of it as wee think will serve our ends, and turne him back the rest upon his hands, lest in his anger he snatch all from us again. Next they alledge the <hi>antiquity</hi> of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> through all <hi>Ages.</hi> What it was in the <hi>Apostles</hi> time, that questionlesse it must be still and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I trust the Ministers will be able to satisfie the <hi>Parliament.</hi> But if <hi>Episcopacie</hi> be taken for <hi>Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> all the Ages they can deduce it through, will make it no more venerable then <hi>Papacie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most certaine it is (as all our <hi>Stories</hi> beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) that ever since their comming to the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for neere twelve hundred yeares, to speake of them in generall, they have beene in <hi>England</hi> to our Soules a sad and dolefull successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of illiterate and blind guides: to our purses, and goods a wastfull band of robbers, a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all havock, and rapine: To our state a continuall <hi>Hydra</hi> of mischiefe, and molestation, the forge of discord and Rebellion: This is the Trophey of their Antiquity, and boasted Succession through so many Ages. And for those <hi>Prelat-Martyrs</hi> they glory of, they are to bee judg'd what they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96875:41"/>
were by the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and not the <hi>Gospel</hi> to be tried by them.</p>
            <p>And it is to be noted that if they were for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks and Ceremonies, it was in their pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, and fulnes of bread, but in their persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which purifi'd them, and neer their death, which was their garland, they plainely dislik'd and condemn'd the Ceremonies, and threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way those Episcopall ornaments wherein they were instal'd, as foolish and detestable, for so the words of <hi>Ridley</hi> at his degradment, and his letter to <hi>Hooper</hi> expressly shew. Neither doth the Author of our Church History spare to record sadly the fall (for so he termes it) and infirmities of these Martyrs, though we would deify them. And why should their Martyrdom more count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance corrupt doctrine, or discipline, then their subscriptions justify their Treason to the Royall blood of this Relm; by diverting and intaling the right of the Crown from the true heires, to the houses of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> which had it tooke effect, this present King had in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood never sat on this Throne, and the happy u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this Iland had bin frustrated.</p>
            <p>Lastly, whereas they adde that some the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedest of the reformed abroad admire our Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, it had bin more for the strength of the Argument to tell us that som of the wisest <hi>States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> admire it, for thereby we might guesse them weary of the present discipline, as offensive to their State, which is the bugge we feare; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96875:42"/>
they are Church-men, we may rather suspect them for some <hi>Prelatizing-spirits</hi> that admire our <hi>Bishopricks,</hi> not <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> The next objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vanishes of it selfe, propounding a doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a greater inconvenience would not grow from the corruption of any other discipline, then from that of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> This seemes an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable foresight, and out of order to deferre, and put off the most needfull constitution of one right <hi>discipline,</hi> while we stand ballancing the discommodity's of two corrupt ones. First consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute that which is right, and of it selfe it will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, and rectify that which swervs, and easily remedy the pretended feare of having a <hi>Pope</hi> in every Parish, unlesse we call the zealous, and meek censure of the <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>Popedom,</hi> which who so does let him advise how he can reject the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storly <hi>Rod,</hi> and Sheep-hooke of CHRIST, and those cords of love, and not feare to fall under the iron <hi>Scepter</hi> of his anger that will dash him to peeces like a Potsherd.</p>
            <p>At another doubt of theirs I wonder; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this discipline which we desire, be such as can be put in practise within this Kingdom, they say it can not stand with the common Law, nor with the Kings safety; the government of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, is now so weav'd into the common Law: In <hi>Gods</hi> name let it weave out againe; let not humain quillets keep back divine authority. Tis not the common Law, nor the civil, but pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and justice, that are our foundresses; they stoop

not, neither change colour for <hi>Aristoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Lastly, they are fearfull that the discipline which will succeed cannot stand with the Ks. safety. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? it is but <hi>Episcopacy</hi> reduc't to what it should be, were it not that the Tyranny of <hi>Prelates</hi> under the name of <hi>Bishops</hi> hath made our eares tender, and startling, we might call every good Minister a <hi>Bishop,</hi> as every <hi>Bishop,</hi> yea the <hi>Apostles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are call'd Ministers, and the <hi>Angels mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strîng Spirits,</hi> and the <hi>Ministers</hi> againe <hi>Angels.</hi> But wherein is this propounded government so shrewd? Because the government of assemblies will succeed. Did not the <hi>Apostles</hi> govern the Church by assemblies, how should it else be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik, how should it have Communion? Wee count it Sacrilege to take from the rich <hi>Prelates</hi> their Lands, and revenu's which is Sacrilege in them to keep, using them as they doe, and can we think it safe to defraude the living Church of GOD of that right which GOD has given her in assemblies! O but the consequence: Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies draw to them the Supremacy of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call jurisdiction. No surely, they draw no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, but that authority which CHRIST, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his name conferrs upon them. The K. may still retain the same Supremacy in the Assemblies, as in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> here he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:96875:43"/>
do nothing alone against the common Law, and there neither alone, nor with consent against the Scriptures. But is this all? No, this Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Supremacy draws to it the power to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Kings; and then followes the worst that can be imagin'd. Doe they hope to avoyd this by keeping <hi>Prelates</hi> that have so often don it? Not to exemplifie the malapert insolence of our owne <hi>Bishops</hi> in this kind towards our Kings: I shall turn back to the <hi>Primitive,</hi> and pure times, which the objecters would have the rule of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to us.</p>
            <p>Not an assembly, but one <hi>Bishop</hi> alone, Saint AMBROSE of <hi>Millan,</hi> held <hi>Theodosius</hi> the most Christian Emperor under excommunication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove eight moneths together, drove him from the Church in the presence of his Nobles, which the good Emperor bore with heroick <hi>humility,</hi> and never ceas't by prayers, and teares, till he was absolv'd, for which coming to the Bishop with <hi>Supplication</hi> into the <hi>Salutatory,</hi> some out Porch of the Church, he was charg'd by him of tyrannicall madnes against GOD, for comming into holy ground. At last upon conditions ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd, and after great <hi>humiliation</hi> approaching to the Altar to offer (as those thrise pure times then thought meet) he had scarse with-drawne his hand, and stood a while, when a bold Arch-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con comes in the Bishops name, and chaces him from within the railes telling him peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the place wherein he stood, was for none
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96875:43"/>
but the <hi>Priests</hi> to enter, or to touch: and this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother peece of pure <hi>Primitive Divinity.</hi> Thinke yee then our Bishops will forgoe the power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication on whomsoever? No certainly, unlesse to compasse sinister ends, and then revoke when they see their time. And yet this most mild, though withall dredfull, and inviolable Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of <hi>Christs</hi> diadem excommunication servs for nothing with them, but to prog, and pandar for fees, or to display their pride and sharpen their revenge, debarring men the protection of the Law, and I remember not whether in some cases it bereave not men all right to their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goods, and Inheritanees besides the deniall of Christian buriall. But in the Evangelical, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed use of this sacred censure, no such prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, no such <hi>Jscariotical</hi> drifts are to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that <hi>Spirituall</hi> doom, and sentence, should invade worldly possession, which is the rightfull lot and portion, even of the wicke dest men, as frankly bestow'd upon them by the al-dispensing bounty, as <hi>rain,</hi> and <hi>Sun-shine.</hi> No, no, it seekes not to bereave or destroy the body, it seekes to saue the Soule by humbling the body, not by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, or pecuniary mulct, much lesse by stripes or bonds, or disinheritance, but by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly admonishment, and Christian rebuke, to cast it into godly sorrow, whose end is joy, and ingenuous bashfulnesse to sin: if that can not be wrought, then as a tender Mother takes her Child and holds it over the pit with scarring
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96875:44"/>
words, that it may learne to feare, where dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is, so doth excommunication as deerly, and as freely without money, use her wholsome and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving terrors, she is instant, she beseeches, by all the deere, and sweet promises of SALVATION she entices and woos, by all the threatnings, and thunders of the <hi>Law,</hi> and rejected <hi>Gosspel</hi> she charges, and adjures; this is all her Armory, her munition, her Artillery, then she awaites with long-sufferance, and yet ardent zeale. In briefe, there is no act in all the errand of <hi>Gods Ministers</hi> to man-kind, wherein passes more loverlike contestation betweene CHRIST and the Soule of a regenerate man lapsing, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and in, and after the sentence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. As for the fogging proctorage of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, with such an eye as strooke <hi>Gehezi</hi> with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosy, and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> with a curse, so does she looke, and so threaten her firy whip against that banking den of theeves that dare thus baffle, and buy and sell the awfull, and majestick wrincles of her brow. He that is rightly and apostolically sped with her invisible arrow, if he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be at peace in his Soule, and not smel within him the brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of Hell, may have faire leave to tell all his baggs over undiminish't of the least farding, may eat his dainties, drinke his wine, use his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, enjoy his Lands, and liberties, not the least skin rais'd, not the least haire misplac't for all that excommunication has done: much more may a King injoy his rights, and Prerogatives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowr'd,

untouch'd, and be as absolute, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat a King, as all his royalties and revenu's can make him. And therefore little did <hi>Theodosius</hi> fear a plot upon his Empire when he stood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicat by Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> though it were done either with much hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
