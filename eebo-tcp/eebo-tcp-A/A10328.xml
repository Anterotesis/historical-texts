            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ A Letter of Doctor <hi>Reinolds</hi> to his friend concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>his aduice for the study</hi> of Diuinity. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Must request you to impute to my businesses, which haue diuerse waies troubled me, not to lacke of good will, my slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is not hitherto answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your letters. Which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure your selfe, if I had been able, I would haue sooner answered, so much the more willingly, the better I liked of them, as being sure wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of your good will to
<pb facs="tcp:512:3"/>
me ward, and desire of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse: whereof for the one I haue heartily to thank you; for the other greatly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice with you. Then to shew my iudgement concerning the order which you may best follow in the study of diuinity, I can tell you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready better read in others and doe know your selfe. Howbeit to satisfie your lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing request, I will briefly mention the chiefest points in my iudgement, which are to be regarded: which if you well consider, and earnestly doe follow, as I trust you will, and God grant you may, your labour shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:512:3"/>
to the aduancement of Gods glory, the profit of his Church, &amp; your own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort</p>
            <p>The chiefest point of all, to begin withis, sith that diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the knowledge of God, is the water of life; the vessell must be cleane that shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue so precious a liquor: the house must be clensed that shal haue Gods holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not only a guest, but also a continual dweller in it. God forbid you should thinke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity consists of words, as wood doth of trees, diuinity without godlinesse doth but condemne consciences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the day of vengeance, and prouoke the wrath of the mighty Lord, and make
<pb facs="tcp:512:4"/>
more inexcusable before the seat of iudgement. I will not ad, that true diuinity cannot be learned, vnlesse we frame our hearts and minds wholly to it. But I will desire you to consider that, only, that as the Poet saith, <hi>Symcrum est nisi vas, quodcun<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> infundis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesssit:</hi> so it is written in the book of Wisedome, <hi>Wisedom cannot enter into the heart of a wicked man, nor dwell in a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that is subiect vnto sinne.</hi> I hope there is no great cause of standing vpon this point, when I write vnto you, who are, as I trust, the chosen of God, and therefore appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted also to be sanctified. Yet sith your selfe haue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:512:4"/>
vnto me your owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse kind of liuing (as you doe terme it;) as you loue me, take heed that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missenesse be not the same in a mans mind, which a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is in the body. And in this, to conclude, consider with your selfe, that if the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens at their sacrifices were wont to cry out, <hi>Procul ô pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul este profani:</hi> what study of holinesse ought there to be in vs, whom God hath adopted, Christ hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the holy Ghost hath sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to be a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnto God, zealous of good works: which if it be required at the hands of all christians, what shal be asked
<pb facs="tcp:512:5"/>
at theirs, who studying diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to instruct others, shold shine themselues as lights in the middest of a lewd ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration? Shall he euer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade others to embrace godlinesse, that hath not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded himselfe that it is a pearle to be redeemed with all treasures?</p>
            <p>For the study it selfe, which is next to be considered, the knowledge of God must be learned of God, if euer it be learned. Of whom that we may learne it, we haue to vse two meanes, prayers and reading of holy scripture. Praiers, our selues to talke with God; reading, to heare God talke with vs. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:512:5"/>
without the grace of the holy spirit, all study, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in diuinity, is vaine: therefore we must earnestly desire of God that he will enlighten our minds, and sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our hearts, both to know and follow his will reuealed to vs. Now because the holy spirit doth teach the same doctrine which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did, which is set forth vnto vs in the Law, and the Prophets, and the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists: therefore we must dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently giue our selues to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and meditating of the holy scriptures in tongues in which they were written by the holy Spirit. Which how much more forcible it
<pb facs="tcp:512:6"/>
is then to be doubtfull among translations, if S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> did not show, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth a christian preacher that the knowledge of the Hebrew and Greek tongues is very necessary to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the old and new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament: yet <hi>Themistocles</hi> might shew, who hauing to speake to the king of Persia, was afraid that his minde would not be perceiued by interpreters, and therefore requested the king to grant him first a yeeres space to learne the Persian tongue. Wherefore I wish that you also ioyne Hebrew to your Greeke, though peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you haue once began it,
<pb facs="tcp:512:6"/>
and giuen it ouer. For in that you may follow me, sith you propose my example, so much the better, who my selfe, when I was first Master of Arts, began the study of it, and being weary, left it: the next yeer perceiuing the necessary vse of it, I set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vpon it, and I thanke God, since continued a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in it. Wherefore the word of God, and that, if it may be, out of the very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, not out of the brooks of translations (if I may so tearme them) must be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently read, and by often reading made familiar vnto vs, though it be not in all places throughly vnderstood
<pb facs="tcp:512:7"/>
as the same <hi>Austin</hi> hath very well noted. As for the parts of scripture (besides this continuall reading of the whole) to be read first ouer with more diligence then the rest, I will giue you the same counsell which I heard of Doctor <hi>Villerius</hi> giuen to yong students, that first you take your greatest trauaile with the helpe of some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned interpreter, in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing S. Iohns Gospell and the Epistle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, the summe of the new Testament: <hi>Esay</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and the Psalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the summe of the old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Howbeit in the rest, you shall doe well also if in harder pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:512:7"/>
you vse the iudgement of some godly writer, as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> who haue written best on the most part of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And because it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to ioyne the reading of some compend of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and summe of all diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, together with the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I would wish you to trauaile painfully in <hi>Caluins Institution</hi> of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whereby you shall be greatly profited not only to the vnderstanding of the scriptures, whereof it is a brief and learned commentary: but also to the perceiuing of points of doctrine, whither all things doe pertaine, and
<pb facs="tcp:512:8"/>
may of vs be applied. Of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reading of Doctors and histories &amp; other treatises of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I wil not adde at this present: we may hereafter (if God will) at greater leisure, when these things are done which must bee laid for the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, more conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly talk. Howbeit, if sometimes to recreate your selfe, you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingle with grauer studies the reading ouer of the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ecclesiasticall, especially as it is written more for our country by good M. <hi>Fox,</hi> you shal receiue of it, togither with great profit, great delectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>I had almost forgotten your two last points, <hi>Quae ratio an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notandi, Quae exercitatio adhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benda,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:512:8"/>
I haue so little to say of them. For touching noting, you know I do not like the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon custom of common places. The best in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is to note in the marge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or in some paper booke for that purpose, the summe and method of that which you read. As for examples sake, M. <hi>Bunnie</hi> hath done very wel in <hi>Caluins</hi> Institutions, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his method and sum of euery sectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in his <hi>Compe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio</hi> &amp;c. which book you may wel ioyn with the reading of <hi>Caluin,</hi> to vnderstand his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; method the better. For the other, which is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, it wil be good somtimes to occupie your pen either
<pb facs="tcp:512:9"/>
at large or briefly, as you list, of such godly meditations as the reading of the scriptures shall offer vnto you; praiers vnto God, reprouing of sin, commending of godlinesse, exhorting to righteousnesse, dehorting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iniquity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation in miseries, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the truth, refuting of heresies, &amp; taking an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of doing these things som tims to other of your friends (a liuely and godly exercise,) whereby you may perfit them, or your self at the least. If you cannot find such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to others, I pray write to mee sometime of doubtes that you may find, or whatsoeuer you list, and
<pb facs="tcp:512:9"/>
I will acknowledge my selfe in that respect as in others, beholding to you.</p>
            <p>Now if God giue you grace, as earnestly to follow these things, as you haue been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous that I should prescribe them: you see the learning of the Hebrew tongue, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the scripturs, of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned interpreters, of the sum of religion, of noting what you read, and your exercise therin, these things require much time, &amp; a mind attent; to speak nothing of prayers, and the study of godlinesse, which will also require some meditation. <hi>Laborandum, mi Iohannes, non luxuriandum.</hi> You know what <hi>Tullie</hi> saith
<pb facs="tcp:512:10"/>
for <hi>Caelius,</hi> that to the bare attaining of eloquence <hi>omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendae sunt omnes voluptates, relinque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da studia delectationis iocus, ludus, conuiuium, sermo pene familiarium deserendus.</hi> You know what <hi>Plato</hi> saith of his Philosopher, what a great <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> he would haue him, if euer he shall be admitted a man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to gouerne his city. If eloquence, if philosophie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire such trauaile for ciuill and base things (in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison:) what shall we think that the knowledge of God, the study of diuinity, desireth for the greatnesse, &amp; for the worthines deserueth. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will take such pains
<pb facs="tcp:512:10"/>
or no, or whether you will fly al entiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts from it, I do not know; I pray God you may.
