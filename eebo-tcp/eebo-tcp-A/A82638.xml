         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>THe Lords and Commons in Parliament, conſidering
with much tenderneſſe and compaſſion, the miſerable
condition of this Kingdome, diſtracted, and diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with many preſent evils, &amp; imminent dangers, and brought
now to ſuch an height of extremity of miſery, that two Engliſh
Armies are neere together, even ready to joyne in a dreadfull
and bloody encounter, through the violent and wicked coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of thoſe, who have captivated both the Perſon and the
power of the King, to their owne impious and Trayterous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
doe thereupon thinke good to publiſh and declare the
ſame to the Kingdome, together with ſome directions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
which may prevent that utter deſolation and ruine,
both of Religion and liberty, already overwhelmed and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
in the intention and hope of thoſe Rebels and Traytors
about the King, to which purpoſe it is deſired by both Houſes,
that all wel-affected Subjects may take notice of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>That the King by the help &amp; aſſiſtance of the Papiſts, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall
and corrupt part of the Clergy, the Delinquent No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry, and by the confluence of ſome notable
Traytors from beyond the Seas, the Lord <hi>Digby, Oneale,</hi> and
others, and of many deſperate mercenary and ill-affected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
from all parts of the Kingdome, hath raiſed an Army,
armed, clothed, and fed, for the moſt part with the ſpoyles of
his Subjects, giving them liberty to plunder and rob all ſorts
of people; to exact money and plate from Corporations, by
threatning fire, and ſword, if they ſhould refuſe it.</p>
            <p>That this wicked counſell doth not onely hinder his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
<pb facs="tcp:171277:2"/>
from exerciſing the juſtice and protection of a King to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his people, but even that honour which is obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Enemies; for by a confident inſtrument of his Majeſty,
Sir <hi>Iohn Hinderſon</hi> a Papiſt (as we are credibly informed) one
<hi>David Alexander</hi> was urged to kill Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> telling him
it would be a good ſervice both to God and the King, which
he refuſed to doe, ſaying it was the worke of a Butcher, and
not of a Souldier; This <hi>Alexander</hi> being a Scotchman, of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
poor fortune, and of a mind fit for deſperate attempts. The
King ſent for him 2, while he was at <hi>Beverley,</hi> and when he came
to his preſence, he ſpake to him publikely in the field, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
a ſum of money to be given him, which he received.</p>
            <p>After which another propoſition was made to him by the
ſame Sir <hi>John Hinderſon,</hi> that he would put fire to the Magazine
of the Army raiſed by the Parliament, &amp; to gain the better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to effect it, that he ſhould labor to get ſome imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the train of Artilery, which he accordingly undertook,
&amp; endeavoured to obtain; But before he could effect his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
intention, he was diſcovered, apprehended, &amp; exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and thereupon confeſt the practiſe, and undertaking, the
particulars whereof are referred to the examinations thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
taken. That the King doth ſend out Letters to borrow
great ſums, profeſſing that thoſe who will not lend him mony,
doe give him juſt cauſe to ſuſpect their duty to his Perſon,
and the peace of the Kingdome. And this will be a ſufficient
reaſon to make them lyable to be plundered and ſpoyled of all
they have; but ſuch is the violence of the Kings Army, that
their friends are in little better caſe then they who oppoſe
them, and thoſe who eſcape beſt muſt yet feed and billet the
Souldiers for nothing.</p>
            <p>In thoſe places where the trained bands are willing to go forth
to ſerve in his Maj. Army, yet for the moſt part their Armes
are taken from them and put upon thoſe who are more
mercenary, and leſſe intereſſed in the Common Wealth, and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:171277:3"/>
likely to be fitter inſtruments of Rapine and Spoyle.</p>
            <p>By theſe great violences and oppreſſions they have ſo exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
thoſe parts that his Majeſty cannot ſtay long about <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and it is the earneſt deſire of the Cavaliers that he would
march forward towards <hi>London,</hi> thoſe rich and fruitfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
in the way being like to yeeld them a ſupply of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,
and the wealth of <hi>London</hi> a full ſatisfaction of their
hope, where they likewiſe thinke to find a party which upon
his Majeſties approach may make ſome diſturbance, and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
their deſignes upon the City.</p>
            <p>That if the Kings Army prevaile, the good Subjects can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
nothing but that their lives and fortunes will be expoſed
to the malice and rapine of thoſe ravenous Souldiers, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
talk of cutting the Throats of honeſt and Religious men, &amp;
have long expected their goods &amp; eſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the rewards of their
ſervice; the Kingdome will againe fall under the government
of thoſe miſchievous counſells, who before this Parliament,
had even brought both religion and liberty to ruine; and wee
ſhall have no hope left of any more Parliaments, but ſuch as
ſhall beconcurrent and ſubſervient to theſe ends.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>The meanes of curing and preventing theſe evills and dangers,

               </head>
               <p>That good proviſion be made by loane and contribution
for the Army raiſed by the Parliament, under the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which is no whit inferiour in Horſe
and Foot to the Kings Army, better armed, full payd, reſtrained
from diſorder and Rapine, as much as may be; well provided
of all outward neceſſaries; but above all, well incouraged and
inſtructed in the goodneſſe of the cauſe, by the labour of many
godly and painfull Divines.</p>
               <p>That this Army bee allwayes ready to attend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
of the Kings Army, either in one body or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as there ſhall bee occaſion, according to the wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and direction of the Lord Generall, that ſo no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity

of fighting upon advantage be loſt, nor the greedie
Souldiers of the Kings Army ſuffered to range, and ſpoyle the
Country at their pleaſure.</p>
               <p>That the Countries through which the Kings Army is to
paſſe doe aſſociate themſelves, and draw all their Forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for the mutuall defence of their perſons and goods from
Oppreſſion and Spoyle.</p>
               <p>That thoſe Counties be required to ſend in all their Horſes
fit for carriage and for Dragoones as well for the Aſſiſtance of
the Lord Generall, for which in convenient time they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſatisfaction, As likewiſe that by ſuch meanes theſe Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
may be kept from being imployed by the Kings Army.</p>
               <p>That command and direction be given to all Lieutenants of
Counties and deputy Lieutenants, that all the Trained-Bands
and all Voluntiers be put into a readineſſe to be brought to
ſuch Randezvous, and to be obedient to ſuch Commanders in
chiefe as ſhall be appointed by the Committee for the ſafety
of the Kingdome, or by the Lord Generall, that ſo the Kings
Army may find oppoſition in every place as they paſſe, and the
Inhabitants may have at hand a ſufficient protection &amp; defence,
and the Lord Generall may ſtrengthen his own Army with theſe
Forces, as he ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>
               <p>That Powder, Munition, and Ordnance, with all other
neceſſaries be prepared for theſe forces, that ſo without any
trouble or confuſion, they may be brought together, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>That all thoſe who in the City of London, or any other place,

likewiſe all others, who being able, ſhall not lend or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

of ſo great and imminent danger.</p>
               <p>That it be commended to the ſerious conſideration of thoſe

ſuccour his Maieſty in this impious and unnaturall warre, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom it may be hoped there are ſome honeſt men, and
Proteſtants, what it is that moves them in this Quarell.</p>
               <p>Is it for feare of ſome Innovations and alteration? of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or Church Governement? let ſuch as are poſſeſt with this
vaine and cauſeleſſe apprehenſion, know, that nothing is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
or deſired, but to take away the government by Biſhops,
which hath bin ſo conſtantly, evidently, miſchievous, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to the Church and ſtate; and ſuch other things as ſhall
be found to be iuſtly offenſive, and nothing to be ſetled and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced,
but by authority of Parliament after conſultation
firſt had with an aſſembly of learned and reverend Divines.</p>
               <p>Is it to uphold the authority, prerogative, and Honour of
the King and to preſerve the ſafety of his Royall Perſon? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Parliament is and ever hath beene ready to doe any thing
that belongs to them to ſecure all theſe, which they have often
teſtified by many humble petitions to his Maieſty.</p>
               <p>If there be no cauſe for any of theſe reſpects, to ſeeke the
deſtruction of the Parliament and the blood and ruine of their
kindred, friends and acquaintance, what remains then to be the
matter of the quarrell, and the motives of ſuch great combuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,
and the effects and conſequences of their victory if they
ſhould prevaile? That Prieſts, Ieſuits, &amp; the <hi>Popes Nuncioes</hi> may
domineere &amp; govern in the Kings Counſel as heretofore, that
the Arch Biſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Yorke</hi> and their Suffragans
may ſuppreſſe diligent and powerfull preaching, and banniſh
and oppreſſe all the moſt pious and beſt affected Subiects of the
Kingdome, &amp; introduce the Popiſh Religion under a proteſtant
profeſſion, till they have ſtrength and boldneſſe to caſt off the

            <head>The Examination of Sir Balthaſar Gerbier, taken
the 8. of October 1642.</head>
            <p>HEe ſayes, he knowes one <hi>David Alexander</hi> a Scotch-man,
and hath knowne him long, and has had diſcourſe lately
with him.</p>
            <p>He ſayes, the ſaid <hi>David Alexander</hi> ſaid he had a propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made to him to kill ſome body, but none named to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant,
he anſwered, that to kill a man was fit for a hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
but any generous act befitting a ſouldier he would doe.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſaid that Colonell <hi>Hinderſon</hi> made
this propoſition at the Court, he ſayes that act was propoſed;
That another propoſition was made by the ſame perſon that
he ſhould get a place in the Traine of Artillery, and getting
knowledge where the Magazine was, to doe his beſt to fire it,
and this he entertained, and was received, and had money given
him, and beſides Colonell <hi>Hinderſon,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Endymion
Porter</hi> ſpoke alſo concerning the ſame buſineſſe to him.</p>
            <p>This Examinant ſayes, he knowes not whether <hi>Alexander,
Hinderſon,</hi> and M. <hi>Endymion Porter</hi> ſpoke of the ſame at the
ſame time, nor did he tell him what ſum of Money hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
nor did hee ſpeake of any other Promiſes: upon the
third of this Inſtant, at nine of the clocke this diſcourſe
was, which he noted in his Table-booke. Then deſiring to
looke in his Table-Booke, the Examinant further rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
That hee having occaſion to uſe ſome mans ſervice
to the Court, with the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſadour, according to
his place, he ſent to this <hi>David Alexander,</hi> to know if he would
goe along with him, the ſaid <hi>David</hi> told him he could not go;
the Examinant wondred at it, knowing his poverty, and asked
the reaſon, the reupon he ſaid he had ſome ſervice to doe, and
the Examinant being his old friend, he would deal plainly with
him, and tell him, and ſaid it was of that nature, that it was as
much worth as his life to diſcover, the Examinant wondred at
<pb facs="tcp:171277:6"/>
it, and made ſome difficulty to know it; but he anſwered that
in the Lord <hi>Buckinghams</hi> time he had been his friend, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to him he would tell it, and put his life into his hands:
The Examinant ſaid, why wilt thou put thy life into ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?
then he ſaid he was diſpatcht and had received money for
it to apply himſelfe to the Army, and to endeavour to get a
place about the Artillery, to the end to take a time to fire the
Magazine; which he ſaid you know I can doe by an inſtrument
made like a watch, which having gone for ſo many houres then
ſtrikes fire, he ſaid he had applyed himſelfe to Sir <hi>William Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
to be recommended by him, but was put off, onely had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to him 14 s. <hi>per diem</hi> for a Serjeant Majors place of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooners,
or ſome ſervice for <hi>Ireland;</hi> but he refuſed it, as not
fit for him, ſaying, that he was more proper for fire workes
and Artillery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſaid further, that meeting <hi>Dulbier,</hi> hee
told him, how now <hi>David,</hi> thou doſt not come hither for the
ſervice againſt thoſe from whence you come, he ſaid no; and
then reſolved to apply himſelfe to Sir <hi>Iohn Meldram,</hi> by whom
he was to be preſented to the houſe the third of this inſtant: he
deſired this Examinant to take this relation from him and to
acquaint the King with it, to whom it would be acceptable to
know what was become of him, &amp; he could not write it himſelf,
and therefore wiſht this Examinant to write it in his Table.
booke: This Examinant ſaid he would put it into his Table-booke,
and ſaid how ſhould I venture to tell this to the King,
or know it to be true; and he ſaid the King would ſoone know
that, and it will be an honour to you to be ſo truſted, ſo he
concluded his diſcouſe with preſenting a Scotchman to this
Examinant in his journey, the Scotchman was his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a Solicitor here for one <hi>Gordan</hi> the Kings Agent at
<hi>Hamburgh;</hi> but this Examinant took only his name, and liking
not his aſpect, promiſed to ſend him ſome other time.</p>
