         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

diligently as we
ought (men,
brethren &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,) consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
&amp; obserue,
Gods vnspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
mercy &amp; goodnesse towards
our English nation; not onely in
the fruition and continuance of
such vncomparable peace and
prosperitie aboue other countries
and king domes, and in the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
and excellent knowledge of
liberall Artes and the learned lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages:
but also (and that most
<pb facs="tcp:15090:3"/>
eminently) in the pure and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
preaching of Christ his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Gospell, in so many places and
parishes. Wee cannot but iudge
and acknowledge our selues to be
highly beloued, and admirably
blessed of Almighty God. But
contrariwise, if wee marke and
take notice of the merueilous
abuses of our peace and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
the exceeding contempt of
Artes and good learning, and
(that, which most aggrauateth
our iudgement) the generall neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of piety, and the horrible hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
of many in the profession
of sincere religion, and withall
call to remembrance the sundrie
and fearefull (if not ominous,)
warnings and iudgements that
God hath inflicted vpon vs in
these few last yeares, wee then
haue iust cause to feare, that God
<pb facs="tcp:15090:3"/>
hath reserued vs to some more
dangerous plagues, and that hee
will by degrees strip and depriue
vs of all his mercies. Wherefore
least wee should take ouer-much
offence at the prophanesse and
hypocrisie of the mvltitude, and
hereby faile and shrinke in our
holy courses and exercises of
godlinesse, or else should deceiue
our owne soules, because wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
an outward forme and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of holinesse, and because
our outward tranquillitie &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
yet continueth: two points
and conclusions must heedfully
be considered of vs. First, that the
number of sincere Christians and
vndissembling Gospellers, is very
rare: they are in comparison of
them that perish, but a <hi>remnant,</hi> a
<hi>gleaning</hi> after the haruest or vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
a small flock, one of a Tribe,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:4"/>
and two of a Citie. The truth of
this assertion most euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in the time of any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Apostacie and persecution,
1. Reg. 19. 14. Apoc. 12. ver. 5. and
6. and chapt. 13. ver. 7. and 8. and
shall be made manifest to all the
world, at Christ his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
when he shal scarcely finde
sauing faith vpon the earth. <hi>Luke.
18. ver.</hi> 7. 8. Therfore we may not
define and measure the truth of
religion by the esteeme and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of the erring multitude, but
wee must make Gods word the
onely rule and touchstone of our
faith and life. Secondly, for the
auoiding and preuenting of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
which maketh vs odious
both to God and men, wee must
not so much (in a curious humor)
desire to know strange mysteries,
as to know that which most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
<pb facs="tcp:15090:4"/>
vs, and to make a good
vse and apply of our knowledge.
Againe, wee must in all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and profession of religion,
propound to our selues no sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
ends. As for example, wee
must not intend gaine but god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
not credit amongst men
(onely) but the glorie of God;
not policie, but piety, and not
the aduancing of our outward
state, but the amendment of our
liues, and the saluation of our
soules; and hereby we shall nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and vnfallibly distinguish our
selues from all hypocrites what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.
Lastly, we must with the
woman in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> cloath
our selues with the sunne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
and tread the Moone,
that is, all changeable and transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
things vnder our feete, and
wee must with the wise Virgins,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:5"/>
whiles it is the time of grace, and
the day of saluation, prouide our
selues of the oyle of true saith,
get the garment of true holinesse
and keepe it vndefiled; and in
hope and patience waite long, and
wish for, the second comming of
Christ, when the mariage shall be
eternally solemnized betweene
the Bridegroome and vs in the
highest heauens. This doing we
shall be happy and blessed here
in hope and beginning, and after
this mortall life ended, in act and
perfection. And because, next
vnto the sacred ministery of the
word, and the spirituall exercises
of Christians, the publishing of
sound and elaborate treatises, are
a singular helpe and furtherance
herevnto, I, (in the mediocritie
of my skill) for the direction of
those that be well disposed, haue

verse set downe their contrary euents

the sincere and vndissembling Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<hi>went with Christ to the wedding,</hi> that
is, they were receiued into heaven, &amp;
vnto the immediate fellowship &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

adiudged and cast into hell. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
our Sauiour exhorteth all men <hi>to

               <p>Now according to the difference
and diuersity of persons, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>wise

different euents and iudgements, are
to be obserued and handled.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>wise virgins,</hi> three heads or
points are to be considered First their

<hi>wise virgins.</hi> Secondly, their readinesse
and fitnesse therevnto in these termes,
<hi>they that were ready.</hi> Lastly, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation
of the marriage in these
words, <hi>Went with him to the wedding.</hi>
Of all these points I will speake in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and afterwards (<hi>God assisting)</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to propound and handle the most
different estate &amp; iudgment of the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<hi>virgins.</hi> In the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract diuers points
are contained. As first, that there is
such a contract betwixt Christ and his
Church. Secondly, the forme &amp; nature
of it. Thirdly the benefits &amp; preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
of it: lastly the vses of the doctrin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15090:9"/>
Touching the contract, that there is
such a contract betweene Christ and
the Church, it is plaine and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable
by sundry places of Scripture.
The Lord by the ministery of <hi>Esaias</hi>
the Prophet, whom he sent vnto <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies</hi>
to comfort him and his people
against the blasphemies and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
speeches of <hi>railing Rabsaketh,</hi> the
seruant of the King of <hi>Assur</hi> thus sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
and saluteth the Church. This is
the word that the Lord hath against
him. <hi>The virgin, the daughter of Syon
hath despised thee, and laughed thee to
scorne; the daughter of Ierusalem hath
shaken her head at thee, Isay.</hi> 57. 22. The
Church is distinguished and adorned
with the title of <hi>Virgin.</hi> Because shee
was consecrated and espoused to God
alone, and his true worship; as a virgin
to her onely bridegroome or husband.
Likewise <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 10. Hearken <hi>O
daughter</hi> and consider &amp; incline thine
eare, &amp;c. So shall the King haue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in thy beauty <hi>for hee is thy Lord
and worship thou him.</hi> Heere <hi>Solomon</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15090:9"/>
representeth Christ, and King <hi>Pharaoes</hi>
daughter that was married to him, the
Church of the Gentiles espoused and
affianced to Christ. Thirdly the Lord
by <hi>Hosea</hi> speaketh; <hi>I will marry thee
vnto me for euer, I will marry thee vnto
mee in faithfulnesse.</hi> Hos. 2. 19. 20. In
the Canticl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, the Church by force of
this contract maketh claime to Christ,
saying; <hi>My beloued is mine, and I am
his, &amp;c.</hi> Cant. 2. 16. <hi>Paul</hi> shewing his
vnfeigned affection to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
who in part (missed by false Apostles)
began without cause to distaste him,
maketh this protestation. <hi>I am iealous
ouer you with a godly iealousie, for I haue
prepared you for one</hi> husband <hi>to present
you as a pure virgin to Christ.</hi> 2. Cor.
11. 2. In the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> the Church is

                  </gap>strate
a spirituall coniunction and
contract betweene Christ and the
elect. Lastly, not to dwell long vpon
<pb facs="tcp:15090:10"/>
authorities, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> most notably &amp;
manifestly in the allegorie of the <hi>Vine</hi>
and the branches, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15. 1. 2. 3. 4.
shadoweth and setteth out vnto vs,
the nature of the coniunction, for as
the Vine doth yeeld and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
life and nourishment to the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and the branches receiue and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it from the Vine: so Christ the
noble Vine, that hath life in himselfe,
and of himselfe, and that is full of
grace and truth, doth infuse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
spirituall life, comfort and
grace vnto his seuerall members; and
the Church being ingrafted into him,
draweth and receiueth the same from
him by the hand and instrument of
faith.</p>
               <p>Whereas therefore the true Church
of God, consisting aswell of marryed
persons as vnmarried, yea for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part in all times and ages of those
that bee marryed; thus the holye
scriptures, and experience and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of all pure and holye Churches
doe testifie; is in respect of their sound
<pb facs="tcp:15090:10"/>
faith onely, and firme hope in Christ,
and sincere loue; stiled by the name
of <hi>Virgins:</hi> it serueth to check and
condemne the error of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who from these and like places
of Scripture taketh occasion, and
would needs prooue, that virginitie
and single life, is a state in it selfe farre
more holy and acceptable before God
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mariage, yea that it is meritorious
and a type of the perfection of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and here-vpon they forbid
their Bishoppes, Ptiests, Deacons,
Monkes, Iesuits, &amp;c. to marry, tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
notwithstanding and allowing
the Stewes, concubines, hatlots, and
all manner of vncleannesse. They vrge
and commend Virginity, with as much
conscience and equity, as the theefe
doth truth, the drunken man sobriety,
and the glutton abstinence. For it is
notoriously knowne to the world, not
onely what vnchaste hearts they carry,
and in what lusts they burne; but how
filthily they liue, that amongst the rest
would be accounted the most holy &amp;
exquisite.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15090:11"/>
But briefly to refute their error, wee
thus prooue, that virginity is not a state
more holy in it selfe before God then
marriage, much lesse meritorious. First
God in the old Testament, and Christ
in the New, allowed and permitted
marriage to Priests, Prophets, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kes,
Apostles, Euangelists and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
aswell as any others. If there had
beene any vnholinesse in their marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
or virginity estate for them, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
better or more necessary,
God in his wisedome would haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
ordered it. Secondly, marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is honorable in all men, it hath his
chastity, it is for the comfort of man,
the medicine of incontinence, the
meane to preserue the world, and the
seminary of the faithfull, therefore in it
selfe not inferiour to a single life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if single life were so holy and
meritorious a state before GOD, as
they would make it, then all vnmarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
persons should be so. But the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Absolon, Adoniah,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudas,</hi> &amp;c.
euince the contrarye. Secondly, it
<pb facs="tcp:15090:11"/>
should bee without the least taint of
concupiscence. Thirdly, the Scriptures
would auerre and auouch it. Fourthly,
albeit virginity and single life in times
of generall persecution be more to be
wished, and more conuenient then
marriage; yet then <hi>Paul</hi> rather wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that all men in respect of the time
present were such, then commandeth
and inioyneth them. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 7. For he
leauerh them to their liberties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
this occurrence of affliction and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
seemeth to bee a principall cause
why Bishops &amp; Ministers so sparingly
were married in the Primitiue church,
for some 200 yeares after the Apostles
decease. Lastly, I conclude with Saint
Augustine; <hi>Melius est humile coniugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
quàm superba virginitas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, in that the true Church
is called by the name of <hi>Virgin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Obser.</note> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

they put out the light of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

               <p>Secondly wee must entirely and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly

               <p>

1. <hi>louers of pleasures
more then God.</hi> Wherfore let vs auoide
all hipocrisie and loue Christ sincerely,
for as Christ himselfe is simple &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
in his nature, and in his promises,
loue and workes, towards vs, so let vs
labor in some good conformity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
and carry our selues to him.</p>
               <p>And thus much touching the first branch
viz. that there is such a contract and
of the vses of it.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The second</hi> point to be considered
in this spiritual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract or vnion, is the
<hi>definition, nature and forme</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>This contract therfore is that mistical
&amp; spiritual, yet real &amp; substantial vnion
&amp; coniunction between Christ and the
Church, whereby they are made one
flesh, and by special compact &amp; consent
haue right &amp; interest one in another,
yea &amp; abide and dwel one in an other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15090:13"/>
In the clearing and manifestation
hereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> three particulars are to bee
handled, first that this coniunction is
onely spirituall, not naturall, or carnall.
Secondly, that it is reall and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
and lastly the order and manner
of it is to be touched.</p>
               <p>It is mysticall and spirituall, first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the persons betweene whom it
is made, <hi>viz. Christ</hi> (as man) and the
Church militant, are farre distant in
place, and therefore it cannot bee any
naturall or carnall coniunction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because the meanes and
manner of working it are spirituall, it
needs must be spirituall also. Now it
is wrought &amp; effected not by nerues,
bonds, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inews, as this naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
betweene the body and the
soule is caused, but by the spirit of
Christ, which he sendeth from heauen
into vs; and by our faith, stirred vp by
his spirit, whereby we send it vp againe
to him: so that this coniunction must
needs bee as spirituall, so relatiue and
mutuall. First therefore that Christ
<pb facs="tcp:15090:13"/>
sendeth his spirit into vs, and that the
same spirit that dwelleth in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and filleth it with all graces
aboue measure, is deriued thence and
dwelleth in all the true members, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vp and working in vs faith and
strength whereby we apprehend him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
loue whereby wee affect him, and all
other graces needfull for euery mans
saluation, it is pregnantly prooued by
these places of scripture following<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the like. <hi>Hee giueth vs of his spirit
and hereby wee know that he dwelleth in
vs and we in him,</hi> Iohn 4. 14. God hath
sent forth the spirit of his sonne into
our hearts which crieth <hi>Abba</hi> father
Gal. 46. Lastly the church is the <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of God.</hi> Eph. 2. 22. and the temple
of God. 1. Cor. 6. 19. Secondly our
faith ascendeth vp to Christ. Acts. 7.
56. doth incorporate vs into him.
Ephes. 3. 12. 17. and hereby wee both
<hi>liue</hi> and <hi>dwell</hi> in him, Galath. 2. 20.
But this our faith is spirituall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible,
for wee walke by faith and not
by sight, 2. Cor. 5. 6. And faith is the
<pb facs="tcp:15090:14"/>
ground of things that are hoped for,
and the euidence of things which are
not seene. Heb. 11. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But some perhaps will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
that wee feed vpon Christ in the
Sacrament, we indeed eate his flesh &amp;
drinke his bloud. Iohn. 6. 55. 56. <hi>Ergo</hi>
our vnion is not spirituall. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Albeit, wee really, corporally
and substantially receiue, partake of,
and eare the elements and outward
signes, namely the bread &amp; the wine,
according to Christs institution in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
and representation of his body
broken and his bloud shed, and yet
wee receiue and feede vpon Christ by
faith. For not euery one that eateth
the bread and drinketh the wine in
the Lords supper doth feede vpon
Christ, but onely the true beleeuers;
who feed of him both in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
and also out the Sacrament as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.
Ioh. 6. 17. 51.</p>
               <p>Secondly as the Fathers in the time
of the Law <hi>did all eate</hi> the same spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
meate (that we do) and drinke the
<pb facs="tcp:15090:14"/>
same spirituall drinke, but they did it
onely by faith, which apprehendeth
things to come as present, (for Christ
was not then incarnate, much lesse was
he dead,) euen so we receiue and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of Christ, that is spiritually by
faith and not carnally and substantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
as the Papists imagine. 1. Cor.
10. 3. 4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly Christ is now in heauen &amp;
there contayned,<note place="margin">Ioh, 6. 26.</note> and his body there
glorified, therfore cannot he be eaten
carnally, corporally, substantially, for
hee is many millions of miles distant
hence. Secondly <hi>His body is impassible</hi>
&amp; not subiect to any such indignities.
Thirdly then <hi>Iudas</hi> and all reprobate
and wicked men who receiue the
Sacrament of Christs body and
bloud, should bee saued, <hi>for they that
eate of the bread of life liue for euer.</hi> Ioh.
5. 57. They that eate his flesh &amp; drinke
his bloud dwell in him &amp; he in them.
vers. 56. But they doe not feede vpon
the bodie and bloud of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they want the mouth and
<pb facs="tcp:15090:15"/>
stomack of faith, to receiue and digest
it. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. 63.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the elements of bread and
wine retaine both their names and
natures, euen after the words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration,
as is perspicuous and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by the Scripture. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26. 27.
28. 29. And herevnto accord the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers, as <hi>Augustine, Theodoret,
Tertullian, Cyprian, Chrysostome,</hi> yea
and some of later times among the
Papists, as <hi>Gela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ius</hi> and <hi>Bertram.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi> Christ is not there bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
neither is the bread and wine
conuerted substantially and really into
his body and bloud, therefore as the
absurd doctrine of transubstantiation
is an inuention of later times, and here
ouerthrowne: so must it needs also
follow that our coniunction with him
in this mortalitie must needs bee alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
spirituall.</p>
               <p>The second thing to be considered
in the diffinition, is, that albeit this
contract and vnion is not feigned,
supposed, imagined, or by touching
<pb facs="tcp:15090:15"/>
and commixion: yet it is a true, a reall
and a substantiall vnion, for wee are
substantially vnited to him; our body,
to his body, our soule to his soule, and
our whole person to his whole person,
so that we are <hi>flesh of his flesh and bone
of his bones.</hi> Eph. 5. 30.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Adams</hi> whole person was
really and substantially coupled with
the whole person of <hi>Eue.</hi> So is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Christ and the Church. He is the
head and we the members, hee is the
husband, and we the wife.</p>
               <p>Now in that this contract and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is reall and substantiall,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> it is also
indissoluble and eternall. For first the
Lord saith by <hi>Hosea</hi> (as I haue before
mentioned,) <hi>I will marry thee vnto mee
for euer.</hi> Secondly Christ his power is
infinite, and none can take any out of
his hands, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10. 28. Thirdly, his
loue is constant, whom hee loueth hee
loueth to the end. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 3. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the sauing graces of his spirit, the
proper endowments of his elect, are
without repentance and irreuocable.
<pb facs="tcp:15090:16"/>
Rom. 11. 29.</p>
               <p>Fiftly Christ is an effectual and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
mediator vnto God his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Father for them. Luke. 22. 32.
Heb. 7. 25.</p>
               <p>Lastly if any true and liuely mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Christs body should bee lost,
then either Christ should want either
power, loue, or wisdome, to preserue
and saue it, but hee wanteth none of
them: or els his body should be may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and vnperfect, which can neuer
bee, <hi>for it is his fulnesse.</hi> Ephesians. 1.
23. and hee will in the life to come
make it vnto himselfe a glorious
Church <hi>Without spot or wrinkle, or any
such thing.</hi> Eph. 5. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> Therefore let euery man trie
by the touch-stone of Gods word,
whether he feele the spirit of God in
lightning and renuing him, and faith
purging his heart, and firmely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
and applying Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
his benefits vnto himselfe, if hee
finde himselfe in this estate let him
thanke GOD and by the continuall
<pb facs="tcp:15090:16"/>
and serious vse of the worde, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
prayer and practise of good
workes, maintaine and confirme it,
for doubtlesse hee is a true member
of IESVS CHRIST, ingrafted
into him, and shall thus continue for
euer. For these are not the workes
of flesh and bloud, and meere Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but of the Spirit of GOD and
grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third thing</hi> in the deffinition
to be explained is the <hi>Order of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
touching which wee are to note
that the Church is first vnited vnto
the body and flesh of CHRIST. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
to his soule, and lastly to his
God-head, and so to his whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
and therefore the Scriptures
commonly speake of first, &amp; propound
Christs humanity vnto vs and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his deity. Rom. 1. verse 3. and 4.
Chap. 9. ver. 5. and 6.</p>
               <p>The reason herof is, because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee vnited vnto his deity but by
his flesh, wherin hee wrought our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
for the humane Nature
<pb facs="tcp:15090:17"/>
of Christ is as it were a doore to let vs
into the communion of his deitie, and
the conduict pipe of deity to conuey
and deriue it vnto vs. And as in the
sacraments, the true-beleeuers doe by
the outward signes and symboles as by
instruments receiue the thing signified
<hi>viz,</hi> Christ and his merits: so they also
by the meanes of his humanity, are
made partakers of his God-head, and
so are vnited vnto him.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be considered in
this: contract, is the rare and royall <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi>
and <hi>prerogatiues,</hi> that hereby
flowe and redound vnto vs. First wee
haue from Christ, and from his merits
and sufferings, the foundation and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of our new birth and being:
he is the roote, and wee are the plants,
he the <hi>Vine</hi> and wee the <hi>branches: of
his fulnesse we all receiue grace for grace:</hi>
finally, <hi>we are in him,</hi> who is made vnto
vs of God, <hi>wisedome and righteousnesse,
sanctification and redemption,</hi> Ioh. 15. 2.
Iohn. 1. 16. 1. Cor. 1. 30. Ier. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 5. 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we being contracted vnto
<pb facs="tcp:15090:17"/>
Christ our head and husband, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed
in and partakers of all his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties
and benefits so far forth as may
be, (the proportion and difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weene
the husband and the wife bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
retained) for from the fountaine of
his God-head and conduit of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
are deriued vnto us, his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes;
santification, triumph, glory.
From Christ wee haue, <hi>redemption
through his blood, euen remission of our
sinnes according to his rich grace,</hi> by his
sufferings we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reed and deliuered
from the guilt of our sinnes and the
feare of condemnation, &amp; by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce
to the Law imputed to vs we are
accepted as iust before God and fit for
eternall life. 2. Cor. 5. 19. 21. Apoc. 12. 1,
Now what an vnspeakable benefit is
remission of sinnes, which sinne draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vpon vs all temporall and eternall
plagues &amp; can be by noe other meanes
obtained then by our coniunction with
him Psal. 32. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>Thirdly communicating with Christ
in the vnion of nature, we also (in some
<pb facs="tcp:15090:18"/>
proportion and similitude are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of his <hi>propheticall, priestly, and
Kingly</hi> Office. We are made prophets
to confesse him and to teach and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
others, Priests to mortyfie sinne, to
suffer for Christ, to offer sacrifices of
praise &amp; thankesgiuing vnto him, and
to consecrate our selues, soules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
wholy vnto him. Rom 8. 39. Apo.
1. 6. 1. Peter. 1. 9. Wee are Kings to
fight against the world, the flesh, and
the Deuill, and by faith in him to
ouercome them. 1. Iohn. 4. 5. And
here wee receiue that right in whole,
and dominion in part which we wholy
lost in <hi>Adam.</hi> Math. 19. 28. 1. Cor. 6. 2.
1. Tim. 4. 4. 5.</p>
               <p>Fourthly all Plagues, Aduersities,
Crosses, Punishments, are made but
only temporary and fatherly correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vnto vs, tending to our correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and not our destruction, and
they are medicines to cure our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and not meanes to increase
our miseries. Heb. 12. 6. 10. 11. Pro. 3. 11.
Apoc. 3. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15090:18"/>
Fiftly wee haue all the Angells of
GOD in this life for our good to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
vpon vs and to defend vs. Heb. 1.
14. 2. Kings. 6. 16. 17. Psal. 34 7. And
in the life to come, especially by reason
of this neere and admirable coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with Christ our head and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and because we are made kings
to rule with him, we are &amp; shalbe supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to the Angels, for there is no such
coniunction betwixt his nature and
theirs as betweene his and ours, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall they raigne as Kings with
him in the life to come as the Saints
shall; Apoca. 2 verse. 26. and Chap.
3. verse. 21.</p>
               <p>Sixtly Satan cannot indite and
condemne vs, for as no man can
sue the wife in the lawe, the husband
liuing and not giuing his consent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Soe CHRIST our husband liuing
and alwaies iustifying vs, who shall
condemne vs? Romans 8. 33. 34. or
who shall seperate vs from his loue?
verse. 35.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15090:19"/>
Lastly when the husband, especially
being a mighty Monarch is highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
the wife may and hath free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
vnto him when none other can
or may haue the like liberty; So may
and hath the true Church free acces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
vnto Christ by praier when the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
are debarred from him, and cannot
or dare not approch neere to him.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the benefits
and priuileges.</p>
               <p>Now in the last place follow the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
vses of this contract and vnion.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Vse.</hi> First seeing our vnion with
Christ is <hi>Reall and substantiall</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
for euer, (for we are made one
flesh with him, bone of his bones and
flesh of his flesh) Heb. 2. 14. Eph. 5. 30.
<hi>Ergo</hi> he still (albeit he be glorified) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
the essentiall parts of a true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
body, the quality is onely alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but the substance and dimentions
remaine, for otherwise we could haue
no fellowshippe with him, and so the
foundation of all our comfort should
<pb facs="tcp:15090:19"/>
be rased and ruinated. And therefore
here is condemned the absurd and
grosse errour of them that defie Christs
humanity by making it infinite, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
&amp; knowing al things, and ours
only finite and circumscribed in power
place and knowledge, whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
that which is finite, and that
which is infinite there can be no such
vnion and substantiall coniunction.</p>
               <p>Secondly we must labour &amp; endeuor
alwaies to continue in this vnion and
communion with Christ, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte
an haires breadth from him; for
remayning and abiding in Christ wee
finde all comfort, refreshment and
peace; and being out of him we runne
head-long into all euill; for euen the
Godly themselues, being out of it, and
the efficacy of it but alittle, feele
themselues as it were tormented with
a flame of fire. Psalm. 77. 2. 3. Iob. 6.
verse. 1. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we must beware of and
shunne all Idolatry, errour, atheisme,
fornication, vncleanesse, drunkenesse,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:20"/>
schisme, and all other raigning sinnes
whereby we dissolue and cut in sunder
this vnion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly by reason of this misticall
and straite coniunction betwixt Christ
and the Church, hee hath a simpathy
and feeling of all their wants and
miseries, &amp; though now he be exalted
to the highest degree of glory in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
yet doth he in nothing (as world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men in their exaltation vsually for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
&amp; neglect their old &amp; poore friends
&amp; acquaintance) remit and abate of his
care and compassion towardes his
poore and afflicted members in earth,
but hee succoureth them in all their
extremities, imputeth and rewardeth
any good done vnto them as done to
himselfe, and censureth and reuengeth
the wrongs and indignities offered
them as done to his owne person.</p>
               <p>Hence wee learne diuers lessons
and duties. First we in all our afflictions
and necessities must flee vnto him
and to the throne of grace, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and assurance of faith, and
<pb facs="tcp:15090:20"/>
wee shall find rest vnto our soules and
helpe in time of need. Math. 11. 26.
Heb. 4. 16. For as <hi>Philo</hi> said to the
Iewes his country men, when he could
find no fauour with <hi>Caius</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi>
Emperour) <hi>Vbi deficit humanum
praesidium, ibi necesse est inciperem diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
auxilium,</hi> that is, where mans helpe
fayleth, there Gods must needs begin.</p>
               <p>Secondly wee must doe all possible
good to Gods Saints, wee must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
his bowells, shew them all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and supply their wants, for
then are we liuely and feeling mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and Christ will take notice of all
the comfort wee yeeld them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and regard it both in this life
&amp; in the life to come, bee the offices of
charity neuer so meane so they be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained,
Mat. 25. 35. 36. 40. Luk. 21. 34</p>
               <p>Thirdly me must take heed that we
neuer grieue, wrong, vexe, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Gods deere seruants and saints;
for then wee doe but <hi>fight against
God, kick against the pricks, touch the
apple of GODS owne eye.</hi> Zacha. 2. 8.
<pb facs="tcp:15090:21"/>
                  <hi>grieue hi: spirit,</hi> and procure to our
selues many Iudgments, and if we are
and continue in the number of open
&amp; professed enemies we besides tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
plagues most iustly, draw vpon
our selues eternall vengeance.</p>
               <p>The last vse is, that being <hi>ioynd
and united to Christ the fountaine of all
good workes,</hi> we wust contend and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
to conforme our selues to his
example and bring forth timely and
plentifull fruits of piety, charity, and
iustice. Phil. 1. 11. Tit. 2. 14 Psal. 13.</p>

                  </gap>hem against his second comming:
For as these wise Virgins were before-hand
prepared in faith, grounded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon the scriptures and relying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:15090:21"/>
Christs only merits, in feruent loue
and sincere affection to Christ, and in
hearty desire and earnest expectation
of his comming: so must we also, if we
would be assured of our contract and
vnion which Christ in this life, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
his glorious presence and haue
perfect fellowshippe with him in the
world to come; trimme prepare and
make ready our selues against the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization
of the marriage: and
therefore it is said in the Apocalyps;
<hi>the marriage of the Lambe is come and
the bride hath made her selfe ready.</hi> Apo.
19. 7.</p>
               <p>And so they are presented as a chast
Virgin vnto one husband Iesus Christ.
The truth and necessity of this prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is plainely and plentifully set
forth in the scriptures, whether we
r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>spect Christ as the princypall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                  </gap>ide her selfe, as

trimmeth his spouse the Church, and
<pb facs="tcp:15090:22"/>
therfore the holy company of his elect
are sayd to come downe from heauen,
<hi>prepared as a Bride trimmed for her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi>
Apoc. 21. 2. that is, purged from
all corruption, GOD through Christ
doth make vs meete to bee partakers
of the inheritance <hi>of the saints in light.</hi>
Col. 7. 12. Christ sanctifieth &amp; clenseth
<hi>his Church by the Washing of water
through the word, that he may make it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himselfe a glorious Church, without
spot or wrinckle &amp;c.</hi> Eph. 5, 26, and 27.
The graces that Christ bestoweth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her are as chaines to adorne her, as
Myrrh, Incense and the spices of the
Merchants to persume her, as Purple
and Skarletto clothe her, &amp; as pretious
Iewels to beautifie &amp; enrich her, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shee as Queene standeth, <hi>at his right
hand in a vesture of the gold of Ophir,</hi>
Psalme 45, vers. 9.</p>
               <p>More particularly Christ trimmeth
and prepareth his spouse. First by offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and affording vnto her the means
and ministery of grace and saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as the Preaching of the worde,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:22"/>
Ephesians 4, 11, 12, 13. the seale of
the Sacraments. Mathew 28, 19. 1.
Corinthi. 1, 23, 24, 25, 26. Herevnto
may be added troubles, crosses, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
which albeit in their owne
nature they bee euils and plagues for
sinne, yet the quality and property be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altered by Christ his death; they
are made meanes to humble vs, <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines

               <p>Secondly Christ trimmeth his spouse
by the continual and effectual in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and efficacy of his blessed Spirit.
For without this all the outward
meanes should bee onelie for conuict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of men, and for their more iust
condemnation, and not for conuersion

dignity and maiesty of the per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son,
to whom she is contracted, and to
whome, she is to bee married, and that
is Iesus Christ, the Kings sonne, the

naturall heire of heauen and earth;
the mighty Iehoua: <hi>the euerlasting fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he that hath all power in heauen and
earth; and God hath so he ighly exalted
him at his right hand and giuuen him a
name aboue all names, that at the

of things in heauen, of things in earth,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:26"/>
and things vnder the earth,</hi> Philip. 2.
<hi>vers.</hi> 9. 10.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if King <hi>Pharaoes</hi>
Daughter being wedded to earthlye
<hi>Salomon, must hearken vnto him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
and incline her eare. Yea forget her

                  <hi>verse</hi> 10. how much more must euery
good Christian, espoused &amp; affianced
to the heauenlye <hi>Salomon</hi> IESVS
CHRIST our Sauiour, performe
these duties.</p>
               <p>And if the Maides and Virgins that

hand <hi>sixe moneths, purified with
Oyle of Myrrhe, and sixe moneths with

much more must the members of the
Church, before they shall or can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
CHRIST IESVS his presence
in glorye; not for a fewe dayes or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths;
<pb facs="tcp:15090:26"/>
but all the dayes of their life,
they must purge, sweeten, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them-selues; for hee alone is
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,
and no power or Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>estie in earth
can compare with him. And by our
coniunction and marriage with him,
wee shall bee exempted and freed
from all euills what-so-euer, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with all good things vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
for euer-more.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by the strange iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Almighty GOD, especially
in the foure or fiue yeares last past,
whether generall, or more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
wee ought, as by so many <hi>voyces
and signes of our omnipotent GOD</hi>
preaching from heauen vnto vs (and
almost at the end of the world) teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and exhorting men to seious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and to bee mooued and
stirred vp more speedily, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to prepare our selues to meete
GOD in the waye, wee must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and humble our selues before him,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:27"/>
forsake our sinnes, giue glory to him;
and entreateth him by prayer and by
repentance, to quench the fire of his
begun wrath and indignation. For it is
an vndoubted truth, that if to all our
other sinnes there be adioyned security
and deadnesse of heart, that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from God are both hastned and
doubled: and the remouall and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of one plague, is nothing else but
the occasioning and beginning of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
as we may read in <hi>Exod.</hi> against
<hi>Pharao</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 8. 9. 10. 11.</note> in the 4. of
<hi>Amos</hi> against the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and in the

against<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and the experience
of former and later times in many
countries doth verifie it. Herevpon
Gods destroying <hi>Angell;</hi> and his kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Arrowe,</hi> the consuming pestilence
hath (not long sithence) destroyed so
many thousands in this Iland, and yet
is not ceased. All the foure <hi>Elements</hi>
which otherwise would fight for vs,
haue beene armed against vs; First the
ayre, partly by his often <hi>Eclipses</hi> por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb facs="tcp:15090:27"/>
perhapps the eclipting and
darkning of the glory and soundnesse
of the truth, and other temporall euils,
partly by prodigious and vnvsuall
stormes and tempests, giuing warning
of the wrath to come. Secondly the
fire by consuming and burning so
many houses and habitations within
these few yeares: seemeth to presage
eyther the fire of the last iudgement,
or else some fearefull and strange
euent. Thirdly the Seas and waters
in diuers parts of the kingdome, haue
most horribly roared, swelled, broken
their banckes; and encroached vpon
the maine land, and firme continent,
so terrified the people the beholders,
and done so much harme. Adde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
the vnwonted, sudden, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
invndations of Riuers and
Brookes, as though like vnto the
men of the olde world wee all deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to bee drowned. Lastly the earth
by his moouing and shaking sensibly
perceiued in many places, hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the <hi>Lord to bee angrie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 18. 7.</note> and seemeth
<pb facs="tcp:15090:28"/>
to proclaime against vs that wee are
vnworthy to liue vpon it, wee must
generally and particularly returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, by vnfained repentance; and
then they shall bee but fatherly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
and gentle warnings vnto
vs. But if wee persist and insist in our
sinne and securitie, then let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
and feare least they bee but
the beginning of (further) euills.
And euen <hi>Herodotus</hi> an heathen histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
diuinely speaketh: <hi>Cùm Deus pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niturus
est gentem vel vrbens, prodigiis
id priùs solet significare.</hi> That is, when
God will punish a Nation or Cittie, he

&amp; this doth the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Icru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
and the dispersion of the nation
of the Iewes, witnesse and warrant
plainely vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the approaching and neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the day of the LORD, must
bee a Trumpet to fore-warne and
waken vs, and as the voyce of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to terrifie vs from our securitie,
and to compell vs to watch and pray,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:28"/>
that wee may bee accompted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to escape all these things that shall
come, and that wee may stand before
the sonne of man. <hi>Luk. 22. verse</hi> 36.</p>
               <p>Signes and fore-runners of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
IESVS CHRISTS second
comming already fulfilled, are these,
not onely the destruction of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
and the Temple of GOD ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye

but more specially, the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie,

it to come to passe. <hi>Apoc. 18.
verse.</hi> 8. For their sinnes of Idolatry,
of filthy and abhominable liuing, of
the bloud-shed of so many millions
of GODS elected saints, of most
horrible and vnmatchable conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb facs="tcp:15090:29"/>
and treasons against Christian
Kings and states, as their most exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
and damnable plot of powder

both our most excellent and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Soueraigne, the most hopefull
Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> together with all the
honorable personages, and the state
of the kingdome there assembled, doe
to their publike and eternall shame,
(amongst infinite other their villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies)
demonstrate, are (as it were)
come to the full: and GOD hath (in
part) and will remember their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitye.</p>
               <p>Adde herevnto their shamelesse cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
and mangling of the writings
and volumes, both of the ancient
Fathers, and also later writers, yea
those of their owne faction, as <hi>Ianse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,

the burning of so many olde copies:
both of the ancient and also of the

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15090:29"/>
Lastly, their late, yet most lewd, lying,
sophisticall and hellish doctrine of
<hi>Aequiuocation,</hi> shifting euasions, and
mentall reseruations, when they are
called into question before ciuill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
doth by their Bookes and
practise euince.</p>
               <p>A third signe, already in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
fulfilled, is the aboundance and
shamelesse defence of sinne, deadnesse,
&amp; dulnesse of heart, whereby men are
neither sensitiue of their sinnes, nor
aware of Gods iudgements; and want
of true <hi>faith</hi> on the earth; as may bee
discerned by so much <hi>Atheisme</hi> and
<hi>Hypocrisie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 18. 8.</note> so little inuocation of <hi>Gods</hi>

of these and the like
fearefull and ominous signes and
occurrences, should driue and drawe
<pb facs="tcp:15090:30"/>
to feare almightie GOD,<note place="margin">Isa. 47. 13 and 14.</note> and stand
in awe of him, that causeth and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them; as <hi>Lodowicke</hi> the first Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
the Father of <hi>Charles</hi> the
great answered one <hi>Edmund</hi> and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trologer,</hi>
that abusing wordes of
Scripture, exhorted him not to feare
the <hi>Comete</hi> which hee then sawe:
let vs not feare the <hi>Comete</hi> sayth
hee, but the creator of it, and let
vs praise his clemencie, who doth
vouchsafe by such iudgements to
remember vs of, and to reprooue
vs, for out dulnesse and sluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>Secondly let vs (taking also as <hi>à


praesagium</hi> and forerunner of the last
daie) bee aduertised and induced
heereby to prepare our <hi>Lampes,</hi> to
furnish the <hi>Oyle</hi> and to make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15090:31"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> the consideration of infinite
losse, detriment and torment that will
follow (if wee doe not in this life, the
time of grace and reconciliation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
our selues) must driue and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
vs herevnto, for they shalbe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded

Wherefore if the former argument
cannot like an heauenly Adamant and
Loadstone drawe vs to preparation,
(as this Argument is most effectuall &amp;
preualent with the regenerate,) yet let
the threatning of damnation, like a
terrible thunderclap, or a great peale
of ordinance rowse &amp; awake vs from
sinne, and driue and enforce vs to
make our selues ready. And if the feare
hereof in very Reprobates, can worke
<pb facs="tcp:15090:31"/>
so far forth as to compel <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
to desire <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to pray <hi>to the
Lord for him, that none of the things
that they had spoken might come vpon
him,</hi> Act. 8. 24. and when <hi>Paule</hi> dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of Iudgment, it could make <hi>Faelax</hi>
to tremble. Act. 24. 26. much more
must it preuaile with those that make
a better profession, and waite for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
redemption.</p>
               <p>Lastly our Sauiour Christ, and <hi>Paul</hi>
&amp;c. by this argument endeuoured to
awaken the secure. Mathew 23. 33. 2.
cor. 5. 11.</p>
               <p>And thus much in generall of the person
that is to be prepared and to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pare
her selfe.</p>
               <p>Now that we may proceede more
orderly in this point, and the reader
may take the more benefite, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by it. We are first to propound the
principall heads of this preparation,
and Secondly the proper and set time
of it. The principall heads are these
<pb facs="tcp:15090:32"/>
foure, faith in Christ; Secondly purity
and innocency of life. Thirdly the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of charity and good workes, and
lastly a feruent desire, and huely hope
in the patient expectation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumation
of the marriage.</p>
               <p>The first head is faith, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els but a perswasion of the
fauour of GOD towardes vs in
Christ, or as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes
defineth it, the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or
substance of things hoped for, it is
called a substance, not for that in
very deede it doth subsist, and hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beeing,
but because it doth present,
and as it were set before our eyes
that which is promised by GOD.
Hebrewes 11. 1. Apoc. 1, 8. and it is
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is
a demonstration <hi>of things not seene;</hi> the
worde signifieth properly a conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the conscience, for faith doth
so conuince him that doubteth hee
can doubt no more, not otherwise
then if hee sawe them with his bodily
eyes, and herevnto is to bee referred
<pb facs="tcp:15090:32"/>
that saying of Christ. <hi>Thomas because
thou hast seene thou hast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eleeued, but
blessed are they that haue not seene, and
(yet) haue beleeued.</hi> Ioh. 20. 29. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sayth that giueth vs an assurance
of the accomplishment of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
whether corporall, or spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
temporall, and eternall, must needs
bee the first, and the principall part
of this preparation: this is the <hi>entry
dore</hi> whereby wee are admitted vnto
God, and into his house. Ephe. 3, 12.
without <hi>this it is impossible to please God</hi>
for hee that commeth vnto God must
beleeue Hebre. 11, 5. <hi>and what soeuer is
not of faith</hi> (that is done in a consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
knowledge of Gods will) <hi>is sinne</hi>
Ro. 14. 23. <hi>faith is the eye of the body,</hi> if
the eye be single <hi>id est</hi> the faith sincere,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>al the body shal be light: but if the
eye be darke <hi>id est</hi> the faith corrupt, &amp;
vnsound, then the whole body is dark,
so that neither hand, foote &amp;c. can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
and performe his function. This
faith is the <hi>stomach of the Soule</hi> to
attract, digest, and conuert into good
<pb facs="tcp:15090:33"/>
bloud, and norishment, the Heauenly
food of Gods word, &amp; if it either want
appetite, to desire, power to digest, or
strength to retaine &amp;c. the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
must needes by degrees languish,
and decay: finally it is the <hi>roote, founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and the instrumentall cause of our
iustification, regeneration, victory ouer
sinne, and satan, peace of conscience,
and eternall saluation. col. 2. 5. 6. Ephe.
6. 16. Act. 15, 9. 1. Iohn. 5. 4. Rom. 5. 1.
Mar 16. 16. Ioe. 3. 15. 16.</p>
               <p>Thus wee see by the properties, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
and vses of faith it is necessary, &amp;
there can bee no preparation accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God without it; wherefore if we
want it, wee must vse the meanes to
get, and obtai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e it: and if wee finde
our selues possessed with it, wee must
then preserue, cherish and norish this
holy flame with the knowledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of
Gods word, with the vse of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by conference, by meditation,
by prayer, by practise of good workes,
and by hope, expecting, and waiting
for the ende of it, euen the saluation
<pb facs="tcp:15090:33"/>
of our soules. For first our faith through
the frequency and violence of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
is often fore assaulted and
weakened, and therefore it had neede
be repayred and confirmed.</p>
               <p>Secondly onely that faith that vsual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth growe and encrease, is the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
and liuely faith, and shall neuer
be extinct, for defect of oile; nor pine
away by any spirituall consumption,
but continueth firme, and vnmoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and obtaineth the promises
Eph. 4. 11. 12. 13.</p>
               <p>Lastly if faith haue not (as before
specified) his continuall supply of food,
it will faile as the wine did at the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galil,</hi> if it be not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished,
and preserued, it will wither
like the corne sowen in the stony
ground for want of moisture, and it
wilbe lost as we see how it was in the
foolish virgins at the Bride groomes
comming, and that argued that it was
not true faith in existence; but onely in
apparence, and that it was rather an
opinion then a deepe impression: for
<pb facs="tcp:15090:34"/>
otherwise the faith of <hi>Peter,</hi> and so of
Gods elect, shall not faile, and the gifts
of God (namely that directly concerne
saluation) are without repentance.
<hi>Luk 22. 32. Rom.</hi> 11. 19. neuer extinct,
or taken away.</p>
               <p>But that neither with the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
nor with the hypocrites, nor
yet with the Papists and other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
wee content, and deceiue our
selues with a mocke faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an historicall
and temporary faith, or with a crackt,
and erronious faith, insteed of that
which is sauing, and iustifying, we must
found and search our soules, whether
wee bee Orthodoxe, and vncorrupt in
the principles of faith, whether we rest
wholy vpon the right obiect, whether
it be ioyned with particuler applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and lastly whether we discerne and
find in our selues the inward &amp; outward
signes, and euidences of it, for then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
wee haue that faith that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth
the sinner, <hi>purgeth the heart,</hi>
engrafteth vs into Christ, and saueth
our soules. But of these, and the like
<pb facs="tcp:15090:34"/>
particulers briefely, and in order.</p>
               <p>Principles and foundations of faith
are these, <hi>preaching of the word of God,</hi>
is the ordinary and <hi>principall</hi> meanes
of saluation. <hi>Rom. 10 14. Christ</hi> is
both God and Man in one <hi>person,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
GOD and perfect man: man to
suffer and dye, and satisfie for sinne in
our nature that had offended, and God
to support his humanitie, to giue effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
and power to his doctrine and
miracles, and to adde infinite merite
and desert to all his actions, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.
Thirdly, onely faith is the
hand and instrument to apprehend,
and apply CHRIST vnto vs with
all his blessing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and so to iustifie
vs.</p>
               <p>Faith is like the eye, which albeit
in the acte, and vertue of seeing, it is
alone: yet not solitarye and alone in
the bodye, but ioyned to other parts:
so faith, albeit it alone iustifieth vs
before GOD, yet it is not solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and alone, but alwayes according
to the proportion of it accompanied
<pb facs="tcp:15090:35"/>
with holy life and good workes. <hi>Gal. 5.
verse.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>There are onely two Sacraments
which Christ instituted, and left vnto
the Church, Baptisme the sacrament of
our new birth, and entrance into chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
the outward signe whereof is
<hi>Water:</hi> and the Lords Supper, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of our growth and perfect
nourishment, and encrease in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
the outward signes and matter
whereof are <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
both Bread and Wine for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
both in the sacramentall vse of
them, and afterwards as <hi>Paul</hi> maketh
it manifest. 1. Cor. 11. 26. 27. That no
man performe and fulfill the lawe, and
therfore no man is to hope and looke
for righteousnesse and saluation by
that obedience which hee sheweth to
the lawe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. Gal. 2. 15. 16. That
we cannot make satisfaction to God
for the least of our sinnes, but that
Christ alone hath most <hi>fully, and onely
performed it.</hi> 1. Pet. 2. 24. Apoc. 1. 5. 6.
That the saluation, of all that beleeue
<pb facs="tcp:15090:35"/>
is certaine and infallible, not onely in
Gods decree, but also to themselues,
<hi>Rom. 8. 38. Heb.</hi> 10. 22. and therefore
that the opinion of the Papists is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
which make faith vncertaine, and
so holde our saluation to bee doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>That all doctrine necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
is contained in the Scriptures,
so that nothing is either to <hi>be added to
it, or detracted from it,</hi> Deut. 4. 2. Apoc.
22. 18. 19. Gal. 1. 8.</p>
               <p>That the knowledge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are necessary for all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for their saluation, and therefore
that they ought to read them, that
they may thereby learne and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
what God would haue them to
beleeue, and doe, <hi>Iohn. 5. 39. Mar.</hi> 12.
24. <hi>Math,</hi> 22. 29.</p>
               <p>That God alone is to be adored of
vs, and that no part of diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is to bee giuen vnto any creature,
<hi>Math.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
               <p>That holinesse of life, &amp; good workes
as effects, and consequents of faith,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:36"/>
and <hi>the way wherein wee should walke,</hi>
Ephes. 2. 10. is necessarily required of
all that will be saued, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>That the Sacraments are onelye
signes and seales of righteousnesse,
and not causes of saluation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our saluation doth not so depend
vpon them, that they that want them
must needs bee damned, whereas our
saluation consisteth onely in Christ his
merits, <hi>Marc.</hi> 16. 16. which none can
dispoile and dismantle vs of.</p>
               <p>That Christ his body was but once
conceiued of the substance of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Mary,</hi> and cannot bee made of
any other matter, and that CHRIST
hath onely one body, and therefore it
is not made of Wheate bread (as the
Papists say it is dayly) for it is not the
seede of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and bread is not the
flesh of the Virgin.</p>
               <p>That the humaine nature of Christ
is now onely resident, and contained
in heauen, and therefore it is not to be
adored in earth, <hi>Acts.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15090:36"/>
That the whole force, vertue, and
efficacie of our saluation, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is in the onely, and once offered
sacrifice of CHRIST, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 12.
14. and that this sacrifice could bee
offered of none but Christ, who was to
be a Priest for euer.</p>
               <p>Lastly (to omit diuers other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which bee more plaine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed)
it is a foundation of faith, to
know, beleeue, and hold, that then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
after the dissolution from
the body, the soules of the righteous
are carryed by the <hi>Angels</hi> into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,<note place="margin">Luke. 16. vers. 22.</note> and the soules of the wicked and
impenitent, are carryed by the diuill
into hell: and that the same bodyes
with all their perfect partes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions
shall for substance bee raised
vp by CHRIST at the day of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Iob.</hi> 19. 25. 26. Of this maine
and principall article many are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
or at least not iuditiously and
soundly perswaded, as may appeare by
the examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ignorant people
<pb facs="tcp:15090:37"/>
both in their sicknesse, and otherwise.
These heads, &amp; foundations <hi>viz.</hi> they
that shall either with <hi>Atheists</hi> deny al,
or with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> deny, or
by consequence ouerthrowe most of
them, or with the common, or vulgar
protestant bee ignorant of them; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly (for the time present) haue
true faith, for faith can no more then
a temple, a house, or any other edifice
bee without his many grounds, and
foundation. Wherefore if we erre, or
bee ignorant in these, or in the like
principles of faith, let vs by diligent
hearing of the word, reading of the
Scriptures, and <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> bookes, by
consulting the Godly learned, and by
earnest prayer to GOD for illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and vnderstanding, seeke to bee
better informed, and resolued.</p>
               <p>The second point to bee conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
is whether Christ with his onely
merites, and obedience bee the onely
<hi>Obiect</hi> of our faith, so that in matter of
saluation wee vtterly disclame, and
renounce all other feined merites, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:37"/>
intercessions of men, and
Angells, for Christ alone is our perfect
redeemer, and mediator. Act. 4. 12.
Heb. 7, 25. Phi. 3.</p>
               <p>The third point, whether our faith
doe not onely rest in abare and naked
knowledge, and history of Christ, (as
the fayth of the deuills, and reprobates
doth) but also apply, and appropriate
Christ, yea and enclose (as it were)
him, and all his merits vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and their owne saluation: for
as without vse, and application of the
weapon there is no defence, or anoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
without vse, and application of
medicine no cure, without vse, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
of meate and drinke, no continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of life, without putting on of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell
no warmth, or hiding of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly
partes, without acceptance,
and perticuler acknowledgement of
the Kings generall pardon, there is no
forgiuenesse: so vnlesse we apply and
appropriate Christ with all his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and merites vnto our selues wee
haue no comfort; helpe, and benefit by
<pb facs="tcp:15090:38"/>
him wee do ebut beate the ayre, run at
randome, and shoote at the rouers.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to conclude this point,
wee must say with <hi>Dauid, O Lord my
strength and my redeemer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 14. Iob. 20. ve. 21.</note> and with
<hi>Thomas</hi> the Apostle, <hi>My Lord and my
God,</hi> and with the Church in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<hi>my welbeloued is mine, and I am
his.</hi> Cant. 2. 16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly we are a little to consider,
&amp; take a view of some pregnant, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
signes, and effectes of true
faith, whereby (as by certaine trusty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencers)
we may be informed, and
certified whether we haue true fayth,
or not.</p>
               <p>First it is one signe of a beleeuer to
ioyne, and associate himselfe to those
assemblies and those people wherein,
and amongst whom the true, &amp; sincere
worship of God is professed, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished:
for in the 2. of the Acts of the
Apostles it is sayd <hi>the Lord added to the
Church from day to day such as should
be saued.</hi> Act. 2. 47. And it is a note of
perdition for a man to <hi>forsake the holy
<pb facs="tcp:15090:38"/>
assemblys, &amp; so to withdraw himselfe and
his faith from GOD.</hi> Hebrewes. 10.
25. and 39.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> absenting himselfe from
the Apostles and their fellowship but
some eight daies, or there abouts was
so hardned in vnbeleife that he would
not beleeue the testimony, and asseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the rest of the Apostles that
told him that Christ was risen, <hi>except
hee might see the print of the nailes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 26. ver. 25.</note>
                  <hi>and put his finger into the print of them,
and put his hand into his side,</hi> and had
not CHRIST beene so mercifull
vnto him, as to condescend to his
infirmitie, and withall to molli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie
his heart hee had perished in his
obstinacie. What then is to bee
sayd of them that seldome, that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,
yea that neuer come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
GODS Chamber of presence
to heare the blessed Preaching of his
word, and to pertake of the Heau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nly
<hi>Manna</hi> of the Sacraments, surely
they are in a most dangerous and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
case.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15090:39"/>
A second note of faith is, constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
wisely, and boldly to confesse and
maintaine the doctrine of saluation,
and all the foundations of fayth when
we are therevnto called: For we must
beleeue with the heart, and confesse
with the mouth. Rom. 10. 10. We must
haue Christ his name written in our
forheads. Apoc. 14. 1. Wee though we
liue wheresathan hath his throne, must
keepe Christs name and not deny the
faith. Apoc. 2. 13. Whereso <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vs vpon to looke to our selues, and
to beeware that wee bee not daunted
with scoffes, and slaunders, terrified
with feare of trouble, and persecution,
seduced with flattery, ouercome, with
false perswasions, and corrupted with
offer of profit, and preferment. For if
wee bee ashamed of Christ our good
Lord, Maister, and Redeemer, he wilbe
ashamed of vs, if wee deny him, hee
will deny vs before his Heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and all the Holy Angells: and
contrarywise if wee confesse, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him before men, hee wil confesse
<pb facs="tcp:15090:39"/>
and honour vs. Finally wee are (then
onely) made partakers of Christ if wee
keepe sure vnto the end <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

(or wherby we are vpholden.)
Heb. 3. 14.</p>
               <p>A third euidence of fayth is to shew
and make knowne our dislike, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of errour, and false doctrine, yea
to set, and oppose our selues against
it, so farre forth as our calling will
warrant.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> professeth that hee
hateth all false waies. Psal. 119. 104.
and 128. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> being at <hi>Athens,</hi>
and seeing the Citty <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

that is addicted to Idolatry, it is sayd
that the Spirit in him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
was prouoked to indignation. Acts.
17. 16. and thus the Angell of the
Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> is commended,
because hee could not forbeare them

A fourth, note is the gift, &amp; practise
of prayer, or the inuocation of Gods
name in the only mediation of Christ,
for this is a speciall character, and note
of an elect of God, whereby he is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
from an Infidell, or reprobate,
and is knowne to bee one of Gods
Children. <hi>Rom. 10. 14. 1. Cer. 1. 3, 2.
Tim.</hi> 1. 19. and contrariwise it is a
brand of an Infidell, or an Atheist
neuer to pray. <hi>Ieremy 10, 25. Psalme</hi>
14, 4. But that wee bee not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
herein, for ignorant people may
mutter ouer, and say by rote certayne
prayers, and the hipocrite, may make
a goodly shew, certaine rules must bee
obserued and heeded.</p>
               <p>First that our praiers bee made in
knowledge of Gods will, otherwise
they are not made in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ayth, and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
please God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, ver. 4.</p>
               <p>Secondly that in priuate we pray not
so much by prescript for me, as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the present sense, &amp; feeling of
our owne wants, &amp; imperfections cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the supply of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15090:41"/>
Thirdly, that it doe not consist in a
few words of course, but bee enlarged
as time, and our present necessities oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
vs. 1. <hi>Sam. 1. vers.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that the matter and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of our prayers bee chiefely, and in
the first place, the aduancement of
Gods Gospell and kingdome, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of our owne sinnes, and the
saluation of our soules, and then in the
second place to pray for temporalls,
and outward things, but alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally,
and with subiecting our
wills to Gods will. <hi>Math. 26. ver.</hi> 39.</p>
               <p>Fistly, it must not be only for a brunt
vpon a sudden motion, or onely in
time of great trouble, but daily, and
continually, for thus are wee taught to
pray incessantly, and neuer to giue ouer
vntill God grant our requests. 1. <hi>Thes.</hi>
5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Luke.</hi> 18 7</p>
               <p>Sixtly, wee must pray in humilitie,
and in vnfained loue to God and men,
for the proud mans prayer God reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<hi>Luke 18. vers.</hi> 14. and the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
mans prayer, and sacrifice is
<pb facs="tcp:15090:41"/>
abhominable. Lastly, (not to be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,)
wee must not pray onely for our
selues, and kindred as carnall men (in
their manner) sometimes doe, but for
the whole church of God vpon earth,
and for euery state and condition of
Christians, as Kings, Counsellers, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
Iudges, Magistrates, the reuerend
Prelates, Pastors, Preachers, Ministers,
commons, and most earnestly and
compassionately, for those whom wee
know afflicted, hated, persecuted for
the truth, and Gospels sake, or for any
good cause whatsoeuer, or where-so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.</p>
               <p>If thou finde all these signes of faith,
or most of them in thy selfc, be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to GOD for them, and which of
them thou feelest, and perceiuest thy
selfe to bee destitute of, in part, or
whole, seeke for the obtaining of it,
and if thou bee wholy voyde of them,
then it is high time, whiles opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
serueth, to labour to procure them
by all holy meanes. Looke therefore
to the maine chance, get and nourish
<pb facs="tcp:15090:42"/>
faith, and thou canst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not perish: but
want, or neglect thou it, and thou
canst not bee saued, <hi>I am horum mauis
accipe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the former notes, and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of faith, may very well be added
puritie, and innocencie of life, and a
liuely hope of eternall glory, for these
are certaine and infallible notes of
faith, and peculiar effects of it, but of
these I purpose to treate distinctly, and
more at large in the two next points
of preparation, wherof these are bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
And thus much of faith, the
foundations obiect, application, and
notes of it.</p>
               <p>The second principall head in this
preparation, <hi>is puritie, and innocencie of
life and conuersation.</hi> This is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and peculier worke, and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of faith, and it proceedeth, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
from it, as the beames from
the sunne, the waters from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and the fruites in their season
from the fruitfull tree, herevpon fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:15090:42"/>
is said to purifie the heart, <hi>Acts.</hi> 15. 9.
faith, and repentance are both prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
together, and so ought to bee
practised, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
               <p>The necessitie of this holinesse, and
innocencie appeareth plainely: <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
holinesse, no man shall see God.</hi> Heb.
12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>4. except <hi>Christ washe vs wee haue
no part with him,</hi>

<hi>no vncleane thing shall enter into the
heauenly Cittie, neither whatsoeuer wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
abhomination, or lyes,</hi> Apoc. 21.
27. Likewise innocencie and harmlesse
simplicitie is a cognizance and badge
of them that are prepared for Gods
kingdome; for they must bee <hi>innocent
as Doues,</hi> Math. 10. 16. harmelesse as
yong children, <hi>Mat. 18. 3. without guile
in their mouthes,</hi> Psalm. 32. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> suffering
wrong rather then offering it, and
dooing no man iniurye, but labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to doe good to all men; and no
maruaile, for beeing borne a new
<pb facs="tcp:15090:43"/>
and cast into a new molde, wee must
<hi>operari secundum formam renouatam,</hi>
according to our new nature, so must
be our actions; and if wee bee rightly
regenerate, the effects that doe retaine
the similitude of the cause, must needs
entertaine some correspondencie with
it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ Iesus the vnspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Lambe of GOD, will neuer marry
with the Church, vntill shee bee first
<hi>washed and sanctified,</hi> Ephes. 5. 26. 27.
and they onely that haue not <hi>defiled
their garments, idest,</hi> corrupted their
conscience with grosse and grieuous
sinnes, <hi>shall walke with Christ in white,</hi>
Apoc. 3. vers. 4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, being contracted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted
into Christ, that is, holinesse it
selfe, we must not walke after the <hi>flesh,</hi>
but after the <hi>spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 1, wee must
be conformable vnto Christ his death
by mortification, and to his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by newnesse of life, or else wee are
no liuely members of his body, but
dead and rotren flesh. It is an axiome
<pb facs="tcp:15090:43"/>
in Philosophy, <hi>quo quid propinquius bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eo
melius, Aristo. 3. Top.</hi> wherefore
if we be in Christ, and contracted to
him, wee must needs be better, for wee
are not onely neere him, but of him,
and he in vs, and we in him. And that
our holinesse and innocencie of life
bee not rather in the flowre, then in
the fruite, and in pompe more then in
proofe, we must sce that it be constant,
and encrease; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as wee continually,
partly by ordinary slips, and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and partly by spirituall conflicts,
&amp; combates, receiue some losse, foiles,
decayes; so must we dayly endeuour
to strengthen our selues, to repaire our
decayes, and to mend our garments,
and to regaine, and recouer our losses,
And as <hi>generatio vnius est corruptio al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius,</hi>
so wee must see how by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendering
of holynesse, sinne doth
decrease; for as one kingdome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure two Kings, so the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ cannot consort with
the dominion of Satan.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15090:44"/>
Wherefore we must not please, and
content ourselues with the out-ward
shew of holinesse, or deceiue our selues
with the opinion that men may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
of vs, out-ward shewes are like
Sodome Apples, goodly in colour,
and appearance, but if a man crush,
and open them, they are nothing
but powder, or ashes, and as for mens
opinion of vs, it is no certaine eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of our inward holines, for
Hipocrisie is spunne with so fine a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that it can deceiue the most
Godly, and iudicious (at least for
a long time) in the world, thus
<hi>Dauid</hi> was deceiued in <hi>Achitophell</hi>
his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>amiliar and counsellor, the <hi>Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi>
in <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the whole Church
in <hi>Nicolas,</hi> one of the seauen Deacons.</p>
               <p>Secondly wee must not onely bee
innocent our selues, and holy, and
here-vpon thinke wee may endure
filthy speach, horrible blasphemye
of GODS sacred name, false im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
laide vppon iust men, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
drunckennesse, and notorious
<pb facs="tcp:15090:44"/>
profanesse in others; but we must (if
wee haue any dramme, or sparke of
grace in vs, or any partickle of zeale
for God,) rebuke them, and shew our
hatred, offence, and opposition against
them. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 11. Herein our loue to
God, our hatred of euill, our strength,
and resolution in Godlines is euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discryed, and discouered Luke. 23.
41. Act. 14. ver. 14..</p>
               <p>Thirdly wee must beware, and
shunne ill company and fellowship;
for if wee bee not armed with spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
grace, and also most chary how
wee come into their company, they
will soone infect, coole, and corrupt
vs. They are as the pestilent vapor to
the apt and open body, as fire to
the tynder, as pitch to the hands,
as <hi>Dalila</hi> to <hi>Sampson,</hi> and as <hi>Iesabel</hi>
to <hi>Achab;</hi> they are so ready and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyble
by their ill president, and
perswasions to infect, and our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
soe weake, and impotent to
resist if it bee not alwayes assisted
with speciall grace, and the spirir of
<pb facs="tcp:15090:45"/>
God, that the Holiest, the Wisest, the
Strongest haue hereby soone beene
defiled, and polluted, how much more
those that either haue very little grace,
or none at all, and that make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and choise of their company.</p>
               <p>The third head, or principall part in
preparation is <hi>Charity,</hi> and the <hi>Fruites,</hi>
and <hi>effects</hi> of it, charity, or loue is the
<hi>fulfilling of the lawe.</hi> Rom. 13. 10. it is
the <hi>bond of perfection.</hi> Colo. 3. 14. For
it knitteth, and bindeth all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
together, that they be not dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and it prefereth them; this chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
dependeth vpon the loue of God,
and cannot bee in any hethen, the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of all other vertues (besides this)
may bee in <hi>Pagans,</hi> as pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty, bountie,
modestie, patience &amp;c. but not this, &amp;
this doth vnite, and ioyne all the
members of the Church together. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
without this, if wee haue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rare perfections yet before GOD
wee are nothing. Cor. 13. 2. Charity
is in respect of the eternity of it grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yea preferred before sayth, and
<pb facs="tcp:15090:45"/>
hope. 1. Cor. 13, 13. for sayth, and hope
determine with this life, <hi>but loue abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe in respect of the obiect, and
the visibility of it, it is greater then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sayth, or hope, <hi>for fayth, and hope</hi>
haue for their obiect only GOD, and
Christ, but loue extendeth it selfe to
God, and man. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 25. fayth is in it
selfe inuisible, but loue, and charity
perspicuous, and apparant. Iac. 2. 16.
18. this charity, and loue is not onely
in tongue, in promises, and in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and welwishing to men, but also
in truth and indeede, as 1. Iohn. 3. 18.
<hi>Charity is bountifull and seeketh not her
owne.</hi> 1. Cor. 13, 4, 5. it is <hi>communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uum sui,</hi>
that is, imparteth that which
she hath to others, and here that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Philosophy is verified, <hi>bonum
quo communius eo melius;</hi> the more
common it is the more comfortable. It
doth not (as many of our inclosers) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pale,
imparke, and hedge in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
groundes, and fields to her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
vse, to the weakening of the
<pb facs="tcp:15090:46"/>
State, and the ruinating of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munalty,
but like a fountaine, sendeth,
and streameth forth her waters vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
shee is so farre (as it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
many practise) from appropriating
to her selfe in part, or in whole the
poore mens stocke, and collection-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
gathered, and giuen for building,
or repaireing of Churches, or Townes,
that haue beene consumed by fire,
that she liberally giueth of her owne.
But (to ende this point) the practise
whereof should neuer ende. As faith
worketh by charity, so there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
particulers wherin her Offices are
most conspicuous, and obseruable.
First we must bee lights, and lamps to
others by our examples, and not looke
who will begin first, as <hi>Mathew 5. 16.
2. Cor.</hi> 9. 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly when our brother offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
we must in charity, and discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
admonish him, and not to suffer
him to perish in his sinne (as many do)
rather deridyng him, then directing
him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15090:46"/>
Thirdly, wee must exhort, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
others to Godlines, and good
workes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3, 13. Fourthly we must
by <hi>Simpathy,</hi> and fellow-feeling, &amp; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
by words of Scripture rightly
vnderstood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and well applied, comfort,
and cheere the afflicted. 1. <hi>Thessa.</hi> 5, 14,
and therefore wee must not post, and
put off, all to the minister, as though
it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerned not vs at all. Fiftly we must
pray for others, and especially for their
conuersion, and saluation. 1. <hi>Timot. 2. 1
2.</hi> and that both publikly, and priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And lastly euery man must accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his ability, &amp; other mens wants
and necessities willingly &amp; seasonably
impart of his worldly goodes for
their releife, Acts. 2. 21. 2. <hi>Corinthi.
8. Galla. 6. 10. 1 Iohn.</hi> 3, 16. This is
the touchstone of many, and most
mens religion in these last and worst
dayes, for herein they are most
fauty and defectiue, but let them that
will not doe good with their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls,
beware least they for omission
heereof, iustly bee condemned
<pb facs="tcp:15090:47"/>
with the two rich worldling, in Luke
Chapter 12. 17. 19. and Chapter 16.
24, and with infinite others at the
day of Iudgement. <hi>Mathew</hi> 23. 42.
43. 45.</p>
               <p>The last point, and branch of the
preparation is <hi>hope, desire,</hi> and <hi>expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the marriage, and the glorie, and
ioye of it,</hi> and herevpon it is that hope
is called the <hi>Anker of the Soule,</hi>
sure, and steadfast, to stay, and sustaine
vs in all stormes, and tempestes of
temptations, <hi>Hebre.</hi> 6. 19. yea the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heauen, which wee waite
for, is called, <hi>A blessed hope. Titus.
2,</hi> 13. this hope of eternall glorie),
is a notable meanes to stirre vp men
to purge, and reforme themselues.
2. Iohn 2. 3. with the expectation
of which blisse, wee <hi>must comfort one
another. 1. Thesalonians</hi> 4, 17. and
wee must both in temporall, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
tryalls not growe impatient, as
the rebellious Iewes that could not
expect, and stay for <hi>Moyses</hi> fortie
<pb facs="tcp:15090:47"/>
daies, but would needes in the meane
time play the Idolators; but with the
woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> after a first, second,
and third repulse <hi>hope still</hi> Mat. 15. 27.
28, we must with the Creeple, in <hi>Iohn</hi>
sometime before wee be cured waite
thirty eight yeares. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 5. 7. Wee
must with <hi>Abraham</hi> against hope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
vnder hope, <hi>Romans</hi> 4, 8. And
as the Iewes patiently (many of them)
waited in hope of the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods promises many yeares,
both their deliuerance out of <hi>Egipts</hi>
tirranny, and afterwards out of <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi>
captiuitie, yea and expected, and
desired many hundred yeares the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
of Christ before that they
in their posterity enioyed it: so must
we also tarry the Lords leasure, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and in hope fustaine our soules.

must stirre vp our hearts desire,

vers. 10.</p>
               <p>A third reason, and that more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall,
is that an end may bee put to all

vpon vs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17. 18. 19. and 23 24.

Lastly, the fruition and enioyment
of Christ his glorious presence, and

the quantitie of our faith; for these
being necessary effects of faith, if they
be great and liuely so is our faith, and
if they bee weake or dead, so is our

weake, it must learne, and schoole vs
in no wise to deferre our repentance,
and time of preparing our selues, but
to begin betimes, and to hold on to

               <p>For first we are bound,<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note> and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to serue God in spirit, and trueth,
and that all the dayes of our life, <hi>Luk.

               <p>Thirdly, we must with <hi>Salomon, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,
Timothy, Ioseph,</hi> and others, serue
God in the dayes of youth, and in the
floure of our age, when our memory is
most apt and firme, our vnderstanding
most sharpe, our sences most liuely, &amp;
we may best lay the foundation of an
holy and comfortable old age, thus are
we commanded and exhorted, <hi>Eccles.
13, 1. Psal. 119. 9. Psal.</hi> 78. 6. 7. and it is
<pb facs="tcp:15090:53"/>
their greate commendation. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 4.
2. <hi>Tim. 1. 5. 2. Epist. Ioh. 4. 1. Ioh.</hi> 2. 12.
13, 14. Whereas otherwise they that
neglect, and omit to reconcile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnto God in their best time, &amp;
in the daies of their child-hood, and
youth grow in time senceles, and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,
and hard hearted, and are iustly
forsaken of God in their old, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
age, that had no care, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to feare, obey, and serue him in
their youth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly it is seldome, and rarely
seene, that men that haue liued all
their life, and spent all their golden
dayes (as they call them) in superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
sinne, and vanity, should vndoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
turne vnto God in their old age.
It is more wonderous then vsuall, and
there are onely some examples of it in
Scriptures to keepe the aged from
dispaire, but they are very fewe and
rare, that we should not (as most doe)
presume to much of it.</p>
               <p>Lastly of all ages, olde age (if it bee
not before rooted, and grounded in
<pb facs="tcp:15090:53"/>
fayth, in loue, and in the practise of
Godlinesse) is of all ages the most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt,
and vntoward, to performe these
duties, to begin, and lay the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of repentance, and to make it ready
for Christ. Wee may in this case in
some sorte say, <hi>Can a man bee (new)

Iohn 3. 4. not being ignorant, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnderstanding
the doctrine of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
as <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> but onely in
another sense affirming that time to
be the most vnfit. And there is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reason for it; for in olde age the
memory decayeth, the strength fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
the senses are infeebled and wast,
then are the euill daies of sorrow, and
labour, of payne, and aches, then <hi>the

Temple, or Ceremonies, for God, and
the <hi>Lambe are the Temple</hi> of it, and

               <p>Wherefore seeing that there is an

Sabboth, which according to Christ
his institution, the <hi>Apostles</hi> practise,
&amp; the custome of the vinuersal Church,
we keepe the first day of the weeke in
memory, and honour of Christs resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
is a tipe, and representation of
it, it must reach vs to obserue it, both
incorruptly touching the out-ward
forme, and spiritually touching the

               <p>The second priuiledge, and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue
is the actuall, <hi>and eternall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,

Now whether they shall sometimes

or which is more probable, and likely
by vision, and heauenly contemplation,

his eyes, for the present clarified,
looked vp into <hi>Heauen, and saw Christ
sitting on the right hand of God.</hi> Act. 7.
ver. 56. why may not a glorified body
by his glorified eyes, and the aire, and
skye, being also purified looke downe
from Heauen, and contemplate the
Earth &amp;c. But because this poynt is
difficult, and the knowledg of it, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
coniecturall then certaine, wee
must bee content to bee ignorant of it,
vntell the day, when all secrets shalbe
made manifest; and let vs in the meane
time make some vse of the point as
most may concerne vs; Here is matter
of consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for poore Christians, that
either neuer actually possessed any
worldly goods, lands, or liuings, as
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> and others, or haue beene

<pb facs="tcp:15090:60"/>
and their proper vses, vnmercifully
turning men out of home, house, and
liuing; well let them possesse, their
soules in patience, and in faith, and

they shall one day inherite the new

<pb facs="tcp:15090:63"/>
is the highest heauens, the throne of

Hierusalem, the Cittie of the liuing
God, Paradise, the seates, and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the saints, &amp; Angels, the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

heauen &amp; the new earth. This blessed
heauen is a place in respect of substance
subiect to no change, and corruption,
in respect of quantity, and extent farre
exceeding other places, and of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
capacitie to receiue all the elect of
God; in respect of qualities, it is of all
places most bright, most glorious, most
pleasant: finally it is such a place wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
no euill can be feared, and no good
can be wanting, and in which GOD
doth offer himselfe to bee seene of
men and Angels face to face; and the
humanitie of CHRIST more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

Wherfore fat be it from vs; that vainly
looking for a visible Church heere
without all spot, or wrinckle in order,
and maner, and seeing, and finding it
not, proudly, vnthankfully, rashly, and
without cause to deuide, and seperate
our selues (as is the maner of Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes)
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church of God, which
notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al other defects, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in doctrine that is not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

the scu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Preaching of Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
doctrine, pure inuocation of
Gods name in Christ, and right vse of
the two Sacraments, Baptisme, and

essentiall, substantiall, and of the life
of the Church, other things are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
accidentall, and circumstantial,
and rather of the comelinesse, well
beeing, and ornament, then, of the
simple necessity, and essence of the
Church, yet it were to be much wished
that the defects were supplied, abuses
remoued, &amp; corruptions taken away,
but it must bee done by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who haue
<pb facs="tcp:15090:64"/>
lawfull authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; in order without

and conscience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Seeing all blisse, felicitie, and
euer-during happinesse is onely in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and not in earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee must not
rest in these temporall and transitorie
things of honour, wealth, preferment,
beauty, buildings, credit pleasure, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
recreations, outward peace,
and prosperitie, neither must wee
thinke that true felicitie and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
consisteth herein; for first all
these are vncertaine, and transitorie,
as the grasse, vapor, flower, shaddow,
they are like <hi>Ionas</hi> his gourde of one
dayes continuance, and are like Reeds,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:65"/>
or rotten posts fayling, and causing
them to fall that leane vpon them.</p>
               <p>Secondly they are rather (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our corrupt nature) fnares,
baits, and traps to deceiue, and hurt vs
(as infinite, examples euince) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meanes, and instruments of our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
and faluation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they cannot saue our soules,
and make vs blessed before GOD, as
<hi>Solomon</hi> acknowledged when hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them all vanity of vanities, but
this worke is proper onely to grace,
and GODS speciall mercy in Christ.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they are no especiall, and
proper endowments of Gods, Church,
and Children, (though sometimes
they in good sort enioy them, and
pertake of them) for the wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
possesse them in farre greater
measure then the Godly who are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rich in minde, and in grace, then
in these externall, and perishable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
honours, and pleasures. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee must eleuate our hearts, and
mindes farre aboue these earthly, and
<pb facs="tcp:15090:65"/>
momentary things, and seeke the
things aboue; wee must get vs vp into
the mountaine of deuine contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and by the eyes of true fayth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and view our Country the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<hi>Canaan:</hi> we haue no abiding Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
here, wherefore we must seeke one
to come hauing a <hi>foundation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. verse.</note> whose
<hi>builder, and maker is</hi> GOD. And as
for these worldly, and outward things
wee must onely vse them so farre
forth as they are lawfull, and are
helpes vnto vs for the furthering of
of our Iorney, &amp; the aduancement of
Godlinesse, and no otherwise; for
els it is better that they should
perish then wee; and it is farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that wee should alienate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
withdrawe our mindes, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from them, then that they should
seperate vs from GOD (as they
doe the most) and depriue vs of the
kingdome of Heauen; and in this
case if they were as deere, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
vnto vs, as our eyes, handes,
feete, yea Fathers, and Mothers, yet
<pb facs="tcp:15090:66"/>
we must cut them off, and hate them.</p>
               <p>And thus much touching
the place.</p>
               <p>The fourth and the last branche, is
the manifold vses and applications of
this doctrine of the heauenly mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
first by consideration hereof, wee
must be stirred vp, and doe our vtmost
endeuour to mortifie, and ouercome
all worldly desires, and earthly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
for otherwise we cannot addict
and wedde our selues to these, and
withall truely prepare our selues for
the comming of <hi>Christ:</hi> for touching
riches, and worldly cares, there is such
an antipathy, an opposition betweene
them and grace, that the one cannot
consist without the other: for as the
eye cannot at one instant, beholde
heauen and earth, euen so a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
serue GOD and the world to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
they are so aduerse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie;
And as those places where
gold and siluer growe, are in all other
respects most barraine, and fruitlesse,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:66"/>
so where the loue of money, riches,
and the world doe beare swaye, and
preuaile, there true zeale, and sincere
godlinesse can neuer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bee found; and
as touching pleasures, they are the
matter, and fewell of euill desires, they
are honey mixt with poyson, and they
are as Haw-thornes, and bryers,
which albeit some-times they beare
goodly leaues, and flowers; yet
if a man gripe them hard, they will
pricke and wound him; wherefore it
standeth vs vpon to be wary of them,
and when wee vse them, to vse them
charily and moderately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Secondly, wee must learne
hence to bee forward, and constant
in well-doing, and still to repaire our
ruines, and prepare our selues vntill
the last breath; for hee onely that
continueth (in godlinesse, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
to the end, hee shall bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
hee that is found watching and
wakefull at his maisters comming,
shall be blessed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 36. 37. and he
<pb facs="tcp:15090:67"/>
that fainteth not in weldoing shall in
due time reape Math. 24. 13. Luke. 12.
38. Gal. 6. 9. Otherwise we, if we faile
neuer so prosperously, and sinke at
the Hauen mouth; if we trauell di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to Heauen, and turne backe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
at our iorneyes end; if wee doe
God good and faithfull seruice in our
youth, and afterwards proue faithles,
and prefidious in our elder yeares;
and finally if we begin in the spirit, and
end in the flesh all our former ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
labours, and sufferings are to noe
purpose, <hi>all our righteousnes shal be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and we shall die in the sinnes and
transgress<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ns that we haue committed,</hi>
Eze. 18. 24. Wherefore if the hope of
Ransomming worke patience in the
captiue, assurance of liberty, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
constant labour, and faithfulnes
in the prenrise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and seruant; and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of victory, and spoile, constant
resolution, and valowrous courage in
the souldier: why should not much

hope, and assurance of this happines,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:67"/>
and eternall coniunction with Christ
make, &amp; moue vs to be constant, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable
in all duty of piety, charity,
&amp; Iustice, knowing that our workes are
not in vaine in the Lord 1. Cor. 15. 58.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Thirdly the assured expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Heauenly, and glorious
vnion must teach vs with the patriarks,
Prophets, Apostles, Martirs, Confessors
and with all the Saints of God both of
former, and also of later time to endure
and vnder goe all sicknesses, trials, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
losses, contempts, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
ioyfully, and patiently, Heb. 11.
25. 2. Cor. 4. 16. 17. 18. and Heb. 11. 8.
9. For first they are but momentary,
and neuer beyond the date, and terme
of this life, secondly Christs yoake is
easie and his bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp; he wil lay vpon his no greater bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,

                  <hi>idest</hi> an issue, and euasion with
the temptation. Lastly GOD will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
and reward these tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,
and transitory euills, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
<pb facs="tcp:15090:68"/>
with an infinite waight of glory
in all his Saints. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> Fourthly the vse of this doctrine
serueth notably to mollifie, and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the sorrowes of death, and all the
paines, and pangs of it, for the stinge
of it, (<hi>viz.</hi> eternall condemnation,) is
taken away. 1. <hi>Cor. 15. ver.</hi> 55. 56. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
it is not a plague vnto vs, but
onely a temporary correction, nay a
narrow wicket, or gate to intromit,
and send vs forthwith into the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of eternall life. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14. 13. for if
wee bee loosed then we goe straitly to
the Lord. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. if wee remoue
hence wee dwell with the Lord, &amp; are
married vnto him. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. and (to
end the poynt) wee rest from all the
labours of this life; and our workes
(First the rewarde of them in mercy,
and fauour) follow, and attend vpon vs
as an honourable guard. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14. 13.
Wherfore let vs not feare death &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but let vs arme our selues with
faith, &amp; hope, &amp; let vs often, &amp; seriously
meditate vpon the life to come, &amp; the
<pb facs="tcp:15090:68"/>
glory of it, and wee shall (when the
time is come) be willing to die, &amp; die
with much comfort, and assurance.</p>
               <p>Lastly (amongst many other vses)
wee must not mourne vnmeasurably
for our friends, and kinsfolkes, or any
other that liue, and die in the Lord, for
they are with God, &amp; in perfect blisse.
And as any man will rather reioyce,
then sorrow, if his sonne, daughter,
friend, kinsman bee happely, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
honourably, preferred in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
albeit hee is otherwise to want
their ordinary company, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
so should wee rather reioyce
that they now are perfited, and most
honourably, and gloriously wedded
to Iesus Christ, their King, and head,
then mourne as they that haue no
hope.</p>
               <p>It is indeede lawfull, and fit to
mourne, for nature, and religion war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranteth
it, but it must bee in measure,
and for our sinnes that haue depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vs of them, &amp; for that the Church
feeleth and findeth the losse of them,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:69"/>
then for any priuate and carnall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and herein notwithstanding wee
must submit our wills to Gods will,
and rather labour to im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sitate their
excellent and manifold vertues, then
to lament immoderately, or ouer-long
for their departure; but alas the world
knoweth not, nor acknowledgeth
good, and godly men. <hi>The righteous,
and mercifull men,</hi> (as wee haue had
lamentable experience within these
few yeares) of all rancks and callings,
dye, they are taken <hi>away from the euill,
and rest in peace, and no man considereth
it in heart, or vnderstandeth it.</hi> Isa. 57. 1.
and therefore because the world mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no more account of them, and is
not worthy of them, GOD most iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
depriueth them of their presence
and comfort.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the solemnization,
and the priuiledges and
vses of it.</p>

at the day of the Lord (for as
death leaueth men, whether peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
or impenitent, so the last iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
findeth, and iudgeth them, and

               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> The vse hereof is first to
shew the vilenesse, and vanitie of the
doctrine of Popish purgatory (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I spake at large before (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

and false, for as there are but two

                  </gap>he estate of damnation (as doe all
the reprobate and impenitent) so are
there but two places in the scriptures
appointed for them, after this life,
<hi>viz.</hi> heauen, and hell, therefore no
purgatory, or third place, <hi>Iohn. 5. 29.
Apoc.</hi> 14. 13. wherefore seeing there
is no such purgatorie after this life,
nor no meanes left to relieue, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
them: therefore all prayer of
the liuing for the dead, is simplye
vnlawfull, for first it is against the
rule of faith, <hi>videliz.</hi> the worde of
GOD, and therefore must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
be sinne.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, it is against the rule of
charitie, that should alwayes iudge
the best of the dead, and not perswade
<pb facs="tcp:15090:75"/>
themseues the dead, are in torments
where-of they haue noe certaine
ground, or knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> The second, and last vse is to
teach vs not to stay for companions in
the way to eternall life, Iohn. 13. 24.
for so wee may perish together, nor
to deferre, or put of our conuersion
from day to day Math. 24 48. 49. 50.
51. least either by death, or the last
iudgement we be suddenly surprised,
and ouertaken, and accordingly iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and condemned, 1. The. 5. 2.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the time.</p>
               <p>The third branch, and member of the
diuision, is the persons, and parties
that are shut out: viz. the foolish vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
<hi>idest,</hi> those that did not prouide
for the time to come, because they
did carelessely please them-selues in
their wants, and so passed by the
time of mutuall communication and
they contemned the helps that were
offered vnto them, and therefore
they are deseruedly derided for their
<pb facs="tcp:15090:75"/>
folly, and doe suffer the Iust pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of their negligence, and
brutishnes.</p>
               <p>Hence wee learne that it sufficeth
not to carry onely the shining lamps
of externall profession, to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
or tast of Gods mercies (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sound feeling of them, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
by them) Hebr. 6. 4. Mat. 13.
20. or to haue onely an externall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
amongst men, as these foolish
Virgins (noe doubt) had, for if a man
haue noe more then this, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
goe beyond a reprobate in Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity,
and all these temporall, and
common graces will faile a man in
the time of temptation, in the day
of death, and at the Last iudgement
as Hebre. 6. 4. 1. Iohn. 2. 19. But true
fayth whereby wee are iustified, and
sanctified before GOD neuer fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
Luke. 22. 32. and all the (sauing)
guifts of GOD are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Rom. 11. 29. and GOD will
remember their sinnes, and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb facs="tcp:15090:76"/>
noe more, Heb. 10. 17. therfore
hee will neuer take his grace whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from them; wherefore let vs not
content our selues with a bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and historicall faith, but turne
this temporary faith into a true, and
sauing faith; and let not the strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
or rarenes of diuine misteryes
onely, or principally moue, and
enduce vs to the profession of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
for so may <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
and the <hi>Athenians</hi> bee Christians,
neither let gaining, or retaining of
worldly wealth, peace, prosperity,
friendship, and dignity, or credit
bee our inducements, or perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Christianity, for these things
are vncertaine, and when these ends
faile (as they doe oft) then their
profession, religion, and temporary
fayth and obedience determineth,
wherefore let the ends of our fayth,
profession, and religion be only the
loue of GOD and the zeale of his
glory, the delight in the truth, the
obedience of his will, and a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:76"/>
and constant desire of saluation;
and that wee may know that our
faith is not temporary, and histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
but sound, and sauing, let vs try
and examine it by these rules follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
first that wee bee humbled in
our hearts for our sinnes, Isai. 51. 17.
and that wee haue a Godly sorrow
for them 2. Cor. 7. 10. Secondly that
wee bee perswaded that our sinnes be
pardonable, for otherwise wee shall
dispaire as <hi>Caine</hi> did Gen. 4. 13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly wee must sincerely desire
the meanes of saluation, such as faith,
repentance, mortification, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
are: fourthly wee must pray
for nothing in the earth so much, so
earnestly, and so continually as for
the forgiuenesse of our knowne and
vnknowne sinnes: fiftly wee must
labour, and endeuour in all our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to approue and commend our
selues rather vnto GOD, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men: lastly whether by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and continuall obseruation,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:77"/>
of Gods fauour, goodnesse, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
prouidence towardes vs, wee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
vnto the strength, ripenesse, and
full measure of fayth. <hi>Rom. 5. 4. 5, Psal.
23. 6. 1. Sam.</hi> 17. 34. 35, 36. If wee
finde these things in our selues,
wee haue true fayth, and shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
perish, but if wee want them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in part, or in whole let vs seeke
betimes to procure, and so to encrease
them. <hi>And thus much of the persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth branch, and part is the
state, and condition of the <hi>foolish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi>
at the comming of the <hi>Bride-grome,</hi>
and that is contayned in these
wordes <hi>viz. And the gate was shut,</hi> and
heere two principall poynts are to bee
marked, and attended. First <hi>from
what they are excluded, viz.</hi> from the
fauourable, and comfortable presence
of Christ, and from the glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Secondly <hi>into what place and
companie they are remitted, and
reserued,</hi> viz. to hell, where they
shalbe tormented with the diuill,
and his Angells in the lake that
<pb facs="tcp:15090:77"/>
burneth with fire, and brimstone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euermore.</p>
               <p>Touching their exclusion from the
glorious and blessed fellowshippe of
Christ, what a torment is this, and
how doth it greeue, and gall them to
thinke, and consider of it? Surely it
cannot bee imagined, much lesse liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

part of the diuills torment to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
from how great glorie, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
hee is irrecouerably fallen.
Now that they, and all the reprobate

               <p>What a greuious, and vnspeakable

all that say there is no other hell, but a

that this is to them but the flashings,

if they will not beleeue the Scriptures
and word of God, yet in that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
and are conuinced by many

beware that they bee not lead blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded

And if the enimies of the truth in this

of the heauy waight of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against them,<note place="margin">Apoc. 6. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>shall seeke death, and
shall not finde it, and shall desire to dye, and
death shall flee from them;</hi> how much
more shall this come to passe, when the
full vyoles of Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wrath shall bee fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
powred out vppon them, and
when they shall drinke the pure wine
<pb facs="tcp:15090:80"/>
of his wrath <hi>Apoc. 9. 6. Apoc. 14. 10.
Rom. 2. 4 Psal. 74. 10. Luke.</hi> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24. 25.</p>
               <p>Touching the eternitie, and euer-lastingnesse
of their paynes, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
both in soule, and bodie, both
playne places of Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sound
arguments thence collected aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
euince and testifie.</p>
               <p>First the paynes and punnishments
are called euerlasting fire, <hi>Mathew</hi>
25. 41. the worme that neuer dieth.
<hi>Isa</hi> 66. 24. the smoake of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
doth ascend euermore, they
haue no rest day, nor night. <hi>Apoc.</hi>
14. 11. and they shalbe punnished
with euerlasting perdition from the
presence of the Lord, and from the
glorie of his power, as 2. <hi>Thessal.</hi> 1. 9.
so that when as many Millions of
yeares bee expired, as there bee motes
in the sunne, droppes of water in the
Ocean sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sands vpon the sea shoare,
creatures vpon the earth: and when so
many yeares shall be accomplished, as
all <hi>Arithmetitians</hi> can number all their
life long; yet their torments shall haue
<pb facs="tcp:15090:80"/>
no end, nor ease, but begin againe a
fresh. Now the reasons why their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
shal be eternal are these: First the
ioyes of heauen are eternall, <hi>Math. 25.
46<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and therefore the paines of the
damned are eternall also, for <hi>contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum
contraria sunt consequenta:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
GOD whom the reprobates
haue offended, and contemned is an
<hi>euerlasting maiestie,</hi> and the chiefe and
<hi>eternall good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and therefore the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the sinne committed against
him is eternall, for sinne committed
against the infinite maiestie, is infinite.
Thirdly, if the reprobates liued here
for euer, they would sinne for euer, and
being in hell they cannot praise God.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 9. but hate, repine, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
against him.<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> But God is merciful,
and therefore hee will at length end
their torments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or at least ease them.
First they dispised Gods mercy in this
life when it was offered them,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> and
therby haue made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues altogither
vnworthy of it. Secondly they shalbe
punished more gently then they haue
<pb facs="tcp:15090:81"/>
des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ued. <hi>Mathew.</hi> 11. 22. for GOD
could much more haue aggrauated,
and encreased the quantity of their
torments.</p>
               <p>And thus much in generall of the paines
of the damned.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come to some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.
First in their faces, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
there shalbe shame, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
for euermore, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 8 9. 7, and
for this cause the reprobates are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>the vessels of dishonour.</hi> 2. Tim. 1. 20.
Rom. 9. 21. for then all their secrete
sinnes shalbe layd open, and discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. and their conscience
bringing them alwayes fresh into
their rememberance shall alwaies
v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xe, and torment them. <hi>Isa. 66. 24.
Mark.</hi> 9. 44. and wee gather this pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
by the contrary estate of the
Godly at Christ his comming. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.
28. for they shalbe bold, and not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>Now if many men in this life for
auoyding and preuenting of open
<pb facs="tcp:15090:81"/>
shame, and punishment, doe not onely
hide, but also make away themselues,
in what horror, &amp; vexation thinke we
they shalbe in, when they shall suffer
full and euerlasting shame, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Secondly, they vpon the perfect
sense of their infinite sinnes, and vpon
the full apprehension of Gods infinite
indignation, shall <hi>euerlastingly dispaire,
and shall alwayes desire to dye, and shall
not dye,</hi> Apoc. 9. 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in their minds and wils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnspeakeably infected, and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with enuie, and malice, they on the
one part seeing themselues depriued
of so infinite glory, and plunged into
so endlesse miseries, by reason of their
sinnes and offences, and on the other
side, either by present sight and view,
as some diuines collect out of <hi>Luk. 13.
28. Luke. 16. 23. Apoc.</hi> 14. 10. or else
(which is an vndoubted truth) by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in fresh and perpetuall memory,
the absolute and glorious estate, &amp; <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification</hi>
of the godly at the last day,
obseruing and perceiuing the godly
<pb facs="tcp:15090:82"/>
whom they in their life time so scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
abused, wronged, persecuted to
be so vnconceaueably blessed, shall be
tormented and vexed with an vncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
enuie, <hi>Isa. 66. 23. 24. Psal. 85. 10.
11. Luk.</hi> 16. 23. We haue some instance
hereof in proud <hi>Hamon</hi> that cursed
<hi>Agagite</hi> that could in no wise endure
the exaltation of <hi>Mordocheus,</hi> but it
was a sword to his heart, and a vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his conscience. And if the enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in this life repine, yea, and pine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
at the felicitie and fauours of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
how much more will they then
enuy, when they themselues shalbe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
more miserable, and the
godly vnspeakably more blessed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the reprobate shalbe as wel
tormented in their bodies, which haue
bin the vessels &amp; instruments of sinne,
and iniquity, as in their soules, for as
their bodies shalbe darke, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inglorious,
and deformed, contrary vnto the glory
of the elect: so shall they be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not with any materiall fire, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the worme of conscience, the carcases
<pb facs="tcp:15090:82"/>
of the slaine, and the metaphoricall
speeches, especially in the <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. 23
that describe and delineate vnto vs the
ioy and glory of heauen should be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
vnderstood, which is very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
to thinke, but with that which is
equiualent, yea farre more extreame,
namely the full, and finall wrath of
God ceazing and inuading the soule
and body, as appeareth, <hi>Apoc. 14. 10.
They shall drinke of the wine of the wrath
of God, yea of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re wine that is powred
into the cup of his wrath, and shalbe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
in fire &amp; brimston before the holy
Angels, and before the Lambe for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi>
they shall drinke vp the <hi>dregs of
Gods wrath,</hi> which is their portion to
drinke, <hi>Psal.</hi> 74. 10. &amp; <hi>Psal.</hi> 11. 6. Lastly
because they must in soule &amp; body suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the vnsupportable indignation of
the Lord, are called, and so indeed are,
<hi>vessels of wrath prepared to destruction.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 22</note>
Now if the anger of a Lion, of a Beare
robbed of her whelps, much more of a
mighty Monarch be so pernicious<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and
da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous, how much more inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable
<pb facs="tcp:15090:83"/>
then is the wrath and indignation of
the Almighty and the most iust Lord,
who is to his enimies <hi>a consuming fire,</hi>
Hebr. 12. 29. and <hi>whose wrath burneth
vnto the bottome of hell.</hi> Deut. 32. 22.
God giue vs grace by our godly feare,
true repentance, and sound obedience
in this life, to preuent it, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much of the generall and particuler
punishment of those that are excluded.</p>
               <p>The last point, and part to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and wherewith we will conclude
the whole treatise, is the manifold, and
wholsome vses that we are to make of
this doctrine: first therfore the serious
consideration, and meditation of the
state, &amp; paines of the damned, must be
a forcible motiue to diswade and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
vs from committing sinne, and
iniquitie for feare, of falling into the
same condemnation. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his
13. Homilie, or sermon vpon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi>
saith well to this purpose; <hi>Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam
(inquit) vbi<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> de Gehenna disserere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
non enim sinet in Gehennam incidere,
Gehennae meminisse, &amp;c.</hi> that is, would
<pb facs="tcp:15090:83"/>
to God euery man would speake of hel;
for to remember hell, will not suffer
a man to fall into hell; for if the due
consideration of seuere humane lawes
that shall be duly executed, doe keepe
the most vnruly from offending, much
more will the serious consideration of
the paines of hell (if men haue grace
to thinke on them) reforme &amp; amend
men, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>de.</hi> 23. Secondly the Preachers
&amp; Ministers of the word of God, when
they see &amp; perceiue the deadnesse, dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and impenitencie of the hearers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
must labour by laying open the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and torments of the damned, to
draw men to feare God, and to repent
their sinnes. <hi>Math<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23. 33. Heb. 10. 27.
Apoc.</hi> 14. 9. 10. 11.</p>
               <p>The third vse is to teach vs not to be
enuious against the wicked, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
at their temporall dominion, and
prosperitie: for first, neither they, nor
their pompe nor prosperity shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
long, but perish suddainly. <hi>Psal.
73. 18. 19. 20. Psal.</hi> 37. 12. Secondly,
they haue (for the most part) their
<pb facs="tcp:15090:84"/>
portion in this life, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 14. Lastly,
their damnation is iust, &amp; sleepeth not,
2. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t.</hi> 2. 3. wherefore wee must rather
commisserate and pitty them, yea, and
pray God to conuert them, for in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we shall please God, discharge our
owne duties, &amp; perhaps in the end, be
a meanes to win, and reclaime them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly &amp; lastly, finding in our selues
by due examination, that God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
vs from so great condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and made vs heires, in hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life, we must continually, and from
our hearts giue all glory &amp; praise vnto
God, <hi>Apoc. 5. 9. 10. Col.</hi> 1. 12. 13. 14. and
hereby bee stirred vp to be <hi>stedfast, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable,
aboundant alwayes in the
worke of the Lord,</hi> 1. Cor. 15. 57. 58.
Now the Lord God, the fountaine of
mercies, and the father of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, grant wee may performe
these duties, and <hi>continue constant</hi> like
pillars in his loue, and seruice to the
end, for his beloued sonnes sake Iesus
Christ our onely redeemer, and
mediator, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>

and mercy hath instituted them
to that end, and hath also commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them to be vsed. Secondly by the
refusall and contempt of them, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
our selues to bee none of Christs
desciples, of whome these Sacraments
are badges. Thirdly (during this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality)

that hee that wanteth them cannot bee
saued?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> No, for first, not the want but
the contempt of them damneth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
the <hi>Israelits</hi> in the Wildernesse
wanted them 40. yeares, but were not
therefore condemned, &amp; the theife vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

is not inherent, in, annexed and tied so to

them should by his very act of receiuing,
be partaker of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> No, for first, it is the proper worke
of God to confer grace, albeit (ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily)
by the means. Secondly the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are signes &amp; seales of grace, but
not causes therof. Thirdly their nature
and substance is not changed; therfore
they cannot of themselues conferre
grace.</p>

                     </gap>phell, Simon Magus,
Iudas,</hi> were Partakers of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet because they wanted faith,
they receued no good by them, for
here, in regard of vs faith is all in all
Heb. 4 ver. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> If there be no grace contained and
inherent in the Sacraments, why are the
signes and the things signified called so
often in Scripture by one and the same
name? <hi>Exo. 12. 11. 1. Cor. 5. 7. Math. 26.
28. 1. Cor.</hi> 11. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> They are often times thus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
onely to shew the straite vnion
and neere coniunction, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the signes and the things signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the beleeuers, for at what time
they in faith receiue the signes, God by
his spirit conferreth the things signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What difference is there betwixt
the word Preached and the Sacraments?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Frst the word preached is only
audible and propounded to the eares,
but the sacraments are sensible, and
offered &amp; subiect to the sense of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:15090:97"/>
fasting, handling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, grace is offered in the
word more generally, but in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
more particularly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the word is preached both
to beleeuers and vnbeleeuers, but the
sacraments, (especialy that of the
Lords supper) are communicated to
those that beleeue, or (at least) thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
iudged.</p>
               <p>Forthly, the word is of force towards
faith and saluation without, or before
that the Sacraments bee receiued; as
may appeare in <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. The
<hi>Enuch</hi> Act. 8. Corn. Act. 10. ve. 2. 3. and
44. 45. but the sacrament without the

they differ in the externall signe or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Secondly in number, for they

seeing that the scripture maketh
no expresse mention thereof?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes vndoubtedly, for first there is
such an affinity betweene Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; Baptisme that succeedeth it; that
<pb facs="tcp:15090:100"/>
by what reason the children of the
Iewes were circumcized, by the same
may the children of Christians be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.
Secondly the commission that
Christ graue to his Apostles, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them to baptisze all nations, was
general and made no exception of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.
Thirdly the Apostles baptized
whole families. <hi>Ac. 16, 15. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 16, 1
&amp; therfore in al likelihood Infants that

their former substance &amp; nature:
for first (according to the infallible rule
in Philosophy) no accidents can subsist
without their subiects to whome they
are tyed.</p>
               <p>Secondly the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in the

mentioneth the expresse words of
bread and wine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. Cor. 1. 26. 27. 28.</p>

of the body, but in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
vse to the norishing of the soule, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
before they were without sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification

they signifie Christs body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and

                  <pb facs="tcp:15090:103"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then the elemenss of bread &amp; wine
are not transsubstantiated or turned into
the very body and bloud of Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, for first it is a spiritual foode
&amp; therfore spiritually to be eaten and
receiued by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aith. Secondly the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this absurd opinion ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the articles of Christs Incarnation
&amp; ascension, for if he was borne of the
<hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> then not made of bread,
&amp; if he be ascended into Heauen and
there contained vnto the ende of the
world, then he is not corporally prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
&amp; much lesse made of bread. Thirdly it
destroyeth the very nature and forme
of a Sacrament, which consisteth in the
relation &amp; respect that is betwixt the
signe and the thing signified. Fourthly
the bread in time will mould, and the
wine turne into vinegar, <hi>ergo</hi> there is
no such conuersion. Lastly (to omit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other arguments) if there were any
such transubstantiation, the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates
as <hi>Iudas</hi> should truly feede
on the body &amp; bloud of Christ and so
should bee saued but this is flat against
scripture.</p>

                  <hi>Qu.</hi> If there be no such reall conuersion
of the bread &amp; wine into Christ his body

guilty of the body &amp; bloud of Christ?</p>
               <p>

bread and wine from common bread

they by their infidelity and wicked
hearts abuse and prophane these holy
seales and pictures; and therefore are
guilty of high treason before God, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as he that rendeth, abuseth and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleth

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> How then is the bread and wine
to be receiued?</p>
