            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

thereto.</item>
               <item>5. The second limitation is, that Doctrine which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
by many notable Realms and Churches: no
Realm nor Church did condemne this, except <hi>Gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that not absolutely, but many Churches did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it expresly.</item>
               <item>6. The third limitation is, the doctrine particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the first Confession of Faith: but no doctrine
is expressed therein contrary to this point.</item>
               <item>7. The fourth limitation is, that Doctrine which was
for a long time before professed by the King and whole
body of the Kingdome: But the King and body of the
Kingdome did expresly professe that they did approve
this point here damned.</item>
               <item>8. The discipline is limitated by the same limitation.</item>
               <item>9. The discipline is either taken in a strict and proper
sense for the censures of the Church, or else in a large
sense, signifying the whole policy of the Church.</item>
               <item>10. In the first sense, it was as yet retained precisely in
the Church of Scotland under Episcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and therefore the oath is not broken.</item>
               <item>11. Discipline is again distinguished in these points
which are essentiall and perpetuall, and those which are
accidentall and mutable.</item>
               <item>12. The first sort are prescribed by Gods Word, and
were not abolished by Episcopall government, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
inviolable.</item>
               <item>13. The other sort is left to the libertie of the Church,

               <item>2. Neither did the Church then condemn any substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
point of Episcopacie, except they did contradict
themselves, instanced in six principall points of that
Doctrine.</item>
               <item>3. They condemn only the corruptions which were at that

corruptions; some corruptions indeed, but only
personall, and not essentiall to the office.</item>
               <item>4. The principall point they condemn in Bishops is, that
they received not their Commission from the Church
to exercise their charge: and yet it is evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that they had Commission from the Church to
exercise all the points of their function.</item>

at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> Novemb. 1638.
can be compared to none of that
kind so well, as to that infamous
Councell of <hi>Trent;</hi> which as it
hath for a long time troubled the
whole world, Emperors, Kings and Princes: fo this
hath vexed mightily the Kings Majestie our dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
disturbed both Church and Common-wealth, and
hath led all his Subjects in <hi>Scotland</hi> blind-fold to Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
given evill example to other Kingdomes, and
brought an evident Scandall upon the reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
There hath been no lesse humane or rather Satanicall
policie, and subtile close conveyance practised by the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64434:8"/>
chiefe Rulers in that Assembly of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> both in the
Preparation, Prosecution, and Conclusion thereof, (yet
in this more malice, and lesse respect to the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
and present established estate of the Church) than
in that of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, as the Pope and his Cardinalls in the Consistorie
professed, that they desired a generall Councell, and did
openly exhort the Emperor, Kings, Princes, and Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
to concurre with them: yet they declared evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by their dealing that they desired, either not at all a
Councell, or not such an one as should be assembled by the
Authoritie of the Emperor and Kings, or that any of
them or their Ambassadors should have suffrage therein,
and much lesse presidencie according to the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the Church, esteeming that their Authority,
suffrage, or presence would crosse their particular ends:
Even so our Covenanters, albeit they often petitioned his
Majestie for the libertie of a generall Assemblie, yet they
declared plainly by their proceedings, that they did not
desire such an one, as should be either convocated by his
Majesties Authoritie, or wherein he, his Commission or
Councell should preside, or give suffrage, or be present,
if it had been in their choice, accounting it so not to be a
free Assembly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the Pope and his Cardinalls in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistorie
used Politick meanes, that none or few of these
Prelates, whom they supposed in any wayes would crosse
their designes, should appeare in the Councell: although
publikly they did admonish all, yet by private threatnings
and distastes, hindred from comming many of the Bishops
of <hi>Germany, France</hi> and <hi>Spaine:</hi> but on the contrary,
allured by divers means those whom they supposed would
favour their designes, as all the Bishops of <hi>Italy:</hi> so that
when the Councell was at the greatest, there were above
150. Italian Bishops, whereof many were at the Popes
charges, yet not above 60. of all other Nations. So in
this at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> politick meanes were used that none
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64434:8"/>
should be chosen Commissioners, except Covenanters;
and of those, only the strongest and most obstinate, who
had solemnely already sworn unto these things they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to conclude: and on the other part, meanes were
used that all those, who were suspected to be averse from
their designes, or not forward enough, shoud be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
as is evident by the particular Instructions sent from
the Tables of the Covenant unto all the Presbyteries of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> which were discovered by the care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of his Majesties Commissioner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and produced in
open Assembly to their great confusion, whereby it was
appointed that care should be taken that none should be
chosen as Commissioner, for the Ministers or ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but Covenanters, and those wel-affected to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines;
And if that any other happen to be chosen by the
greater part, that all the best affected protest against
them, and processe them before the Assembly that they
might be excluded from voycing, and for that effect also
directed an informall and illegall Citations against all the
Bishops, to exclude them from having place or voyce in
their assembly, who ought to have been (by the present
lawes of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and continuall practice
of the universall Church in all ages) the principall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> the Pope of Rome
to have more voices favouring his designes, did create
many titular Bishops, who had no Christian slock, and
had never so much as seen that Church which they did
represent. So likewise in this Assembly were brought in
many Titular Lay-elders, as Commissioners from Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
wherein they had no habitations, nor ever did sit
therein to exercise their rule of Elder-ship before the day
of their election to be Commissioners to the Assemblie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Pope and his Cardinalls did complaine
that the Emperor and Kings would have prelimitate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
Councell by their directions: yet the Ambassadors and
Prelates did in every Session and Congregation complain
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64434:9"/>
more justly, that the Councell was not free, being strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prelimitate by the Pope and Consistory of Rome, both
in the members and matters to be proposed, as also in
framing of the Canons. So our Covenanters did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a free assembly, affirming, that as farre as the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
should be prelimitate either in the members or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be treated, so farre the necessary ends of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and good of the Church was hindred, accounting it
a most dangerous usurpation to any person or Iudicatori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
whatsoever, to impose any such limitations, except an
Assembly it self; And therefore did most grievously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
against his Majestie, (although unjustly) for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
no limitations, but such as were prescribed by
former lawfull assemblies. Yet his Majestie and the whole
Kingdome may more justly complaine of them, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
the reasonable prelimitations of other former as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies;
did neverthesse admit strange limitations from
the Tables of the Covenant, (which was neither a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Assembly of the Church, nor had any authority over
the same) and those also against the established Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of former generall Assemblies and Lawes of the
Kingdome, as appeares evidently by those foure papers
of Instructions sent to every Presbytery, according to
the which the Assembly was limitate both in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and matters.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, as in the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> nothing was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Consultation, but <hi>Proponentibus Legatis,</hi> which
gave occasion of offence to many: no Bishop, no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
no Regall Embassador, nor any good Christian had
liberty to propose any thing, onely the Popes Legates had
this Power, who did propose every thing as they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
instructions from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: even so in this Assemblie,
nothing was admitted to De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>beration, but Proponente Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;
And he likewise was confined to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of the Tables, who had before set down every
Article which was to be treated: All propositions of any
other whatsoever, though flowing from his Majestie, by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64434:9"/>
his Commissioner or Councell, were contemptuously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, as in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> let the Fathers and
Doctors deliberate and reason <hi>Pro &amp; Contra</hi> as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
yet nothing was concluded, untill it was first agreed
unto by the Pope and his Cardinalls at <hi>Rome,</hi> and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,
who never heard the reasoning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was sent
to <hi>Trent</hi> to be enacted, and that no otherwise then it was
set down by them; which gave occasion to that common
proverbe, That the holy Spirit, whereby the Councell
was directed, came from <hi>Rome</hi> in a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>og-bag. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
all that which was done in this Assembly was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained
by the Tables of the Covenant in <hi>Edinburgh:</hi>
For there were all the members of the Assembly consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
though contrary to the perpetuall practice of the
Church; there were all the Commissions framed, and a
Cople thereof sent to every Presbyterie, as appeared by
the production, since never one of them was different in
one Syllable from another; there also was the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Assemblie set down, and accordingly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
there were all things which were to be proposed
in the Assembly, discussed and concluded by the Rulers
of the Covenant, who for the most part were Lay-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Noblemen, Gentlemen, Burge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es, and some few
Ministers most forward in the cause: therefore it may be
justly said, that the Spirit, whereby those holy Brethren
of the Assembly were ruled, came not from Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
directly from <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> I leave you to imagine by the
effects what Spirit that was, which hath stirred up such
Sedition, Rebellion, Disorder and Confusion both in
Church and Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Then although in these points of Corruptions, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other which for shortnes we omit, this Assembly at
<hi>Glasgow</hi> was not unlike that Councell of <hi>Trest;</hi> yet I
will be bold to say, and that truely, that in some substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
points, that Councell was more formall than this
Assemblie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64434:10"/>
For the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> in the Externall order and
Constitution of the members thereof, keeped more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
and decency according to the order of the Church
many ages before. 1. There was none admitted to that
Councell except Prelates of the Church, Ambassadours of
Princes, and the most learned Doctors in all Europe for
the time; And such as the Prelates thought fit in the
bounds of their Iurisdiction to reason in weighty points
of Doctrine. 2. In their Congregations and Sessions,
they did sit every man in his owne place according to
his degree, with such gravitie, modestie and decencie,
as did become Reverend Fathers, distinguished one from
another by their habits, appointed by the Canons of the
Church, making it appear to the beholders, a Venerable
Assemblie. 3. In their proceedings were appointed the
wisest of the Bishops, and most learned amongst the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
to frame the Articles, and being framed, were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
one by one discussed, by weighty reasons ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely
in severall dayes and diets, all doubts particularly
moved, and Objections solidly answered according to
their grounds, using not onely the testimony of former
approved Councels, Fathers and learned Schoolemen,
but also very frequently the Authority of Sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:
So that if in their conclusions they had pondered
well the reasons alleaged, and had concluded according
to the same, and not according to the Popes sole Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie;
that Councell might have had a more happy event
for the weell and peace of the Christian Church.</p>
               <p>But in this Assemblie at <hi>Glasgow</hi> was not observed that
forme, order or decencie, which did become a venerable
Ecclesiastick meeting: for first, these, who were ever
esteemed the Principall members of all generall or Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Councels, to wit, the Reverend Bishops of the
Church, were excluded; a company of Lay-men, Earles,
Lords, Gentlemen and Burgesses, without warrant, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
or example of the ancient Church were thrust in
their roomes, bearing chiefe Sway in the Assembie, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64434:10"/>
all matters violently for their own ends; so that it
was remarked by wise and grave men, that one Earle and
one Lord made more speech in the Assemblie, than all
the Clergie, except the Moderator. 2. In their Sessions,
no order or decencie observed, all sitting pel-mell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
distinction of Degrees, save onely that Lay-Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Gentlemen occupied the chiefest roomes with

mixt amongst Burgesses, Merchants, and Noblemens ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
hardly to be discerned from them by their Habite
or Carriage; Many of the Ministers in coloured clothes,
all in short cloakes, except the Ministers of <hi>Glasgow</hi> who
had their Gownes; so that unlesse one had known their
persons before, they should scarcely have discerned the
Ministers from the Merchant or Taylor. 3. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
were not there by the approbation of their Bishops
according to the custome of the Primitive Church, and
Acts of the generall Assemblies of <hi>Scotland</hi> long after
the Reformation, as for instance, in that Assemblie at
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> Iuly 1568. It was expresly ordained, that no
Minister should leave his Flock, except such as were
chosen by their Superintendants: but by Commissions
from their new invented form of Presbyteries, wherein
Lay-men had the greatest rule, or rather from the Tables
of the Covenant, who did not choose the most wise, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
and learned Brethren; but the most turbulent, sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and bold to oppose Authoritie: fit members in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of such an Assemblie. 4. In discussing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which were concluded, no reasoning but superficiall;
no carefull pondering of the Reasons, but all taken <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
fide,</hi> which had any shew; no exact distinguishing
of the Articles, but many matters of different nature were
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dled up together confusedly, and with great precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were voyced and concluded. The Assembly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
onely a moneth, and a great part of that time (to wit
from the 21. of November to the 4. of December) was
consumed in circumstantiall points concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64434:11"/>
to be admitted to have voice in receiving and discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their Commissions, in Contestations betwixt the
Commissioner and the Covenanters, in excluding some
of his Majesties Counsellors authorized by him to have
voyce in the Assemblie, contrary to the Practice of all
Ancient approved Councels, either Generall or Nationall;
in rejecting most just protestations of divers Presbyteries
against this Assemblie, as that of the Presbyteries of
<hi>Glasgow,</hi> of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ables,</hi> of <hi>Aberdeine,</hi> of the Channonry of
<hi>Rosse;</hi> in refusing to heare read the most just declinature
and protestations of the Bishops. And finally, in declaring
certaine books of the former Assemblies to be Authentick
registers.</p>
               <p>At last, the fourth of December they enter to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
matters for which this Assembly was required, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at the condemnation of the six last generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
conveened, continued, and concluded by the
Kings Majesties Authoritie, and full consent of the
Church, and ratified by the whole bodie of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in Parliament: which they did in shorter space
then could suffice to reade them over; so precipitate were
they in condemning absolutely so many grave Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
with such unanimous consent, as never one was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
but (without reason or judgement) condemned
them all in one word, by implicite faith given to some
few, neither of the most wise, or learned of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
who had a Committee to invent some apparant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to anull the same: and that is most certaine that the
two part of those who voyced against them, had never
seen the Acts and the proceedings of these Assemblies, or
at least had never read nor perused them; But out of a
blind zeal and Iesuiticall obedience, did it only, because
they were so directed by the Tables of the Covenant, and
their rebellious Leaders.</p>
               <p>In another Session they deposed and excommunicated
summarily fourteen Bishops, upon a pretended false Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
produced before the Presbytery of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> against
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64434:11"/>
them (which by no law or reason could be competent
Iudges to their processe) without lawfull citation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Acts of many generall Assemblies, the Books
of Discipline and perpetuall practice of the Church; For
the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was never accustomed, no, not in
the most strict times of Presbyteriall government, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
so summarily to the sentence of excommunication
against most notorious offenders, without mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and long space granted to the Accused, either to
justifie himself, or declare his repentance. 1. There was
used three private personall Citations to appear before the
Presbytery; next, if those were not obeyed, three publik
Citations one three severall Sabbaths. 3. Followed three
publik prayers for their conversion, and if at any of these
times they did appear, either to purge themselves of the
crime imputed to them, or submitting themselves to the
censure of the Church; The sentence of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not pronounced against them.</p>
               <p>In another Session, they condemned with one voyce
the Book of Common Prayer; the Book of Canons, the
Book of Ordination of Ministers, and Consecration of
Bishops; together with the Court of the High Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
which space was not sufficient to have read over
all those books, muchlesse to peruse them throughly, and
discusse the controverted points therein, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
requisit to be done before they had been abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
rejected.</p>
               <p>But this is strange, that the principall and most weighty
point, for the which chiefly they did procure this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
should have been so slightly, &amp; with such precipitation
handled, to wit, whether Bishops should be reteined or
removed forth of the Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi> A Doctrine
so universally approven by the whole Christian Church,
even in her purest time since the Apostles dayes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in Substance by the reformed Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
for many yeares after the reformation; And though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
for a time, yet re-established again by divers more
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64434:12"/>
lawfull Assemblies than this, ratified by divers Act of
Parliament, and continued now for many yeeres by-gon;
there behoved to be many and weighty reasons why such
a Doctrine should be conversed, with a serious delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ponder and consider them; yet neverthelesse in
this Assembly in one short Session, the whole matter was
proponed, discussed, voiced, concluded, and a large Act
past thereupon.</p>

               <p>ALbeit it were an easie matter to refute all the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Acts of this Assemblie, yet leaving the rest
at this time, we intend onely to examine that Act, <hi>Sess.
26. Decemb.</hi> 8. Against Episcopacie, And that for two
reasons especially:</p>
               <p>First, because the grounds whereupon this Act is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
are the self-same whereupon all the rest of the
controverted Acts are grounded; and therefore these
grounds being declared evidently to be infirme and weak,
it will also appear that together with this Act of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie,
All the rest of their Acts depending thereupon
shall be found to be ruinous, as I trust their fall shall be
suddain.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because the principall aime of the most and
chiefest of these, who were members of that Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
was to suppresse Bishops, because they esteemed them
chiefly to have crossed their Sacrilegious and ambitious

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tate at their
pleasure in Councell and Parliament, by their own voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and voyces of the Gentry and Borroughs, whom
those factious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> did depend for the most part upon

one Noble man or other: then finding that by the re-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing
of Bishops, their rents were taken out of their

and Prio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies also; and finally, that their particular ends
(not alwayes tending to the weell of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or
Kingdome, or Honour of the Prince,) were crossed by
the estate of Bishops: no marvell then, though they be
moved by all meanes possible to suppresse them; and for
that effect have laboured to make use of the simplicitie of
some of the Ministrie, and proud humours of others impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of Subjection to lawfull Authoritie, of whom some
having aimed in vaine at Bishopricks (as is well known
of divers of the Ring-leaders of that Faction) thought it
best for their credit, to declare a great contempt of that
estate, which they had with much labour sought after,
without the desired effect, according to the fable of the
Fox<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others by their former misdemeanors both against
the Church and Regall Authority, being past hope of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advancement, did easily condescend to shake off that
yoak, which their turbulent humours could never suffer
them patiently to bear; those were made to blow the
trumpet of Rebellion, both in their Pulpits and private
conferences, drawing the people after them, and the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest
sort of Ministers also, who did not judiciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
their secret ends, cloaked under the colour of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and libertie of the Church, by which meanes this
condemning of Episcopacie was brought in head with
all the consequences thereof.</p>
               <p>This is the point we mean to examine for the present,
and that you may see the weaknes of their reasons the

some difficultie appeared to some Brethren to arise
out of the word <hi>(Office)</hi> contained in the said Act, what
should be meaned thereby, the Assembly consisting far
the most part of such as voted, and were present in the
Assembly at <hi>Dundie,</hi> to take away the said difficultie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
upon the true meaning and understanding of the

the whole estate of Bishops, as they are now in <hi>Scotland;</hi>
and that the same was the determination and conclusion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64434:16"/>
of the Assembly at this time, because some Brethren
doubted whether the former Act was to be understood of
the <hi>Spirituall function</hi> onely, and others alleaged that the
<hi>whole office of a Bishop,</hi> as it was used, was damnable, and
that by the said Act, the Bishops should be charged to
dimit the same: this Assembly declareth that they meaned
wholly to condemne the whole estate of Bishops, as they
were then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> And that this was the meaning of
the Assembly at that time.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Commissioner presented unto this Assemblie
the Confession of Faith, subscribed by the King and his
houshold, not long before together with a plot of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries

the Assemblie, with a Letter to be directed from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
to the Noblemen, and Gentlemen of the Countrey, for
their action of Presbyteries, consisting of Pastors and
Elders, and dissolutions of Prelacies, and with an offer to
set forward the Policie untill it were established by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:
The Kings letter subscribed by his hand, to the
Noblemen and Gentlemen, was read in open audience of the
whole Assembly.</p>
                  <p>This Assembly ordained the book of Policie to be insert

                  <p>For asmuch as travell hath been taken in the framing of
the Policie of the Kirk, and divers suits have been made
by the Magistrate for Approbation thereof, which yet
hath not taken the happy effect, which good men would

Anent the Confession of Faith lately set forth by the

Assembly in one voyce acknowledgeth the said Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to be a true, Christian, and faithfull Confession, to be
agreed unto by such as truely professe Christ, and have a
care of Religion, and the tenour thereof to be followed
out efoldly, as the same is laid out in the said Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherein that Discipline is sworn to.</p>
                  <p>In the generall Assemblie holden at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
1581. Sess. 10. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Robert Montgomery</hi> is accused

The Assemblie gave Commission to the Presbytery of

in the Ministry of <hi>Stirling,</hi> and not to meddle with any
other office or function of the Kirk; namely, in aspiring
to the Bishoprick of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> against the Word of God,
and Acts of the Kirk, under the pain of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>In the same Assembly it is acknowledged that the estate
of Bishops is condemned by the Kirk, Commission for ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of moe Presbyteries was renewed: and a new Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
made for subscribing the Confession of Faith, and to
proceed against whatsoever persons that would not aknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

                  <p>In the Assembly holden in <hi>April</hi> 1582. there was a new
Commission for erection of Presbyteries where none was at

                  <p>In the generall Assembly holden at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> 1582.
The Generall Assembly gave Commission to some Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries

                     <hi>In the Assemblie holden</hi> Anno 1586. <hi>these two Articles
were agreed upon. First,</hi> It is found that all such as the

               <head type="sub">Discussing the foure Considerations whereby they
were moved to make this Act.</head>
               <p>OUr Covenanters before they come to the point, in
the beginning of the Act, have set down foure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
whereby they alleage they were moved, yea
forced of Necessity to conclude this Act against Bishops:
and albeit they doe not directly appertaine to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Controversie, yet we will shortly observe
some few notes thereupon, to shew upon what imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Considerations this Act hath been grounded.</p>
               <p>Their first Consideration is of the unspeakable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and great mercie of God, manifested to this Nation
in that excellent and divine work of Reformation,
brought to perfection, not onely in Doctrine and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
but also in Discipline and Government, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Whereupon first we must remark, that if they had sori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
considered that excellent work of Reformation,
with due respect towards these worthy Reformers;
(whom God used as instruments in effectuating that
work) they should never have been moved thereby to
have concluded such an Act as this, so directly contrary
to their mind; for they at the Reformation did establish
such a discipline and government in the Church accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Gods Word, as whereby one Pastour under the
Name of <hi>Superintendent</hi> might lawfully have power and
preheminence over other Brethren of the Ministrie, and
over moe particular flock than one; which discipline
and government continued with happie successe in the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> above thirty yeers after the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
but they have made this Act quite contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
thereto, <hi>That it is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> for one Pastor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> have
power and preheminence over other Brethren, nor over moe
particular flock than one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That which they alleage that the second Book of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64434:20"/>
Discipline is the perfection of the work of Reformation,
can no wise be true; for that cannot rightly be called the
perfection of any thing, which doth reverse and destroy
the substance and nature thereof: but so it is that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
established by the second book of Discipline,
which was presbyteriall, including an absolute paritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Pastors, did reverse and destroy the nature of the
government established by the Reformation, which was
Episcopall, including directly Superioritie of one Pastor
over others; and therefore it could no wayes truely be
called the perfection thereof.</p>
               <p>3. It is false that this Discipline was established by the
Confession of Faith, as shall be hereafter qualified by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussing
all the passages falsly and impertinently alleaged
for the same: As likewise I see not how it can be true,
that this book of Discipline was established by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
practice of the Church; for some points thereof
were never practised in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
those which were practised contrary to the estate of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
were not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> long continuance; the practice of 8.
or 10. or 15. yeers (which is the most I can reckon) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be accounted such a continued practice, as may make
prescription against the continuall practice of the whole
Christian Church for many hundred yeares before, and
above six and thirtie yeeres since the approved practice of
the principall points of their Discipline were disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
as we shall shew more particularly hereafter.</p>
               <p>Their second Consideration is, that by mens seeking
their own things and not the things of Christ, many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations
and great evils have been obtruded upon the
Church, to the utter undoing of the work of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and change of the whole forme of worship and face
of the Church.</p>
               <p>To this we answer, that those Constitutions of the
Church (which they call Novations and Evils, such as
the establishing of Bishops; Baptisme in private places in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ase of Necessitie; reverent Kneeling in the Act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64434:20"/>
the Supper of the Lord; not refusing to give it to
the sick who earnestly desire it; the thankfull remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of Gods speciall benefits by prayer; and preaching
of the Word upon certaine appointed dayes; the Cate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of yong children; and presenting of them to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
to blesse them by prayer for increase of knowledge
and continuance of Gods grace) are neither evils in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but tending to the removall of evils from the
worship of God: as irreverence and contempt of the
Sacraments, neglect of a thankfull remembrance of Gods
speciall benefits, and ignorance in youth, and to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
of great good in the Church, as sound Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Reverence in the worship of God, thankfulnesse
for Gods benefits, increase of knowledge in the yonger
sort, and Spirituall comfort to Christian soules in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse:
Neither are they to be accounted Novations, but
rather a restoring of the ancient Constitutions and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
of the Primitive Church in her purest times.</p>
               <p>2. These things cannot be said to be obtruded upon
the Church, which were received by the Consent both of
the Church in Generall Assemblies, and by the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Kingdome in Parliament, as all those Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which they challenge have been: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
those things are said more truely to be obtruded
upon the Church, which are not brought in either by
Assemblie or Parliament, yea directly against the Acts of
both standing in force are violently urged upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
not onely to receive them simply, but likewise to
swear solemnly to the truth thereof by the great name of
God, and that not by any having authority or lawfull
calling thereunto, but by certaine seditious private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
and such are their seditious Covenant and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
applications, or false interpretations of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith; whereby many persons of sundry estates
were by false allurements and violent threatnings, forced
against their minds, to swear directly disobedience to the
Kings Laws and Constitutions of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:64434:21"/>
                  <hi>Finally, it is also false, that those things which they
call Nova<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ions,</hi> have undone the work of Reformation, and
changed the whole forme of Gods worship or face of the
Church: <hi>For the work of Reformation is rather restored
by the establishing of Bishops, which was destroyed in
that point by their Presbyteriall Government, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
paritie of Pastors; as we have touched already, and
shall be more fully cleered hereafter. Then albeit some
Circumstances and Ceremonies in Gods worship, and
externall apparell of the Church have been changed, yet
the substance and forme of Faith, Religion, worship, and
the Beautifull face of the Spouse of Christ, the Church,
doth notwithstanding remaine still without change or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration;
which S.</hi> Austin Epist. 86. <hi>expresseth fitly,
speaking of the like Novations in these words,</hi> Vna fides
oft universa Ecclesiae, tametsi ipsa fidei unitas quibusdam
diversis observationibus celebratur, quibus nullo modo quod
in fide verum est impeditur, omnis enim pulchritudo filia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis
intrinsecùs, illa autem observationes quae variè celebran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
in ejus veste intelliguntur. <hi>That is to say,</hi> The faith
of the universall Church is one, although the unitie of the
Faith it self be celebrated by some diversitie of observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whereby the truth of faith is not hindred; for all the
Beautie of the Kings daughter is within, But these obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
which are diversly celebrated are in her apparell.
<hi>And</hi> Tortullian lib. de virg. vela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d. <hi>faith,</hi> Regula quidem
fidei una omninò est sola immobilis &amp; irreformabilis, &amp;c.
<hi>And a little after,</hi> Hâc lege fidei manente, caetera jam disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinae
&amp; conversationis admittunt novitatem correctionis,
operante &amp; proficiente usque in finem gratia Dei. <hi>That is
to say,</hi> The rule of Faith is altogether one only, unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and such as admitteth no reformation; this Law of
Faith standing firme, the rest that concerne discipline and
reformation may admit the Noveltie of Correction by the
grace of God, which worketh a profitable progresse even to
the end.</p>
               <p>Their third Consideration is, that by the Kings urging
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64434:21"/>
of the Book of Common Prayer, they knowing no other
way to preserve Religion, were moved by GOD, and
urged by Necessity to renew the Nationall Covenant,
which the Lord since hath blessed from heaven, and to
subscribe the Confession of Faith with an <hi>Application,</hi>
abjuring and suspending all Novations formerly introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
till they should be tried in a free generall Assembly.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, first, that the Kings urging of the
Book of Common prayer was not the true essentiall cause
of their rebellious Covenant, but onely an occasion gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
apprehended by the Ring-leaders, to make that a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
to stirre up the people to follow them in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
which they had before purposed in their heart:
For, if it had been the true cause when the King dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that book, their Rebellion had there ceased; for <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata
vera causa tollitur effectus, the true cause being taken
away the effect must needs cease:</hi> But so it is that their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
did never shew it self in so damnable effects, as it
did after the discharge of the book of Common prayer,
and granting of all their petitions. 2. The urging of that
Book containing no impious thing against God, nor
hurtfull to true Religion, could not be a just motive to
move them by any Necessitie to such an action, as by the
fundamentall Laws of the Kingdome is declared to be
high Treason; when as Subjects without permission or
knowledge of the Kings Majestie, doe combine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a mutuall band of maintenance against all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whatsoever, not excepting the King their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne;
yea, it is most evident that this Rebellious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was intended against the Kings Majestie directly,
and against him onely; albeit they cunningly dissemble
and pretend the contrary; for from whom could so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
potent Noblemen and gentlemen of such worth, with
so great a number of their followers, possibly or by any
liklihood fear any danger or harme in their persons or
estates, for refusing the Book of Common prayer, or
other things which they call Innovations, urged chiefly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64434:22"/>
by the Kings Authoritie and speciall Command, if it
were not from the King himself; Could they fear any
harme from thirteen or foureteen Bishops, for the most
part old decrepit and impotent men? or was there any,
the smallest appearance of externall Invasion, or inward
Conspiracie in the Kingdome, before they made it by
their Covenant? so it is manifest that it was from the
King onely they feared danger, being conscious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of their mis-demeanors and Rebellious intentions,
by which it is more than evident, that the band of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
defence was onely intended against the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
self.</p>
               <p>3. Was there no other way to preserve Religion, but
by Disobedience and Rebellion? it is a dangerous and
harmefull physick, which prescribes a remedie worse
than the disease it self: the greatest danger which could
come to Religion by this Book, was only in circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Ceremonies, and some mis-interpreted words, which
being rightly understood could not have been rejected by
peaceable, wise and understanding men, they might have
been better interpreted or otherwise corrected, than by
open disobedience to God and his Anointed: as <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
(according to the saying of the Prophet) <hi>is better
than sacrifice:</hi> so Disobedience and Rebellion bringeth
more danger and harme to Religion, than the alteration
of some indifferent Ceremonies and Circumstances can be
able to doe, as any wise man may consider by the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
effects which ordinarily accompanieth Rebellion.</p>
               <p>4 It is false also that they were moved thereto by
God. For God is the God of order, and the God of peace,
the author and commander of obedience unto Superiors;
and therefore cannot be called without blasphemie, the
author of Rebellion, Disobedience, Disorder, and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in Church or Common-wealth, such as this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is in it self, and hath produced all those evils as the
proper effects thereof: It is the doctrine of Anabaptists
and fanaticall Libertines to ascribe all the foolish conceits
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64434:22"/>
of their braines to the motion of Gods Spirit: But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
it is more probable that they have been moved to
this Rebellious Covenant by that Spirit, whereby <hi>Chore,
Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> were moved to make insurrection,
drawing all the Congregation of Israel to Rebellion
against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n,</hi> since both the Acts are very
like one to another, as is evident by considering the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.
That Traitor <hi>Raviliack</hi> who killed <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> was a confident in his imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
affirming, even to the very death, that he was not
moved to that Fact by any par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ular respect, or instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of another person, but onely by God and the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Mary.</p>
               <p>5. It is false also that they were thereto drawn by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie;
it was thought indeed that those of <hi>Lower Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
were drawn by some Necessity, to confederate
themselves together against the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> (who
was their Prince indeed) yet neither he, nor any of his
Predecessors had such absolute Soveraigntie over them,
as our King hath over <hi>Scotland;</hi> because he violented
their conciences, compelling them not onely to forsake,
but also to forswear the true Religion, and imbrace Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Idolatrie; not by Proclamations onely, but by fire
and sword, and cruell torments in the Inquisition; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
many thousands of them were put to death most cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
before ever they made any combination amongst
themselves, or refused due Obedience to their Prince. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
neverthelesse many wise and learned men are of
opinion, that their rising in Armes against their Prince,
was not altogether justifiable before God: much lesse
then can our Covenanters alleage truely, that they were
drawn by any Necessitie to this Rebellious combination;
since for the refusall of that book, never a man in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
had lost his life or estate, or a drop of his bloud, or was
fined in a farthing, or had his body imprisoned, or a haire
of his head touch'd before that Covenant.</p>
               <p>6. They alleage that this was a renewing of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64434:23"/>
Covenant injoyned by King <hi>Iames,</hi> which is most
false; for it was a plaine contracting of a new one, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in Substance from that which was sworn either
the year 1580. or 1590. as they know well, and their own
conscience beares them witnes. The substance of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
consists 1. in the Authoritie whereby it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.
2. In the parties betwixt whom. 3. In the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Articles whereunto they bind themselves. 4. In
the end for the which it is contracted; but in all these
points, this Covenant is different from the former injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by King <hi>Iames</hi> of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ppy memory.</p>
               <p>First, the Kings Covenant was injoyned by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the King and his Councell, who only under God
hath power to bind all his Subjects: but this was onely
framed and urged by private men, upon those, over whom
they had no lawfull Authoritie civill or ecclesiasticall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in that Covenant the parties were the Kings
Majestie our dread Soveraign on th'one part, and all his
Subjects on th'other part: in this, the parties are some
particular private persons, Noblemen, Barrons, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Ministers, Burgesses, and Commons amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
excluding the Kings Majestie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the matter and Articles whereunto all are
bound in the first Covenant, are the maintenance of true
Religion according to the Confession of Faith, Abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of all Antichristian and Popish errors, the defence
of the Kings Majesties person, Authoritie and estate; but
in this, albeit they pretend to bind themselves by oath to
the defence of all these, yet is it but a pretext to cover
their Rebellion, and <hi>Protestatio contra factum:</hi> for it is
evident that they have in this very Fact, many wayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached
upon the Kings Majesties Authoritie and estate,
contrarie to the fundamentall Laws of the Kingdome;
but the principall Articles whereto they bind themselves
is, 1. To stand together in the mutuall defence one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
against all persons whatsoever. 2. To the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of their false Applications of the Confession of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64434:23"/>
Faith added thereunto, like the Glosse of <hi>Orleans,</hi> destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the meaning of the Text. 3. To forbear the practice
of all those things which they call Novations, constituted
by the consent of the Church, ratified in Parliament, and
commanded by the King, which is directly to swear dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
both to the King and the Church, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to God also. 4. To reject the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church established by the Kings authoritie,
consent of the Church in divers generall Assemblies,
and of the whole estates in Parliament: finally, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
one of the three estates o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Parliament, thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the fundamentall Laws of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the end of the first Covenant was to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
peace and concord both in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
(which was many wayes disturbed in those times)
and defence of the Kingdome from externall Invasions
and inward Seditions, which were upon too evident
grounds then feared: but in this their Covenant the chief
intended end was to disturbe the peace both in the Church
and Kingdome, by stirring up seditious factions therein
against the King and his Loyall Subjects, that in those
troubles (as fishing in troubled waters) they might
work their own particular ends: and not to exclude ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
invasions, but rather to open a gate for strangers
to enter, and if their secret practices with the King of
<hi>France,</hi> and the Estates of <hi>Holland</hi> could have prevailed
(as they were confident they should) to have brought in
forraigne forces within the bowells of the Kingdome;
But praised be God, those Estates were wiser than so, as
to assist Subjects in their unjust Rebellion against their
naturall Prince.</p>
               <p>Finally, we must not omit their foolish and vaine boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64434:24"/>
against the Kings Castles, in putting their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the field, and harming the Kings loyall Subjects
without present damage to themselves: but let not him
that putteth on his Armour boast himself, as he that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it off; <hi>Chore, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abirars</hi> had good successe
at the first, and drew after them in their Rebellious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
two hundred and fiftie Princes of the Assemblie,
famous in the Congregation, and men of Renoune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it
is written, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 2. And a great many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Prince of the people,
and the high Priest of the Lord whom God had set over
them; So that <hi>Moses</hi> being greatly astonished, fell down
most abjectly upon his face before them, and could not
know how to represse that Sedition, except the Lord
had comforted and directed him: these men might have
thought as our Covenanters doe, that the Lord had bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
their enterprize from Heaven; yet ere it was long
they found Gods just Iudgement and Curse both from
Heaven and Earth, for the Earth swallowed up some of
them quick, and others were destroyed by fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
Let all Seditious Rebells therefore learne by this
example to repent in time, and not to boast too confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
of their present successe, but fear the end.</p>
               <p>The fourth and last Consideration is, because his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Commissioners and Councell, by the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
and others of his Subjects by ordinance of the
Councell, had subscribed the Confession of Faith without
their Applications; and that both the one &amp; the other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers
had done it according to the date, tenor and mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it had <hi>An.</hi> 1581. there, for they considered that it was
expedient and proper for the generall Assemblie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the true meaning thereof, as it was at first professed,
to the end that all his Majesties Subjects may be one mind
and heart, and have full satisfaction to all their doubts.</p>
               <p>Concerning this Consideration, we must observe that
howsoever the subscribers of that rebellious Covenant
did understand the Confession of Faith, yet those who
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64434:24"/>
did subscribe the Kings Covenant at his Majesties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
both first and last, could not lawfully swear to it
in any other sence than the King who required the oath
did understand the same; for this is most certaine, <hi>That
all oathes required by a magistrate should be taken in the
direct and explained meaning of him who required the oath:</hi>
But it is evident that his Majestie declared himself plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough, that he did not require his Councell, nor his
other subjects, to sweat this Confession in such meaning as
therby either Episcopacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the other established Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of the Church should be abjured; for otherwise, it
had been a deluding of his Majesties Command by a Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
equivocation, who teach their Supposts that Axiom,
<hi>Vnto dangerous interrogatories one may frame to himself a
safe sense, and swear thereto, thought it be contrary to the
meaning of him who required the Oath.</hi> Therefore I cannot
conceive, that those judicious and discreet Noblemen
would practise Iesuiticall tricks to elude his Majesties
Command, in swearing that Confession and Covenant in
another sense than they knew his Majestie intended.</p>
               <p>2. Albeit, that in their subscribing and swearing they
had all added expresly that restriction, <hi>According to the
meaning it had Anno</hi> 1581. yet will it not follow that
they had any doubt of the true meaning, for we must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppone
that all the Kings loyall Subjects did conceive,
that that Covenant was no otherwise understood at that
time by King <hi>Iames</hi> of happy memory, than it is now by
King <hi>Charles;</hi> to wit, in such a sense as might stand with
Episcopacie, neither could it be otherwise understood as
we shall declare more fully hereafter: and therefore, those
needed not this Act of Assemblie to resolve them of their
doubt in this point; and certainly, this Assembly hath
casten more doubts and scruples in the hearts of men, than
ever they shall be able to resolve, untill it shall be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Null, as indeed it is already really null in it self. It
were an infinit labour to examine all the falshoods of
these Considerations, since there is scarce a line or a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64434:25"/>
therein, which doth not containe divers falshoods;
yet those which we have remarked are sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
how unfirme those considerations are to ground
thereupon a Necessitie of concluding this Act.</p>

            <div n="4" type="chapter">

               <head type="sub">Containing the state of the Question concerning
Episcopacie, as it is here condemned.</head>
               <p>HAving already discussed the falshood and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
of those foure considerations, laid down for
grounds in their preface to the Act; we must now come
to discusse the Act it self: But first of all, before we enter
to the reasons <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> or <hi>contra,</hi> the state of the Controversie
must be first set down, for there is nothing more requisite
to the clear deciding of any Controversie, than the right
stating of the Question; but chiefly in these Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
which are to be determined by voyces or suffrages in
a grave Assemblie of the Church, wherein every one
ought to give his voyce, not according to the example
or injunction of other men, but according to a certaine
knowledge and conscience before God: therefore the
Question must be cleer without ambiguitie, either in the
matter, or in the words and phrases; It is a trick of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisters
to propose a Question or determine it in obscure
and ambiguous termes, which may be drawn to contrary
senses; all such Questions ought to be plaine, clear and
simple, and such as one may easily conceive, and answer
thereto directly and Categorically.</p>
               <p>But in this Act of the Assemblie the proposition of the
Question is set down, in such ambiguous words and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
phrases, that one can hardly either understand the
meaning, or give a direct answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And albeit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Question be set down in the end of the
Act after all the Reasons, yet we must consider it in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64434:25"/>
beginning, to the end we may try how pertinently or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently
the reasons alleaged, doe conclude the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the Assemblie: It is proposed therefore by
the Moderator in these words, <hi>Whether according to the
Confession of Faith, as it was professed in the year 1580.
1581. and 1590. there be any other Bishop, but a Pastor of
a particular flock, having no preheminence nor power over
his Brethren; and whether by that Confession, as it was
then professed, all other Episcopacie is abjured, and ought
to be removed out of this Kirk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, this proposition of the Question is altogether
captious, including a Sophisme <hi>à multis interrogatis;</hi>
for there are three severall Questions expresly included
therein, which are so different in Nature, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly answer to all in one manner, 1 <hi>Whether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Confession of faith, as it was professed in the
year 1580. 1581. &amp; 1590. there be any other Bishop, but
a Pastor of a particular flock, having no preheminence

                     </gap> power over his Brethren:</hi> to this, the voycers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the meaning of the Covenanters behoved to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<hi>negativè,</hi> that there was no other Bishop. 2. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by that Confession, as it was then professed, all other
Episcopacie is abjured:</hi> Certainely, all Covenanters keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own grounds behoved to answer to this <hi>affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mativè,</hi>
that all other was abjured. 3. <hi>Whether all other
Episcopacie behoved to be removed out of this Kirk,</hi> To
this Question also they could not answer but <hi>affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

               </p>
               <p>Is it not then evident? that such a question as this
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ould not be put to voycing, except by those who had a
mind to intangle simple men by a Sophysticall proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for in all matters which are to be determined by
voyces, the question ought to be so proposed, as the voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
may answer by a simple affirmation, or by a simple
negation, and as it is called in the Schools <hi>Categoricè;</hi>
otherwise, there behoved to be a strange confusion in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tinguishing
the voices. But to this Question as it was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64434:26"/>
proposed, no one Categoricall answer could be given by
any, but they behoved of necessitie to answer <hi>negativè</hi> to
one part, and <hi>affirmativè</hi> to another. I have known the
Moderator to have been a quick and solid Logician, and
I should marvell what could make him oversee himself so
grosly in such a weightie busines against all true Logick,
if I did know that passions and affections will often
miscarry wise and learned men into great absurdities: or,
that perhaps the Question was so framed at the tables of
the Covenant, and appointed to be thus proposed at the
Assembly; therefore he could not alter nor change the
forme, because of his Oath of obedience to them as his
Superiors, although he knew it was against all Logick
and good reason.</p>
               <p>But lest they should object, that if the Questions though
many in number, have such a necessary and essentiall co-herence
together, that the one being granted, the rest
must be necessarily granted also, or that upon the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the one, the affirmative of the other dependeth
by necessary consequence; then it is not captious, but one
answer may suffice for all. To this we answer, that these
Questions have no such necessary Cohesion together, for
although the answer of the first were granted to be true,
yet the answer to the second may be false, &amp; albeit the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
be granted, the third may be false: for first, although it
were granted that by the Confession of Faith, there were
no other Bishops but such as were Pastors over a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
flock, and had no preheminence over their Brethren;
yet is it not necessary to grant, that all others were abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
for albeit there be no other Bishops expressed in the
Confession of Faith, yet that will not exclude all others
that are not expressed, yea even in divine Scripture; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in matters necessary to Salvation, <hi>Argumentum
negativum à Scripturis</hi> be good and valid, it is not
written, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not necessary to Salvation; yet is it not
so in all other particulars, not necessarie to Salvation, it
is not written <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not; much lesse can such a reason
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64434:26"/>
be necessarie in humane writs, such as the Confession of
Faith is. First, because all humane writs are subject to
error, and not infallibly true; then because confessions doe
not comprehend every point, which may by any be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in controversie, but those onely which are chiefly
controverted with their principall Adversaries: Now
this point of the preheminencie of Bishops, &amp;c. was not
a point controverted, betwixt the reformers of Religion
who set down the Confession, and their Adversaries the
Papists; And therefore needed not to be mentioned in
the Confession, and by consequent, albeit there was no
such Bishops according to the Confession; yet it is not
necessary that they should be abjured. Then there is as
little coherence betwixt the last two questions, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it had been abjured at that time, yet will it not
follow necessarily, that it be now removed out of the
Church for two reasons; first, because then it might have
been abjured wrongfully and out of Ignorance; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
men comming to better and sounder knowledge,
that which rashly hath been abjured before, may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
restored now. Next, because if there had been a Law
and Constitution against it, for certaine reasons of not
expediencie, the Church might have abjured it for that
time; yet that Law being abrogated by lawfull Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
it may be received againe by the Church: for it is
holden as granted by all, that Oaths given to humane po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Laws, either Civill or Ecclesiastick, obliges no
longer than the Law stands in force; Now therefore since
the Law forbidding preheminencie of one Pastor over
others (if any such Law was) being now abrogated, and
the contrarie established, this preheminencie ought not
to be removed now, though formerly abjured.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is great Ambiguities in the termes of
the proposition themselves, yea, almost every word hath
its own Ambiguitie: for 1. the word <hi>Confession</hi> is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous,
for although there be two writs which by some
are called Confessions, yet there is one onely proper and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64434:27"/>
perfect profession of Faith of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
neither ought there to be any more in one Church; to wit
that large Confession set down at the beginning of the
reformation, wherein is contained all the positive Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
maintained by that Church, which was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
&amp; received in the general Assembly, <hi>An.</hi> 1560. and
ratified by the whole body of the kingdom in Parliament,
1567. and inserted <hi>verbatim</hi> in the body of the Act: that
other which is called the negative Confession is only an
Appendix of the former, containing an abjuration of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
speciall Errors of the Romane Church, so it is
doubtfull which of those Confessions is here understood.
2. There is likewise an Ambiguity in that word, <hi>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Confession;</hi> because it may be understood di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly,
for either it implies that it is expresly contained
therein, and so it is properly according to the same; or
otherwise it may signifie onely that it is not contrary
thereunto, though not particularly expressed: now Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacie
in the first sense perhaps is not according to the
Confession, because it is not expressly mentioned therein,
which is no absurditie as we have shown before; yet is it
according to it in the second sense, because not contrary
thereunto. 3. There is ambiguitie in the words <hi>(As it
is professed Anno 1580. &amp;c.)</hi> For either it must be sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified

is needlesse and superfluous: or by <hi>(Profession)</hi> is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the sense or interpretation thereof, as it was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
and interpreted <hi>An.</hi> 1580. and thus also that restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the profession to those years, is no lesse superfluous;
for it could not be, or at least ought not to have been by
any otherwise interpreted in these years, or now, then it
was understood at the beginning by those who set it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64434:27"/>
down, for (as we say) <hi>unusquis<expan>

interpres,</hi> and the first Reformers, who framed that
Confession, did interpret it in the first book of Discipline,
and Acts of divers Assemblies thereafter, so as it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the power of one Pastor over others: Therefore,
if any did interpret it in a contrary sense, they wronged
greatly the worthy Reformers of the Religion, and we
are not now obliged to imitate them in their wrongfull
dealing. 4. There is Ambiguitie likewise in the word
<hi>(Bishop)</hi> which sometimes is taken in a generall sense, as
it is attributed to every Pastor in the Church who hath
power to oversee the actions of the people in Spirituall
affaires: sometimes more particularly, as it signifieth those
that have Iurisdiction both over moe pastors and people
of a certaine bounds called a <hi>Diocese,</hi> as it hath been taken
in all Churches since the Apostles dayes, untill this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
age, but because this is discussed in the Question it
self I speak no more of it.</p>
               <p>Finally, there is Ambiguities in those words <hi>(A par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
flock,)</hi> for a Diocese is the particular flock of a
Bishop, aswell as a Parish is the particular flock of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister:
many more Ambiguities might be remarked in
the words of this Question, which for briefues we omit
here, but shall be (God willing) discussed as occasion
serves in the subsequent discourse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is also subtle Sophysticall dealing, that they
have drawn the Question <hi>à Thesi ad Hypothesin;</hi> they doe
not aske whether Episcopacie be lawfull in it self or not,
but whether it should be retained or removed, in regard
of the Confession of Faith, and of the Covenant, and that
only as the Confession was understood <hi>An. 1580. 1581. &amp;
1590.</hi> involving the Question in divers intricate suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
which they have done subtilly for their own ends:
first, because they were not able to bring any solid testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Scripture, or approved Fathers, or practice of
true antiquitie, to prove the unlawfulnesse of that office;
and therefore, neither in this Act, nor in any other Act of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64434:28"/>
this Assembly is there one syllable produced out of Gods
Word to approve their conclusions, but all their proofes
are from their Negative Confession of Faith, impudently
wrested from the true meaning thereof, from the Oath
of the Covenant strangely mis-applyed, and from certaine
Acts of late Generall Assemblies; which all at the best are
but humane testimonies, and such manner of proofes is
not consonant to their ordinary exclamations against hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ordinances and Traditions of men, continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to all their speeches and actions, Gods Word, and
Conscience which only is to be grounded thereupon. 2.
They have framed the Question so, restricting the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Confession to the year 1580. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because it is
evident that from the reformation untill that time, they
could not alleage any Act of Assembly or Book of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
shewing that the Church had any such intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as absolutely to condemne Episcopacie: but by the
contrary, the Church had declared both by the first book
of Discipline, and Acts of divers Assemblies (as shall be
fully made clear) that she did so explaine her meaning in
the Confession of Faith concerning the point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as she did approve expresly this power and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence,
and charge over moe particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ocks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by this Act. 3. They framed the question in this
manner, to strike a terror of a fearfull perjurie upon the
weak Consciences of these who could not discerne right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
either the quality of the Oath or the matter thereof;
to make them more plyable to their Rebellious projects,
perswading them, that the swearers themselves and all
their posteritie were bound to the observation of that
Oath, according to their false interpretation, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of any interveening Law or Constitution absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them from it; and that this fearfull perjurie could
never be expiated, except they renewed their Oath to
that Covenant, together with their false Applications
and perverse interpretations, farre different, yea flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their meaning who framed the Confession of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64434:28"/>
Faith and injoyned the Oath, which as we shall shew,
is but an Imaginarie fear.</p>
               <p>It had been more plaine dealing, and fitter to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
all doubts, if they had proposed the Question more
simply, and in more perspicuous termes, asking, <hi>Whether
the Office of a Bishop be lawfull in it self or not;</hi> for, if it
had been solidly proven by Gods Word to be unlawfull,
then it had been evident also, that the Oath whereby it
was abjured, was lawfull; and no man could have doubted
but that Oath did bind, both the Actuall swearers and all
their posterity to the observation thereof: but if it had
been found by cleer Scripture that the Office of a Bishop
had been lawfull, then no man could have doubted but the
Oath whereby they did abjure it was unlawfull; and
therefore, that no man was bound to the observation
thereof, but by the contrary, all were bound in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to break such an Oath: or, if it had been found of
middle nature, neither simply unlawfull, nor necessarily
lawfull at all times, but a thing indifferent, in the power
of the Church and Supreme Magistrate, to make a Law
either establishing or abolishing the same, who might also
require an Oath of all to observe that Law: then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
no man could have doubted but that so long as that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Law stood in force, that Oath did bind all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to the observation of it; as likewise that the Law
being abolished by lawfull Authoritie, no man was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bound, but was <hi>ipso facto</hi> absolved from the Oath. So
the Question being propounded in this manner, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
any other wayes it had cleered all doubts and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all to be of <hi>One mind and one heart;</hi> but being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in their manner, no resolution did take away all
doubts (as they promised to doe by this Act) but rather
did multiplie them and make them greater: For albeit it
had been cleered, that Episcopacie had been abjured by
the Oath of the Covenant (which notwithstanding is not
done) yet a greater doubt remained, whether that Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration
was lawfull or not; which could not be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64434:29"/>
except it had been first made manifest, that Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie
was unlawfull in it self by Gods Word.</p>
               <p>Yet that we may follow them in their own method,
and reason upon their own grounds, we shall leave at this
time the probations which may be brought for the office
of a Bishop from Gods Word, and practice of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church, which hath been sufficiently performed by
divers learned Divines, to the which the best of that Sect
could never sufficiently answer. Taking then the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
as it is set downe by them, there are two points
which they onely here condemne in that office; first, that
they have charge over moe Parishes than one, secondly,
that they have power and preheminencie over their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
we shall make it therefore evident, 1. That by the
Confession of Faith, Books of Discipline, Acts of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Assemblies, and long continued practice of the
Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> at the reformation and many yeers
after, this preheminence and power of one Pastor over
others, and charge over moe parishes than one, hath been
acknowledged to be lawfull. Secondly, we shall shew
that none of those passages brought by them, at length in
the Act it self, (which doubtlesse were the strongest they
could find) forth of the abjuration in the Covenant,
books of Discipline, and Acts of former generall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
doe prove their conclusion; but that all of them
are either falsly or impertinently cited, farre by, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the meaning of the Authors, and therefore that
all of them are Sophystically alleaged.</p>

               <p>FIrst, we must observe that there are two Confessions
of Faith so called in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as we
have remarked before, to wit, that large Confession, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
at the first reformation, framed by <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> and
other faithfull Ministers <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. Confirmed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
generall Assemblies, received by the whole body of
the Kingdome, ratified by Act of Parliament 1567. and
inserted in the body of the Act, which is the only proper
Confession of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> containing all the
positive grounds of the Reformed Religion, especially
in matters of Faith, controverted betwixt us and the
Papists, and other Hereticks; the other called common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Negative Confession, which is not properly a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Confession, but an Appendix of the former, framed
not by any Ordinance of the Assemblie of the Church, but
by the appointment of the Kings Majestie and Councell;
first sworn and subscribed by the Kings Majestie himself
and his houshold, then by an Act of Councell dated the
5. of March 1580. It was ordained that all persons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Kingdome should swear the same; and for
more commodious doing thereof, it was presented
by his Majesties Commissioners to the Assemblie holden
at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> 1581. that they might approve it, and
injoyne every Minister to see the Oath taken by all
their Parishioners, and it did containe an abjuration
of most speciall grosse errors of Poperie: the same ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation
was againe commanded by the King to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
in the year 1590. (when as that Conspiracie of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64434:30"/>
some Papists trafficking with the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered)
having annexed thereto a generall band or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
whereby all the Subjects bindes themselves with
the Kings Majestie for maintenance of true Religion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Confession of Faith set down at the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and for the defence of the Kings Majesties
person, Authoritie and estate, against all Enemies within
and without the Kingdome; to the end that true profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
and his Majesties loyall Subjects might more easily
be discerned from hypocriticall Papists and seditious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells.</p>
               <p>Now as for that onely perfect Confession there is no
clause nor Article therein, which either expresly, or by
any probable consequence condemneth this power and
preheminencie here controverted: neither have they
been so bold, as to alleage any passage out of the same; nor
was it the meaning of those godly and learned persons
who set it down, and proposed it to be received by the
Church and Kingdome of <hi>Scotland;</hi> nor the meaning of
the Church and Kingdome who accepted and approved
the same, as the true Doctrine proved by Gods Word,
thereby to condemne any such thing: yea, it is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that they had a quite contrary meaning, as they
themselves did publikly declare in the first book of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
shewing therein what manner of Government
and Policie they doe require in the true reformed Church;
to wit, that it should be governed by <hi>Superintendents</hi> in
every Province, having power and preheminence over
all the Ministers and all the Parishes within their bounds:
for this book of Discipline was framed by the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who set down that confession of Faith, and at the
same very time or shortly thereafter; and that by the
command and direction of the great Councell of <hi>Scotland,</hi>

generall Assemblies, and the continuall practice of the
Church for twice as many years thereafter, as Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Governmental remained in force.</p>
               <p>Then that we may see how farre this power of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents
did extend, we must consider that the first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
of Religion, (because of the detestable enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Papisticall Bishops, which made their persons,
offices, and very names to be detested) out of a certaine
zealous scrupulositie, would not at first give the title of
Bishops to the rulers of the Church; yet neverthelesse by
the example of many other reformed Churches, gave to
those who were appointed to their charge a title of the
same signification, calling them <hi>(Superintendents:)</hi> So
changing a proper Greek word into a barbarous Latine,
for the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

and needed not any particular Commission thereto, but
being once admitted to the office, were ever acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
thereafter, and received without any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;
as is evident by that Assemblie at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
Iuly 1568. wherein the members of the Generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
are divided in two Ranks, some are appointed to be
ordinary and perpetuall members, as <hi>Superintendents</hi> and
<hi>Commissioners of Provinces;</hi> the other sort are mutable,
as <hi>Commissioners of Churches, Vniversities, Townes,</hi> and
<hi>Provinces;</hi> the first had no need of particular Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but were perpetuall and first called in the Roll, the
other were changeable from Assemblie to Assemblie, and
had new particular Commissions from those by whom
they were directed. In the Assemblie at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> 1563.
that every Superintendent shall appear the first day of the
Assemblie: at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> March 1578. the same Act is
renewed, and Bishops also are appointed to be present at
all Assemblies, or else to be accounted unworthy of the
office, and by divers other Acts: yea, after that the othee
of Bishops begun to be questioned in the Assemblie 1579.
Iuly 7. Sess. 9. It is ordained <hi>That Bishops and Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouers
of Provinces who abjent themselves from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>
Assemblies shall be censured according to the Act,</hi> august
12. 1575. and that Act to be understood not onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:64434:32"/>
Bishops having power of Visitation from the Church,
but also of such as have not that office.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, As all Bishops have power to hold their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
twice in the year, when and where it shall please
them within their own Diocese, and there all the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
of the Diocese are bound to conveene, and all matters
which concerne the Diocese are therein to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Bishop. So likewise albeit that in the first book
of Discipline, there is no mention of Synodall or Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Assemblies: yet after by Acts of Generall Assemblies,
it is appointed that every Superintendent and Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
shall hold Synods in their own bounds, wherein all
matters pertaining particularly to their own Diocese or
Province shall be determined, as appeares by the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
at</hi> Edinburgh <hi>March 5. 1570. wherein these two
Acts are set downe: first,</hi> It is ordained that offenders in
hainous crymes shall not appear before the generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
but shall be called before the Superintendents, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
of Provinces to appear before them in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodall
Conventions, and there to receive their injunctions,
conforme to the order used before in Generall Assemblies.
<hi>Itein,</hi> It is ordained that all Question<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> concerning the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
shall be propounded first to the Superintendent et
Commissioner, to receive resolution in their Synodall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions;
and if they be diffieile, to be propounded to the next
generall Assemblie by the Superiatendent or Commissioner;
with certification that no Question shall be received here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
from any private Minister. <hi>So likewise in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie
at</hi> Edinburgh 1568. It is ordained that no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
exhort or reade, or other person shall trouble the
Generall Assembly with such matters as Superintendents
may and ought to decide in their Synods; And if they doe so
their Letters shall be rejected.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, As no Pastor ought to have place in Nationall
Assemblies, except such as are authorized thereunto by
their Ordinarie Bishop, according to the custome of the
ancient Church: Although our Bishops in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:64434:32"/>
since they were re-established, did never usurpe this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to themselves, but left the Election of the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
in the power of the Brethren of the Presbyterie: So
likewise it was ordained in the Assemblie at <hi>Edinburgh
1568. That no Minister should have voyce in Generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
nor leave their flocks to attend thereat, unlesse
they be chosen by their Superintendent, as men known able
to reason, and of knowledge to judge in matters of weight.</hi>
The same likewise we see testified to have been the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by a Letter written by
the Lord <hi>Glames</hi> then Chancellor of <hi>Scotland</hi> unto <hi>Beza,</hi>
about the year 1575. when Episcopacie began to be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled,
wherein <hi>Quaest.</hi> 2. he saith, <hi>Post reformatam Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionem
consuetudine receptum est, ut Episcopi</hi> (under
which word he comprehendeth the Superintendents) <hi>&amp;


ex Ministris, Pastoribus, ac Senioribus, tot, quot ijde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
Episcopi jusserint, unum in locum conveniant, cum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipuis
Barronibus, ac Nobilibus, Religionem veram profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentibus,
&amp; de doctrinâ &amp; de moribus inquisituri.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixtly, As all the presentation of Benefices vacant were
to be directed to the Bishop of the Diocese where the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
lyes; so that if the person presented be found qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
he may enjoy the same. So is it appointed at the
Assembly holden at <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Iohnstone</hi> Iune 1563. <hi>That when
any Benefice shall chance to vaick, or is now vacant, that a
qualified person be presented to the Superintendent of that
Province where the Benefice lyes, and that he being found
sufficient, be admitted Minister to that Kirk, &amp;c.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the Assembly at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> 1578. (wherein they
alleage the second book of Discipline was agreed unto)
one of the Petitions of the Assemblie preferred to the
King and Councell was, <hi>That all presentations to Benefices
may be directed to the Commissioner or Superintendent
where the Benefice lyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, As the Ordination of Ministers appertaines
peculiarly to the Bishop of the Diocese. So likewise the
Ordination (which by the stile of <hi>Scotland</hi> is called <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:64434:33"/>
or <hi>Conftirmation)</hi> not onely of Ministers, but also
of Readers, Schoolmasters and Principalls of Colledges,
did appertaine to the Superintendents in their owne
bounds, as is evident by the fifth Chapter of the book of
Discipline, in the Article of Superintendents, and in the
Article of Schools and Universities.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, As Bishops have at all times had power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the life, doctrine and behaviour of the Clergie of
his own Diocese, and to admonish, correct, or censure
them accordingly. So likewise in the same book of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
<hi>Cap.</hi> 5. the Superintendents received power and
authoritie to visit the Churches of their bounds, so often
as they may, and therein not only to preach, <hi>But also to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the life, diligence and behaviour of all the Ministers, as
likewise the orders of the Kirks, and manners of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and to admonish where admonition needeth, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them by the censures of the Kirk, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ninthly, As Bishops have power of suspension or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Ministers, who are either scandalous in their
lives, or hereticall in their doctrine. So by the book of
Discipline, and divers Acts of the Assemblies, that power
doth appertaine to Superintendents, Commissioners or
Visitors, as is manifest by that place of the book of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plince,
cited by us in the former Article: and by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie
holden at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> April 1576. wherein it is
said, <hi>Anent the demand made by</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Andrew Hay <hi>Parson
of Ranthrow, if every Commissioner or Visitor in his own
bounds hath alike power and Iurisdiction to plant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
suspend and depose for reasonable causes: the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie
resolved affirmative, that they have alike power
and Iurisdiction therein, as is contained in the particular
Acts concerning the Iurisdiction of Visitors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tenthly, As Bishops, because of their places and great
charges in overseeing all the Churches, have greater rents
appointed to them than to other Pastors. So likewise by
the book of Disciplie, <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. in the Article for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of Ministers, is appointed almost foure times as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64434:33"/>
stipend for the Superintendent, as for other private
Ministers.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it is evident by many Acts of Generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
that those Bishops who had joyned themselves
to the reformed Church, retaining still the office and
title of Bishops, did by approbation of the generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
exercise their Iurisdiction over the Ministrie
and people of their own Diocese, even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Reformation almost; for in the Assembly at
<hi>Edinburgh, 1582. Alexander Gordon</hi> Bishop of <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
was authorized <hi>to plant Ministers, exhorters and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and to doe such other things as has been heretofore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to be done by Superintendents or Commissioners.</hi>
In the Assembly at S. <hi>Iohnstone,</hi> Iunc 1563. the Bishops
of <hi>Orknay</hi> and <hi>Kai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hnes</hi> are allowed to exercise the same
Iurisdiction; and to shew that they did not this by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion
of Superior Authoritie, but of their own volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
motion, in that Assembly it is appointed, that a Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
shall be preferred in name of the whole Assembly
to the Queens Majestie, that she would be pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the thirds of the Bishopricks (which were then in
the Queens hands) to the Bishops, who were allowed
by the Church to be Commissioners, for planting of
Churches within the bounds of their own Diocese:
and therafter <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. All Bishops were by speciall
Act of the Generall Assemblie restored to the function, at
the desire of the Earle of <hi>Lenox</hi> then Regent of <hi>Scotland:</hi>
and the next year in the Assembly at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> 1573.
certaine limitations of their power were added, not very
strict which no Bishop can refuse; 1. <hi>That the Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Bishops in their Ecclesiasticall function, should not
exceed the Iurisdiction of the Superintendents, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
they had and presently have;</hi> which Iurisdiction, as
we have declared, was no lesse than that which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
require now. 2. That they should be willingly
subject <hi>to the Discipline appointed by the Generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
as members thereof:</hi> This likewise is reasonable, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64434:34"/>
no Bishop will think himself exeemed from the censure
of a Nationall Assemblie lawfully constituted, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the established and approved orders of the
Church. 3. <hi>That no Bishops give co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ation of Benefices
within the bounds of Superintendents without their consent
and testimoniall subscribed by their hands:</hi> This was also
reasonable, for Superintendents were also Bishops, and it
is conforme to the ancient Canons of the Church, That
no Bishop should give ordination or collation to any
within the Diocese of another Bishop without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and testimoniall. 4. <hi>That Bishops in their own Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese
visite by themselves, where no Superintend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nts are:</hi>
which indeed is their duty, if they be not impedited ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by infirmitie, or by some weightier affaires of the
Church. 5. <hi>That they give no collation of Benefices with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the advice of three qualified Ministers:</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of <hi>Scotland</hi> heretofore did astrict themselves fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for they were not accustomed to give collation of
Benefices (except <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> were to men of known worth in
the exercise of the ministry before) without the advice
of the whole Brethren of the Exercise in the bounds
where the Benefice lyes, committing the whole triall
both of their life and doctrine to them, and according to
their Testificate did accept or reject him who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.</p>
                  <p>By this then which we have truely related out of the
book of Discipline, and Acts of Generall Assemblies of
the Church, it is manifest, that the true Confession of faith,
as it was professed at the Reformation, and many yeers
thereafter, had no such meaning as condemne or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bjure
the power and preheminence of <hi>One Pastour over others,
or over moe particular flocks than one:</hi> But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
did approve the same, as it is explained (concerning
the point of Government) by the book of Discipline and
practice of the Church, under the title of <hi>Superintendent</hi>
untill the year 1590. and under the title of <hi>Bishop</hi> untill
the year 1580. for untill those years neither the one nor
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64434:34"/>
the other were abrogated by the Assembly of the Church,
the first Act condemning that Iurisdiction under the title
of Bishops was in that Assembly at <hi>Dundie</hi> 1580. and
the first Act abolishing the office and title of <hi>Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>
was in that Assembly at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> August 1590.
wherein it is declared that <hi>since Presbyteries were fully
established, that Superintendents and Commissioners were
neither necessarie nor expedient.</hi> What regard should be
had to those Acts we shall shew hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Is it not therefore too impudent and manifest a calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
and a scandalous impurtation laid by our Covenainers
upon the worthy reformers of the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi>
and those who did prosecute the same for many years,
that their meaning in the Confession of Faith was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
that as unlawfull, which they did approve by
their plaine and publike declaration and continuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice?
As it is also a subtill and hypocriticall dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Ring-leaders of this Rebellion (against the
knowledge and conscience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f those who knowes the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie
of that Church since the Reformation) to professe
and perswade people that their upright intentions is to

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
since they are manifestly doing the quite contrary;
abolishing, violently that order of Government which
was established by the Reformation, and establishing in
place thereof a most dangerous Novation, never heard of
in many Christian Church since the beginning untill this
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> age, and whereof the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> never
thought of, nor dreamed at the Reformation or many
yeers thereafter; untill it was brought by a violent wind
from <hi>Geneva,</hi> bringing therewith great trouble and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
both first and last.</p>

               <head type="sub">Shewing that this power and preheminence of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
was not abjured by the Negative Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
or Covenant.</head>
               <p>HAving showne that this power and preheminence
of Bishops was not condemned by the principall
and proper Confession of Faith of the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
It followes also, that we shew that it was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by that abjuration in the Covenant called the
<hi>Negative Confession;</hi> which by them improperly and
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is called a <hi>Confession:</hi> For it is absurd, and
almost <hi>repugnans in adjecto,</hi> to say that it should be the
Confession of Faith in any Church, which doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
any positive point of Doctrine to be beleeved, but
consisteth onely of meere Negatives, which are not to be
beleeved. It was onely therefore set down as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix
of the true Confession, for that end which we
declared before: For this is the ordinary manner both of
publike Confessions of Churches, and private Confessions
of particular persons, first to set down the positive Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in certaine Articles and propositions, which are
properly the Confession of Faith; and then by way of
Appendix deduced from thence, to adjoyne damning and
abjuring of the contrary errors: so we see it done in most
of the Confessions of reformed Churches, collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in that book called <hi>Syntagma Confessionum.</hi> So
doth <hi>befa</hi> in his Confession, and learned <hi>Zanchius</hi> in
his: right so we must conceive the matter, that those ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurations
of Popish errors set down in the Covenant, are
but <hi>Appendices</hi> deduced from the Articles and proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which comprehend the Confession of Faith: yea,
the very words of that Covenant make it cleer and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
for therin it is first said, <hi>We beleeve with our hearts
and confesse with our mouthes, that this is the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64434:35"/>
Faith and Religion, which is particularly expressed
in the Confession of our Faith, established and confirmed by
divers Acts of Parliament, &amp;c. To the which Confession
and forme of Religion we agree in all points, &amp;c.</hi> In these
words is the proposition and summe of the Confession,
the Appendix followeth thereafter in these words, <hi>And
therefore we abhorre and detest all contrary Doctrine and
Religion, but chiefly Papistrie and particular heads there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
&amp;c.</hi> whereby it is evident, that it is onely the proper
ancient Confession of Faith set down at the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereunto they did directly swear in that Covenant;
but unto the abjuration of errors they did onely swear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly,
and by consequent, as they were contrary to the
doctrine contained in the Confession of Faith.</p>
               <p>From this then that we have shown to be true, we
may bring a forcible argument to prove, that by this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration
the power and preheminence of Bishops is not
abjured: For this abjuration being but an Appendix de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by necessary consequence, it could not of it self
have another meaning, or at least not a contrary sense to
that Confession whereupon it depends; but so it is that
the meaning of the Confession of Faith, as it was explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Church, was no other, but that it was lawfull
for one Pastor to have this power &amp; preheminencie over
others, &amp;c. Therfore the abjuration could not have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
meaning, towit, that this power and preheminencie
was unlawfull in it self. The assumption of this argument is
already sufficiently qualified in the former Chapter by the
book of Discipline, Acts of divers generall Assemblies,
and long continued practice of the Church. The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is evident in it self, for it is an absurd thing to say,
that an Appendix should have a contrary sense to the
principall proposition, from whence it is deduced by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
consequence: all good Logicians know this, of
which number to my knowledge the Moderator is one,
who hath in his time composed many accurate proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with their Appendices; and would not have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64434:36"/>
one of his Schollers with patience to set down
their <hi>Thesis</hi> with so evill knit consequences, as they
would make us beleeve, is betwixt the confession of
Faith, and the Abjuration of the Covenant depending
thereupon. I can finde no reason why he and other
learned men of that Assemblie should be so farre misled
against all true Logick and sound reason; except it be (as
appeares) that they have captivated their understanding
to the Tables of the Covenant, that for obedience thereto
they have forgot all rules of Logick, to advance <hi>per fas
&amp; nefas</hi> their Idoll of Presbyteriall Government.</p>
               <p>But our Covenanters objects, that albeit the Confession
of Faith might have been understood so by those who
have set it down, and so interpreted by the Church for a
long time, as that thereby this power and preheminency
was not condemned; yet the Generall Assembly of the
Church (to whom it appertaines to interpret the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith) might understand and interpret it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
as it did in that Assembly at <hi>Dundie</hi> 1580. wherein
Episcopacie was condemned, and now in this Assembly
at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> 1639.</p>
               <p>To this we answer first, It is possible indeed, that men
might understand it otherwise then it was understood at
the beginning, yea in a contrary sense as the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
doe interpret it now: But the Question is, whether
both those contrary sense can be the true meaning of the
Confession; I hope they will not judge so, except they
would make the Confession of Faith like a nose of wax,
(as some blasphemous Papists speak of the Scripture) or
that they would make the Confession (which ought to be
a firme and constant rule, to try the doctrine of all within
the Church) like a <hi>Lesbian rule,</hi> which may be applyed
both to crooked and straight lines, or to contrary and
contradictory senses. Then if it be so, it may be asked
which of those is the true meaning? Certainely, there is
no reasonable man but will esteeme that to be the true
meaning which is intended and expressed by the author
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64434:36"/>
thereof; For as we say, <hi>Vnusqui<expan>

                     </gap> verborum
optimus interpres,</hi> except such a one as speaketh non-sense:
but so it is, that they that framed the Confession of the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Church who received the
same, did declare their meaning therein to be such, as that
thereby this power and preheminencie was not damned,
but directly approved; Therefore that contrary meaning
which they ascribe to the Church in the year 1580. 1581.
1590. must needs be false.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Covenant and abjuration therein was
neither framed by the Authoritie of the Church or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Assembly, nor was the Oath required by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie:
but both was done by the Authoritie of the
King and Councell, at whose direction this Covenant
and abjuration was framed, and the Oath and subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereto required of all his Subjects by his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
therefore it appertaineth onely to his Majestie and
Councell to declare the meaning thereof, and in what
sense he did require the Oath of all his Subjects: For this
is a most true <hi>Axiom</hi> agreed unto by all orthodox wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>That all Oathes required by a Magistrate should be
taken according to the direct and plaine meaning of him who
requireth the same:</hi> But it is most manifest that neither
the King nor Councell did require that oath in such a
sense, as thereby Episcopacie should be condemned; for he
and his Councell did plainely declare before that time, at
that same very time, and many times afterward, that his
expresse meaning, purpose, and constant intention was,
to continue the estate and office of a Bishop in the
Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and to withstand all motions ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the overthrow thereof, as we shall shew more
particularly. For first, that this abjuration was set forth
by the King and Councels appointment, and that by his
Authoritie onely the Oath was required, is manifest both
by that Act of Councell, <hi>March</hi> 5. 1580. which they
have prefixed before their Rebellious Covenant pressing
thereby to make people beleeve, that it was authorized
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64434:37"/>
by the King: as likewise by the Acts of Assembly cited
here by themselves, wherein is declared, <hi>That the Kings
Commissioner presented to the Assembly in April 1581. the
Confession of Faith subscribed by the King and his houshold
not long before,</hi> and in that Act approving this Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
cited here by them it is expresly acknowledged that
it <hi>was set forth by the Kings Majestie.</hi> Next that it was
to be understood according to the Kings Majesties mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
appeareth also by the same Act where it is said, <hi>That
it should be followed out efoldly, as the same is laid out in the
Kings Proclamation,</hi> for that word <hi>Efoldly</hi> signifieth, that
they should follow not onely the words, but likewise the
sense and meaning which was intended in his Majesties
proclamation, not in a twofold sense, as if the Assemblie
would intend one sense and the King another, but sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and sincerely by all in the same words and meaning
which his Majestie did expresse in his Proclamation.
Thirdly, that his Majestie did not intend, that it should be
sworn and subscribed in such a sense or meaning, as that
thereby Episcopacie should be condemned is also most
manifest. 1. By his Majestie and Councell often rejecting
the instant petitions of divers Assemblies, for establishing
the second book of Discipline, whereby the power of
Bishops is impaired, and absolute paritie of all Pastors
established; as they acknowledge themselves by that Act
of the Assembly at <hi>Glasgow</hi> 1581. cited here by them,
wherein are these words, <hi>Because divers suits have been
made to the Magistrate for approbation to the book of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
which yet have taken no great effect.</hi> Then because
his Majestie both before this time, at this time, and after,
did shew evidently that he did approve the office of a
Bishop, as he testified by his divers protestations against
those Assemblies which pressed to suppresse the same, and
by his presentation of Bishops to the places, whensoever
they hapned to be vacant; as he did at that same very
time, present <hi>M. Rob. Montgomery</hi> to the Archbishoprick
of <hi>Glasgow:</hi> and by that Act of Parliament 1584. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64434:37"/>
the whole Iurisdiction of Bishops was ratified by his
Majestie with consent of the whole estates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that this Abjuration or Confession (call it
as they please) was framed by the Kings Majestie, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be subscribed and sworn by his Authoritie, and
that in such a sense, as that thereby Episcopacie was not
understood to be abjured; It must be also presupponed,
that all those who did swear or subscribe the same, did it
in no other sense or meaning, otherwise they did swear
falsly, sophystically, and by Equivocation: therefore it
must necessarily be concluded, that by that Oath of the
Covenant 1580. 1581. 1590. and 1591. Episcopacie, nor
the power and preheminence of one pastor over others,
or moe particular flocks than one, was not abjured by
honest men, who had an efold and upright meaning in
taking their Oath. Neither can the interpretation of this
Assemblie at <hi>Glasgow</hi> 1639. give any fure warrant to those
who hath sworn in a sense contrary to the Kings mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for if this Abjuration or Covenant had been the Act
of the Church properly, there had been some appearance
that a lawfull generall Assembly now might give forth
the true interpretation thereof; but since it is the King
and Councels Act, and the Oath thereto required of all the
Subjects by his Authoritie, it doth not appertaine to the
Generall assembly, especially such an unformall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
one as this, to declare in what sense it should be
understood.</p>
               <p>So that it is but false and vaine fear, wherewith they
would burden the consciences of all the Kingdome of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> as being fearfully perjured, by establishing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the pretended oath of the Covenant, the office of
Bishops in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and giving obedience unto them:
But on the contrary, they are rather forsworn and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured,
who contrary to the meaning of their first
oath, have by their new rebellious Covenant and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of their Assembly abjured Episcopacie. And of this
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64434:38"/>
no man needeth to doubt, but that all those who have
acknowledged Bishops, and have taken their oath of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall
obedience, and now by perswasion of their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
have broken their solemn Oath, in disobeying and
contemning their authoritie, and ratifying their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
by another Oath, are evidently forsworn, as most
of the Ministers of that Assembly have done; Let them
in sincerity of mind search their own consciences in this
point, and I doubt not, that if it have any life therein,
they will finde themselves sensibly pricked thereby.</p>

               <p>HAving now shown that neither by the principall
Confession of Faith, nor by the Appendix thereof
called Abjuration, nor by the first book of Discipline, nor
by any Acts of Assemblies, nor practice of the Church ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

of Faith in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but all their
Arguments are of a later foundation, and may be in summe
reduced to three sorts; first, they bring certaine broken
sentences <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut of the Abjuration in the Covenant, which
they call the Confession, then some Acts of their late Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Assemblies, and thirdly, some passages out of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64434:38"/>
second book of Discipline to the which we shall answer
in their own order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And first they bring foure severall sentences out of the
Abjuration or negative Confession, falsifying and wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
them strangely, as to make them appeare to have
some shew of proving their determination: The first pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
is in these words,</hi> We professe that we detest all Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
brought into the Kirk, without, or against the Word
of God, and Doctrine of this reformed Kirk. <hi>The second
is,</hi> We abhorre and detest all contrary Religion and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
but chiefly, all kind of Papistry in generall, nad par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
heads; as they were then damned and confuted by the
Word of God, and Kirk of Scotland, when the said Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
was sworn and subscribed, Anno 1580. <hi>and 1581.
1590. and 1591. The third is,</hi> That we detest the Roman
Antichrist, his worldly Monarchy and wicked Hierarchie.
<hi>The fourth is,</hi> That we joyne our selves to this reformed
Kirk, in Doctrine, Faith, Religion and Discipline, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
and swearing by the great name of God, that we
shall continue in the Doctrine and Discipline of this Kirk,
and defend the same according to our vocation and power.</p>
               <p>We answer first in generall to all these passages, that by
none of them is either Episcopall Government abjured,
for first in the words themselves, there is no mention ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Bishops or their power and preheminency over
others, or their charge over moc particular flocks, or of
Presbyteries of absolute parity of Pastors: Therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they have recourse to some secret meaning, these
passage can serve nothing to their purposes: and we
have shown before both by the meaning of the principall
Confession of Faith, whereof this Abjuration is an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix,
and by the explained meaning of his Majestie by
whose appointment this abjuration is framed, and who
required the oath and subscription thereunto, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be understood in such a sense as that this power and
preheminencie of Bishops should be thereby abjured, and
therefore neither the words nor the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nse can be able to
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ove their purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:64434:39"/>
Secondly, we prove the same by the Confession of the
Moderator <hi>M. Alexander Henrison,</hi> and his Associats the
Apostles of the Covenant; for they in their Disputes
with the Doctors of <hi>Aberdeene</hi> doe confesse plainly, that
by swearing this Confession of Faith, Episcopacie was
not abjured, and that any man might safely swear that
Confession and their Covenant also, without abjuring
Episcopacie; and by this profession they entised many
to sweat and subscribe their Covenant, who otherwise
would n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t have done it. Now either they spake sincerely
at that time according to their knowledge and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and so did flatly contradict this position, <hi>That by
swearing the Confession of Faith Episcopacie was abjured:</hi>
or else by dissembling policie they did so professe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their own mind, to serve their own designes in
advancing <hi>(per fas &amp; nefas)</hi> their rebellious Covenant;
And so did shew themselves Iesuiticall temporizers and
time-servers <hi>(En graine)</hi> abusing people most impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to promote their own ends. Albeit this that we have
spoken, already may suffice to cleer that Abjuration and
Coven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t, or any part thereof, of any such meaning as
they pretend, yet that the matter may be more evident,
we shall examine particularly every one of these foure
sentences cited by them, shewing that all of them are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
falsly or impertinently alleaged by them to prove
such a conclusion.</p>
               <p>As to the first sentence here produced, by it we may
judge <hi>(tanquam ex ungue Leonem)</hi> what we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y expects
of the rest of these reverend Fathers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with a manifest falshood, and we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
divers more in that kind; the words according to that
citation are, <hi>We professe that we detest all traditions
brought into the Kirk, without, or against Gods Word,
and Doctrine of this Reformed Kirk.</hi> Whereas in the
Covenant it self it is otherwise, for there the words are,
<hi>And finally we detest all his</hi> (to wit the Roman Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs)
<hi>Traditions without or against Gods Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:64434:39"/>
First, we answer that there is a great difference betwixt
<hi>All</hi> Traditions absolutely, <hi>and the Roman Antichrists
traditions;</hi> for albeit we detest as sincerely as they doe all
Antichristian traditions, yet doe we not so detest all tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
absolutely, which have not expresse or particular
warrant from Gods Word, if they be not repugnant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
the Traditions of the Roman Antichrist are those
which are invented by him, for upholding his tyrannie
over the consciences of men, made equall to Gods word,
and intruded upon the Church as parts of Gods worship,
those we detest and abhorre from our very heart; but to
abjure absolutely all Traditions which are not expressed in
Gods Word, it was never the meaning of the reformed
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor of any well reformed Church;
for all the ancient Fathers of the Primitive Church, and
all Neoterick, Orthodox writers doe teach, that some
Apostolicall and Ecclesiasticall traditions are not onely
profitable, but also almost necessary to be retained in the
Chruch; Necessary I say, if not <hi>ad esse simplicter,</hi> yet
<hi>ad bene esse,</hi> such as are according to these generall rules
of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. According to decency and good
order, and tending to Edification:</hi> and such as are accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that rule of S. <hi>Austin lib. 4. contra Donat. cap. 41.
Quod universa tenet Ecclesia, nec concilijs constitutum
semper retentum est, non nisi Apostolicà authoritate tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum,
rectissimè crediture:</hi> of which there are many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
reteined in the Church, both concerning doctrine,
manners, government, and circumstances of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as the distinction of Canonicall books from <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha,</hi>
the Constitutions of the Apostolick Creed, the
manner of the celebration of Marriage before the Church,
the sprinkling of water upon the head of the Child in
Baptisme to be sufficient, the gesture of kneeling in the
Supper of the Lord, the time and place of the ordinarie
Celebration thereof in the morning, and in the Church;
and such likewise are the <hi>Appropriating</hi> of the name and
title of Bishops, to these Pastors who are set in Authority
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64434:40"/>
over others, and divers Ecclesiasticall Canons concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the manner of their Government.</p>
               <p>Secondly, albeit it had been so that all Traditions had
been simply abjured, (which men of understanding would
not have done) yet this sentence could not have served
to prove their Conclusion; for although some of the
points of the office of a Bishop, now appertaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
be by Apostolick tradition or Ecclesiasticall constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet this point here called in Question, that one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
may have power and preheminencie over others, or
over more particular flocks, is not a Tradition either
against or without Gods Word, and Doctrine of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Church; but first it is a most certaine written ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
approved by Gods Word expresly, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
practice of the Church of God, from the very first
Constitution of the visible Church and publik exercise of
Gods worship, not only under the old Testament, but
under the new also, continued in all Churches untill this
lust age, which cannot be denied without great impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cic:
then it is not against the doctrine of the reformed
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but most conformable thereunto, as
we have sufficiently declared before; therefore it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that this passage can prove nothing for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
but is both falsly and impertinently produced by
them.</p>

               <p>THe second passage cited from the Negative Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

Doctrine, but chiefly all kind of Papistrie in generall, and
particular heads, as they were then damned and confuted
by the Word of God and Chruch of Scotland, when the said
Confession was sworn and subscribed, Anno</hi> 1580. and
1581. 1590. and 1591. But the words in the Originall are

Alteration seemeth but small to change <hi>(now)</hi> in <hi>(then,)</hi>
yet in effect, it is very matteriall and subtilly made to
wrest the meaning of the words to their own purpose,
contrary to the intention of those who framed this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration,
in making this <hi>(Now)</hi> relative to the damning
of Episcopacie in that Assemblie at <hi>Dundie</hi> 1580. and
others thereafter, albeit it be evident, that there was no
such thing intended in the framing of this Abjuration for
divers reasons.</p>
               <p>First, that <hi>(now)</hi> in the Kings Covenant, is not to be
understood of that present definite time <hi>then,</hi> when the
Covenant was framed or subscribed, but as it is expresly
exponed a little before, <hi>Now for along time,</hi> to wit, from
that time when the large Confession of Faith was set
forth <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. and approved by the Generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and ratified in Parliament 1567. By the which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
those particular heads of Papistrie were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and confuted, and the true Doctrine opposite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<hi>Now for a long time openly professed by the King,
and whole body of the Kingdome,</hi> as it is expresly set down
in the same place of the Covenant: therefore it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
that this <hi>(Now)</hi> is not relative to that Condemnation
of Episcopacie 1580. which was not then for a long time
condemned, but only for that present yeer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, albeit we should grant that this <hi>(Now)</hi> was
not to be understood of that definite time, yet doth it not
serve to prove the point in Controversie; for albeit by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64434:41"/>
that Assembly 1580. Episcopacie as it was then used in
<hi>Scotland</hi> was condemned, yet this power and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
by approbation and practice of the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
were standing in force in the persons of Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents,
Commissioners or Visitors, and not abrogated
untill the year 1590. towit, ten years after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the setting
down, and swearing of this Abjuration: And therefore
this power and preheminence, which is the point in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
cannot be understood to have been then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in the Abjuration 1580. &amp; 1581. for otherwise
the Church should have condemned that which in the
mean time they did approve and practise.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, notwithstanding that Act 1580. condemning
Episcopacie, as it was then used in <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet these
points of the power and preheminence of one Pastor over
others, and charge over moe particular flocks was not
condemned, but expresly acknowledged to be lawfull by
that whole Assembly, wherein Episcopacie was called in
Question <hi>Anno</hi> 1575. 1576. as shall be evidently cleared
when we shall come to discusse the Acts of those Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, those points of Papistrie in generall, and the
particular heads damned and confuted by Gods Word and
Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were only such as were opposite to the
doctrine contained in the principall Confession of the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> then of a long time professed by the
Kings Majestie, and whole body of the Kingdome, as it
is expresly set down in the same place of the Covenant:
But so it is, that there was no Doctrine contained either
in the Confession of Faith, or professed now for a long
time by the King and whole body of the Kingdome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to these points of power and preheminence of one
Pastor over other Brethren, or moe particular flocks:
therefore these are not points of Papistrie abjured by the
Covenant, as being damned then by Gods Word, or the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and so this passage doth not more
serve to prove their purpose than the former.</p>

               <p>THe third Passage is in those words <hi>We detest the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Antichrist, his worldly Monarchie and wicked
Hierarchie.</hi> In this passage indeed there is no false cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as in the former two; yet is there as great imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
in applying it to their purpose: for I cannot see
what they can assume upon this proposition to conclude
the point in Controversie, except they would say, that all
power and preheminence of one Pastor over his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
or over more particular flocks is an Antichristian
worldly Monarchie, and all degrees of Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
is an Antichristian wicked Hierarchie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
detested and abjured: But if this Assumption were
true, then the high priest in Ierusalem constituted by
God himself had been an Antichristian Monarch, and the
divers degrees of Ecclesiasticall persons distinguished by
God himself had been an Antichristian wicked Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie;
for it is most certaine, that the High priest had
power and preheminencie over his Brethren, and charge
over all the particular flocks in Iudea. The Apostles like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

over moe particular flocks, as Bishops have now; which
may be qualified by the writings of the Apostles, and the
testimony of all the Venerable Fathers of the Primitive
Church, who lived either in the dayes of the Apostles, or

               </p>
               <p>But the principall words which they doe most urge is

which words it was made cleer (as they alleage) in the

               <p>But before we enter to discusse their reasons, we must

is here condemned: first, the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

                  </gap>ient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
writers to signifie the sacred orders of Rulers in the
Church: Now that there is an holy order of Rulers in
the Church I think no man can deny, even in Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Government, there are three orders of Ecclesiasticall
persons who bear rule in the Church, and have charge of
sacred things, of distinct power and authoritie, towit,
Pastors, Elders, and Deacons, and so those orders may be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>afely called an Ecclesiasticall Hierarchie; they who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of sacred things, or a holy
Government: they cannot deny but these Ecclesiasticall
functions have every one their own point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that about sacred and holy things, why then
should they abhorre the word, since they acknowledge
the thing signified thereby to be competent to their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
functions? Is it because the word is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64434:42"/>
from Ethnicks? It should not be abhorred for
this cause, more than the words <hi>Episcopus, Presbyter,</hi> and
<hi>Pastor,</hi> which did signifie also amongst the Ethnicks
certaine offices, or magistracies, as is well known to those
who are versed in their writings. Or is it because it hath
been abused by the Papists? neither can it for this cause
be rejected, taken in a right sense, and separating Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
corruptions from it, more then the other titles gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Ecclesiasticall officers, which all have been abused
in the Popish Church: and that this word <hi>Hierarchy</hi> may
be used to signifie the orders of Ecclesiasticall rulers in the
Christian Church, I will bring no other testimony than
that of <hi>Calvin,</hi> who was the first Author of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall

Ecclesia,</hi> speaking of the Popish Hierarchy, saith;
<hi>If they will set us down such an Hierarchie, wherein Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
have so preheminence, that they refuse not to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Christ, depending from him as from their head, and
referring all to him; wherein they doe so entertaine Societie
amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gst themselves, that they be no otherwise bound but by
his truth: Then I must acknowledge that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>se are worthy

                     </gap>crable, who will not reverence such an Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie,
and with all humble obedience receive the same.</hi>
Where we see that <hi>Calvin</hi> doth acknowledge, that
there may be a lawfull Hierarchie neither wicked nor
Antichristian, and such was this Hierarchie in the Church
of <hi>Scotland;</hi> consisting of Bishops, Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
wherein Bishops have so preheminence over others,
as they refuse not to be subject to Christ, and depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, as from their head, and not from the Pope of
Rome, &amp;c. And therefore in the judgement of <hi>Calvin,</hi>
those who will not reverence such an Hierarchie, are
worthy to be accounted execrable and accursed; and
since our Covenanters professe, that they reverence the
judgement of <hi>Calvin</hi> more than all Antiquitie, I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
how they can blesse themselves in this, wherein he
accounteth them accursed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:64434:43"/>
To the same purpose likewise speaketh <hi>Beza,</hi> the chief
promoter of Presbyteriall government in his Answer to
<hi>Saravia De divers. grad. Minist. cap.</hi> 21. Albeit he doth
not name Hierarchie, yet speaking of the Orders in the
Roman Church, whereof the Hierarchie doth consist, he
concludeth in these words, <hi>Neither doe we accuse of this
Tyrannie, all those who are called Archbishops or Bishops,
for what Arrogancie were this? yea, we doe acknowledge
all those who are so called, as faithfull Pastors of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church, providing, they imitate the example of those
holy Bishops, in reforming the house of God so miserably,
deformed; according to the rule of Gods Word; and obey
them, and with all reverence receive them: so farre are we
from that whereof some do most impudently accuse us, that we
should prescribe to any our particular example to be followed
like to those impertinent men, who esteeme nothing well
done except that which they doe themselves, &amp;c.</hi> By the
judgement then of these two learned men, whose judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they can hardly contemne, all Hierarchie is not
condemned, nor all Episcopacie under the name of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie
is to be abjured, but only in so farre as it is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
and wicked; that is to say, the manifold corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
and abuses in the orders of Ecclesiasticall rulers
brought in by the Pope to fortifie his usurped Tyrannie;
Those with you we also abjure and detest from our very
heart. But so it is, that one Pastor to have power and
preheminence over others, is not to be reckoned amongst
these corruptions which were brought in by the Pope or
Antichrist, but was appointed by God himself, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
in the Church by those whom <hi>Beza</hi> doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to have been faithfull Pastors of the Christian
Church.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the reasons which they set down at
length in the end of the Act; the first reason whereby
they presse to prove that the order of Government under
Bishops, having power and preheminence over other
Pastors, as Presbyters and Deacons, is the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:64434:43"/>
is in these words: <hi>The Popis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Hierarchie doth consist
of Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons, that is, Baptizing and
Preaching Deacons,</hi> which they prove first by a Canon
of the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> 2. By a testimony of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
3.</hi> By a Censure of the Vniversitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Articles sent out of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which tedious proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was needlesse, for we doe not deny their proposition,
but grant that the Popish Hierarchie doth consist of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Presbyters and Deacons; But what then? they
suppresse the Assumption and Conclusion, yet according
to Logicall Rules we may finde them out, their Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is known, towit, that <hi>Episcopall Government is the
Antichristian wicked Hierarchie.</hi> So to inferre this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
upon their proposition as it is set down, nothing
can be assumed for the <hi>minor,</hi> but that <hi>Episcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
consisteth of Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons.</hi> So the
whole Syllogisme must be.</p>
               <p>The Popish Hierarchie doth consist of Bishops, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Deacons.</p>
               <p>But Episcopall Government consisteth of Bishops,
Presbyters and Deacons:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Episcopall government is the Popish
wicked Hierarchie.</p>
               <p>But by their leave, this is a Syllogisme, <hi>Ex omnibus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularibus
&amp; affirmantibus in secundà figurâ,</hi> which
concludeth not, as they who have learned the first rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Logick knows; such as that, <hi>Asinus habet aures,
tu habes aures, ergò, tu es Asinus.</hi> I confesse that this may
be reduced to a syllogisme <hi>in primâ figurâ,</hi> by converting
the termes of the proposition, and making it universall,
as <hi>Quic quid habet aures est Asinus, tu habes aures, Ergo,
&amp;c.</hi> But thus the <hi>Major</hi> is evidently false, and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
their Syllogisme may be deduced in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
by converting the <hi>Major,</hi> and making it universall,
but so it is no more their proposition, thus;</p>
               <p>All Orders of Ecclesiasticall Rulers consisting of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64434:44"/>
Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons is the Antichristian
wicked Hierarchie.</p>
               <p>But the orders of Ecclesiasticall rulers in Episcopall</p>
               <p>Government consisteth of Bishops, Presbyters and
Deacons.</p>
               <p>Ergo, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But so the <hi>major</hi> is evidently also false, neither doth
their reasons any wayes prove it, for if it were true, we
might aswell prove thereby that the orders in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
Rulers in the Apostles dayes, and Primitive
Church after them, was the Popish wicked <hi>Hierarchie;</hi>
for they cannot deny but therein were Bishops, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Deacons. As likewise that their Presbyteriall
Government is the Antichristian wicked <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> for
they grant that their Pastors are Bishops, their Elders
Presbyters, and their Deacons are Ecclesiasticall Rulers
also.</p>
               <p>But they seeme to object, that their Deacons are not
preaching and baptizing Deacons as ours are, and those
of the Roman Church, but onely distributers of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
goods: I answer, their Deacons are so much
the worse, as unlike to Apostolick Deacons; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Deacons and Popish Deacons more Christian,
and liker to those who were appointed by the Apostles,
for <hi>Stephen</hi> who was the first of these Deacons was a
Preacher, and for his preaching suffered Martyrdome. <hi>Act.
7. Philip</hi> was a Deacon, and yet both a Preacher and
Baptizer, <hi>Act. 8. 5. &amp;</hi> 12. And so we must esteeme that
all the rest of the Deacons had the same power, nor are
they able to shew the contrary. We will not be ashamed
therefore in this point, rather to joyne with Papists,
wherein they adhere to Gods Word and sound Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than to their new invented opinion disagreeing from
both.</p>
               <p>This reason, notwithstanding the grosse informalitie
thereof, was good enough for the Common people,
who are well pleased, with any shew of reason comming
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64434:44"/>
from the mouthes of their Leaders, and men of learning
amongst them either would not or durst not enquire the
strength of it: or if they did enquire in their own minds,
durst not publish their opinion either by word or writ,
because of an Act of this Assemblie, <hi>Sess. 23. Act.</hi> 17. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
any person of whatsoever qualitie or degree to
speak or write against this Assemblie, or any Act thereof
under paine of incurring the censure of the Kirk.</p>
               <p>Therefore leaving the informality of this Argument, I
answer to the substance of the matter; that all orders of
Ecclesiasticall Rulers are and may be called an <hi>Hierarchie</hi>
we grant, in that sense which we have declared, but that
all such is wicked and Antichristian we deny, and have
even <hi>Calvin</hi> (the first founder of Presbyteriall Discipline)
for our warrant, as we have shown already<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that exception they make, <hi>That this Hierarchie is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Antichristian Hierarchie, not to distinguish the
Hierarchie in the Popish Church from any other as lawfull,
But that the Hierarchie wheresoever it is, is called His:</hi> is
most false, and all the reasons they bring to prove it are
as false and impertinent.</p>
               <p>First, they say, as <hi>Invocation of Saints, Canonization of
Saints, &amp;c.</hi> are called his, not that there is any lawfull
Invocation or Canonization of Saints, but wheresoever
they are, they are his; even so (would they say) the <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie</hi>
is called his, not as if there were any other <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie</hi>
lawfull, but all <hi>Hierarchie</hi> wheresoever it is, is the
Popes, therefore abjured. A solid reason indeed, and
worthy of such an Assembly: for first they may aswell
conclude that all wordly Monarchy is abjured, because
the Popes worldly Monarchie is abjured, and so be of the
Anabaptists opinion, that there ought to be no King in
a Christian Church; and indeed it is to be lamented that
their words, writings and practice doe bewray their
mind, that they approach too neer to those damnable
opinions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this is a manifest putid Sophis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>A dicto se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64434:45"/>
quid ad dictum simpliciter; All Antichristian wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Hierarchie is abjured, Ergo, All Hierarchie is abjured
simpliciter.</hi> A child or an ignorant that knew never a
word of Logick, may see by naturall reason evidently the
absurditie of this Argument, for albeit all wicked and
Antichristian Hierarchie is unlawfull, and therefore to be
abjured: but since there may be a lawfull <hi>Hierarchie</hi> in
the Church as we have shown, which therefore needs
not to be abjured <hi>simpliciter;</hi> as if one should reason thus;
<hi>God hateth all wicked men,</hi> ergo <hi>He hateth all men simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
This Sophisme is like that which is in their next
Act against the Articles of <hi>Perths</hi> Assembly, to prove that
Confirmation of Children is abjured, <hi>The Popish five ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard
Sacraments are abjured, but Confirmation is one of
the five bastard Sacraments, ergo abjured:</hi> It is abjured
indeed to be a Sacrament, but not therefore simply, for so
they may conclude aswell upon that ground that Marriage
is abjured, because Marriage is one of these five bastard Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;
albeit perhaps the Moderator has abjured mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
yet I hope all the rest of the Brethren of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie
will not doe so. I marvell indeed, that men
esteemed for learned and wise should have blotted paper
with such trash, and put such childish Arguments in print,
as if they had to deal with none but fools or Ignorants.
Thirdly, there is a great difference betwixt Canonization
or Invocation of Saints, and an Hierarchie: for Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Canonization are sunply evill in themselves, as
against Gods Word, albeit they had never had the Pope
for their Author. But an Hierarchie or order of sacred
Rulers in the Church is not in it self evill, but onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Corruptions thereof in the Roman Church,
for which respect it is called Antichristian and wicked,
and therefore only abjured; though in it self separating
these corruptions from it, it may be lawfull and reteined:</p>
               <p>Secondly, they bring a reason to prove this, that all
Hierarchie is the Popes in these words, <hi>Whatsoever cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
was in the Kirk, either in Doctrine, Worship, or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64434:45"/>
Government, since the mystery of iniquitie began to work,
and is retained and maintained by the Pope, and obtruded
upon the Church by his Authoritie, is his, but all Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
is such; Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> I answer, that neither the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
in it self, that is the order of Ecclesiasticall Rulers,
nor the power and preheminencie of one of these orders
above others, is a corruption of the Church, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
thereof, as we have shown before, nor was it
brought in since the mystery of Iniquity began to work,
but established by God himself long before that mysterie
of Iniquitie; And albeit it was retained and maintained
by the Pope, yet for that is it not to be rejected more than
divers sound points of Doctrine, which are as yet retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and maintained by the Pope; God forbid we should
think, that all which the Pope retaines and maintaines
were wicked and properly Antichristian; finally, neither
is it obtruded now upon the reformed Church by the
Popes Authoritie, but restored to the former perfection
by the lawfull Authoritie of the Kings Majestie, with
consent both of Civill and Ecclesiasticall Supreme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
of Generall Assemblies and Parliaments: Therefore
this <hi>Hierarchie</hi> in our Church is neither to be accounted
the Popes nor Antichristian.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they alleage a passage out of the Historie of the
Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> to prove this, <hi>Where it is related that
the Councell would not define the Hierarchye by the seven
Orders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that we have in our Confession the manifold
orders set apart, and distinguished from the Hierarchie:
Ergo, Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke.</hi> I professe I doe not understand what they
would conclude upon these words, but of this I am assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
they can conclude nothing that serves to prove their
conclusion; It hath need of a sharp wit to finde any
cleer consequence thereof pertinent to the purpose, and
since they have set downe no consequence themselves,
it were an idle thing for me to trouble my braines to
search it out, and therefore untill it be better explained,
I leave it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:64434:46"/>
Lastly, they alleage a passage out of their second book
of Discipline, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. in the end thereof: <hi>Therefore all
the ambitious titles invented in the Kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs,
and in his usurped Hierarchie which are not of one
of these foure sorts, towit, Pastors, Doctors, Elders and
Deacons: together with the offices depending thereupon in
one word ought to be rejected.</hi> If they would conclude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, that the ambitious title of Bishop, and the office
depending thereupon is therfore to be rejected, (for I can
see no other consequence that can be deduced of these
words pertinent to the purpose in hand.) I answer, first
that they have used as great falshood in this citation, as
they have done in divers others before, for in that same
very place cited by them, the title of Bishop is one of
these which they acknowledge is given to signifie a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
of the Church, for a little before, they number these
titles to be Pastor, Minister, Bishop, Doctor, Presbyter,
Elder and Deacon; and yet they here in their citation,
reckon onely foure titles, whereas in the book it self in
the Chapter cited by them seven are reckoned, whereof
the title of Bishop is one, and therefore not to be rejected
as an ambitio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s title, nor the office depending thereupon.
Secondly, the title of Bishop is not an ambitious title in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
in the Kingdome of the Antichrist, or the Popes
usurped Hierarchy, but is a title given by the Spirit of
God in the Scripture to signifie a Spirituall function in the
Church, <hi>Acts 1. 20. Acts 20. 28. 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2. And
therefore this Citation out of the Book of Discipline is
both false and impertinent. Thirdly, Albeit it were true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alleaged, and did prove the point directly, yet we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
not the Authoritie of that Book so authentick, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
make it an Article of our Beleife whatsoever is said
there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THe fourth and last passage of the Abjuration or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Confession, whereby they alleage that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacie
is abjured, is,</hi> We professe that we joyne our selves
to this reformed Kirk, in Doctrine, Faith, Religion, and
Discipline; promising and swearing by the great Name of
God, that we shall continue in the Doctrine and Discipline
of this Kirk, and defend the same according to our Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and power all the dayes of our life.</p>
               <p>First, we must remark that by these foure distinct terms
are not signified foure severall distinct things, but by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Faith and Religion is signified one and the self-same
thing, for <hi>Doctrine</hi> to be beleeved is the object of
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> consists in the practice of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and <hi>Discipline</hi> is the meanes to conserve <hi>Doctrine,
Faith and Religion,</hi> and so we see in the next words, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the promissary part of the Oath, they are all redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to two, Doctrine and Discipline.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we must consider what doctrine and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
this is whereunto they swear; It is not every point
of doctrine which hath been taught in the pulpits of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> nor every point of Discipline which hath been
practised in their Sessions, Presbyteries &amp; Assemblies; for
then (God knowes) how doubtsome and uncertaine an
Oath this should have been, because those points have
been often changed, and some directly contrary to other:
the matter of an Oath should be so clearly and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set down as is possible; for it be set down indefinitely,
men may involve themselves rashly in a contradictory
Oath: And therefore those who framed this Oath, have
wisely and considerately set down divers limitations of
the matter of the Oath, whereby it is made clear and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64434:47"/>
evident, what doctrine and discipline it is whereunto
they promise by their oath to joyne themselves: But our
Covenanters have dissembled subtilly those necessary li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations,
and set it down in generall and indefinite
termes, only naming in generall the Doctrine and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that we may know more evidently what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Discipline is here meaned, I shall set down at
more length the words of the Oath as they be in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall:
<hi>We beleeve with our hearts and confesse with our
mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thes, &amp;c. that this is the onely true Faith and Religion,
pleasing God and bringing salvation to man, which is now
by the mercy of God revealed to us by the preaching of the
blessed Evangel, and received, beleeved and defended by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
notable Churches and Realms, and chiefly by the
Church of Scotland; particularly expressed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith, established and publikely confirmed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Acts of Parliament, and now of along time publikely
professed by the King and whole body of the Kingdome.</hi> In
these words are comprehended foure necessary limitations
of the matter of this Oath, without the bounds of which,
it is not to be extended; Albeit it were sufficient to shew
that Episcopacie was not abjured by this Oath, if we
prove that by any one of these limitations it can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
yet to make the probation more full we shall
make it evident, that not by one onely, but by all these
foure limitations, this point <hi>(That it is not lawfull for
one Pastor to have power and preheminence over his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
or over more particular flocks than one)</hi> is excluded
from this Oath, and therefore not abjured as a Popish
error.</p>
               <p>The first limitation is, that they only did swear to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to that Doctrine, <hi>which is revealed by the preaching
of the blessed Evangel, or by Gods Word:</hi> But so it is that
no doctrine condemning this power and preheminencie,
is revealed by the Gospel, or expressed by Gods Word, or
depending thereupon by necessary consequence, therefore
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64434:47"/>
by that Oath, none was sworn to adhere to any such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
condemning that point: But the contrary doctrine
is so clearly testified by the whole course of Scripture,
both in the old and new Testament, that it is lawfull for
one Pastor to have power and preheminence over others,
or over moe particular flocks, that we much admire why
men so versed in Scripture can be so blinded as not to soe
so cleer a Truth, or if they see it to be so impudent, and
without conscience to abjure it as a damnable Heresie,
compelling others to abjure the same by so solemn and
fearfull an Oath, wherein they move them really to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
themselves for eschewing a supposed perjury.</p>
               <p>The second limitation is, that the Doctrine whereunto
they swear to adhere was that, <hi>Which was received, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
and defended by many notable Churches &amp; Realms,</hi>
then when this Oath was first made: But so it is that this
Doctrine declaring it to be unlawfull, that one Pastor
should have power and preheminence over others &amp;c.
was not received, beleeved, and defended by many nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Churches and Realms at that time; for we can shew
that the most of the reformed Churches and Realms at
that time did professe and practise the contrary, as all the
Churches of <hi>High-Germany, Rohemia, Denmark, Sweden,
Norway, Poland, Hungaria, Helvetia, England, Ireland,
and our own Church of Scotland:</hi> they cannot produce
one Realm, nor any Church that had at that time imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
fully presbyteriall Government, except one City of
<hi>Geneva,</hi> which notwithstanding did not so absolutely
condemne Episcopacie as they doe, as we have shown
by the Testimonie of the two cheifest members of that
Church, <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza.</hi> There are now some Churches
which have received the <hi>Geneva</hi> Discipline, as the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate
in High-Germany, the consederate Provinces of
Lower-Germany, and the reformed Church of France,</hi>
which notwithstanding had not that Discipline, nor a
full established Church amongst them at that time: for

testifie. In the Low Countries, albeit there were many

                     </gap>onfessionum,</hi> you
shall not finde one of them condemning this power and
preheminence, or Episcopacie absolutely. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
many of them doe expresly approve it: Therefore
since there was not many notable Churches and Realmes,
which received, beleeved and defended, that it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
for one Pastor to have power and preheminence
over others, or over moe particular flocks, it is manifest
that this point was not abjured by the Oath of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the matter of the Oath is expresly restricted
to that Doctrine and Discipline, <hi>Which is particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the Confession of Faith, set down Anno 1560.
And ratified publikly by divers Acts of Parliament before
this Abjuration was sworn:</hi> by which limitation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from this oath all points of Doctrine and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
added since, either by Acts of Generall Assemblies,
Synods or Presbyteries since that Confession was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as that Act of the Assemblie at <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndie,</hi> 1580. and
at <hi>Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sgow,</hi> 1581. Condemning Episcopacie, and others
of that kinde; and such are our Covenanters Additions
or Applications of the Confession of Faith, expressed in
their Rebellio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Covenant: And the truth is, that they
neither have nor can produce one word of that Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condemning this power and preheminence, neither
had the Church who established it any such purpose or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to doe so. But on the contrary, the same Church,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64434:48"/>
at the same very time, in setting down the first book of
Discipline, did approve that power and preheminencie
under the title of Superintendents; therefore this point
was not abjured by the Oath.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the matter of this Oath is determined to be
that doctrine and discipline, <hi>Which was for a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
the first framing of this Oath, <hi>professed by the King
and whole body of this Kingdome.</hi> But so it is that no point
of Doctrine condemning this power and preheminence,
was professed for a long time before this, by the King or
body of the Kingdome: therefore that power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence
was not abjured by that Oath. For the Kings
profession we have shown <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. what it was at that
time, and both before and after; then the profession of
the whole body of the Kingdome cannot be determined
by particular mens opinions, but by publik Acts either by
the Supreme, Civill or Ecclesiastick Court. And they have
not produced any Act of either of those Courts long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
shewing such a profession; and therefore, it is to be
presupposed that there was none such: But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
we can produce Acts of both those Courts, not onely
long before, but also continually since the Reformation,
yea at that same very time when this Abjuration was
first made, and some yeers after standing in force, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this power and preheminence: the first Act they
can produce, having any appearance of condemning Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacie
as unlawfull, is that Act of the Assemblie at
<hi>Dundee</hi> 1580. which notwithstanding doth not serve
their purpose, first, because this Act was not long before
(if not after) this Abjuration was first framed, being even
that same very year about that same time. Secondly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the office of a Bishop, as it was then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> be
condemned, yet notwithstanding this point, that it was
lawfull that one Pastor might have power and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
given him, was agreed unto by the whole Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie,
as we have signified before, and shall more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
hereafter. Thirdly, long before this the power and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64434:49"/>
preheminencie of Superintendents and Commissioners
was publikly approved by the first book of Discipline, and
by divers Acts of Generall Assemblies, even then, and
some years after standing in force unrepealed, which we
have before faithfully cited <hi>cap.</hi> 5. And as for the civill
Courts both of Councell and Parliament, they declared
their profession by rejecting of divers suits made for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
the second book of Discipline, which seemed to
condemne this power and preheminence as in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
1578. 1579. and 1580. cited here by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
It is declared that divers suits were made for esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
the second book of Discipline by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or otherwise, if that could not be obtained, by Act of
Councell, but both the one and the other were often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it was declared by the King and whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Kingdome assembled in Parliament at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
May 22. 1584. that they had no such profession:
but on the contrary, in the 129. Act of that Parliament
representing the whole body of the Kingdome, the
whole power, preheminence and Iurisdiction of Bishops
was ratified and confirmed in most ample forme. By
which it is evident, that there was no point of Doctrine
long before the swearing of this Covenant received, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
and defended by the King and whole body of the
Kingdome, condemning this power and preheminence
now in question; And therefore that it was not abjured
by the Oath of the Covenant. And since it is so, it is
strange with what face or conscience they can so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
abuse Christian people, as to impose falsly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uch a burden
upon the Consciences of all persons within the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
both King and Subjects, Pastors and people, in
pressing to perswade them against so many evident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that they are all by vertue of that Oath so fearfully
perjured, who have consented to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacie.</p>
               <p>But, because this point of Episcopacie is understood by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64434:49"/>
them rather to be abjured under the name of <hi>Discipline,</hi>
than under the name of <hi>Doctrine:</hi> therefore to take away
all way of Escape or subt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rfuge, we shall examine the
point of Discipline also, and shew how farre it is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Oath; and albeit it be by all those former limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
excluded also, for these limitations are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
aswell to the Discipline as to the Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Yet for further resolution, we must consider that the
word <hi>(Discipline)</hi> is taken in divers significations, first
strictly and properly, for that part of the Policie which
concerneth the censures of the Church, to be practised up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those who doe erre either in doctrine, or in manners of
life. And so Episcopacie, or power and preheminence
of one Pastor over others is not contrary thereto, but may
very well subsist therewith, and hath subsisted actually
both during the Governement under Superintendents
or Commissioners, as also under the Government of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
since they were re-established: for the same cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
which were established by the book of Discipline,
by the order set down before our Psalm books, and by
divers Acts of Generall Assemblies long before Bishops
were re-established, did still remaine the same admo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be taken in their proper and most usuall sense, rather than
in an unproper and figurative, except by some evident
reason it appear that it must be taken improperly. And
this certainly is the most proper and usuall meaning of
this word <hi>(Discipline,)</hi> as it is taken in the order set
down before our Psalm books, in the second book of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
<hi>cap.</hi> 7. intituled of <hi>Ecclesiasticall Discipline,</hi> in
the second book of Discipline every where, and most
frequently by all Ecclesiasticall writers: and therefore
those who have obeyed and received Bishops are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured,
nor have broken that oath, whereby they did swear
<hi>to adhere to the Discipline of the Church of Scotland.</hi> But
on the contrary, those of this Assembly who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and excommunicated with such precipitation so
many Bishops and Ministers, without observing in their
proces these formes prescribed by the Discipline of the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are evidently perjured according to
their own grounds.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the word Discipline is taken at some times
in a more large and ample signification, for the whole Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
of the Church, which in the second book of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<hi>cap.</hi> 1. is defined to be <hi>An order or form of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Government, which is exercised by the members thereto
appointed by the Word of God, for the we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:</hi>
which policie <hi>cap.</hi> 2. is divided, first in regard of the
persons, in that part which concerneth Rulers, and that
which concerneth them who are ruled; secondly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the thing subject to this Policie in three parts.
1. The policie which concernes the preaching of the
Word, and the administration of the Sacraments. 2 That
which concerneth the censures of the Church or Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
so properly called. 3. In that which concerneth
the collecting and distributions of Almes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent of the
Church.</p>
               <p>Now if any will be so obstinate as to contend, that the
word <hi>Discipline</hi> is taken in this large sense in the Oath
of the Covenant; for their satisfaction likewise, we must
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64434:50"/>
consider that in this Discipline or Policie, it is requisite
that we distinguish the points which are essentiall and
perpetuall, from the points accidentall and mutable; or as
it is expresly distinguished in the first book of Discipline
<hi>cap. 9. Intituled of the Policie of the Church in things ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
necessary,</hi> without the which there is no face of a
visible Church, and in things profitable and not meerly
necessarie: the points utterly necessary are those which
are prescribed by Gods Word to endure perpetually, as
that there be Pastors, Teachers and Rulers in the Church,
that Gods Word be truely taught, and Sacraments admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
according to Christs Institutions, and that the
censures of the Church be exercised against scandalous
persons, and such other like things. The points not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary but profitable are those, which are not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
prescribed by Gods Word, but left to the libertie
of the Church to constitute by Ecclesiasticall Canons, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
down the formes, Ceremonies and Orders to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in Gods worship, and ruling of the Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the divers circumstances of time, place, and
persons doe require: Such as, how many Pastors under
what names and titles they ought to bear rule in the
Church, over what bounds or what particular persons
they ought to have charge, when, where, in what order,
gesture, or what habite they ought to preach, pray, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
Sacraments, and exercise their Authoritie, and
divers other Ecclesiasticall Constitutions concerning
their particular manner of Government.</p>
               <p>The first sort ought not to be altered or changed in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
since they are appointed by God to be perpetuall
in the Church, and the oath taken in Baptisme, or entr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
to a calling, doth oblige every one within the Church
according to their place and station therein, to observe
them perpetually, albeit there had been no other Oath. But
so it is that this power and preheminencie here condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
is not contrary to any of these essentiall points of the
policie of the Church appointed by Gods word, but most
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64434:51"/>
conforme therto, according to the practice of the Church
both under the Old and New Testament; And therefore
in swearing to adhere to these points of Discipline none
have abjured this power and preheminence, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
have retained those essentiall points without change
or Alteration.</p>
               <p>There be other points of Episcopacie, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
under the accidentall parts of the Policie of
the Church, such as are by what titles or names those who
bear chief rule in the Church ought to be called, <hi>Whether
Bishops,</hi> or <hi>Superintendents,</hi> or <hi>Commissioners,</hi> or <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi>
or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Moderatores,</hi> by whose advice
they should exercise their Authoritie, whether by <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or Synods, or Presbyteries,</hi> or by other wise, godly and
learned men, assumed by their own choice to be their
C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uncell: Albeit indeed it be more expedient to use
these titles and names, which have ever been used in the
Apostolick and Primitive Church, and continued by long
prescription in after ages, than those new invented titles,
by men affecting Singularitie.</p>
               <p>These points being alterable in their own nature, as not
being precisely commanded in Gods word, may be
changed by the Church in whose libertie they were left:
and therefore no Oath could bind any man to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
observation thereof, in case it pleased the Church for
reasons of expediency to alter them; for according to
that Common <hi>Regula Iuris, Iuramentum sequitur na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam
actus super quo interponitur,</hi> if the things we
swear unto be of their own nature <hi>perpetui Iuris,</hi> the

                  </gap>des to the perpetuall observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and no Creature is able to absolve us of that Oath.
But if it be <hi>Iuris positivi,</hi> and onely a Constitution of the

force, but being altered by that same lawfull Authoritie
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64434:51"/>
whereby it was established, all are <hi>ipso facto</hi> loosed
from the bond of that Oath: yea all those who have
sworn to adhere to the Discipline of the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
are bound by vertue of that oath to follow the
Church in the alteration she makes in those mutable
points, and to obey the new Acts and Constitutions that
concerne the same. Although they be different or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the former Acts, and all those who disobey there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
contemptuously, are guiltie of perjurie: Therefore
since the Church hath altered upon good and grave rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
those formes and Constitutions of Presbyteriall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
established for a time not upon so good grounds
unto the ancient approved manner of Episcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
all those within the Church are obliged notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of their former oath to follow the Church in her
change without fear of perjurie. And on the contrary all
our Covenanters, who before the lawful abrogation of the
Constitutions of the Church established by lawfull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
have not conformed themselves thereto, but
disobeying them in their own persons, and by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary

and rebell to the disgrace of their mother their Church,
and breaking of the bond of peace, whereby the Unitie
of the Spirit is conserved doe lye under a fearfull perjurie
untill they doe seriously repent.</p>

               <head type="sub">Answering to the Acts of the Generall Assemblies
produced against Bishops untill that Act at
Dundee, 1580.</head>
               <p>HAving disoussed those passages alleaged out of the
Abjuration of the Covenant, it rests that we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
in like manner to the Acts of divers generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
produced to prove that the Church hath condemned
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64434:52"/>
this power and preheminence of one Pastor over another
and over moe particular flocks: albeit a sufficient answer
may easily be gathered by the judicious Reader; out of that
which we have said already, yet because many are moved
by the Authority of those Assemblies, who doe not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the manner of their proceedings, we must consider
them more particularly, to the end than we may shew
what weight and force they ought to have in the
Church.</p>
               <p>Those Acts here cited by them for the more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
answering without Tautologie may be disposed in
three Ranks, first, some of them containe only prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the condemning of Episcopacie, as those from
the year 1575. to the 1580. next there are some that tend
directly to the establishing of the second book of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
transferring the power of Bishops to Presbyteries;
thirdly, others are such as condemne Episcopacie, which
all we shall examine particularly in their own order.</p>
               <p>And first we must observe, that they never alleage one
word of any Assembly since the Reformation untill that
at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> 1575. albeit there were thirtie generall
Assemblies in <hi>Scotland</hi> before that time, more uncorrupt,
holy and venerable, than any of those which are alleaged
of them; for why they were not able to shew by any
probabilitie, that before that time the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>
did think any evill of this power and preheminencie, but
did continually and constantly approve the same both by
her Constitutions and practice.</p>
               <p>Next we must consider the causes and occasions mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Ministers at that time to alter their judgements
in this point, and if we remark the estate of the Church
and Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> at that time, as it is known to
all these who have taken paines to understand the true
history of the Church and Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> in those
dayes, we shall finde evidently the occasions of this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Iudgement.</p>
               <p>First, there were at that time some men of learning,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64434:52"/>
but of fiery and violent humours, come into <hi>Scotland</hi> from
<hi>Geneva,</hi> who because of their travels abroad and learning
were had in great esteeme; and they being themselves
greatly in love with <hi>Geneva</hi> discipline, did labour by all
manner of perswasions to move others to like both of the
Clergie and Laitie, especially Noblemen, to a liking ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
also; at lest by intreaties, perswasions, and some shew
of reason made secretly amongst themselves a reasonable
number both of Nobility and Ministry, who carried a
great sway in generall Assemblies, and were able to make
a partie if the former Government were called in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they thought the time fit to further their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
in regard of the Kings Majesties minoritie, being
then about ten yeers of age at most, and therefore not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the knowledge of that which was most fit for
the Government either of the Civill or Ecclesiastick
estate, governed himself by divers men of divers hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there was a great furtherance to this Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in regard of the great troubles, divisions and factions
at that time, amongst the Nobilitie and Courtiers, every
one striving to thrust out his Neighbour from that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
he had about the King and Court, as witnes the
violent death of three Regents, and the fourth, like
enough, had gone the same way (if his Govermne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t had
indured longer) and many of the Nobility cut off by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
quarrells, some justly, some unjustly under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of legall proceeding: as witnes likewise an Act of
the Assemblie at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> 1578. whereby a solemn Fast
was injoyned for divers reasons, <hi>Especially because of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ivill and intestine, ungodly S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ditions and Divisions within
the Bowells of the Kingdome:</hi> Some Noblemen therefore
and Courtiers in those factious times, as fishing in troubled
waters, to further their own ends did labour to make
some pretext of Religion, and therefore did strive to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
the Church upon their side, abusing the simplicitie of some
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64434:53"/>
of the Ministrie zealous of the new Discipline, and the
pride of others impatient of subjection to their Bishops
or Superintendents stirring them up to cast off their yoak:
knowing that they by their Sermons and private practices
might doe much, to make the people incline to which
faction they pleased best; And by that meanes to force
the Kings Majestie for fear of a generall insurrection to
grant them whatsoever they desired, which policie our
Covenanting Noblemen have carefully practised now
with great but a dangerous effect: there was never yet in
those times so bold a Traitor, but he found Ministers of
that sect to Countenance him, and approve his doings
both privately and publikly, as witnes their applauding
the Earle of <hi>Bothwell</hi> in his treasonable attempts, for it
is certainly known that of those moneyes which was
collected by the Ministers for the relief of <hi>Geneva,</hi> a part
was imployed to wage souldiers for him, I know and
could name if I pleased both the deliverers and Receivers
thereof: It is known also that Ministers of that Sect had
a chief hand in all those attempts which commonly are
called <hi>Roads,</hi> as at the road of <hi>Stritilling,</hi> the road of
<hi>Leith,</hi> and the <hi>Abbey</hi> road, and at the 17. day of December
the Earle of <hi>Gowry</hi> found one of the prime Ministers of
that Sect to justifie his cause, and refuse to give thanks to
God for the Kings Deliverie from that treasonable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
Finally, it is well known how King <hi>Iames</hi> of
happy memory was vehemently troubled and vexed most
unjustly by that Sect, during the time of that Anarchie of
the Church, as he himself left in record in his <hi>Basilicon
Doron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, to those occasions another was joyned to
further the ruine of Episcopacie, towit, the Sacrilegious
greed of some of the Nobilitie and Courtiers gaping
after the Church-rents, which they perceived they could
never obtaine so long as the Authority of Bishops did
subsist, and therefore did use the uttermost of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to bear down that estate, pushing forward the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64434:53"/>
to cry out against the Bishops, and to blue abroad
their personall faults both in their Assemblies, Pulpits and

                  </gap>

               <p>It is therefore more than manifest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that those trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and factio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orage of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Magistrate constituting a new Discipline, by the
example of one small Citie of <hi>Geneva,</hi> confirmed onely
by the practice of fourteen or fifteen yeers at most, be
able to counterpoize Gods Word, the continuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Church of God both under the old and new
Testament, and the example of the blessed Apostles and
their Successors, the venerable Pastors of the Primitive
Church, continued in after ages in all Christian Nations
untill this last age; yea retained by the first reformers of
the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and approved by the Church
therein for many yeers thereafter. So that the Authoritie
of these Assemblies ought not to move judicious men
judging without partiall affection: This much in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
concerning those Assemblies whereby the estate of
Bishops was opprest in those dayes, yet to remove all
scruple, we shall discusse particularly all the Acts alleaged
here out of these assemblies, shewing that they serve little
or nothing to the present purpose.</p>
               <p>First, they alleage that Bishops were tollerated from
the year 1572. untill this year 1575.. But by their leave,
they were tollerated from the very first years of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
for so many of them as did joyne themselves
to the reformed Religion, retaining the title, office, and
Benefice of a Bishop, did exercise their jurisdiction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
all the Pastors a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d people within their Diocese by appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the generall Assemblies of the Church, as we
have shown before, <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. So that this was not as they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64434:54"/>
alleage a meer tolleration, but a full consent and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
at least in regard of their power and preheminence
above Ministers, and charge over moe particular parishes.
It is true that <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. there were divers Bishopricks
vacant, and that my Lord Regent did excuse himself to
the Assembly, that they had been so long void; as appears
by an Act of that Assemblie at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> August 1572.
wherein it is recorded, that <hi>Alexander Hay</hi> Clark of the
Councell presented some Articles in name of the Regent
to the Assembly, whereof one is <hi>My Lord Regent his
grace mindes, that with all convenient diligence, qualified
persons shall be presented to the Bishopricks now vacant,
the delay whereof has not been by his owne default, but by
reason that some enteresse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>as made to those livings in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of some Noblemen, before his acceptation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie;
yet his Grace is perswaded that qualified persons
shall be speedily presented, and in case of fail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, will not
faile without the others knowledge or consent to present.</hi> So
it appeares by his excuse, and promise of diligence in
times to come, that this was not a tolleration onely, but
an earnest suit of the Church, that qualified persons should
be presented as they were shortly after and accepted by
the Assemblie: The Regent at this time was the worthy
<hi>Mathew</hi> Earle of <hi>Lenox,</hi> a man of a noble and generous
disposition, who bent himself to wrest the Church Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
out of the Noblemens hands, and to establish the
Church in her proper lustre, which doubtlesse he had
effectuate if he had been suffered longer to live, and so set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
things therein, as King <hi>Iames</hi> of happy memory, and
King <hi>Charles</hi> now raigning should not have had so much
trouble and turmoile in redressing the estate thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
But not long after this, he was traiterously mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and after his death another wind
blowing, all his designes were reversed, Episcopacie born
down, and the Church brought to miserable povertie.</p>
               <p>The first Assembly alleaged to prove their conclusion
is that in August 1575. which notwithstanding doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64434:54"/>
make for them, but against them rather, as we shall
make manifest by the proceeding of that Assemblie and
Conclusion thereof, according as we have faithfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
them out of the Register of the Assemblies. At
this Assemblie indeed was made the first publik motion
against Episcopacie (although they had before laid pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
their plots in their own conventicles) at the very
beginning of the Assembly, when they were calling the
Roll of their names, the Bishops (according to the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
order in former Assemblies) being first called, the
promoters of <hi>Geneva</hi> discipline set forward one <hi>Iohn
Durie,</hi> a man neither of the wisest nor most learned of
the Ministrie, but of great boldnesse, which happily he

the Assemblie in these termes, <hi>Whether the Bishops, as they

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64434:55"/>
conferred and reasoned the matter at length, could not
agree upon the Principall question, and therefore the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
determined by an Act, <hi>That they think it not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
presently to answer to the Principall question:</hi> yet
they who were appointed to reason the matter, reported
to the Assembly that they had agreed altogether in certain
points, First, that the name of Bishop is common to all
them which have charge of a particular flock, to preach
the Word and administer the Sacrament, which is their
chief function by the Word of God. Secondly, That out
of this number may be chosen one to have power to visite
such reasonable bounds as the Assemblie shall appoint.
Thirdly, That he may have power in these bounds to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
Ministers, with consent of the Ministers of that
province, and of the flock to which they are appointed.
Fourthly, That he may have power to appoint Elders, and
Deacons in every particular Congregation with consent
of the people. Fiftly, That he may have power to suspend
and depose Ministers for reasonable causes, with consent
of the Ministers aforesaid. The which points of agreement
were ratified and approved by the next Generall Assembly
in April, 1576. whereby it is evident that they did not
intend to diminish that power and preheminence, which
Superintendents had before over private Ministers, or
over the particular Congregations within their bounds,
which as we have shown before was no lesse than tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
which Bishops now doe require to have in the Church:
And therefore that this Assemblie concluded directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, who condemne the power and preheminence
of Bishops over Ministers and over moe particular flocks
than one.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we must remark a subtill dissimulation of our
Covenanters, who in the Citation of this Act remember
only one point of this Agreement towit, <hi>That the Name
of a Bishop is common to every one of them that hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
flock;</hi> but dissembles the other points of agreement
which we have rehearsed importing this power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64434:55"/>
because they found them directly contrary to
their Conclusion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, albeit they intended at this Assemblie present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have thrown down Episcopacie to the ground, yet
because many wise, learned and godly Brethren did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them, standing firmly for the ancient discipline of
the Church, there passed five or six years in these conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations
before the finall sentence was pronounced; in
the mean time those <hi>Episcopomastiges</hi> ceased not to labour
diligently by all meanes to draw others to their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
using likewise the perswasions of men of speciall
note beyond Seas; as in the time of the Contestation, the
Lord <hi>Glames</hi> then Chancellor of <hi>Scotland</hi> was moved by
our Genevating Ministers to write to <hi>Beza,</hi> craving his
opinion concerning the present Government under Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
&amp; Superintendents, to the which letter <hi>Beza</hi> made
a large answer condemning the present Government, and
setting down a plot of that Policie and Discipline which
he desired them to imbrace, according to the which they
did frame their second book of Discipline, and that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
points <hi>ipsissimis verbis,</hi> as may appear by conferring
the Book with his Epistle.</p>
               <p>That second citation from the Assembly, April 1576.
serves nothing to their purpose, for albeit <hi>Some Bishops
were censured because they had not betaken themselves to a
particular flock:</hi> yet this might consist with power and
preheminence over other as is cleer in the Superindents,
who albeit they had particular flocks wherein they were
specially bound to attend in preaching the Word, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of Sacraments, yet that did not hinder but
that they might have charge over other Pastors and moe
Parishes.</p>
               <p>Finally, those corruptions of the estate of Bishops
which are set down in the Assemblie at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> 1578.
were not fully concluded in that Assembly to be damned
absolutely, but only proposed by some and craved to be
considered.</p>

               <head type="sub">Answering to the Acts for establishing of the
second Book of Discipline.</head>
               <p>THe second Rank of Acts cited out of Generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
are those which concern the establishing
of the second Book of Discipline, such as are that Act of
the Assembly in April 1578. Sess. 4. that in April 1578.
Iuly 1579. Iuly 1580. Sess. 10. April 1581. 1590. 1591.
Sess. 4. to the which they need no particular Answer,
but Generally concerning this book of Discipline, we
answer, first, that this Book of Discipline was brought in
head, and urged by the same means and occasions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we spake before, to subvert the former established Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and to bear down Bishops, that the Church
the more easie might be robbed of her patrimonie by No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
and Courtiers gaping after the Church-rents, and
factious humours striving to singularity, contrary to the
mind of the wisest and gravest and most modest of the
Ministry, and opposed continually by the King &amp; Councel
and whole body of the Kingdome, as the very Acts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
here produced by them doe evidently declare.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Acts of those Assemblies can be of no
greater force than the book it self, for the establishing
whereof they were made. But so it is, that this Book is
not in it self that Discipline whereunto we swear to
joyne our selves in the Oath of the Covenant, first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
at this time the book of Discipline was but onely a
thing in <hi>fieri,</hi> not as yet concluded when the Oath was
made, and therefore could not be accounted to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
therein; for that Ordinance of the Assemblie
at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> 1581. whereby that Discipline was appointed
to be registrated in the Assembly books, did not make it
a binding Law, neither was it intended for that end, but
as it is expresly set down in the Act it self <hi>ad perpetuam
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64434:56"/>
rei memoriam, and that the posteritie should think well of
the intention of the Church.</hi> So it was but a thing inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Church, but not effected: as likewise that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of the Assembly at <hi>Glasgow</hi> 1590. concerning the
subscription to that book, did not extend it self to all,
but to actuall Ministers only, and yet of those many did
resist it; as particularly the Ministers of <hi>Angus</hi> and
<hi>Mear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es,</hi> and divers other parts of the Kingdome, for
the which cause it was thought needfull that a new Act
should be made <hi>Anno</hi> 1591. injoyning againe the subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
under a penalty, and particularly to those of <hi>Angus</hi>
and <hi>Mear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es.</hi> This book was never ratified by any Act of
Estate either in Councell or Parliament, without the
which they themselves confesse it could not be a Law, as
they doe in that Assembly Iuly 1579. and that Assembly
1580 Sess. 10. As for that Act of Parliament 1592. here
alleaged, first, it was after the last urging of the swearing
of the Covenant 1591. and therefore could not be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Oath. Secondly, it was but a partiall ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not of the whole book, but of Generall, Synodall,
and of Presbyteriall Assemblies, and Parish Sessions, which
did still remaine under Episcopall government with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
regularitie than they were before.</p>
               <p>2. This book of Discipline many years after the first
motion thereof, could not be agreed unto by the greatest
and best part of the Ministrie, finding it for the most part
but an Imaginary plot, which could be hardly effectuate or
indure long in the Church without great corruption, as
the event proved. Some of it never put in practice either
in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or any other Church in the
world, like to the frame of Policie in <hi>Plato's Republik,</hi>
or of <hi>Outopia,</hi> as those points <hi>de Diaconatu,</hi> concerning
the collecting and distribution of the rents of the Church:
in some points the contrary hath ever been practised, as
it is appointed by that Book <hi>Cap. 7. That Landward
Churches should not nor could not have particular Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,</hi>
and yet ever after there was not so small a Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64434:57"/>
Church, but had their particular Sessions consisting
of the Ministers, Elders and Deacons. It is likewise there
appointed that Elders <hi>once lawfully called to the office may
never leave it again;</hi> and yet it hath ever been an use that
he who was Elder this year should be casheered the next,
and every year a new Election made. <hi>Item,</hi> it is ordained
<hi>Cap. 3. That all Ecclesiasticall Parsons, as Pastors, Elders,
and Deacons should receive the Ceremonie of ordination to
their office,</hi> which are declared to be Fasting and Prayer,
and imposition of hands of Elderships, and yet they did
never practise imposition of hands upon Elders or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
but only in the Ordination of Pastors: many other
points might be brought which either were never practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
or the contrary practice brought in.</p>
               <p>3. If this Book of Discipline be a declaration of the
meaning of Church, whereby the negative Confession in
the Covenant should be interpreted, then those who have
sworn the Covenant, have sworn also to this Book of
Discipline; if it be so then, which of all the Covenanters
can free themselves of perjurie, for I am assured, that the
greatest part are not perswaded in their Conscience of
the truth of all this Book of Discipline, nor will swear
to adhere thereto all the dayes of their lives: let them
put their Covenanting Noblemen, and other Gentlemen
possessors of the Church Rents, to an assay to swear that
point of this Book <hi>ca. 9. That to take any part of the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Church (consisting of Tithes, Manses, Glaebs,
Possessions, Lands, Biggings, Annuall rents, and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing which hath been at any time before, or shall be in
times coming, given for the use and utilitie of the Church)
and convert it to the particular and profane use of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
we hold it a detestable Sacriledge before God.</hi> Or that
point <hi>Cap. 12. That this order which Gods Word craves,
cannot stand with patronages, or power of presentation, &amp;c.</hi>
put them (I say) to this Oath particularly, and make them
understand, that by swearing to the discipline of the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they are sworn also to this point;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64434:57"/>
and then you shall find that they will rather renounce
your Covenant before they take such an Oath: Or if they
have so bad a Conscience as to swear so directly against
their mind, before they perform really that which they
swear, by restitution of the patrimonie of the Church and
quieting the Right of Patronage, they shall rather revolt
from your Covenant, and conforme themselves to the
Book of Common Prayer, Book of Canons, and high
Commission likewise. So if you should put many of the
Ministrie, especially those who possesse rich Parsonages,
to swear particularly that point of the Policie appointed
by this Book, <hi>Cap. 9. &amp; Cap. 12. To suffer the Deacons to
intromet with all their Church Rents, and to distribute the
same by the direction of the ruling Elders, giving one fourth
part for the maintenance of their Lay-Elders and Deacons,
another to their poore Hospitals and Schools: another for
upholding the fabrick of the Church and other extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
affayres, and only a fourth part to be given to the
Minister;</hi> they should find few of them who would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
their Covenant upon those Conditions. So then to
perswade people that by swearing to adhere to the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they swear also to this
book and to all the points therein, (whereunto the whole
Church did agree fully in that Assemblie 1578. as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage)
either it is a false deluding of the whole Kingdom,
in drawing upon their consciences the burden of a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
perjurie, or else the Covenanters themselves remaine
as yet under that fearfull perjurie, notwithstanding of the
renewing of their Covenant, whereby they think that
their perjurie is expiate; for they have not as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
those things which they are bound to renounce
by their oath.</p>
               <p>4. This Book of Discipline is deficient in the principall
points of Church discipline; there is no order set down
therein of the censures of the Church, nor of the manner
of proceeding to the sentence of excommunication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
offenders, or in the absolution of the penitent, or
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64434:58"/>
of receiving them again into the Church who has been
excommunicated: in which points that which properly
is called the Discipline of the Church doth consist. Every
Church hath her Ecclesiasticall Canons, whereby those
things are directed, but this book omitting those Canons
hath done, as that Painter, who having portraied every
Nation in its proper habite, did paint the French man
naked with a paire of Taylors sheers in his hand to shape
to himself a fashion of Habite, because he changeth year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
according to his fancie: even so this book of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
hath given to the Ministers, and Lay-Elders in their
Elderships, a power to shape to themselves a new forme
of Discipline every year as they please; so that as I know
perfectly, there were few Presbyteries or Sessions in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but had different manner of proceeding in these
things, as I could instance in divers particulars, having
seen and perused many Presbyteriall and Session books.
And there is none amongst themselves, who frequented
divers Presbyteries, but they know this to be true.</p>
               <p>Finally, this Book is superabundant also, meddling with
those things which doe not appertaine to Ecclesiasticall
discipline, as setting down rules restraining the civill
and supreme Magistrate in the execution of his charge
committed to him by God, debarring him from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
with Ecclesiasticall matters, and not giving him so
much power therein, as to a Shoemaker or Taylor being
a ruling Elder, and giving him no definitive power, but
only to be an executioner of that which they define, and
such other points of Iesuiticall doctrine.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore this book of Discipline was never
fully approved, nor practised by the Church, nor fully
ratified by the estate and kingdome, nor received fully by
the Covenanters themselves, and since it is de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icient in
principall points of Discipline, and superabundant in
meddling wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>things impertinent, it cannot be accounted
that discipline whereunto all are sworn by the oath of the
Covenant: And therefore that all those Acts of Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64434:58"/>
cited here for the establishing thereof are imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to prove their conclusion.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="13" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">VVherein is discussed that Act of the Generall
Assemblie at Dundee 1580. Condemning
Episcopacie, as it was then in Scotland.</head>
               <p>THe principall Act whereupon they chiefly insist, and
ground this abjuration and meaning of the Church
in these years when the Covenant was sworn, is that Act
of the Generall Assemblie at <hi>Dundee</hi> Iuly 1580. whereby
<hi>The office of a Bishop (as it was then used in Scotland) is
condemned as unlawfull in it self:</hi> and that Act at <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi>
in April 1581. explaining the same, declaring it <hi>to
be understood not of the spirituall function only, but of the
whole office of a Bishop, as it was then used.</hi> Albeit the
Church appeareth wholly to have condemned by those
Acts all the points of the function of a Bishop, yet if we
consider rightly, we shall finde nothing in them which
proveth directly the determination of this Assemblie; for
I cannot see how the whole Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> did agree
at that time in condemning as unlawfull in it self, either
this point of Episcopacie which is condemned by this
Assemblie of Covenanters 1638. or any Substantiall point
either of the Spirituall or temporall function thereof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they grant that the Church at that time did contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
it self.</p>
               <p>First, I am assured they intended not to condemne in
Bishops, as unlawfull it self, the preaching of the Word,
the Administration of the Sacraments, and the exercise of
Ecclesiasticall Discipline, since they acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that these are the principall points of their spirituall
function in that Act of the Assemblie 1575. discussed here
before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:64434:59"/>
Secondly, neither did they condemn as unlawfull in it
self, the name and title of a Bishop to be appropriated to
some Pastors by others, for first, they did allow the title
of Superintendent to be appropriated to some pastors,
which is a word of the same sense and signification, and
importing as great Authoritie and Iurisdiction as the
other; And therefore it were but a foolish <hi>Logomachie,</hi>
or strife about words to allow the one title, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the other. Secondly, it may aswell be condemned
as unlawfull, to appropriate the name of <hi>Minister</hi> to the
degree of preaching Pastors, which is common to all
those who have charge in the Church: or to appropriate
the name of Elder to their ruling Elders only, which is
common to all Pastors, Apostles, Evangelists, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, neither did they condemne as unlawfull in it
self, their power and preheminence over the Ministers
in their Diocese, or charge over moe particular Parishes,
first, because there were points agreed upon by both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
before this Assemblie, and approved by a speciall Act
as we have shown before, <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. Secondly, because this
power was as yet still remaining in the persons of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents,
Commissioners and Visitors, and long after
this time.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, neither did they condemne as unlawfull in it
self, their power of Convocation of Synodall Assemblies
and their moderation therein, for the Church acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
this power to be lawfull in Superintendents, as we
have shown by divers Acts of Assemblies, <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. for if it
were unlawfull in it self, it could not be thought lawfull
under any title whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, neither did they condemne as unlawfull in it self
their sitting and voycing in Councell or Parliament, or
other Civill Iudicatories; for they acknowledge in the
second book of Discipline, <hi>Cap. 11. That Pastors may
and should assist their Princes when they be required in all
things agreeable to Gods Word, whether it be in Councell
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64434:59"/>
or Parliament, or otherwise.</hi> So a little before this time
<hi>M. Robert Pont,</hi> who was a Pastor and Commissioner of
<hi>Caithenes,</hi> had licence from the Assemblie to exercise the
office of a Senator of the Colledge of Iustice, which
was a civill Iudicatorie: That <hi>proviso</hi> which is added to
this doth not import any unlawfulnes in the office, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
they neglect not their own charge, nor by flatterie
of Princes hurt the publik estate of the Church;</hi> if any
doe so, it is but a personall fault, and not essentiall to the
office, for Bishops may doe more good in those places
for the publik weal of the Church, than their Apostles of
the Covenant by their long staying in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> farre
from their own particular charges, attending the tables
of the Covenant, and gadding up and down the Countrie
to stirre up the Kings Subjects to rebellion against him,
and to disturb the estate of the Church and Kingdome, as
many of the Covenanting Ministers have done.</p>
               <p>These are the principall points both of the Spirituall and
temporall functions of the Bishops, and since they were
not accounted by the Church unlawfull in themselves,
how can this be that this Assembly hath justly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>The whole estate of Bishops as unlawfull in it self;</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Ambiguitie lurk in these words which are there
added and often repeated, <hi>As it is now used in Scotland,</hi>
signifying that it was only the corruptions which were
in those who were Bishops at that time which they did
condemn, and not Episcopacie absolutely. It may be
true indeed, that there were some corruptions at that
time in those who had the office of Bishops, or that they
did not exercise their office aright, retaining some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the Roman Church, but for these personall
faults, the office should not have been condemned of it
self, since these corruptions might have been separated
from the office, as they were indeed by the new re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of Bishops in the year 1606. 1608.</p>
               <p>And certainly, they understood those corruptions
which are remaked to have been in the Bishops by the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64434:60"/>
book of discipline, <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. whereof some are corruptions
indeed, but not competent to that office, as it was now
established in <hi>Scotland</hi> by generall Assemblies and Acts of
Parliament: others of them are only supposed corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which cannot be convinced to be such indeed, either
by Gods Word, or testimonie of approved Fathers, or
practice, or example of the primitive Church. 1. They
say, it is a corruption that the name of Bishop should be
appropriated to some few: we have answered to this a
little before, shewing that this is only a proud doting
about questions and strife of words, as the Apostle sayes,
1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Tim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 6. 4. 2. They account it a corruption, that they
addict not themselves to a particular flock: I answer, that
they doe so, for their Diocese is their particular flock;
Then it is neither necessarie nor expedient, that he to
whom the generall charge of many parishes is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
should astrict himself to one Parish only, nor can the
contrary be convinced from Gods Word, wherein we
finde no such divisions of Parishes as is now. 3. They
challenge them that they are called Lords over their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and over the inheritance of the Lord: But first we
say, that they are not called Lords in regard of their rule
over their Brethren, but in regard of their temporall
Lordships bestowed upon them by the Liberalitie of
Princes, and in regard of their place in Parliament and
Councell: then this title of Lord, like as <hi>Dominus</hi> in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greek is sometimes a word signifying
absolute and illimitated Dominion. So we see that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Emperors, albeit in effect they had absolute domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet did they refuse often the title of <hi>Dominus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was odious to people, and in this sense Bishops
are not called Lords, neither doe they arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
such absolute and unlimited dominion, as to doe
what they pleased, but they must be ruled by the Canons
of the Church. But otherwise the title of Lord is only a
word of honour competent to every man of respect, to
whom it pleases the Prince, or custome of the Countrey
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64434:60"/>
to give that title, as in <hi>France</hi> we see the Bishops are no
otherwise intituted than other ordinarie Gentlemen, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them <hi>Mounsieur;</hi> so likewise in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy
Seignior,</hi> which title is also given to any other man of
worth; it is only the custome of the Countrey of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereby this title of Lord is given to
Bishops, and not for any absolute Dominion they arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
thereby. 4. They account it a corruption that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
should have further bounds to visite then they may
lawfully (they would say conveniently:) but that corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
may easily be amended by division of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese,
as is lately done in the Diocese of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Andrews,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
abolishing the whole office. 5. That a Pastor should
have criminall Iurisdiction: we answer they have not
this as Pastors or Bishops, but as a priviledge by the Laws
of the Countrey annexed to their temporall lands, which
notwithstanding they doe not exercise in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but by their Stewards or Bailif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es. 6. They count
it a corruption, that Bishops would not subject themselves
to the correction and censures of the particular Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
or Presbyteries: this is but a supposed corruption,
and if it were so, it were a great corruption indeed, and
a most uncomely and confused disorder, to give libertie
to the inferior members to correct the head; it is true
indeed, that Bishops ought to be subject to the censures
of Generall or Nationall Councels, and none of them will
think themselves exeemed from such a one as is lawfully
constituted. Albeit the Bishops did decline upon many
just reasons this Assembly of Covenanters, which are at
length expressed in their declinature, yet if that the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie
had been constituted according to the present
established order of the Church, they would never have
declined from the same. The last corruptions, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
in the Bishops as they were then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is,
that they did not instruct their people in Gods Word,
which is a corruption indeed, but not essentiall to the
office of a Bishop, or allowed by a Law: if any omit that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64434:61"/>
dutie, let them be censured for their personall fault, it is
great iniquitie to condemn the whole office as unlawfull
in it self, for the personall fault of one or two.</p>
               <p>But I perceive that the chief thing which was then
condemned in Episcopacie is, that they did not receive
<hi>their Commission to exercise their charge from the Church,</hi>
or that every Minister had not his voyce in the Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Election of Bishops, but that they were nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and presented by the King, elected by those of the
Chapton only, and consecrated by other Bishops, and
this was the thing which moved them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o despitefully to
condemn that estate, in the constitution whereof every
one of them had not a hand, and in all their proceedings
both in the book of Discipline and Acts of Assemblies it
appeares, that this was the chief thing they required, that
if they had had their Commission only from the Church
or generall Assemblie, they would have condescended to
all other points of their function.</p>
               <p>1. In the second book of Discipline, <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that albeit Pastors as pastors have not power over moe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>locks than one, yet if it be given them by the Church
they may exercise it lawfully. 2. In the Assemblie 1575.
it is agreed by both parties as we have declared, that
amongst the pastors one may be <hi>chosen by the Church</hi> to
visite certaine bounds comprehending many particular
parishes, and therein to plant Ministers, to suspend and
depose them for reasonable causes. 3. In the Assemblie at
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> 1578. one of the principall petitions they
make to the Regent, was that none should be admitted to
vote in Parliament in name of the Church, excep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> such as
have <hi>Commission from the Church.</hi> 4. In the second
book of Discipline, <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. It is said that no person un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whatsoever title ought to attempt any Act in name of
the Church either in Councell or Parliament, <hi>having no
Commission from the Church;</hi> so that if that had been
done, we see that they acknowledge both their power
and preheminence over other Pastors, their charge over
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64434:61"/>
moe particular flocks, their sitting in Councell, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in Parliament to have been lawfull, which are the
principall points both of the Spirituall and temporall
function of Bishops, which they challenge in this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
to be unlawfull.</p>
               <p>If then we can shew that the Bishops have received
from the Church such a <hi>Commission,</hi> to exercise all these
points of their office, how can it be denied but they may
exercise them lawfully, since this is the only exception
against them in these things: Therefore we shall make
it appear that Bishops have received from the Church
this Commission. 1. Christ himself who is the head of
the Church having all power, gave to the Apostles this
Commission to exercise power and preheminence in all
Spirituall and Ecclesiasticall matters, over all both Pastors
and people throughout the whole world. 2. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
who were at the beginning the representative
Church, gave the like Commission to Bishops over cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
bounds over the which they received Iurisdiction,
as <hi>Paul</hi> gave to <hi>Timothy</hi> in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and the bounds of
<hi>Asia minor</hi> thereabout, Commission to plant Churches,
to ordaine Presbyters and Deacons, to have Iurisdiction
and Rule over them being ordained, to receive or repell
accusations given in against them, and by consequent to
judge and correct, or censure them: the same Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
received <hi>Titus</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Creta;</hi> neither
can it be doubted, but the rest of the Apostles gave the
like Commission unto others in these Nations where they
travelled to preach the Gospel, who were to succeed
them in the rule and Government of the Churches, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they had not only the Name, but also the office, and that
power of Bishops which is here called in Controversie;
as none can deny, except those who will impudently
deny all t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rue records of Antiquitie, since all the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thodox
Fathers who succeeded the Apostles, and lived in the
same age with them, doe with unanimous consent te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
the same. The which Commission was derived from
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64434:62"/>
the Primitive Church (who received it from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles)
to those of succeeding ages, confirmed by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
practice uncontrouled for the space of fifteen hundred
years by any Orthodox writers, untill this last age that
some of the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> began to call it in question.
3. The Commission to vote in Parliament they could not
have at the beginning, when there was no Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
or Common-wealths, yet so soone as King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and Common-wealths received the publik exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Christian Religion authorized by Laws, then the
Church considering that many of the Civill Laws did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
directly or indirectly reflect upon Ecclesiasticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Religion; and that it was very expedient, that
Ecclesiasticall Constitutions for better obedience thereto
should be strengthened by the Laws of the Kingdome,
they did earnestly supplicate Emperors, Kings and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
that some Commissioners from the Church
might have place in their Soveraign Courts, whereby
Laws were established to further therein the cause of God
and the Church, and to take heed <hi>Nè Ecclesia aliquid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimenti
capiat:</hi> the which supplications Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
Kings and Magistrates out of a pious zeal did
grant, And therefore did authorize the Bishops and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to sit in their Soveraigne Courts in name of the
Church; this priviledge many godly and learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
did injoy to the unspeakable good of the Church,
and advancement of Christian Religion: so that it is no
lesse, but rather a great deal mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e wicked Sacriledge to
rob the Church of this so profitable a priviledge, than to
rob her of her patrimonie: and therefore no marvell,
though these who make no scruple in Conscience to be
sacrilegious in the one, be also sacrilegious in the other.</p>
               <p>4. To come neerer to our Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by all histories, that since there were Christian
Princes therein, the reverend Bishops did not onely rule
the Ecclesiastick affaires, but also had a great hand in the
affaires of the Civill estate, and did much good by their
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64434:62"/>
wise Counsell to the King, the Church and whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
before Popish tyrannie had place therein; and
that since there were any formall Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
the Prelats made up the third Estate, and did represent the
whole Church therein, both by the consent of the Church
and fundamentall Laws of the Kingdome, so that to the
enacting of any Law, the consent of Prelates was ever
thought as necessarie as any of the other two Estates. And
therefore since by the fundamentall Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
no Act in Civill or Ecclesiasticall matters ever had
the strength of a binding Law without the consent of all
the three Estates, whosoever will prease to suppresse th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
estate of Prelates doe reverse and destroy the very funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Laws of the Kingdome. 5. To come yet neerer
to the reformed Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at the very first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
those who were appointed in the place of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
called Superintendents, had by Commission from
the Church as great power and preheminence over other
Pastors, and all the Parishes within the bounds of the
charge committed to them, as Bishops doe now require
in their Diocese. It is true, the Superintendents had not
vote in Parliament, nor could have; for why the Bishops
retained still their possession in those places upon their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Commission, often ratified in Parliament both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after the Reformation, never quarrelled by any
Generall Assemblie of the Church, untill that Assemblie
at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in October 1578. wherein the Bishops are
required only, not to vote in Parliament in name of the
Church without speciall Commission there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ra. And
a few years before, to wit, at the Assemblie at <hi>Edi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>burgh
1573.</hi> the whole Iurisdiction and power of Bishops is
expresly allowed by the Church, with some exceptious
not very materiall as we remarked before, and yet there
is no mention of excepting this power, to vote in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in name of the Church, whereby they doe tacitely
at the least approve this the ancient Commission of the
Bishops to vote in Parliament in name of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:64434:63"/>
Finally, at the last re-establishing of Bishops, <hi>Thu Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to vote in Parliament in name of the Church was
expresly given to them by the Church;</hi> for first, by that
Assemblie at <hi>Montrosse</hi> 1600. the Church gave Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to a certaine number of Ministers (though not under
the title of Bishops) to have a care of the Generall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of the Church, and to voice in Parliament in name
of the Church: then the generall Assemblies at <hi>Glasgo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
and <hi>Lithgow</hi> in the year 1606. 1608. 1610. they did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the very title of Bishops receive full Commission
from the Church, not only to vote in Parliament, but
likewise to exercise their whole Iurisdiction, power and
and preheminence over all Pastors and people within the
bounds of their Diocese, and so every Bishop particularly
by their election and consecration receives power to use
this Commission, whensoever occasion shall be offered:
neither is it necessary, that for every severall Act they doe
in name of the Church, they have a new particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
for that effect; but it is sufficient, that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Church and Estates of the Kingdome, this
power is annexed to the office of a Bishop for ever, so
that whosoever should be elected to that office, should
have this Commission once for all during his life time,
or untill by his malversation in his charge he be lawfully
and legally deprived.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed, that the Church may adde new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to their Commission, as times and occasions requires;
as is done in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> where the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Clergie sits ever in the time of Parliament, to
consider upon such Articles as are thought by common
consent to serve for the weel of the Church, and by them
are presented to the Bishops, that by their care they may
receive due ratification: but the turbulent behaviour of
some Ministers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who scornes to have their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
proposed orderly by the Bishops, hath as yet bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Clergie of <hi>Scotland</hi> from that priviledge.</p>
               <p>Now to conclude this point, since for ought we can
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64434:63"/>
see, the only exception that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath
made against any point of the function of Bishops, at that
time when Episcopacie was condemned as unlawfull,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1580. &amp; 1581. is that they had not their power
and preheminence by Commission from the Church or
generall Assemblie, and since that exception, as we have
shown, is now removed, it is evident that those Acts of
the Assemblies at <hi>Dundee,</hi> 1580. and at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> 1581.
doe not serve to prove the Conclusion of this Assemblie,
and therefore are impertinently alleaged.</p>

               <p>SInce all the rest of the Acts in the subsequent Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies

them altogether, we shall remark some few particular
observations upon them, whereby it may be perceived
that if they serve not for their purpose here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet that they
serve in divers points against them. First, those Acts ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
here concerning the presentation by the King, and

Montgomerie</hi> to the office of the Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow.</hi>

                     </gap>es,</hi> and the
divers ineffectuall suits made by the Generall Assemblies
to the King, Councell and Parliament, for advancing of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64434:64"/>
their Presbyteriall Discipline, and suppression of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
to wit, those presented by the Assemblies 1580.
1581. &amp; 1587. serves against them in so farre as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that their violent proceedings against Bishops, and
for establishing of their new discipline, was not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Kings Majestie and Councell, and whole body
of the Kingdome in Parliament all this time, but directly
resisted, as contrary to their wills and manifest intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereby it is evident, that neither the King nor the
Councell, nor the whole body of the Kingdome had any
such meaning or intention, as by that oath of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
to abjure Episcopacie. 2. Although that the King
and estate suffered an Act to passe in Parliament 1592. esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
in a part their new discipline, yet was it not
their meaning to approve the same directly. But for a
pregnant reason of estate, they did tollerate lesser evils,
that greater might be eschewed: for at that time it is
well known, that the King and estate were mightily
astonished by the late discovery of a dangerous conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of sundry Noblemen of greatest power in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
by the practice of some tras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ieking Iesuites and
Gentlemen affected to the Popish Religion, such as <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Creightou, father Abercromy, Sir William Graham
of Fentry, M. George Carr,</hi> and others who brought in
great summes of Spanish gold, and promised greater,
whereby those Noblemen and many others of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
were corrupted to betray their Native Countrey,
promising by their letters, and subscription of blank pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
to give way and assistance to the King of Spaines
Navie to enter within the bowels of the Kingdome: No
marvell therefore, although (in so perillous a time, when
a totall ruine both of Church and Kingdome, of Policie
and Religion was feared and threatned) the King and
estate thought it fit for eschewing the present danger, to
give way at that time to those new <hi>Disciplinarians,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
that Act of Parliament to passe in their favour;
fearing that if they should have resisted their present im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64434:64"/>
turbulent spirits (as some of them were) might
have made a further distraction, even amongst these who
adhered to the true Religion, whereby an other gate
might have been opened for the entrie of forraigne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and so the estate being thus devided should have
been lesse able to resist the common enemie.</p>
               <p>This was the very true reason whereby his Majestie
was in a manner forced to condescend to this Act, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they brag so much, contrary to his own judgement and
constant intention: as is evident by that which followed,
for no sooner was that blast past, and that Conspiracie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
but King <hi>Iames</hi> of happie memory did set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
more earnestly than ever he did before, to re-establish
Episcopall government, and bear down that new disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
the evils and corruptions whereof disturbing both
Church and Common-wealth he perceived daily more
and more.</p>
               <p>3 We must remark that this Act of Parliament 1592.
was the first that ever did allow presbyteriall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by a Law, and therefore ought to be accounted the
first establishment thereof in the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
whereby it appears, how short a continuance it had in
this Church, and how soone it became loathsome to all
estates of persons, <hi>Spuria, putamina non agunt altas radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi>
For not full eight years after this, in the Assemblie at
<hi>Montrosse,</hi> 1600. it received a great blow, and Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie
was by one step more advanced, wherein it was
concluded that a certaine number of ministers who were
nominated by the King, should supply the place of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
by voycing in Parliament in name of the Church,
and to have a care of the generall affaires thereof under

thereafter under their own proper title were established
in their full power and Iurisdiction by the generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
of the Church 1606. 1608. 1610. &amp; solemnly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:64434:65"/>
4. We cannot omit that Act cited out of the Assemblie
March 1589. wherein it is said <hi>for asmuch as the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Kirk in England is understood to be heavily troubled
for maintaining of the true Discipline and Government,
whose griefes ought to move us: therefore the Presbyterie
of Edinburgh was ordained to comfort the said Church in
the said matter.</hi> I cannot conceive whom they call <hi>The
Church of England</hi> here, except it be some few Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
who a little before this time were challenged
before the Starre-chamber, for disturbing the Church and
Kingdome, by promoting unto the people a new forme
of Discipline, different in many points both from the
Scottish Discipline, and that of <hi>Geneva;</hi> who because
they did obstinately refuse to answere to some interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
proposed to them by the Councell of <hi>England,</hi>
were committed to prison; of which number was one
<hi>Wigintone,</hi> who stirred up three fanaticall fellows, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund
Coppinger, William Hacket</hi> and <hi>Henry Arthington</hi>
to labour for their relief, perswading them that they were
extraordinarily called thereto, <hi>Hacket</hi> being mightily
possessed by this humour did give out that Christ was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from heaven with his fan in his hand, and had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

ought to obey, being placed in Christs stead; whereby
they moved great multitudes of the Common people to

might more easily perceive whether the reasons alleaged

                  <hi>Thirdly, when it comes to the voycing, they say,</hi> The
whole Assembly most unanimously without contradiction of
any one (and with the hesitation of one alla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>ind did voyce, &amp;c. <hi>No marvell,
though all these who were present and admitted to give
voyce, did so without contradiction, since all those whom
they suspected, would make any contradiction were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
excluded from being Commissioners, or if they
were chosen Commissioners, were debarred from voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
by the Rulers of the Covenant, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
sent from their Tables at</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to every Presbyterie, some publikly to all, some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
to those of every Presbyterie, who were most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to the cause; and to make this evident, it shall not
be amisse to set down some of their instructions</hi> verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim.
1. Order must be taken that none be chosen ruling-Elders
but Covenanters, and those wel-affected to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
2. That where the Minister is not wel affected, the
ruling-Elder be chosen by the Commissioners of the Shire,
and spoken to particularly to that effect. 3. That they be
carefull that no Chapter-men, Chappel-men, or Ministers,
Iustices of peace, be chosen Commissioners although they be
Covenanters. 4. That the Commissioners of the Shire
cause conveen before them the ruling-Elder of every Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h
before the day of the election, and injoyne them upon their
oath that they give vote to none to be Commissioner, but to
those who are named already at the meeting at Edinburgh.
5. That such as are erroneous in doctrine or scand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
life <hi>(and such only they account those who are contrary
to their Covenant)</hi> be presently processed, that they be not
chosen Commissioners, and if they shall happen to be chosen
by the greater part, that all the best affected protest against
them, and come to the Assembly to testifie the same. <hi>There
were divers likewise who were chosen and admitted
Commissoners, and yet did remove themselves when the
Assemblie was discharged by the Kings Authoritie, out of
conscience of obedience to the Sover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igne Majestie and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64434:67"/>
detestation of Rebellion before this point was put to
voycing: Therefore none remaining except these who
were resolved to be partakers of Rebellion, no marvell,
though none of them did contradict their rebellious Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We see indeed this same unanimous consent in all the
rest of the Articles which were put to voycing in this
Assembly, whereby it may be cleerly discerned, that all
of them before this time were resolved upon amongst
themselves, by a sensible preagreement at their Tables at
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to the which agreement, they did astrict all
the Commissioners before they were admitted to have
voice in this Assembly: and for that effect it is injoyned
both by their secret and publik instru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tions. <hi>That every
Presbyterie shall send their Commissioners to Edinburgh
before the first of October</hi> (which was seven weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the day appointed to the beginning of the Assembly)
<hi>to the end they may know their own strength the better at
their next meeting.</hi> So that these Acts cannot be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Acts of the generall Assembly of the Church at
<hi>Glasgow,</hi> but rather Acts of those seditious tables of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters
at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and only repeated here at <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi>
for the fashion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wherein was this unanimous consent of their
suffrages? It was (say they) <hi>That all Episcopacie different
from that of a Pastor over a particular flock, was abjured
in this Kirk, and to be removed out of the same.</hi> If this
was their unanimous suffrage and no more, I marvell not
that there were no contradiction: Yea, I beleeve, that if
all the Bishops in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all those who had refused
to subscribe their Covenant, had been admitted to give
their voyce, they should not have contradicted this: for
neither doe these words answer to the propositon of the
Moderator, nor doe they condemn Episcopacie in any
point, as it was then used in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or in the primitive
Church.</p>
               <p>As for the first, that it doth not answer directly to the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64434:68"/>
proposition, I prove it in two substantiall points: for
first (as we declared before in setting down of the state
of the question) the Moderators proposition included
three distinct questions. 1. <hi>Whether according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith, as it was professed anno 1580. 1581. &amp;
1590. there be any other Bishop but a Pastor of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
flock, having no preheminence nor power over his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
2. Whether by the confession of Faith, as it was then
professed, all other be abjured. 3. Whether all other ought
to be removed out of this Kirk or not.</hi> But in voycing
they answer only to the last two, omitting altogether the
the first, which notwithstanding is the ground of both
the other: And indeed considering the informalitie of
the proposition, I esteeme that they had good reason to
answer so, for if they had done otherwise, their voices
had been as informall and intricate as the proposition
was, because they could not answer Categorically to all
three at once, for why, according to their grounds they
behooved to answer to the first <hi>Negati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and to the
other two <hi>affirmativè;</hi> and therefore lest their answers
should have been obscure and intricate, including both a
negative and affirmative voyce, they did wisely to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to those questions only, to the which one affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive
voyce might serve. 2. The propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ition containeth
two points of <hi>Episc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pacie,</hi> to wit, <hi>Charge over moe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
flocks, and power and preheminence over other Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
demanding, if both these points be abjured or not,
and both to be removed: But in voycing they determine
only the first point concerning their charge over moe
particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>locks than one, not a word of their abjuring or
removing their <hi>power and preheminence over their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
which notwithstanding is the chief point that
doth most grieve our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ovenenters, and for removing
whereof they have raised all this trou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Be it therefore
known to all, that this Assembly which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
conve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ned to condemn Episcopacie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
this power and preheminence over their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:64434:68"/>
therefore that this standing still in force in the Church of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> whosoever yeeldeth not due obedience to the
Bishops according to their oath, are evidently perjured,
and are not absolved from their oath by this Assembly
except they would say that they have extended the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
further then all their unanimous voyces could suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
which as they must confesse is the greatest iniquitie
which can be committed by any Assembly whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Finally, if it be so, that no episcopacie is here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
except that <hi>which is different from a Pastor of a
particular flock;</hi> there is nothing here condemned in the
Bishops, either as they were of old in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Ireland,</hi> yea, no Episcopacie is here abjured,
except that of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who only arrogats to
himself to be the Pastor of the universall flock: all other
Bishops requires no more, but to be a Pastor of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

                  </gap>lock, but the
Church by the Authority of the Magistrats, for the more
commodious ruling of the Church, and for conserving
unitie, have divided Kingdoms in provinces, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
in particular Dioceses, and Dioceses in particular
parishes, appointing to every part their own rulers, so
that as a parish is the particular flock of a Presbyter or
Minister; even so a Diocese is the particular flock of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
the province the particular flock of an Archbishop,
and the Nation or Kingdome in regard of the universall
Church is the particular flock of a Primate. Neither may
any Bishop lawfully usurpe charge over the particular
flock of another Bishop without his consent. Their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
of the Covenant who went through the Country
to preach, not the Gospel of peace, but their seditious
Covenant and mortall warre against the King and all
his Loyall Subjects, albeit they pretend to be Pastors only
of a particular parish, yet did violently intrude themselves
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64434:69"/>
to exercise charge in the parishes of other pastors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
warrant or Authoritie, or lawfull calling from the
Church, and contrary to the Constitutions of the Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> established even then when presbyteriall
government was in greatest force, drawing after them
many thousands of people to disobedience and open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
and by consequent to perdition, except they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;

<hi>cur ita facis?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot see what they can answer to this grosse and
absurd escape in not answering by their voices fully to the
proposition, and extending the determination of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
further than the voyces can suffer, except that they
would alleage that it is a fault in the Printer, and that it
was otherwise in the originall Register, which is not
like to be true for these reasons: first, because if it had been
so that they had answered fully to the proposition, their
suffrages should not have been Categoricall, but very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formall
and intricate, including both a negative and an
affirmative voyce. 2. Their Clerk <hi>M. Archibald Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi>
hath testified the contrary, by adding to this printed
Coppie, and all other which I have seen his signe and
<hi>Manuall subscription,</hi> testifying thereby that they are
printed according to the originall Acts contained in the
Authentick Register, out of the which he affirmes, he
hath not only collected and extracted these Acts, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
visied them, to see if the extract was according to the
originall; if he had committed such an absurd escape in
omitting the very principall point whereupon the whole
Act doth depend, and being that Act also for the which
the Assembly was chiefly conveened: he hath certainely
shown himself a very Asse, unworthy of that trust which
the whole Assembly did commit unto him by an expresse
Act, constituting him the only visitor and approver of all
things that are to be printed concerning the Church or
Religion. 3. Albeit it had been true that <hi>Iohnstone</hi> might

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ave overseen himself so far, yet how could it be possible
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64434:69"/>
that the Moderator, and others committed to visite the
Acts should have suffered such a fault, as reverseth the
whole Act about the which greatest care was taken to
passe forth before it was diligently corrected.</p>
               <p>Therefore I cannot but beleeve assuredly that there was
no fault committed by the Printer, but that the Act was
printed according to the originall Register, and that it
was so written in the Register, as it was voyced unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
in the Assembly, and that the voycers had no
other meaning then their words did expresse: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that nothing in effect was concluded in this Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Episcopacie, as the title of the Act beares. And so
we may conclude justly in these words of the Satyrick.
