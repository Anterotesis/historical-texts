            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I send you heere one of the <hi>shortest,</hi> and one of the <hi>sweetest</hi> of his Treatises: had it been as well brought foorth <hi>by me,</hi> as it ws begot <hi>by him,</hi> it had beene a <hi>child</hi> not vnwoorthy of so great a <hi>father</hi>: but seeing it is now as a <hi>fatherles</hi> child, be you the <hi>Tutors</hi> to this Orphane, at whose hands Orphanes and <hi>Wards</hi> haue euer been well vsed.

The subiect of this Treatise is <hi>the Ministerie,</hi> whereof are layde downe <hi>the duties &amp; dignities.</hi> And well dooth he couple these two together: for some can challenge the <hi>dignities</hi> of the Ministerie, and cunningly cast the <hi>duties</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr shoulders: others performe the <hi>duties</hi> but are kept from the <hi>dignities</hi> dulle belonging to that calling: but as hee that will doe the <hi>duties,</hi> may iustly challenge the <hi>dignities,</hi> so he that will expect the <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> must doe the duties of a Minister: therefore in this building, these <hi>two beames</hi> are in great wisdome well set together by this <hi>wise Maister builder,</hi> and so closelie coupled, as the idle or ambitious man cannot looke at the <hi>dignities,</hi> but he must withal behold the <hi>duties,</hi> nor the painful &amp; laborious man see his <hi>dutie,</hi> but withal shal see the <hi>dignitie</hi> thereto belonging.</p>

And as none could be a fitter <hi>Author</hi> of this discourse <hi>then he,</hi> so not many fitter <hi>Patrons</hi> then your <hi>selues: not many</hi> in your profession better schollers, <hi>nor any</hi> that better loue schollers then your selues: &amp; you are some of those few in this wicked age, who willingly yield all <hi>dignities</hi> and due reuerence to such <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> as you see willingly to discharge the <hi>duties</hi> of good Ministers. Well would it be with the Ministerie of England, (and the better with it, the better with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) if all <hi>as great</hi> as you, vvere <hi>as great friends</hi> to it as you. And if the Papists ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and say how can this be, for that you haue beene persecuters of <hi>their Priests,</hi> let
<pb facs="tcp:3042:4"/>
me answere once for you, who often aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere for many distressed men: they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute you with slander, that say you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (but be content to beare your part in popish slanders, with our Prince and state, our Counsellers &amp; Clergie, our Parliaments and Lawes, for none of these haue escaped these viperous tongues) for though you haue <hi>executed the lawes</hi> vpon some of them in your seuerall places, yet not with <hi>sharpnes</hi> nor seueritie, but with <hi>mercifull iustice,</hi> and that also not as they were <hi>Priests,</hi> but <hi>Plotters,</hi> Practisers, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerters, and seducers: and as they vvere Priests, you sought their reformation, not their ruine. And if they, who can hardlie discharge themselues from beeing <hi>Priests of Baal,</hi> haue had but <hi>iustice,</hi> and that also tempered with <hi>mercy,</hi> it shewes how good regard you haue, and howe much you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme all good and faithfull Ministers, which are <hi>Gods Interpreters.</hi> In a word, if all our <hi>Ministers</hi> were such as this Treatise describeth, or came but as neere it as the <hi>Author</hi> hereof did, &amp; if all our <hi>great ones</hi> did vse &amp; esteeme good Ministers as you do, we should then soone pull the <hi>Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder that foote of contempt, with
<pb facs="tcp:3042:4"/>
which this prophane age doth daily tread vpon it. The Church of Rome, who are farre <hi>wiser in theyr kinde then the children of light,</hi> haue taken other &amp; strange courses to magnifie the Clergie. They teach, that the state <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> is so far more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then the <hi>Ciuile,</hi> as the <hi>sunne</hi> is then the <hi>moone,</hi> &amp; that not in <hi>spirituall</hi> onely, (for that we deny not) but in <hi>temporall</hi> power, pompe, &amp; estate: and that therefore the <hi>Chiefe</hi> of their <hi>Clergie,</hi> is as farre aboue the mightiest <hi>Emperour,</hi> as the <hi>sunne</hi> is aboue the <hi>moone</hi>; and as the moone borroweth her light from the <hi>sunne,</hi> so doth the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> his state and power from the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They teach, that the <hi>Clergie</hi> is a state so distinct, &amp; so absolute of it selfe, as it hath not to do with the <hi>Ciuile</hi> state, yea they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt their <hi>Clergie,</hi> from beeing any vvay subiect to the <hi>temporall Magistrate.</hi> And though their crimes, be neuer so many or monstrous, yet the <hi>Prince,</hi> or ciuile au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, hath nothing to do to take notice thereof, much lesse to punnish them: &amp; herevpon great volumes are written, and many Acts and decrees are made in theyr Cannon Law, <hi>De exemptione Clericorum.</hi> They extoll their <hi>Clergie</hi> aboue the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraltie,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3042:5"/>
allowing the Priests both Breade and Wine in the Sacrament, but leauing the <hi>Laitie</hi> bread alone. They make them in their Masse <hi>Mediators</hi> betwixt Christ &amp; God the Father, &amp; <hi>Creators</hi> of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and Redeemer, when and as often as themselues list. And finally, they send for the most part, all their <hi>Clergie</hi> immediatly to <hi>heauen</hi> without let, wheras all the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralty</hi> (except Martyrs) must passe by <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Here are great buildings, but on a sandy <hi>foundation,</hi> goodly <hi>Castles,</hi> but built in the <hi>ayre</hi>; if these deuises vvere of God, they would certainly stand, but their long tottring threatens a suddaine fall.</p>
            <p>Contrariwise, our Church, or rather <hi>the corruption of our Church,</hi> by auoyding this <hi>Scilla,</hi> haue falne into <hi>Charibdis,</hi> by auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one extremitie, haue falne into the other, by taking too much <hi>dignity</hi> &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our <hi>Ministerie,</hi> &amp; by laying too much pouerty, <hi>contempt,</hi> and basenes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it. It were a worke worth the labour of the <hi>wisest heads,</hi> to put downe the <hi>true meane</hi> betwixt both extreames, &amp; vvorth the labour of our <hi>Noble King,</hi> to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that that meane be kept, without <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> to the right hand, or <hi>falling</hi> to the left.
<pb facs="tcp:3042:5"/>
This short Treatise may hap to giue som light &amp; directions therein, or at least may encourage &amp; stir vp their <hi>harts</hi> in vvhose <hi>hands</hi> it is to doe it: Vnder your woorthy names would I haue it see the world, not so much for that I am bound to you both in many priuate and particuler respects, (though that be much) as for that I know you both to be of so right and reformed a iudgement in this case, as you would haue none <hi>Ministers</hi> but of sufficient gifts, and vnblameable liues, nor those <hi>Ministers</hi> put to their pensions, or vncertaine sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but to haue <hi>certaine</hi> &amp; <hi>sufficient</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance proportionable to theyr charge, and beseeming the honour of a christian Church: God continue you still in that minde, and make many more of the same with you, so should we haue as florishing a Church as any Christendome hath seene. Goe forward in that, &amp; other your religious resolutions, it is the true way to <hi>honour</hi> both heere and in a better world: stand firmly for the truth, and boldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the popish enemies thereof, as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you haue done: Religion had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more cause to thanke you, and all that doe so then now it hath, for her enemies

were neuer so insolent since they were our enemies: but if you and others holde on, as in your seuerall places you haue wel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and others take the like course, there is hope their insolencies will bee easilie (if timely) repressed, and themselues neerest the <hi>fall,</hi> when they imagine they are in the <hi>full.</hi> The Lorde blesse and assist you in your painfull places, and make you on earth Instruments of his glorie, to the good of his Church, so shall you be ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of glory in the kingdome of Heauen: And thus commending this little treatise to your <hi>reading,</hi> and my selfe to your <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,</hi> I take leaue, and will euer rest</p>

both for soule and bodie: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these words to he end of the chapter.</p>
            <p>The intent then of this Scripture, is, that God vseth meanes in his mercie to preserue sinnres fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falling into sin, but if they do, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he in much greater mercy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foordeth them meanes and helps to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And this is the soule &amp; substance of the words. Now, that meanes and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is the matter I purpose to speak of, out of these wordes: The meanes then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store a sinner after a fall, is to raise him by repentance into a better estate then hee was in before, and that is inclusiuely, and by implication taught in this text: But the instrument by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that great work is to be wrought, is heere in plaine tearmes layd downe to be a <hi>Minister of God,</hi> law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called and sent by God, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Church to that great duty.

            <p>Let no man thinke I heere giue the least allowance to Anabaptisticall fancies, and reuelations, which are nothing, but eyther dreames of theyr owne, or illusions of the deuil, for they contemne both hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning, and the study of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and trust wholy to reuelations of the spirit; but Gods Spirit worketh not but vpon the foundation of the word: onely I teach this, that a Minister must be a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Interpreter,</hi> an <hi>Interpreter</hi> of Gods meaning.

            <p>Furthermore, inasmuch as Ministers are Interpreters,<note place="margin">Esay, 13.</note> they must labour for sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and holines of life.

A Minister is to declare the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation betwixt God and man, and is he himselfe not reconciled? Dare he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent another man to Gods mercy for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and neuer yet presented himselfe? Can hee commend the state of Grace to

another, &amp; neuer felt the sweetnes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in his owne soule?

            <p>In Exodus,<note place="margin">Exod, 19, 20, Leuit. 10, 3,</note> the priests are bid to <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the people,</hi> and in Leuiticus it is sayde, that <hi>God will bee sanctified in all that come neere him,</hi> but who come so neere vnto God as the Ministers doe? so that it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, <hi>Ministers</hi> doe <hi>sanctifie the people,</hi> and in some construction, <hi>God himselfe</hi>: Nowe, shall they one way be <hi>sanctifiers of the people,</hi> another way <hi>of God himselfe,</hi> &amp; no way <hi>of themselues?</hi> Surely if it bee so, they are but lame Interpreters; And this is the reason doubtlesse, why vnsanctified Ministers, and such as are of a loose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, bestow such fruitlesse labors in the Church: many want no learning, no ability to interpret, &amp; yet how few soules
<pb facs="tcp:3042:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doe they bring to God? Some it may bee are conuerted by theyr ministery, that God may shew, the efficacie is not in the person of man, but in the ordinance of God, but fewe doubtlesse (for ought that we can see) do teach vs, how God hateth him which will take in hand to reconcile others, himselfe beeing vnreconciled to God.

            <p>The last reason is,<note place="margin">3 Reason: want of mainten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> more peculiar to this of the new testament, namely, <hi>want

of maintenance and preferment,</hi> for them that labor in this calling: men are flesh and bloud, and in that respect must bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured, &amp; wonne to embrace this vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by some arguments, which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade flesh and bloud: the world hath in all ages beene negligent heerein, and therefore God in his lawe tooke such strick orders, <hi>for the maintenance of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uits</hi>:<note place="margin">Deuter, 10, 9, &amp; 28, 2, Number, 18, 26.</note> but especially, now vnder the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, this calling is vnprouided for, when it deserues best of all to be rewarded: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it were a worthy christian pollicy, to propound good preferments to this calling, that thereby men of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest gifts might bee wonne vnto it, and the want heereof, is cause why so many young men of speciall parts, and greatest hope, <hi>turne to other vocations,</hi> and especially <hi>to the lawe,</hi> wherein at this day the greatest part of the <hi>finest wits of our kingdome,</hi> are imploied, and why? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue all the <hi>meanes to rise,</hi> whereas the Ministerie, for the most part yeildeth nothing, but a <hi>plaine way to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery</hi>

            <p>Heere is the third part of the descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Minister, that is, by his office,<note place="margin">3 Part of the description by his office</note> 
               <hi>to declare vnto man his righteousnes:</hi> that is, when a poore sinner, by his sinnes (the foulenes whereof he seeth, and the burden whereof he feeleth) is brought downe, as it were to the very gates of hell, when this sinner by the preaching of the Lavve, is brought to <hi>a true sight of this misery:</hi> and again, by preaching the gospel, is brought <hi>to lay hold on Iesus Christ,</hi> then it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per office of a Minister <hi>to declare vnto that man his righteousnes.</hi> Namely, that though <hi>in himselfe</hi> he be as ill, &amp; as foule as sinne can make him, &amp; as the law can discouer him to be; yet <hi>in Christ</hi> he is righteous, &amp; iust, and by Christ so iustified, as hee is no more a sinner in the presence &amp; account of God: this is the <hi>righteousnes of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb facs="tcp:3042:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man,</hi> this is the iustification of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And <hi>to declare this righteousnes</hi> to him that repents and belieues, is the proper dutie of a <hi>true Minister.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Acts, Paule saith of himselfe, that <hi>he witnessed to the Iewes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts, 20, 21,</note> 
               <hi>&amp; to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, the repentance towards God, and fayth towards our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> In vvhich words is layde downe the complete dutie of a Minister (as he is a publick <hi>Angell or Interpreter,</hi>) first, to preach <hi>repentance,</hi> which a man must performe to GOD, whom by his sinnes he hath grieuously of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; secondly, to preach <hi>faith in Christ,</hi> and free forgiuenes, and perfect saluation through that faith in Christ, to all that shal truly belieue in him. And after both these, followeth that which is heere spoken of, which comprehendeth both the former, namely, <hi>to declare vnto man his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> So that in these words, are inclusiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid downe, these poynts of a Ministers calling: first, a true Minister may &amp; must <hi>declare</hi> vnto a sinful man <hi>where righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is to be found,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1, Iohn, 2.</note> namely, in Iesus Christ the righteous. Secondly, <hi>how</hi> that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes may be <hi>obtayned,</hi> namely, by doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:3042:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
two duties; first, by <hi>denying</hi> &amp; disclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>his owne</hi> righteousnesse, and that is doone by repentance; secondly, by clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming &amp; <hi>cleaning</hi> to <hi>Christs</hi> righteousnes, and that is done by <hi>fayth.</hi> Thirdly, a true Minister may and must <hi>declare this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes to him,</hi> that is, first <hi>publish</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime it, that it is ready to bee bestowed on euery sinner, which will thus appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it, and that it is able to iustifie and saue him: secondly, beside a bare <hi>publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this iustification, hee must (as Paul did) <hi>witnesse and testifie it</hi> to the conscience of the sinner, that it is as certainly true, as God is true. For as <hi>a witnesse</hi> in doubtfull cases is called, that by his testimonie hee may <hi>cleere the truth,</hi> so when the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of poore sinners are <hi>wauering</hi> and doubtfull what to belieue, when they <hi>doubt</hi> of this righteousnesse, then is a true Minister as a <hi>faithfull witnes</hi> of God to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre and <hi>testifie this truth,</hi> from his owne conscience, knowledge and feeling, of the infallible certaintie of Gods promises, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the doubtfull and distressed conscience of the sinner.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, besids <hi>declaration</hi> and <hi>testifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3042:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he is <hi>to maintaine</hi> this truth, and this <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> (if the sinners conscience be yet not quiet) against all gainsayers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the power of darknes, and all the gates of hell: that this is true and perfect righteousnesse to him that apprehends it, as afore is layd downe: and this is so infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible to euery soule that repents and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth, that the Minister may <hi>assure</hi> it to the conscience of the sinner in the word of truth, and in the name of God, and may call to witnes all Gods Saints, and all his holy Angels, and may <hi>pawne</hi> vnto him <hi>his owne soule</hi> vpon it, that it is most true, that this is <hi>true, perfect, and all-sufficient righteousnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see in some measure, what it is <hi>to declare vnto a man his righteousnes.</hi> And this is the peculiar office of a Minister of God, and this is the height and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his office. In the want of godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, I confesse that godly Christian men may one <hi>helpe</hi> another in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of these duties, and that with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but it is the <hi>proper function</hi> of a godlie Minister to doe it, and the <hi>promise and blessing</hi> belongs properly to him: as the
<pb facs="tcp:3042:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
consciences of all penitent sinners, will testifie in this case: let Dauids serue for many, who when he was cast downe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the mouth of hell, by that feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full discouery, of his two hideous sinnes by Nathans preaching, &amp; when the faith of his soule, beganne to wrestle against hell, and striue against dispaire, and to apprehend the mercy of God in Christ: then I say, could not the testimonie, of all the men in the world, haue giuen him that ioy, comfort and assurance, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than did, when hee said in the word of a Prophet, and of a true Minister, <hi>God hath taken away thy sinne, thou shalt not die:</hi> what did Nathan heere, but <hi>declare vnto man his righteousnes</hi>: what did Nathan heere, but the duty of euery true Minister?</p>
            <p>If this be the office and duty of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,<note place="margin">1 Vse for Ministers.</note> and if such be the height and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of his office let vs see then what vse we may make of it.</p>
            <p>First, concerning the Ministerie:<note place="margin">First for the Popish Ministerie.</note> It first discouereth how nakedly, weakely, and insufficiently, <hi>the Popish Church</hi> doth <hi>declare vnto man his righteousnesse,</hi> who will let a man seeke it <hi>in himselfe,</hi> where alas it is not: for Paule himselfe testifieth, that
<pb facs="tcp:3042:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>

And this God did to <hi>Easy,</hi> not as he was an ordinary, but an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prophet: for ordinary Ministers need no renouation of their calling, nor any newe signes of confirmation, but extraordinary Prophets, who come in extraordinary maner, &amp; to do many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary workes, God in his wisdom wil haue their calling confirmed, againe, and againe, &amp; that by very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanes.

wordly and politique purposes. And some of a better ranke, which thinke if a man haue learning, degrees and age, he is sufficiently qualified for that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. But alas, this is not all; there is a greater work to be wrought then so, he must be humbled &amp; cast down, in sight of the greatnes of that calling, of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of that God whose roome he is to execute, &amp; of the vnworthines of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to so great a worke: hee must bee resolued, that to call a man to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, is the greatest worke that GOD worketh in his Church, but the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a sinner, and calling him to the state of grace: nay it is a worke eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like vnto it: for as a sinner in his <hi>conuersion,</hi> so he at his <hi>Vocation</hi> to that place, is often to cry out in the amazement of his soule, <hi>Woe is me I am vndone.</hi> As therefore they are foulie deceiued, which thinke any holinesse or sanctification, can suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently qualifie a man without lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, so are they no lesse which thinke all outward complements to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent without this worke, which here was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3042:45"/>
wrought in the holy Prophet. Thus we see the feare and astonishment of the Prophet. It followeth;
<q>For I am a man of polluted lippes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now follow the causes of his feare, which are two. The first is, his owne pollution and sinfulnesse, and the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of his people: his owne he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confesseth in these words; <hi>I am a man of polluted lippes:</hi> that is, I am a miserable and sinfull man, and therefore I feare and tremble to stand in Gods presence: nay, I dare not looke vpon the Lorde, for my sinnes. But it may bee demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, how could the Prophet say thus truely, for he was a holy man, and iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Gods presence, by his true faith in the <hi>Messias,</hi> and sanctified by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: can a man iustified and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, say, he is a man polluted? I answere, It is doubtlesse, he was so, he therefore complaineth here not of any great and enormous sinnes, which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the publicke scandoll of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3042:46"/>
Church, but first of the corruption of his nature; which in him as in al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a very sea of iniquity, &amp; which alwaies appears the more, the neerer a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comes to God and therefore did now most apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discouer it selfe in the Prophet, when he was in the presence of the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Secondly, he complaineth of some actuall sinnes of his life, and it is more likely of some sinnes of omission, then of Commission: for we find not that the Prophet was euer touched with any great sinne, and where we know it not, we are in charitie not to imagine it. So that it ts most probable, he complaineth of some smaller faul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>donable in other men, is no way in them: they must therefore watch ouer themselues most carefully, and take heede to all their wayes: and for this ende is it, that a Minister in godly wisedome must often depriue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe euen of many things (which it may bee, lawfully hee might vse) least his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie bee an occasion of euill to others:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3042:47"/>
and must abstaine from the least sinnes, least euen they be blemishes to his calling, and burthens to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science. And hence is it, that a Minister cannot be too carefull in his calling, in his words, dyet, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, recreation, apparell, gestures, and in his whole cariage, because little sinnes are so great in them. Especially Ministers here learne the Apostles Lesson, to bee <hi>instant in season &amp; out of season: to preach and exhort, to comfort and rebuke publikely and priuately</hi>: to good, to bad: when it is well taken, when it is ill taken, when they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly receiue it, and when they stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resist it, when they commend him and reward him, and when they raile at him, and persecute him for it: thus must he be diligent in season &amp; out of season, for the least negligence in his dutie, or omitting the least opportunitie of doing good, will when God visits his conscience, be a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and vexation to him, as it was here to the Prophet.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, if these small sinnes thus afflicted the Prophet, then alas what is to bee thought of those Ministers, who
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3042:47"/>
make no conscience of foule &amp; scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous sinnes? how shal Symonie, Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie, Vsurie, inhospitality, couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Ignorance, Idlenesse, carelesse Nonresidencie, how shall these (I say) and other like greiuous crimes oppresse and burthen the soule, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest sinnes doe so affright this holy man? Surely, when God shall visite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their states will be most fearefull, nor, shall any mans case be so miserable, as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscionable Ministers: And though now such loose and licentious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters seeme to liue in Iolitie, &amp; without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto their consciences, then will they cry out in fearefull anguish, <hi>Woe is mee, I am vndone.</hi> And againe, if these small faults so affrighted this holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and burdened his conscience, then what pittifull consciences haue those Ministers, whose daily negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and vnconscionable carelesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in their places is such, as all men speake of, and yet they are not touched: surely, these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are not of so tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3042:48"/>
as the Prophet was: and either the Prophet here was much more nice then needed, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> else these men will proue to be in a miserable estate.</p>
               <p>Lastly, let Ministers of care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, be here comforted in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble of the Prophet: who is there, but may finde imperfections and blemishes in himselfe, which will often make him cry out; <hi>Wo is me</hi>: but let not that discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather reioyce, that they can see their owne weaknesse, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did here: If they haue cause to exclaime against themselues, they are not alone, as was this, and all other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets case before them. In ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, they are no more miserable then the Prophet was: but let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> labour to be as blessed in seeing &amp; complaining of themselues as hee was: And let euery Minister as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure himselfe, that the more hee makes conscience, euen of the least sinnes of all, the more he resembleth the ancient holy Prophets, &amp; the more likely is he to worke effectually in his Ministerie.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3042:48"/>
For his dutie is to worke in his people a conscience, not of great sinnes onely, but euen of all: but how can hee doe that to them, if he haue not first of all done it in himselfe? hence it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that godly Ministers finde fault with themselues, when other men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, and cry out against themselues, for their pollution (with the Prophet here) when no other man can accuse them of the least crime: nay, when others doe magnifie God for his graces on them, and praise their giftes, and commend their good liues, euen then doe they condemne themselues, and exclaime against their owne corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and their owne smallest negligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or omissions, are great woundes to their consciences: &amp; their last sinnes, and their most pardonable infirmities, are sore burthens vnto them: for of all men in the worlde, a godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister is a man of the most tender conscience.</p>
               <p>Hitherto hath the Prophet complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed generally of his pollution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:3042:49"/>Particularly, hee exclaimeth against <hi>the pollution of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ippes.</hi> But why will some say, complaines hee of the <hi>polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ippes,</hi> rather then of his heart, or his hands, or any other part of him? were they not all polluted? yes, all in some measure: and was not he grieued at them all? yes assuredly, wee must grant that also. But the reason is, he was a Prophet, his dutie was to vse his tongue, the practise of his calling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in the vse of his tongue: for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister is an Interpeter, as he is called, <hi>Iob.</hi> 33.23. that is, <hi>the peoples to God by prayer, and Gods to the people by preaching</hi>: he is Gods mouth, and the peoples mouth: so that the tongue of a Minister is that part of his body, which is to be vsed as a principall instrument of Gods glorie, and more to the setttng foorth of his honour then any other: Now euery man is to be tryed what he is by his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, rather then by any other acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall or collaterall courses: therefore the honour or dishonour of a Minister, is the vse or the abuse of his tongue: and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3042:49"/>
his comfort or discomfort is the well v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, or not vsing of it. The Prophet therefore here affrighted at Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and therefore retyring into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, presently his conscience checkes him for his most proper sins: namly, for some fault or negligence in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, (which is the proper sinne of that calling) and therfore is it that he exclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth against the pollution of his lippes: out of which practise of his wee may learne;</p>
               <p>First, the vanitie of the Papists, who magnifie the merites of holy mens workes: for if this holy Prophet, a man truely iustified, &amp; extraordinarily sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, yet durst not stand before God in this little apparance of his glory, notwithstanding all his zeale, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and conscience, and paines, and sufferings in his function, but was cast downe so farre, from a conceit of his owne worth, that hee cryed out; <hi>Woe is mee, I am vndone.</hi> How then can wee who are no better, but rather worse then hee, stand before <hi>GOD</hi> in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3042:50"/>
day of Iudgement, in the great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of his infinite iustice and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? Rather doubtlesse, as here the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest <hi>pollution of his lippes,</hi> and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in his calling, droue him out of all conceit of merit, when once hee came into the presence of GOD: so the due consideration of our so many and foule pollutions aboue his, should beate downe all proude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites of our owne goodnesse, when wee appeare before GOD. It is therefore to bee feared, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, who thus magnifie their owne merites, doe seldome or neuer enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to earnest consideration of their owne infirmities, and doe seldome present themselues in the presence of Gods Maiestie. For if they did, then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the least sight of their least pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would make them farre from euer thinking of their owne merites.</p>
               <p>They also tell vs, of workes of superrerogation, but it seemes heere, this holy Prophet had none of them. And they teach, a man may in this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3042:50"/>
life perfectly fulfill the Lawe, but who can doe it, if not Ministers? And what Ministers, if not extraordinary Prophets? And yet <hi>Isaiah</hi> (the first and chiefe of them) exclaimeth here in pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull manner against his pollutions: Doubtlesse, if the Papists would cease flattering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mselues, and not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their consciences by their owne pleasing corruption, but present themselues in the face and presence of Gods Maiestie, they would bee farre from these conceits.</p>
               <p>In the next place, whereas the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet complaineth of the <hi>pollution of his lippes</hi>: As of the peculiar sinne of his place: Ministers are heere taught, to auoide that sinne aboue all other; and to labour in that dutie aboue any other: for the dooing of it, is his most comfort: the want of it is his most vexation: his tongue is the Instrument giuen him to honour God, if hee vse it well, it yeeldes him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, more then any other duties.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3042:51"/>
But if hee vse not, or abuse his tongue, the pollution of his lippes will bee the heauiest burthen of all: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are greatly deceiued, who thinke a Minister to discharge sufficiently his duetie, though hee preach not, if hee keepe good Hospitalitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make peace amongst his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

yet <hi>if his lippes be polluted,</hi> either by not preaching, or by negligent, idle, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse preaching, this pollution will so staine his conscience, and so burthen him in the presence of God, that the time will come (notwithstanding all his other good qualities) he will cry out in farre more pittifull maner then here the Prophet doth; <hi>Woe is me, I am vndone, because I am a man of polluted lippes.</hi> It followeth;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I dwell in the midst of a people of polluted lippes.</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3042:52"/>
people, and make both publike and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate confession of them to God: and the more particularly hee can doe this, the better: and this he is to doe, both for the peoples good, and for his owne also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot be but that the sinnes of his people, are in some sort his: for this is the peculiar danger of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats and Ministers calling, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie the sinnes of their people are theirs: I meane, that they are accessarie to the sinnes of their people, either by prouoking them by their euil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or by not reprouing, or not hindring or suffering, or winking, or couering and concealing, or not punishing them, or not carefully enough vsing meanes to preuent them: by all which meanes and many more, it comes to passe, that the peoples sinnes are the Ministers by communication: so that as well for his owne sake, as theirs, hee is to confesse to God their sinnes, as well as his owne.</p>
               <p>Now if a Minister must confesse
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3042:52"/>
his peoples sinnes, then it followeth consequently, that hee must knowe them, and take notice of them, for else hee cannot confesse them. And this is one cause why the holy Ghost com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes a Pastor <hi>to knowe his flocke.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 27.23</note> Hee must not onely <hi>haue a flocke,</hi> and <hi>knowe</hi> which is <hi>his flocke</hi>: or haue a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall eye ouer it, but hee must haue a particular and distinct knowledge of the state of it, and the more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar the better. And if the Minister ought to knowe his peoples sinnes, then it followeth, first that it is best for a Minister to bee present with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that so hee may better knowe them and their state: and certainly if it bee a Ministers dutie to confesse to God the pollutions of his people, then wilfull and carelesse nonresidency and all absence, without iust and consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble causes, must needes be a foule and feareful sin. For how could <hi>Isayah</hi> haue confessed he <hi>dwelt in the midst of a people of polluted lips,</hi> but that he dwelt amongst them. Nay saith the Prophet, hee dwelt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3042:53"/>
in the midst among them, indeede well may hee <hi>knowe and confesse</hi> his peoples pollutions, that <hi>dwelles</hi> in the midst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</p>
               <p>Againe, if the Minister be to confesse his peoples sinnes, and therefore must needes knowe them, then it followeth also that they must discouer &amp; confesse them vnto him, or else it is not possible he should perfectly knowe their estate: the want of this is a great fault in our Churches, for howeuer we condemne Auricular confession, as a very pollicie in the deuisers, and as a rack to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of poore Christians, yet we not onely allowe, but call and cry for that confession, whereby a Christian volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily at all times may resort to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, and open his estate, and disburden his conscience of such sinnes, as disquiet him, and craue his godly assistance, and holy prayers: great blessing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort doth doubtlesse followe them that vse this godly practise, and the want of it, is cause that a Minister ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not discerne the state euen of his own flocke, nor can
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3042:53"/>
complaine to God of their pollutions, and confesse their sinnes so particularly as would be good both for him &amp; them. Secondly, the Prophet couples together his owne pollution, and the pollutions of his people, as the adiuva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or helping cause and the effect: For the pollution of a people, helpes forward the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Minister, and the worse people they are, the worse do they make him, though he be otherwise neuer so good: For euen the Prophet, though called of God himselfe, and iustified and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a man of extraordinary grace, yet dwelling in the midst of a people so stubborne and disobedient, as the Iewes were, hee was something touched with their pollutions: Ministers (euen the best) are men, and this comes to passe by reason of the corruption of their nature, as they are men: the nature of which corruption, is to apprehend any euill where euer it can be found, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with it: regeneration qualifieth and abates this corruption, but takes it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way perfectly in this life: whereby it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3042:54"/>
comes to passe, that a Minister, liuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst euil people, cannot but be som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what stained with their pollutions, of what sort soeuer they be; insomuch as it is often seene, that one known to be otherwise disposed of himselfe, is found to be disposed to this or that euill, by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing amongst a people so disposed. And againe, that a Minister in such a place, &amp; amongst such people, free from such and such sinnes, remoued to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, is there found more or lesse tainted with them, because they abound amongst the people: and yet further, that a Minister, knowne to be faithfull, painfull and zealous, and comming to a disobedient, stubborne, froward, or prophane and dissolute people, his faith is weakened, his zeale and courage aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Gods graces in him dulled, &amp; much decayed: godly Ministers doe daily complaine hereof, and experience eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where shewes it too true.</p>
               <p>Out of this, we may learne something both for our instruction, and for our conuersation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:3042:54"/>For our instruction, it here appeares how wicked and wretched the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our nature is, which cannot but receiue some contagion from the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those with whom we liue: for this is so, not onely in them who carry a loose hand ouer themselues, but euen in such as looke most narrowly vnto their steps: as we see here in this holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who was a man of more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary sanctification: how little cause therefore hath any man to extol nature? and how much lesse cause the schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and some other Papists, to giue the least commendation to our pure natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals: for if nature rectified by grace, bee so hardly kept within compasse, alas how outragious and peruerse is it, when it raignes without controlment?</p>
               <p>And for our further instruction, here wee may see of what a cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and incroaching nature sinne is, which like a secret venome in the naturall bodie, so it in the polliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que bodie restes not in the place, or pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3042:55"/>
and diffuseth it selfe into euery part and member of the whole: it creepes from man to man, yea from an euill man to a good, from the worst man to the best: from prophane men, to godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: and as from publike persons (as Magistrates and Ministers) it descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth visibly, and the example of their euill life is palpably scandalous: so from the people to the Magistrate or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, it creepeth closely, and ascendeth in more secret and insensible maner, yet in the effect it is too sensible: for it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies seene, that they are something touched with their peoples pollutions: sinne is not onely as a poison spreading from the heart to all parts, from the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to the people: but as a gangreue, if it begin in the foote, wil without spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy preuention spred priuily to the hart: so sinne shewes it selfe, euen from the people to the Ministers: So great cause is there for all men to stop sinne in the beginning, to breake it in the egge, to giue water no passage, no not a little: for let this gangreue beginne at the feete, it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3042:55"/>
will not rest till it be in the heart.</p>
               <p>For our confirmation wee are here taught, first if a Minister, by reason of the corruption of his owne nature, and the creeping nature of sinne, is in such daunger to be stained with the peoples pollutions, then let all Ministers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and vse all good meanes to dwell with a people <hi>as little polluted</hi> as may be: otherwise let him assure himselfe to be polluted with them, which is both a great discomfort to his owne conscience (as here it was to the Prophet) and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to his profession: for if it be a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of euery good professor of religion, <hi>to keepe himselfe vnspotted of the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.17.</note> then how much more is it the ministers du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie so to doe, and how foule a staine is it to the honour of his calling, to bee polluted in the common pollutions of his people?</p>
               <p>It may be therefore good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell to all godly Ministers in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and disposing of themselues, not to enquire onely how good a liuing such
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3042:56"/>
and such a place is, how wel seated, how healthfull, and beneficiall it will bee, (which are alas the common and almost the onely questions now adayes) but principally, to regard what a people they be: and how affected, amongst whom they are to liue: if godly and well disposed, or at least tractable and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and willing to be taught, then lesse to regard other incommodities: but if wicked, &amp; prophane, or (which is worse) stubborne, froward, &amp; vntractable, then lesse to regard the greatest co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities: and certainly if this point be wel consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of, and how bitter it hath bene in the end to many who haue not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, it will appeare, that this is the best encourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or discouragement, the greatest commoditie, or discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, and the best reason, either to winne a man to a place, or to drawe him from it, how good soeuer it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes: they that neglect this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and are ledde (or misled rather) with carnall and worldly respects, how iust

is it vpon them when they are made to cry in the sorrowe of their soule, <hi>Woe is me, I dwell in the midst of a people of pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lippes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here such Ministers as haue <hi>poore liuings, but good people,</hi> let them not faint nor bee discouraged, they haue more cause to blesse God, then to bee grieued, for doubtlesse they are farre better then those who haue <hi>great liuings,</hi> and <hi>an euill people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as for those to whom God hath bene so good, as to bestowe vppon them, competent liuings, and a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and well disposed people, let them thinke themselues double blessed of God, and treble bound to honour God, and to doe good in his Church: and if such men goe not before their brethren in all Ministeriall care and dutie, their fault is aboue all mens, and they make themselues vnworthy of so great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Againe, if that a polluted people, pollutes their Minister, here is a good warning for all ministers to be wary and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3042:57"/>
choyse of their company, with whom they will most priuately conuerse: for, as on the one side they may not retire themselues into solitarinesse, nor sequester themselues from all societie with their people, (which is rather a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical and fantastical, then any way a religious practise: so of all men are they to be most carefull, that they doe not loosely and lauishly bestow themselues on al companies, as too many do in our Church, to the great scandell thereof, who care not with whom they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerse, but all companies, all places, all times, al sports and recreations, all meetings, all occasions, are one with them: but alas what maruel, though such men <hi>keepe not themselues vnspotted of the world,</hi> but proue too offensiue to their calling: for seeing the best men ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not liue with the best people, but they shal receiue some contagion from them, how carefully ought ordinary Ministers to make dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of men and meetings, times and places, and not diffusedly and carelesly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3042:57"/>
to thrust themselues into all: So doing shal they keepe their calling from much reproach, and preserue themselues from much pollution, which otherwise from their polluted people, they shal bee sure to receiue.</p>
               <p>And here people are to be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, not too sharpely to censure their Minister; though hee bee not so soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with them all, as it may be many would expect: for it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernes no man to be so wary of his companie and his sports, as it doth the Ministe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Lastly, here people are taught, not to be too sharpe condemners of those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, whose conuersations are not so vnblameable as were to be wished: for if they liue ill, generally the cause is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

And lamentable experience daily lets vs see, that where a people in a towne is giuen
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3042:58"/>
to drunkennesse, there the Minister, is either so for company, or at least too good a fellowe: where a people are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to contention, there the Minister hath too many suites: where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be popish, there the minister is too superstitious: where the people be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, there y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minister is no great clark: where the people are giuen to any great sinne, there the Minister generally is not cleare from the same pollution: and it is seene, that the best Ministers and most carefull of all, doe complaine bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly of the pollutions of their people: for that howsoeuer it may bee they es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape partaking with their sinnes: yet they alwaies finde, at the least a dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and decaying of Gods graces in themselues, where the people are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward and disobedient. If therefore a Minister liue with such a people, his case is pittifull and daungerous, for he walks in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> midst of nets &amp; snares, which are laide for him on euery side, and if he escape them (I meane, if he keep himself

And if this holy Prophet, feare so much the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God for his small pollutions, and yet liued amongst so wicked and polluted a people, then what heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and horror, shall be heaped on his soule, who cares not with how foule pollutions his life be stained, and yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth amongst a godly and well dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thus we haue the first cause of his feare, his own, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples pollutions.</p>

               <p>Wherein let vs first of all obserue the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3042:60"/>
connexion and dependance of these two causes, one vpon another: for as they are both ioyntly the cause of his feare, so one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in a sort the cause of another: he feareth, <hi>because of his own and his peoples sinnes, and because he sawe the Lord</hi>: but why is he <hi>afraid to see the Lord</hi>? the cause thereof is <hi>his owne and their sinnes,</hi> without which he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue beene affraid, but rather haue glorified to see the Lord: but his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science checking him, for some defect of dutie in his calling, therfore he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth at the least glimse of Gods glory. Here let vs marke the ground of his reason, which is this: <hi>That man that is in his sinnes, is not able to stand in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God</hi>: this is a generall and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truth, &amp; the reasons of it are; First, the contrarietie betwixt God, and the nature of sinne, it being the onely thing which offends him, &amp; which prouokes his wrath and iust displeasure: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a subiect cannot but be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, if he hap to come into the kings presence, with any thing about him

which the king hates, or cannot abide to see: so a man cannot but be extream astonisht, if hee know himselfe to bee in Gods presence with his sinnes, which Gods soule hateth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, sin makes a man indebted to God: for as the Lawe tyeth him first to obedience, so if he sinne and fayle in that, it bindes him to punishment: and the more a man sinneth, the deper is he in Gods debt. If then in this world, a man willingly indures not the sight of him, in whose debt he is; what maruell, though a poore sinner tremble at the presence of God, to whom he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faited soule and all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, sin is that which prouoketh God to wrath: therefore a sinfull man feareth the presence of God, as a traytor the face of the Prince or a malefactor of the Iudge. For these causes, a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man endures not Gods presence.</p>
               <p>Now Gods presence hath diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. First, God is present to our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when we think of him. 2. He is present, when wee name him, or heare
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3042:61"/>
him named or mentioned by others, and these are the furthest of: Thirdly, God is neerer vnto vs in the presence of his Ordinances, as his Word and Sacraments, and publike seruice in the Congregation: Fourthly, there is a most apparant and sensible presence of God, which shall be at the last Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when all men shall stand before him in his immediat presence, to receiue their iudgement. Now all these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences of God, are hatefull to a wicked man: for the first, a wicked man by his good will neuer thinkes of God, and if sometime a thought of God (like ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) flasheth in his minde, presently he quencheth it, as being a most vnwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and burdensome thought vnto him: therefore saith <hi>Dauid; The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked is so proud,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 10.4.</note> 
                  <hi>he careth not for God: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is God in all his thoughts</hi>: Nay, God himselfe is so litle thought on, by them, that they will willingly thinke of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that might bring GOD into their thoughts: as namely, Gods great workes of his wonderfull Iudgements:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3042:61"/>
of whom the same Prophet saith, in the same place;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 10.5</note> 
                  <hi>Thy Iudgements are farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, out of his sight.</hi> As if hee had sayd, he laboures to set them farre from the eye of his minde, that hee may neuer haue occasion to thinke of them, nor on God by them. That this is true for his thoughts, I haue endeuored thus to proue, by Gods owne testimonies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thoughts cannot be discerned by man. But alas, for the second; that is, for his wordes, that's too apparant in the sight of all men. For obserue it, and you shall neuer see a wicked man, by his good will haue God in his mouth, (vnlesse it bee to abuse his name, by swearing or blasphemie) nor willingly doth he heare any other man talke, or discourse largely of God, or of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and his Iustice; but such talke is tedious &amp; combersome vnto him: and if hee cannot breake it off with other discourse, then he sits as mute as a fish, and inwardly either frets with anger, or is tormented with feare. All this is true in <hi>Felix</hi> the Gouernour: who whilst
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3042:62"/>
                  <hi>Paul discoursed of righteousnesse,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And for the third, wee see daily wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, endure not Gods presence in the Church: for nothing is more troublesome vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, often praying, and much recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Sacrament: &amp; therfore they neuer come to the Church, nor receiue ofter then the Lawe layes vpon them: but further then that, as the Psalmist saith;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 14.4</note> 
                  <hi>they neuer call vpon God.</hi> But as for the last, that they feare and abhorre aboue all, they wish in their heart it may neuer be. And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it a token of a true beleeuer, and a holy man,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>to loue, and looke for the appearing of Iesus Christ.</hi> Whereupon it followeth, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so it is a signe of a wicked man, to feare the last Iudgement, &amp; to wish it might neuer be: And when it comes in deed, &amp; they see they cannot escape it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then do they? Euen <hi>cry to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3042:62"/>
of God:</hi> so fearefull and so hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is Gods presence to a sinfull man.</p>
               <p>Besides these, there is another way, whereby God sheweth his presence: and that is, by extraordinary reuelation of his glory immediately: which was vsual in the old Testament, as here to the Prophet, but now is not to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. But how terrible that is to the sinfull nature of man, appeares in this place: for if the Prophet a most holy man, whose conscience accused him, but of a fewe and small sinnes, yet thus cryes out, amazed &amp; affrighted, at the reuelation of some part of Gods glory: alas, how would they be terrified with it, whose consciences are burdened with great and grieuous sinnes, &amp; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance? Thus we see the ground of his reason, how true it is, that a man in his sinne, cannot cheerefully come, nor boldly stand in Gods presence.

                     </gap> holy ground:</hi> then how will God rebuke and checke the consciences of such carnall men, as carelesly &amp; carnally rush into the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, and to Gods holy Table, where God is present, in a farre more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manner then he was in the Bushe? And if they bee so to be blamed, who enter into this calling without feare and reuerence, then how much more faulty are they, who beeing Ministers, dare venture to preach, or minister the holy Sacraments, without holy and priuate preparation, and sanctification of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: but rush vpon them, as vpon common &amp; prophane actions? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3042:63"/>
God is present there, in a most holy and glorious maner: these men sure wil say, the Prophet heere was of too nice a conscience: but fearefully and terribly shall God appeare at last vnto such men,<note place="margin">The 2. vse.</note> as care not how they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in his holy presence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this sheweth the reason of the practise of al Christian churches: who vse to sing before the Sermon and after: namely, not for <hi>Decorum</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; to grace the action, but to sanctifie and to humble our selues, <hi>because then wee come befor Gods presence:</hi> they ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe not thinke reuerently enough of God, and his presence, who doe by their practise in any sort,<note place="margin">The 3. vse.</note> make way to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may here learne, the pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull case of those ministers, who are so presumptuous, as to exercise that holy function, &amp; yet remaine in their sinnes without repentance: what doe these men? they approach to the <hi>burning Bush, with their shooes on their feete:</hi> that is, <hi>into Gods presence in their sinnes</hi>: what shall come of it in the ende? surely, that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3042:64"/>
burning fire shal consume the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? the least sinnes, &amp; smallest negligences affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this holy Prophet, when he should go into Gods presence:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.16.</note> But these men dare come into the Sanctuarie of God; yea dare <hi>take Gods words in their mouth's,</hi> and <hi>yet hate to bee reformed,</hi> and <hi>doe cast the glorious Word of God behinde their backes,</hi> which they preach to others with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>heir mouthes: these men may wonder at this holy Prophets nicenes, or else al the world may wonder at their prophanenesse. A little pollution of his lippes, feared him to come into Gods presence: but these dare doe it, with eies, eares, lippes, feet, hands, heart, and all polluted: their eyes polluted, with carelesse looking at all vanities: their eares with hearing: and their lips with speaking, wanton &amp; wicked talke: their feete, with running into wicked company: their hands, with practizing, and their hearts, with deuising and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to all wickednesse.</p>
               <p>This is the cause, why the labours of such men are almost vnprofitable: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they dare come into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3042:64"/>
in their sinnes. In many places of our land, there is by Gods blessing much teaching, yet there is little refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, in the liues of the most: but contrariwise, some fall to Atheisme: some to Papisme: some into foule sinnes, not to be named amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
               <p>Where is the cause? surely not in the Gospel: nor in our doctrine, nor in the teaching of it; but one very principall cause is, many Ministers come into Gods presence, vnsanctified, &amp; in their sins: not caring how loosely they liue, in the face of their people: and therfore God in iustice, thogh he instanstly smite not them, with visible vengeance for their presumption: yet hee smites the people, with spirituall blindnesse, that they regard not their Doctrine, but looke at their liues, and doe rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the prophanenesse of the one, then the holinesse of the other. Ministers are such, in whome God will be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, therefore because they doe not so,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3042:65"/>
but dishonour him, by comming into his presence in their sinnes: therefore hee cannot abide them, nor giue any blessing to their labours.</p>
               <p>All ministers therfore, as they would see any fruite of their Ministerie, let them first sanctifie themselues, &amp; clense their hearts by repentance, afore they persume, to stand vp to rebuke sinne in others: else let them not thinke, that their golden words shall doe so much good, as their leaden liues shall doe hurt: and they may happe to confirme men, that already are conuerted, but hardly shall any such men, conuert any soules from Poperie or prophanesse. And it is a vaine conceite for men to imagine, there is any force in eloquence, or humane learning, to ouerthrow that sin in others, which ruleth and raigneth in themselues. Our Church, and all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed churches, may make vse of this doctrine: for it is the glory of a Church to haue their doctrine powerfull, &amp; ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall for the winning of soules, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concerneth them, to take order, as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3042:65"/>
well that their ministers be godly men, <hi>as good Schollers,</hi> &amp; their <hi>liues inoffensiue,</hi> as wel as their <hi>doctrine sound</hi>: or els they will find in wofull experience, that they pull downe as much with the one hand, as they build vp with the other.</p>
               <p>But most neerely this doctrine tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth ministers themselues: who must know, their case is most fearefull of all mens, if they come into Gods presence, in their prophanenesse: for as no man is more honourable, then a learned and holy Minister: so none more contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible in this world, none more misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for that to come, then he that by his loose &amp; lewde life, doth scandalize his doctrine: and let him assure himselfe, that for his presumption, in rushing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods presence in his sinnes, he shall in this world, be cast out as <hi>vnsauory salt, and troden downe of men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math</hi> 5.13.</note> with the foote of contempt: and in the world to come, he shall aboue all men cry out, in most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame torment of conscience; <hi>Wo is me, that my eyes must see the King and Lord of hostes:</hi> and so because hee would not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3042:66"/>
in this world, come into Gods presence in sanctification and holinesse: he shall therefore in feare and horror, bee haled into the presence of Gods glorie, at the last day: there to receiue the iust sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their condemnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The fourth vse for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note>Lastly, all painfull and godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters may receiue comfort, not to bee discouraged or driuen from Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, because of their corruptions or infirmities, for wee see it was the Prophets case: but let them still ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch in feare and reuerence, and be so farre from being driuen from their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, because they being sinfull men, dare not come into Gods presence without much feare: as let them contrariwise be assured, that the more they tremble at Gods presence here, the lesse shall they feare it at the last day: and when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and vngodly men, who in this world feared not to stand in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in their horrible sinnes, shal cry to the <hi>Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and hilles couer vs, and hide vs from the presence of God</hi>: then such Ministers as in this world in feare and trembling, and alwayes in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3042:66"/>
repentance, did approach into Gods presence: shall then <hi>looke vp, and lift vp their heads,</hi> &amp; shall say to the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, &amp; all the powers of heauen, helpe vs, and hasten vs to come into the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous presence of our God and Sauiour.</p>
               <p>And thus we see the manifold vse of this doctrine to our Church and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The second vse against the Papists.</note> Inasmuch as here the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in a conscience of his corruptions, feareth and cryeth out at <hi>the least appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of Gods glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vanitie and false dealing of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is here discouered, in whose <hi>Lege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds</hi> &amp; stories of their Saints, nothing is more common then appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from heauen, of Saints departed: of glorious Angels of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> (and that so familiarly, as sometime she sang with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their Cell, kissed some of them, and let them sucke her brests). Nay, of God himselfe: and especially of our Sauiour <hi>Christ Iesus:</hi> who they say, appeared (I know not how oft) to one man: namely, to Saint <hi>Francis</hi>:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3042:67"/>
and appeared as hee was crucified with his woundes, and imprinting those woundes of his, in <hi>Francis</hi> his body, which they say he bare all his life, and that they bled whensoeuer hee would suffer them, which he alwayes did on <hi>Good Fryday,</hi> that he might bee like to Christ. This, and many more such, may you see in that fabulous &amp; blasphemous book, of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formities of Saint <hi>Francis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the matter: are apparitions from heauen so ordinary in the popish Church? how then came it to passe, that the greatest and holiest men in the olde Testament, were so amazed at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apparition but of an Angell: as wee may see in the whole course of the Storie? Some ranne away, and hidde themselues: some couered their faces, some fell downe flat on the ground: and the Prophets <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere cryed out; <hi>Woe is mee, I am vndone</hi>: my eyes haue seene the King and Lord of Hostes. But in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> looke the stories, that Saint or Monke is no body that hath not had some
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3042:67"/>
apparition: either of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> or some of the Apostles, or an Angel, or Christ Iesus appearing &amp; talking with them: and yet alas, <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn, those</hi> 3. <hi>great pillers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gala.</hi> 2.9.</note> they were as good <hi>as beside themselues</hi> at the appearing of a <hi>little part of the glorie of Christ</hi> in his transfiguration.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Either therefore must it followe that these men haue no sinne in them, which dare and can behold Gods glory so easily, and so ordinarily, (which is impossible): or rather which indeede is truth, it appeares that these are but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull fancies and forgeries of their owne deuise, to deceiue the world, and to magnifie themselues before the eyes of the common people: for it is first of all most <hi>false,</hi> that apparitions are so common as they make them, for if they were, then are they more ordinary in the new Testament then in the old. For whereas the scripture hath one, their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions haue 20. and whereas one, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saint <hi>Paul, was once rapt into heauen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12</note> they haue 20. that were rapt thither:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3042:68"/>
And as that is false, so is it <hi>impossible</hi> that any man cloathed with fleshe can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure an extraordinary apparition of Gods glory, without extreame amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as is plaine here in the Prophet: who I hope was as holy a man as the holiest monke, that euer was. I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this, that yong Diuines may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned to looke a little into their fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious legends, that so they may discouer the false trickes, and iuggling casts of that religion: which euil shifts it needed not, if it were of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the people may here learne; <hi>First,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 <hi>Vse.</hi> to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> in that <hi>Gods presence is so glorious and fearefull to mans nature,</hi> how merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully God hath delt with them, in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them not by himselfe, or by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels from heauen, which they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer endure; but by men, who are like themselues: and how vaine and fond these men are, who would be taught <hi>from heauen,</hi> and not <hi>by men,</hi> who are so ful of wants. In the old Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, when the people receiued the lawe from Gods owne mouth, it is said, they ranne away

               <p>The first circumstance,<note place="margin">1 Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the time.</note> is the time when this Prophet was comforted and raised from his feare. <hi>Then</hi> saith the text: that is, after his feare and astonishment, but not afore. Thus dealt God alwaies with all his Saints, he bestoweth no <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> on them pertaining to saluation, but after he hath by some meanes or other brought them to true <hi>humiliation</hi> in themselues, and to sorrow for their sins: Humiliation is the preparatiue for grace: for when by sight and sence of their sinnes, and their owne misery by sin, hee hath euen driuen them quite
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3042:71"/>
out of themselues, finding nothing in themselues, but cause of feare and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, then powres hee the oyle of grace, and of sweete comfort into their hearts, and refresheth their weary soules with the deawe of his mercy: this point needes no further proofe, for looke into the scriptures, and wee shall finde, God neuer called any man to the state of grace, or to any notable worke or fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in his church, but he first humbled them, and then brought them out of all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit with themselues, &amp; then wrought <hi>in them, and by them,</hi> his wonderfull workes.</p>
               <p>The vse of this doctrine, is first of all to teach <hi>all men,</hi>

Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Minister.</note> that is, <hi>an Angell</hi> of that order so called: out of which we learne,</p>
               <p>First, that there are diuers degrees &amp; seuerall orders of Angels, though wee knowe not the true distinction thereof: nor thinke it lawful to imagine them to be 9. nor to set them down particularly, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, who make many of their owne deuises, which they cal traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, of equal authority with the scriptures.

               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:3042:73"/>Thirdly, that they are also by the merciful appointment of God,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>the guard of Gods children,</hi> and ministring spirits sent out, as it were with a commission, <hi>for the good of the elect.</hi> All these points because they are plaine in the scripture, and do lesse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne our general scope, which is concerning the Ministery, I passe them ouer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, here it is appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that as the Angels are sent out for the help and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the elect: so <hi>specially of Gods mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> as is plaine in this place, where the Prophet being afrighted, <hi>a holy Angel</hi> is ready to giue him comfort: and so ouer the whole course of the Prophets: and at this day, their protection, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable assistance, is no lesse present to the godly Ministers of the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though not in such sencible signes, and such visible manner, as in the olde: for if they bee ministring spirits, sent out for the good <hi>of them which shal bee saued,</hi> howe much more for their good, which shall <hi>both bee saued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and saue others also.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:3042:73"/>A doctrine of great comfort, and much good vse to all Ministers: who first of all may here learne contentment in their calling: for howsoeuer no calling hath <hi>more crosses,</hi> so none againe hath <hi>more comforts</hi>: and howsoeuer none bee more disgraced <hi>by euill men,</hi> yet none is more honoured <hi>by the holy Angels</hi>: and howsoeuer in this world they aboue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny calling, are <hi>seruants to all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> yet none hath the <hi>seruice</hi> &amp; attendance <hi>of Angels</hi> so much as they: for though wee haue them not to helpe vs to do the outward actions of our ministery with vs, or for vs, (as some Popish Doctors teach, that in their Masse, <hi>Amen</hi> is not said to one collect, because the Angels say <hi>Amen</hi> to it) yet doubtlesse they are prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alwaies, as at all holy exercises and lawfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so especially at the publike seruice of God, performed by the Ministers: and beside that, they are <hi>witnesses thereto,</hi> and of the paines, and diligence, and faithfulnesse of a good Minister, they also <hi>do Minister</hi> vnto them oftentimes bodily strength, and assistance, &amp; many

               <p>First, if any aske, whence comes it that <hi>Angels</hi> performe more seruice to good <hi>Ministers</hi> then to other men: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, the reason is partly from God, partly from the <hi>Angels</hi>: first God hath a principall care of them aboue other men, because they worke his worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other callings: for their labours immediately co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne the good of mens soules: whereas others, do first concerne the bodie, and consequently the soule: therefore,<note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, because the <hi>Ministers</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is, to conuert and saue soules, being a work, which (next to the glorifying of God, and doing his will) the <hi>Angels</hi> doe take most delight in aboue any other: for if they <hi>bee sent out for the good of them which shal be saued,</hi>

vppon the Kings <hi>throne</hi>? will nothing serue him, but the <hi>Crowne and Scepter</hi>? so cannot Angels be honoured, vnlesse they be made <hi>Gods, or Sauiours, or Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators</hi>? I answere therfore, we dare not go so farre, least we remember the seruant so much, that we forget the Maister: but rather we answere thus: seeing Angels are thus seruiceable to Gods Ministers, it should first of all, teach all men to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that Calling, with all due reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: For they cannot but please the <hi>angels,</hi> in honouring good <hi>Ministers,</hi> whom they esteeme their <hi>fellowes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it should teach all mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, not to content themselues with the name and tytle, but to labour to be good and faithfull. For so doing, they are <hi>fellowes</hi> to the Angels, and it is a disgrace to the Angels, when those that are their <hi>fellowes</hi> are vnfaithfull.</p>
               <p>And it should further teach them, to adorne their Calling with a holy life, for as sinne is that, that grieues the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> and driues them away, so it is grace and holinesse, which makes them
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3042:76"/>
                  <hi>delight</hi> in the fellowship of men.</p>
               <p>And it may also encourage any man, to take paines in that holy Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, wherein hee is sure to haue <hi>Gods angels,</hi> in a speciall manner to attende him, to assist him, to protect him, and to bee a witnesse of his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and who would not worke cheerfully in that labour, wherein hee hath the Angels to bee in a sort <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-workers</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>To doe these three duties, is to <hi>honour good angels</hi>: and that <hi>Minister</hi> that conscionably performeth them, the <hi>angels</hi> will take themselues suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently honoured of that man.</p>
               <p>And if beside this <hi>honour,</hi> wee would <hi>reioyce Gods angels,</hi> and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster matter of <hi>ioy</hi> vnto them, then in the fourth place, let all <hi>Ministers</hi> propounde to themselues aboue all things, <hi>the conuersion of soules,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then their own praise, or liuing, or pleasing of men, and so endeuour it both in teaching, and all their other courses, that the <hi>angels</hi> may see it, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3042:77"/>
be witnesse of it: for if they reioyce at the <hi>conuersion of a sinner,</hi> (as Christ saith they doe) then those men make them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <hi>reioyce,</hi> which doe most seriously aime at the <hi>conuersion of sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus we see, both the seruice of <hi>Angels</hi> to Gods <hi>Ministers,</hi> and the duties they are to performe to them in that regard. The due consideration of this point, may raise <hi>the world</hi> to a better conceit of this <hi>Calling,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade <hi>fathers</hi> to dedicate their sonnes to it, and stirre vp <hi>yong Students</hi> to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate themselues thereto, &amp; turne their studies to that end: for no man in no cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hath so speciall attendance, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of Gods <hi>Angels,</hi> as godly <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> haue: At least, if it worke not this <hi>in the world,</hi> yet it may yeeld com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and contentment to all faith <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> in their painfull calling.</p>
               <p>But let vs see how the <hi>Angel</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his seruice to the Prophet: not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, not lingeringly, but <hi>speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>: so saith the Text.</p>

               <p>Secondly, we see here how great loue <hi>angels</hi> beare vnto Gods children, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vnto godly <hi>Ministers,</hi> how <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly</hi> they are imployed to doe them good. <hi>Willingnesse</hi> and readinesse to doe good to any man, must needes come from <hi>loue:</hi> and yet alas all men, euen the

                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:3042:79"/>
this must teach <hi>them</hi> further.</p>
               <p>First, euery one to labour to bee a <hi>good Minister,</hi> for then are they sure of the loue of <hi>angels,</hi> and then most <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly</hi> doe the <hi>angels</hi> any seruice to them.

               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:3042:80"/>First, see how God magnifieth <hi>meanes</hi>: hee <hi>can</hi> worke without them, and so he did in the Creation, giuing <hi>light</hi> to the world,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>from</hi> 4. <hi>to</hi> 17.</note> diuers dayes <hi>before there was Sunne</hi>: but since the order of nature was established, hee <hi>generally</hi> vseth meanes, not onely in his <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but euen in his <hi>miraculous</hi> actions: and though hee vse not alwayes the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie</hi> and direct <hi>meanes</hi>: yet <hi>meanes</hi> hee generally vseth, though they seeme <hi>contrary</hi>: as heere in this place, and the same will bee found true in almost all the miracles, both of the Old and New Testament.</p>
               <p>This therefore commends vnto all men, the vse of such good <hi>meanes,</hi> as Gods prouidence hath ordained of any duties, or effecting of any thing, that doth belong vnto vs to doe: and not to depend vppon <hi>immediate</hi> helpes from <hi>Heauen,</hi> as many fonde and fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call men doe, who are therefore often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times iustly forsaken of GOD, and left destitute of all helpe; and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3042:80"/>
to shame and reproach.</p>
               <p>Secondly, see here the mightie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Gods <hi>ordinance,</hi> how it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in <hi>weakenesse</hi>: such are all his great workes. In the <hi>Creation,</hi> hee brought <hi>light</hi> out of <hi>darknesse.</hi> In our <hi>Redemption,</hi> hee brought vs <hi>life</hi> out of <hi>death.</hi> In our <hi>Conuersions,</hi> hee workes vpon vs by his <hi>Worde,</hi> and by it hee drawes vs <hi>to him,</hi> which in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son would driue vs <hi>from him</hi>: and by it <hi>confounds</hi> the wisedome of the worlde, which is starke <hi>foolishnesse</hi> to the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Lord.</p>
               <p>And so heere, hee cleanseth the Prophet by <hi>a Coale of fire:</hi> which would rather defile him, and <hi>seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> his mouth with it, which in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should haue <hi>burnd</hi> him: so great, so admirable, and so powerfull are the <hi>ordinances</hi> of GOD, though they seeme neuer so contrarie, or so weake in themselues, or in their meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:3042:81"/>Let this teach al men not to contemne the Sacraments, though the outward Elements, Bread, Wine, and Water, bee weake and common, and dead creatures in themselues: nor the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of the <hi>Word,</hi> though it bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised by a weake man, mortall and miserable as others are: for that God, which can season the Prophets mouth, and clense his heart by <hi>a coale of fire,</hi> no maruell though hee worke vppon the consciences of men, by his <hi>word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And againe, when we see <hi>Grace and Holinesse</hi> conueyed into mens hearts by the <hi>Word and Sacraments</hi>: let vs learne, not to ascribe it to the dignitie, either of the <hi>Minister,</hi> or the <hi>Elements,</hi> but to the supreme power of the mighty God, who can purge the Prophet, by <hi>a coale from the Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is it altogether without <hi>Miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> that God here sanctifieth the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> by touching his lippes with <hi>a fierie coale</hi>: for it <hi>signifieth,</hi> that the apt and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <hi>teacher,</hi> must haue <hi>a fierie tongue,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This shewes apparantly that those <hi>Ministers</hi> neuer had their lips touched with <hi>a coale from Gods altar</hi>: that is, their consciences neuer touched, nor their soules seasoned with the sanctifying <hi>grace of Gods spirit,</hi> which sit still and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But when this comes to bee wayed in the ballance of a good conscience, it will bee found, that not the <hi>pleasing</hi> tongue, but the <hi>fierie tongue,</hi> is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall grace of a good <hi>Minister.</hi>

               <q>Taken from the Altar.</q>
               <p>This <hi>coale of fire</hi> was taken by the <hi>angel</hi> from the <hi>altar of God,</hi> where was a fire which neuer went out, and this fire was that, that <hi>came from heauen</hi>: sent downe by God, at the dedication of the Temple by <hi>Salomon.</hi> And this fire kindled by God neuer went out: for no man could kindle the like, but all other was counted <hi>strange</hi> fire; As <hi>Nadab, and Abihu, tryed in wofull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when they would needes offer with it.</hi>

there were not a great <hi>scarcitie</hi> of such men, the Lorde needed not aske this question.

if it bee so, leauing the reformation thereof to those Churches and States whom it may concerne: I answere, for the matter in hand, that this may be so, and yet the Lorde may complaine as here hee doth. Whom shall I send? for the Lord meaneth not such as beare the name of <hi>Leuites or Priestes</hi> in the olde, or of <hi>Ministers</hi> in the newe: for there were alwayes more of them: who, some for preferment sake, some for their ease, and some for a refuge how to liue, are willing to enter that function, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in that calling, seeke not the Lord, but themselues, and their owne ends.</p>

               <p>In the meane time, till God put into the hearts of <hi>Parliaments, and Princes,</hi> to looke to this great and needfull worke; let vs <hi>Ministers</hi> learne our duties: and first, wee who are in the <hi>Vniuersities,</hi> are here admonished to look to our selues.

Oh, but say they, these <hi>motions</hi> are from Gods spirit: sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they can say litle for themselues, who cannot say so much: but that cannot serue their turne: for if we say contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise nay, but they are from the diuell, or at the least from your owne vanitie and pride, how can they disproue it! Againe, might not the <hi>Prophet</hi> haue alledged that with a better pretence and colour then they? yet he stayeth till God here call him: euen so all good
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3042:91"/>
Ministers are to stay Gods calling.</p>
               <p>If any aske, how he shall know when <hi>God calles him? I</hi> answere, God calleth ordinarily by his <hi>Church,</hi> her voice is his: therefore whensoeuer the <hi>Church</hi> of God, saith vnto thee, thou shalt bee <hi>sent,</hi> and thou shalt <hi>goe for vs,</hi> euen then doth the Lorde <hi>call</hi> vs out to this holy function.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let vs obserue how the Lord saith: <hi>Who shal</hi> (I) send, <hi>&amp; who shal go for (vs)?</hi> Some Interpreters gather out of this Chapter, an Argument for the Trinitie of persons; as namely, out of the third Verse, where the Angels sing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God, &amp;c.</hi> But it is not sound inough to ouerthrowe our stubborne enemies the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it seemes those Diuines are of a sounder and wiser iudgement: who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we haue other places pregnant and plaine enough, therefore thinke it no good discreetio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vrge this or any such place which may probably admit ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Interpretation, least that the <hi>Iewes</hi> finding the weaknesse of the argument,

doe iudge all our proofes to be as weak, and so take occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to persist the rather in their blindnesse, by that which wee brought to haue conuerted them. And as for that song of the <hi>Angels</hi> in the third Verse, where they ascribe holinesse to the Lord three times: that their repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion signifieth nothing else, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ioy and delight which the holy <hi>Angels</hi> take in praising of God, who cannot satisfie themselues in honouring his name: teaching vs in their example, neuer to bee weary of <hi>praysing</hi> God by prayers and holy hymnes, and of <hi>ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But to proue out of the words; <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> the three Persons in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, seemes to bee no fit nor sound col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Rather in my opinion, we may safely collect and conclude out of these words (I and vs) that there are more persons in the <hi>Trinitie</hi> then one: for first, God the Father, or the whole Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie saith: <hi>Whom shall I send?</hi> and then changing the number, he saith: <hi>Who shal goe for vs?</hi> For howsoeuer God may
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3042:92"/>
imploy in the word <hi>Vs,</hi> that hee that is sent to preach, is sent as well for the good of the Church, as for his owne glory, yet can it not bee denied, but that the plurall number here, and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, ascribed to the Deity, must needs argue a certaine pluralitie of pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Out of the euidence of which places, seeing the enemies of this doctrine must needs graunt a pluralitie, namely, that there are more then one: then wee shal sufficiently proue out of other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by other arguments, that there are three.</p>
               <p>In the last place, let vs marke what God saith: Whom shal <hi>I</hi> send, and who shal go <hi>for vs?

               <p>If they be <hi>Gods seruants,</hi> then are they not <hi>their owne</hi> Maisters, they haue a Maister, euen God, whose they are, and <hi>for whom,</hi> and from whom they come: they may not therefore please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, nor serue their owne pleasures, nor seeke the satisfying of the their own carnall lustes, either in matter of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,

credite, or profite: if they do then euill, he calls them to a heauie account, whose seruants they are.</p>
               <p>Againe, if they bee Gods seruants, then let them doe their seruice to God, and expect their reward from God: some Ministers will expect the reward, and honour of Gods seruants, but will doe no seruice: that beseemes not ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: let such men remember <hi>for whom</hi> they come, euen from that God, who as he can giue reward: so he will expect seruice.</p>
               <p>And as for such men as painfully do their seruice, but are not regarded nor rewarded of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they deserue, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be content, &amp; continue in their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for they are <hi>Gods Ambassadors</hi>: and we know Ambassadors may haue <hi>gifts</hi> giuen them, of those to whom they are sent: but they expect their <hi>mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> from the kings their owne Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: So the <hi>maintenance</hi> which the world should giue Ministers, is like <hi>gifts</hi> giuen to Ambassadors: if it come, it is no more then they deserue.

               <p>Thirdly, if they be <hi>Gods Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,</hi> sent by him, and come from and for him, then let all such as either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, or any way iniurie them, be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that as God is mightie &amp; power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, so he will mightily reuenge it.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, seeing they are <hi>Gods Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers &amp; seruants,</hi> they must not be the seruants of men, to please, or flatter, or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3042:94"/>
satisfie humours, this is not for them that are Gods seruants: they therefore that will bee slaues to the persons, and pleasures, and humours of men, they forget that they are Gods seruants, and came <hi>for him</hi>: yea, they must not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour the pleasing of themselues, nor the bringing of their owne purposes to passe, but in euery motions either made to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by others; or suggested fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne hearts, they must forth with call to mind, <hi>Who sent me hither, &amp; for whom am</hi> I <hi>come</hi>? Euen from and for God: therefore they are to yeeld to nothing, nor ayme at any thing but which may be both to the will, and for the glory of him that sent them.</p>
               <p>And if the great men of this world, doe thinke it wrong that any man should command <hi>their</hi> seruant against their will, or expect any seruice from them against their <hi>owne</hi> honour: then let them thinke it reason that <hi>Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> should not bee commanded any thing contrary to Gods will, or against <hi>his</hi> honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:3042:95"/>And lastly, if ministers bee <hi>Gods seruants,</hi> then let them regard their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters glorie, and be ashamed to doe any thing, either in their doctrine or liues, which may dishonour him: that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant is vnworthy of a <hi>good Maister,</hi> who seekes not his Maisters credite in all his courses.</p>
               <p>And againe, if they bee Gods Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, then must they not deliuer their owne fancies, or inuentions, but that message they receiued: And as they receiued it, so must they better it. And if they doe their duties faithfully, this doctrine is comfortable to them, they <hi>take paines,</hi> with ioy they haue a Maister will <hi>reward</hi> them: they may <hi>speake free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> (so it be with discretion) they haue a Maister will <hi>make it good</hi>: they may <hi>stand boldly</hi> in the face of their enemies, they haue a Maister will <hi>defend them.</hi> And euery faithfull <hi>Minister</hi> may say to himselfe, <hi>I</hi> will doe my dutie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer my ambassage. <hi>He whom I serue, and whose I am: He who sent me, and for whom I come,</hi> will beare me out.

And thus much of the inquirie which God makes, and the manner of it.</p>
               <p>Now let vs see the answere which the Prophet makes, in these words.<note place="margin">2 The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then I sayd, Here am I: send me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prophet after hee was comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, and had his sinnes forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, then answereth; <hi>Here am I, send me.</hi> First marke heere, what a great change is wrought on the suddaine: he who a little afore, feared and shrunke at the least appearance of Gods glorie: Now stands forth boldly, as soone as he is called, and answereth; <hi>Heere am I, send me:</hi> So great a matter is it for a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to haue his sinnes forgiuen, and to feele the fauour of God to his soule and conscience. Here therefore wee haue an answer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to two great Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, often moued in the world.</p>
               <p>First, many would haue quietnesse of minde, and peace of conscience, and cannot attaine vnto it; If they aske how they might, to them I answere; Here is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3042:96"/>
the way, seeke it not in worldly wealth, carnall pleasures, nor humane learning, in companie nor recreations: but seeke it in the fauour of God, and pardon of thy sinnes, and thou shalt not misse of it. Thus shalt thou haue comfort in thy owne conscience, courage before men, and boldnesse toward God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, many Students in Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, would gladly be <hi>Ministers,</hi> and doe much honour the Calling: but they finde a feare and shrinking in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and thereby an vnwillingnesse to venter vpon it. If they aske, how they amend this: <hi>I</hi> answere, (or rather the example of his <hi>Prophet</hi> answereth for me); Let that man set himselfe in Gods presence, enter into himselfe, search his conscience, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nde out his sinnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse and bewayle them to God, craue pardon in <hi>Christes blood,</hi> and grace to leaue them, and cease not till hee heare the voyce of Gods spirit sounding in his conscience: <hi>Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then when God shall aske whom
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3042:96"/>
shall send, thou wilt answere readily, and with ioy, <hi>Heere am I, send me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And againe, many are driuen from this calling, to behold the contempt and reproch, and daungers which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto it. But let those men marke heere the phrase of this holy <hi>Prophet</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when God asked, <hi>Whom shall I sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e?</hi> Hee might haue answered: Lorde, <hi>I</hi> would goe, but such disgraces and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements doe accompany this Function, as <hi>I</hi> desire to bee excused: but hee casting aside all such conceits, answereth peremptorily, <hi>Heere am I, send mee.</hi> How came this to pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, for certainly the Prophet was as sensible of these wrongs as any of vs all, for he was nobly borne and brought vp, and was of the blood royall: surely, because hee sawe he was in Gods fauour, hee had him and his Commission on his side, and he held this for a sure ground: <hi>If God be on my side, who can be against mee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore doubtlesse, those men who are driuen backe by these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, were neuer setled in assurance that their <hi>sinnes were forgiuen</hi>:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3042:97"/>
nor satisfied sufficiently, that <hi>God is on the side of all good Ministers,</hi> and that, that calling as it hath his authoritie from God, so likewise, allowance, blessing, assistance, and defence of GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue any other calling: for if they were, they would scorne the storme, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the contempt of the prophane world, and with much courage and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, set their hand to Gods Plough, and say with the Prophet; <hi>Here I am, send me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, let vs obserue, how the Prophet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God askes the question, sends him not to <hi>others,</hi> nor commends <hi>others</hi> to that seruice, as is to be thought hee might haue done many in the Churches of the Iewes, but offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>Heere am I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It controlles the carnall courses of many amongst vs in the <hi>Vniuersities,</hi> who thinke it sufficient to liue there, and send out other men, and giue testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Letters of commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to other men, but themselues stirre not: when question is made; <hi>Who shall
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3042:97"/>
goe to such a place? or who shall be sent to such a Parish?</hi> they say not, <hi>Here am I,</hi> but either it is <hi>too little</hi> a liuing, or <hi>too great</hi> a charge, or <hi>ill seated,</hi> or some fault it hath, that they will not bee sent to it: but will answere God and his Church, there is such a man, and giue him Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of testimonie, or commendation, and so all is well: but for themselues, they liue too sweet and easie liues, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to vndertake the attempt and burden of the <hi>Ministerie.</hi> Let such men therefore learne, when God and his Church giue them a calling, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere with the Prophet: <hi>Heere am I, send me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And let all such as are <hi>Students</hi> of Diuinitie in the <hi>Vniuersities,</hi> marke here the Prophets answere, not I <hi>will</hi> bee ready, but <hi>here I am</hi>; why takes hee no longer time? because hee was now suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently qualified. Where let them learne, not to linger and lye rioting too long in their <hi>spec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that calling: let them shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues willing and readie to yeeld their seruice to the <hi>Church,</hi> when they shall be called. For as an Apple may as well hang too long on the tree, as bee puld too soone, and both make it vnfit for vse: so may men as well stay too long, as goe out too soone: and both wayes are made vnprofitable, or at least lesse profitable in the Church.</p>
               <p>And to conclude this second point; It is not vnworthy to be noted, that the <hi>Prophet</hi> saith not, <hi>Here I am</hi>: and <hi>I</hi> runne on my owne head, but, <hi>Send me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee willes the Lorde to send him: then where are they who dare bragge of their priuate motions, and will runne when they are not sent?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prophet</hi> might haue said; Oh, now <hi>I</hi> feele a motion from the Spirit, therfore <hi>I</hi> will goe and preach: but he stayeth till he <hi>be sent</hi> in expresse tearms: Let no man therfore presume to presse into this function, till he bee fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued in his conscience, that God and his Church hath said vnto him, <hi>Goe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:3042:98"/>And though a man be neuer so well qualified with all maner of sufficiency, yet let him sit still and stay Gods lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and let him say, <hi>Here I am, send me:</hi> and so rest contented vntill he bee sent. If any man say it is vnfit that a man should say so of himselfe; <hi>I</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, let him not say so in wordes, but in deeds: let him therefore make proofe of himselfe, and giue the Church tryall of his gifts. Vpon which experience of his gifts, if he be found sufficient, that practise of his is all one, and much more then if hee had said, <hi>Heere I am, send me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus wee see the Prophet would not stirre till he were sent, and therefore in the next words, he is bid to <hi>Goe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he sayd, Goe and speake vnto this people.</hi>

presented himselfe, and offered his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice) God both giues him leaue to goe, and further doth furnish him with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, both to goe and speake.</p>
               <p>Wherein the principall point is, that the <hi>authoritie</hi> of the Prophets calling, is deriued from <hi>God him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>fe,</hi> in plaine and euident words; <hi>Goe and speake</hi>: and till <hi>then</hi> the Prophet went not. So in the Newe Testament,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> the Apostles went not into the world to preach, till they had their Commission: <hi>Goe and teach all Nations.</hi> And after them, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preached not, till it was said vnto him, <hi>Arise, and goe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all which is discouered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the pride and presumption of those who dare run on their own heads, and will not stay till the Lord say vnto them: <hi>Goe, and speake.</hi> These men are bolder, then either the extraordinarie <hi>Prophets</hi> of the olde Testament, or the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which are the extraordinary Ministers of the New: who alwaies had their warrant with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they went. And if any man aske why is it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3042:99"/>
they should haue so; <hi>I</hi> answere, the reasons are many.</p>
               <p>First, all <hi>Prophets and Ministers,</hi> are Gods Deputies and Commissioners, it is therefore reason that they haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie from their Lord and Maister.</p>
               <p>Secondly, their wordes nor deedes beare no credite, nor haue any power in them, vnlesse they be spoken <hi>by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Commission</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor haue their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours any blessing: vnlesse <hi>God giue it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, these <hi>persons</hi> haue no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, nor safetie, vnlesse they bee <hi>Gods Ambassadors:</hi> and how are they so, vnlesse they be called and sent by God, and haue authoritie giuen of God? For these causes, no man is to thrust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into the <hi>Ministerie,</hi> without a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from God, and therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, though those men who will bee <hi>Chusers,</hi> and <hi>Callers</hi> of themselues, and run when they are not sent, bee in their <hi>persons,</hi> subiect to all dangers: because they are out of Gods <hi>protection,</hi> &amp; their <hi>labours</hi> without profite because no bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, nor <hi>promise</hi> of God was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto

them: for GOD may iustly say vnto them: Let <hi>him that sent you,</hi> protect your persons: let <hi>him that sent you,</hi> blesse your labours.</p>
               <p>But it will then bee demaunded, how may <hi>I</hi> know if <hi>God</hi> bid mee <hi>goe</hi>: God speakes not now from heauen as in old time, and as to this Prophet: I answere, It is true, we are to looke for no such <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, nor apparitions</hi> from heauen, for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily there are none such, and the <hi>Popish Church</hi> doth but deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and cozen the world, who tell vs of so many apparitions that happen to their <hi>Monkes and Fryers</hi>: for now or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, God speaketh in another ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to his Church: for in Generall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties God speaketh to vs out of his <hi>word</hi> and holy Scriptures, and in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If therefore thy owne <hi>conscience</hi> tell thee vpon true examination, that thou doest not loue and affect this calling aboue any other, then God sends thee not: and if thou enter with such a testimonie, <hi>not God</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but some wordly and sinister respect doth send thee, and put thee forward:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3042:101"/>
for though thou doest <hi>desire</hi> it, yet if the <hi>Church</hi> of God giue not allowance of sufficiency, <hi>God</hi> doth not send thee: But if contrariwise, thy <hi>conscience</hi> do tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly testifie vnto thee, that thou desirest to doe seruice to God and his Church, in this calling aboue any other: And if withal, vpon signification hereof to the <hi>Church,</hi> and vpon trial made of thy gifts &amp; sufffciency, the Church (that is, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned, wise, and godly, and such as the Church hath publikely appointed for that purpose) do <hi>approue</hi> of that they desire, and of thy <hi>sufficiencie</hi> to doe God seruice in his <hi>Ministery,</hi> and thereupon by a publike <hi>Calling,</hi> bid thee <hi>goe,</hi> then assuredly God himselfe hath bid thee <hi>goe.</hi> And it is as effectuall a calling, as if thou heardst the voyce of God fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: for as in <hi>Repentance,</hi> If thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tell thee thou hast truly repented, and if thou canst make that knowne to the Church by so good euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon a <hi>Minister</hi> of God pronounceth the pardon of thy sins vnto the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> If thou restest herein, &amp; knowest it to bee as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3042:101"/>
as if <hi>God</hi> from heauen had tolde thee, <hi>thy sinnes are pardoned.</hi> So is it here, if thou hast the testimonie, first of thy <hi>conscience,</hi> and then of the <hi>Church,</hi> thou art to rest therein, as in the voice of God: And this is the <hi>calling</hi> that we are to looke for in these dayes.</p>
               <p>By which doctrine, as those are iustly condemned of foule <hi>presumption,</hi> who dare runne vpon priuate motions, and carnall respects, and are iustly left without <hi>blessing or protection</hi>: so they on the other side, doe offer great <hi>wrong to God</hi> and to his <hi>Church,</hi> who when they cannot deny, but they <hi>affect</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie aboue any calling, and haue <hi>approbation</hi> of their giftes from the good Church, yet will not beleeue the Testimonie of the <hi>Church</hi> herein, but their owne priuate <hi>Iudgements,</hi> which in this case is no way a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Iudge, either for, or against.

               <p>Nowe then (to drawe to an ende) let vs obserue in the last place, with what <hi>authoritie</hi> a Minister of God comes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and executes his Function: euen with an immediate authoritie &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from God: whereby he is bid, <hi>Goe, and speake.</hi> If it bee so, let it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade <hi>the world,</hi> to feare to doe any wrong, either to that calling, as to those persons who come with so faire a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from <hi>God himselfe.</hi> But if it doe not perswade the prophane worlde, at least let this be a comfort &amp; encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all true <hi>Ministers,</hi> for if <hi>God</hi> bid them <hi>goe</hi> he will <hi>goe</hi> with them <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: If hee send</hi> them, he will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake them, but <hi>assist</hi> them, and <hi>blesse</hi> them, and <hi>open</hi> their mouthes, and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large</hi> their hearts, and <hi>harden</hi> their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, and giue <hi>power</hi> vnto their words to conuert his children, &amp; to confound and astonish the hearts of his enemies.
