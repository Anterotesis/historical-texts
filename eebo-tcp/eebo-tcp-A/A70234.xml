            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Propoſals for Promoting the <hi>Woollen-Manufactory,</hi> promoted.</head>
            <p>NExt to being the Authors of profitable Inventions our ſelves, 'tis certainly moſt commendable to Incourage them in others, and endeavour, That what is happily found out, may be advantageouſly proſecuted. Men are grown to a wretched paſs indeed, when, as <hi>Cicero</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they leave off, <hi>Non ſolum laudanda facere, ſed etiam laudare</hi>; Not only to do Praiſe-worthy Acts, but even to Commend them; Let us at leaſt ſpeak well of good Expedients, give the Labouring Promoters of Publick Weal our good word, and afford Induſtry a Tribute from our Tongues, though we are ſomewhat loth to allow her much from our Hands; To improve ſuch effectual Expedients as will moſt reclaim Vice, and bring all Idle hands to Induſtry. To increaſe our richeſt Manufactories for Exportation, and eſpecially to reſtore and advance that of Woollen, the Grand Staple Commodity of this Kingdom, which heretofore made the ſame to abound with Wealth, Power, and Honour, beyond any of its Neighbour Nations. Theſe are things not to be Contemned or Neglected, but rather with the greater Diligence and Zeal to be Promoted and Encouraged to the utmoſt; For, ſince this golden Manufactory hath Decreaſed amongſt us, ſeveral Offers and Eſſayes have been made for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and many who are concerned therein have been very Impatient; and not ſufficiently conſidering the Cauſe of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, ſome have moved the Parliament for the Exportation of Unwrought Wool, becauſe little more than half what grows in the Nation is Converted. Others have Oppoſed them, and obtained an Act whereby to render the Exportation thereof Unwrought, a Capital Offence, and hang all thoſe that ſhould do it; yet are not able to Manufacture it themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:32041:3"/>If Wool be Exported, the ſame will deſtroy our Markets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and make People Beggars at home, ſaith the Clothier; But if it be kept at home, and not Converted, it will do us no good, ſaith Reaſon, with whom Experience and Poverty both joyn their Voices; the out-cries of the latter being heard, not only in every Street, but almoſt at every Door.</p>
            <p>The laſt Parliament hath almoſt every Seſſion made it a great part of their Buſineſs to Hear and Encourage thoſe who had any thing to offer for the Recovery of this Trade; and yet, till the late Breviat of Propoſals publiſhed by one Mr. <hi>Richard Haines</hi> came out, it muſt be acknowledged, That neither the Exporter of Wool, nor Oppoſer of the ſame, or any others, have offered any certain Expedients for bringing all Idle hands to Induſtry, whereby the Wool may be Converted as faſt as it grows and ariſes, on ſuch terms, that the Cloth we have to ſpare may be Exported as faſt as 'tis made.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, we cannot think it unſeaſonable, to joyn our Suffrages with him, and ſtir up all Active Publick Spirits, to promote and encourage that which will beſt accompliſh this good Deſign: namely,</p>
            <p>Work-houſes to be Erected, and Stock raiſed in every County, in which, poor People, Beggars, &amp;c. ſhall be Employed in this Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, with ſuch Method of Government as may prevent all ſuch Miſcarriages, as have formerly rendred ſuch Houſes unſucceſsful in our Nation; which he hath, in ſuch his Breviat, declared to make good, and to Anſwer all Objections in that Caſe, in his Propoſals at large, which undoubtedly may be done with little Difficulty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis done and practiſed in other Nations, and may here as well as there.</p>
            <p>The greatneſs of the Profits, namely, thirty or forty hundred thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> we confeſs at firſt ſtarted us, but on deliberate Conſideration we are ſatisfied with the Verity of it. And therefore judge it our parts to recommend it as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, with the Reaſons and Grounds which have fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us why ſuch vaſt Wealth cannot but neceſſarily ariſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to the Nation as thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:32041:3"/>In <hi>England</hi> we may reaſonably conclude there are of Beggers petty Felons, Pariſh-Poor, and other idle People, which do little or nothing for their Living, 200 Thouſand; whereof many who do nothing may earn ſix Pence <hi>per</hi> day, and thoſe that earn ſix pence might earn twelve pence, when pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced together in view of each other, where Correction and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement are duely adminiſtred.</p>
            <p>It may alſo be reaſonably concluded, that each Perſon, one with another, may (with the help of ſome Clothiers) work as much Wool as will make fifteen pounds worth of Cloth in one Year, which, if ſo, then there will be thirty hundred thouſand pounds worth to be Exported more than now is, as the Author of the Propoſals does inſert. But ſuppoſe the quantity fall ſhort, yet we may reaſonably conclude, that our Merchants in their courſe of Trade will near the matter double the Value in the returns of what they Export, ſo that ſtill the Wealth of the Nation will be more, rather than leſs, increaſed, than what is propoſed. But if we take no other meaſures than this, <hi>viz.</hi> that each Perſon, one with another, earns ſix pence <hi>per</hi> day, and that which is wrought by their Labour ſhall be Exported, 'tis a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth, the Nation will gain by their Labour 5000 <hi>l.</hi> for every day in the year that they work, as by Calculation doth appear; which, if doubled by the Merchants courſe of Trade, as aforeſaid, it will then amount to no leſs than 10000 <hi>l. per</hi> day, clear gain to the Nation. And put caſe we allow 80 dayes in the year for Holy dayes, there remains 285 dayes to work in, which, by this modeſt Calculation, will bring in 2850000 <hi>l.</hi> in one year clear gain by their Labour, beſides the Value of the Wool, and other things which add to the Value of all the Cloth they make. Nor is it to be doubted, but the Work of each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, one with another, may amount to 8 <hi>d. per</hi> day, after ſome time of practice, ſo that for the future, by the Expedients propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, all people, as aforeſaid, being brought up to ſuch habit of Induſtry, the Wealth of the Nation cannot but increaſe to the Value propoſed. The Caſe is plain, and an ordinary Capacity, whoſe Judgment is not ſway'd by corrupt Affection, may be well ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:32041:4"/>That we have Wool enough, Fullers Earth enough, poor People enough, Vagrants, petty Felons, Nurſes of Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſufficiently enough to make Cloth enough to revive the Glory, Wealth, Strength, and Safety of the whole Nation is moſt certain, and may as certainly be effected with good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; if inſtead of Houſes of Debauchery, ſuch Houſes of Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry were erected. It being that which not only is practicable, but <hi>de facto</hi> hath been and now is practiſed on the ſame Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, by the means whereof there is not a Begger in the Country where 'tis uſed, and by which that overgrown and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Multitude of leud People may moſt profitably be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained.</p>
            <p>All which conſidered, we can ſee no Reaſon why any People ſhould oppoſe theſe Work-houſes, unleſs it be thoſe that do the greateſt Miſchief to the Perſons, Eſtates, and Souls of Mankind, namely, the before mentioned Idle lewd Nurſes of Debauchery, whom nothing can reſtrain ſo effectually as theſe houſes, in which they would be held in Durance with great Advantage. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concerns them and their Abettors to obſtruct the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and look how much a man is an Enemy to the one ſo much he is the greater Friend to the other.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. This we dare aſſert and maintatin againſt all Oppoſers that ſhall put Pen to Paper againſt it, that if ſuch a Gold or Silver Mine ſhould be found in <hi>England</hi> as might afford five thouſand Pounds <hi>per</hi> day throughout the year, it would not do the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion near ſo much good, as theſe Expedients, if proſecuted.</item>
               <item>2. That it is the greateſt thing of ſuch a kind, and eaſieſt to be accompliſht that hath been offered to the King and Parliament, to promote the Wealth, Strength, and Safety of the Kingdom; ſince in it the Woollen Manufacture hath been encouraged.</item>
               <item>3. That the ſaid Expedients are feiſible and practicable; which being ſo, it muſt needs be ſome extraordinary and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Affection that muſt force any man to oppoſe it.</item>
               <item>4. That 'tis in vain to endeavour to ſuppreſs and deſtroy the Houſes or Schooles of Debauchery, whilſt the major part are Oppoſers and Enemies to the Houſes of Induſtry, which may
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32041:4"/>
afford a better Imployment and honeſter life to the Inhabitants, who ought to be removed from one to the other. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if ſuch publick Labours and Endeavours as will thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the greateſt Happineſs of a Nation be contemned and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, it will be enough to diſhearten all noble and publick Spirits, and render them Objects for the Scorn and Deriſion of the baſeſt of Men.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Wherefore, to prevent this deſtructive Evil, we ſhall with all hearty Affection and Zeal to the publick recommend the ſaid Expedients to all good People in the Nation, of what Eſtate or Quality ſoever, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <item>3. To the Breeders of Wool, becauſe thereby they will have quick Markets for their Wool as faſt as it grows and ariſes, if the neglect of practical Expedients do not hinder.</item>
                  <item>4. To the Clothiers, becauſe thereby all the Wool of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and what <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have to ſpare will be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from being exported, and they may have it wrought upon cheaper Terms than before, as faſt as they need it, having their Labourers partly maintained by a publick Stock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. To the Drapers and Merchants, becauſe they may have their Cloth, and afford it on cheaper terms than thoſe that have ſupplanted us.</item>
