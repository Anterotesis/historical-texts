            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Comedy was Written by the Sacred Command of our late moſt Excellent King, of ever bleſſed and beloved Memory. I had the great good Fortune to pleaſe Him often at His Court in my Maſque, on the Stage of Tragedies and Comedies, and ſo to advance my ſelf in His good opinion; an Honour may render a wiſer Man than I vain; for I believe he had more equals in extent of Dominions than of Underſtanding. The greateſt pleaſure he had from the Stage was in Comedy, and he often Commanded me to Write it, and lately gave me a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Play called <hi>No Puedeſer: Or, It cannot Be.</hi> out of which I took part o' the Name, and deſign o' this. I received the Employment as a great Honour, becauſe it was difficult; requiring no ordinary skill and pains to build a little Shallop, ſit only for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> South Seas, into an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship Royal; but I believe my ſelf able for the Work, becauſe he thought ſo, who underſtood me and all Men, better than I only knew my ſelf, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by Royal judgment that never was miſtaken, I have attained a ſucceſs I never ſhould have met with, had I only followed my own feeble Genius, which often deceives me. That I may enjoy the little fortune I have got with the better reputation, and not ramble the World like a blind Author, obſerving none but my ſelf, I make this humble Application to your Grace. I am ſure all the World will approve my choice. I cannot be guilty of Flattery if I would; nor ſlander Wit (if I had any) by ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and wanton Paintings. Here will be no Tryal of skill how I can praiſe, Nature has done it to my Hands, and devis'd and expos'd finer Ideas, than I am able to Tranſlate. A gracefulneſs of Perſon, excellence of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, largeneſs of Heart, a Loyalty, Gallantry, Integrity, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and many Qualities above my deſcription. Fortune alſo has been more wiſe than uſual, She frequently honours and enriches others to her own diſgrace—but here She ſhares in the Praiſe, and Commends her own Wiſdome, in what She beſtows on your Grace. She has advanc'd Honour in Advancing you, Titles, Greatneſs and Command may be proved, they have attained you. Wealth has a value in your Hands, 'Tis no vile par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, poor flatterer, ſervile Lacquey, wretched Priſoner; but excellent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of a juſt wiſe and liberal Prince. Shou'd I mention all the Qualities, that have long gained you the higheſt Honours from Prince and People, I ſhould rather ſeem to deſcribe a Province than a Man; for what ſingle Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince can afford what are at once in your Grace, a General, a Stateſman, Courtier, and all in perfection; and which is rare in ſuch company, a Martyr. What has your Grace both done and ſuffered, for our Religion, Laws, Liberties and Honour? And not only in the former times of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, but the latter of Confuſion? When the pretended <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the times, out of their Zeal againſt all <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrines, abhorring you for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to good Works.</p>

As an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> I am bound in juſtice, to pay you all the Honours I can. You have been an Ornament, and ſupport to the Crown and Church of <hi>England,</hi> both in your Perſon and Poſterity. Many great Men no doubt have ſprung from your example, but none equalling thoſe deſcended from your ſelf. The late brave Earl of <hi>Oſſery,</hi> advanced the Honour of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both by Sea and Land. 'Tis hard to ſay in which Element he made us moſt renown'd, and for which vertue. He was no more to be vanquiſhed by falſhood than fear; Loyalty, Fidelity, and Gallantry, are Vertues inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the Houſe of <hi>Ormond;</hi> we find e'm in every branch of it, and at all ſeaſons. The Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> Attacked in the late days of Confuſion, a Bloody, Popular, and Formidable Error in its Camp, Fortified and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by all the ſtrength of <hi>England;</hi> and for ever ſecur'd his own, and ſo much of the Publick reputation as was entruſted to him; managing that charge with the ſame Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Fidelity he has done the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and many other great Commands, for the Honour and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the King. In the Young Earl of <hi>Oſſery</hi> we have great aſſurances, the Grandfather and Father ſhall live in him, and receive the laſt rewards of Vertue Men are capable of in this World, to have their Honour and Happineſs extend beyond their own beings. And herein the Hiſtory of your Grace ſeems a Comment on the Fifth Commandment, you have always Honoured the Father of your Country, and your Days of Honour conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long in the Land, in your own Perſon, and your Illuſtrious Race. A uſeful Preſident to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I may approve my ſelf an honeſt and grateful <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> is one reaſon of my Addreſs: I have alſo other obligations on me. Your Grace has been a Princely patron and encourager of Poetry; a Pleaſant but Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Country where my Genius and inclination has caſt me. I am entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled among the inclinations of it, though it affords nothing but a good Ayre, a little vain reputation, and we muſt climb for it, and ſhall miſs it too, if envy or ill nature can hinder us. There were no living, if ſome great Men elevated not only in Quality but Underſtanding above the reſt of the World, did not Protect us from theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> becauſe they know us. I beſeech your Grace then give me leave to pay my Duty to you. Many and great are your Revenues in Honour, in the Camp, the Court, the Church, and the whole Common-wealth of Learning. The Poet may be employed as well as the Hiſtorian. I have made but a ſmall Collection, but I have put it in hands that I hope will not ſoon embezle it. This Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy has rais'd it ſelf ſuch a fortune in the World, I believe it will not ſoon run away. Give it leave to Honour it ſelf with your great Name, and me with the Title of,</p>

Sad fate, that all the Chriſtian Youth o'th' Nation,</l>

            <l>Nay, what is worſe, that's, if reports be true,</l>

For what is life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Liberty? To be his Wife is worſe than to be a Ghoſt, for that walks and enjoys a little chat ſometimes, but I muſt be laid by a Conjurer call'd a Husband for my whole life, I would not be a Queen on the tearms; no nor on any tearms, becauſe a Queen is confin'd to Forms, ſo fond am I of Liberty; but next to that I love your Brother; I wou'd give all the World to cure him, is there no way?</p>

                  <p>Do I know of what Race I am, Madam? Never was ſuch a pack of Fops as my Lord <hi>Belguard's</hi> Anceſtors and mine.

Nor were their quarrels ſo bitter about Land, as place; ſo big were their great hearts, they cou'd not come into one Room together, for fear of looſing place. My Lord <hi>Belguard's</hi> Father to end the difference, moſt piouſly endeavours to be a better Man than any of his Anceſtors. That is to ſay a Lord.</p>

Murder or Treaſon, for thoſe are miſchiefs to others, but Love he accounts High-Treaſon againſt his own damnable Perſon; and he's more aſham'd of it, than he wou'd be of a Beaſts Taile if it grew out of him.
