         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
LETTER
To the D. of P.
In Answer to the Arguing Part of
his First Letter.</head>
            <p>1. THAT you may not take it unkindly
the Arguing Part of your Letter to
Mr. G. should pass unregarded, I have
been prevail'd upon to accept of his
Commission to hold his Cards, while
he is not in Circumstances to play out his Game him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
But can assure you beforehand, since Matter of
<hi>Fact</hi> is clearing by other Hands more proper, I mean
to confine my self to Matter of <hi>Right;</hi> and so shall
give you the least and most excusable trouble that can
be, a short one.</p>
            <p>2. Your Letter tells us, that the Conference was for
the sake of a Gentleman, who I heard desir'd to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd
that <hi>Protestants</hi> are absolutely certain of what
they believe, and made account you could satisfie him,
and profess'd, if you could not, he would quit your
Communion. And you take care to inform us (<hi>p.</hi> 2.)
that he was satisfi'd, and <hi>declar'd immediately</hi> after the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51893:3"/>
Conference, that <hi>he was much more confirm'd in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of your Church by it, and resolv'd to continue in it.</hi> But
could you not have afforded to inform us likewise <hi>by
what</hi> he was satisfi'd? For there is many a Man who
would be as glad, and is as much concern'd to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
in that Point as that Gentleman; and he would
not have been a jot the less <hi>confirm'd</hi> or the less <hi>resolv'd,</hi>
if his Neighbor had been confirm'd and resolv'd with
him. I cannot for my life imagin why you should
make a Secret of a thing, which, besides your own and
your Churches Honor, concerns the Salvation of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
and thousands to know.</p>
            <p>3. Your Letter I perceive would shift it off to Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
whom you <hi>desire</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 7) to prove that Protestants have
<hi>no Absolute Certainty,</hi> &amp;c. Of this Proposal there will
be occasion to say more by and by. At the present I
pray you consider how you deal with those Souls who
rely on you. If you should move them to trust their
Estates with a Man of your naming, of whom you
would give no other satisfaction that he were able to
manage them, and faithful, and responsible, but only to
bid those who doubted, prove the contrary; I fancy
there would need all the Credit you have to hinder the
Motion from appearing very strange: And yet you
have the confidence to make them one as much stranger
as their Souls are more worth than their Mony: For
you would have them hazard their Souls where they
are not safe, for any care you take to satisfie them that
they are. Why, suppose Mr. <hi>G.</hi> could not prove that
Protestants are not Certain, are they therefore Certain?
Has <hi>Peter</hi> Twenty pounds in his Purse, because <hi>Paul</hi>
cannot prove he has not? Or, ever the more Title to
an Estate, because an Adversary may have the ill luck
to be Non-suited? Must not every body speak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51893:3"/>
one day, and bring in his own Account, which will
pass or not pass as it is or is not faulty in it self, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any fault have been found in it before or no? And
will not the Happiness or Misery of their Souls for ever
depend on that Account? Can you suffer them to run
that terrible hazard, without making them able to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
their Accounts themselves, and furnishing them
with assurance that they can, and with no more to say
but that they hop'd Dr. <hi>St.</hi> would make his Party good
with Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ? That things so precious to God as Souls
should be of no more value with those who set up for
Ministers of the Gospel! That their great and only care,
as far as I see, should be to make a shew, and pass for
some body here, let every one take his chance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after!
Besides, Truth is therefore <hi>Truth,</hi> because 'tis
built on Intrinsecal Grounds which prove it to be such;
and not on private Mens Abilities, or their saying this
or that; wherefore till those Grounds be produc'd, it
cannot be with reason held <hi>Truth:</hi> And Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is more
particularly oblig'd to make good he has such Grounds,
having had such ill fortune formerly with the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
to which he undertook to reduce <hi>Protestant Faith,</hi>
as appears by the Account given of them in <hi>Error Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. But, leaving these Matters to be Answer'd where
we must all answer why we have believ'd so and so;
pray let us have fair play in the mean time. Let every
one bear his own Burthen, and you not think to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
your self by throwing your Load on another
Man's Shoulders. You affirm there is Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
on the Protestants side, and 'tis for him to <hi>prove</hi>
it who <hi>affirms</hi> it. If you do it but half so well as Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
can, and has, the Infallibility which he asserts, you will
earn Thanks from one side, and Admiration from the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51893:4"/>
other. But it is for <hi>you</hi> to do it: To trick off proving
the contrary upon your Adversary, is to own that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
is a thing which agrees not with your Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in which your Heart misgives you.</p>
            <p>5. Yet even so you were uneasie still, and would not
venture what Mr. <hi>G.</hi> could do, as slightly as you think,
or would have others think of him. You know well
enough, that to prove Protestants have no Absolute
Certainty of their Faith, is no hard Task even for a weak
Man:<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Tillotson</hi>'s Rule of Faith, <hi>p.</hi> 117, 118.</note> You know any Man may find it confess'd to his
hand by Protestants. And therefore you had reason to
bethink your self of an Expedient to trick it off again
from that Point,<note place="margin">Pag. 7.</note> and put Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to prove, That <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
have no Absolute Certainty as to the Rule of their
Faith,</hi> viz. <hi>the Scripture.</hi> The Merits of this Cause too
I think will return hereafter more fitly; in this place I
mind only the <hi>Art.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s Second Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note> Pray, was not the very First Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
at the Conference, <hi>Whether Protestants are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
Certain that</hi> they <hi>hold now the same Tenets in Faith,
and All that our Saviour taught to his Apostles?</hi> And your
Answer that <hi>They are?</hi> Did our Saviour teach, and do
Protestants believe no more, than that the Book so call'd
is <hi>Scripture?</hi> Is Certainty of this <hi>more,</hi> and Certainty of
this <hi>Book</hi> all one? And was not the Question plainly of
the Certainty of this, and of <hi>All</hi> this <hi>more?</hi> Here is then
an Enquiry after one thing plainly turn'd off to another.
Yes; but this was one of the <hi>two things which the whole
Conference depended upon.</hi> As if the whole Conference
did not depend on that thing which was to be made
manifest by the Conference, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Absolute Certainty
of Protestant Faith.</hi> Mr. <hi>G.</hi> indeed did himself ask some
Questions about your Certainty of your Rule; Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whose course it was wisely done to cut off, before
they had question'd away your Certainty of Faith. For,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51893:4"/>
after they had caus'd it to be admitted, that the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Scripture is from Tradition, there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to admit that Tradition causes Certainty, and
makes Faith as Certain as Scripture. And then it
would have prov'd something difficult to satisfie even
a willing Man, that the Faith is Certain which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
to a Faith come down by Tradition. But it was seen
whereto it would come, and thought fit to break off in
time, and not let the Conference proceed too far. In the
mean time Absolute Certainty of Scripture was not the
Point of the Conference nor is it the Point of Concern.
Besides that 'tis agreed on all hands, Men are Sav'd by
<hi>Believing</hi> and <hi>Practising</hi> what <hi>Christ</hi> taught, not barely
by believing <hi>Scripture is Scripture:</hi> And Salvation is the
thing that imports us in these Disputes, and 'twere well
that nothing else were minded by Disputers. But it
imported you it seems both to shift off <hi>Proving</hi> from
your self, and to stifle any further Talk of the Certainty
of Protestant Faith, and keep us from looking that way
by fixing our Eyes on another Object. And this is all
you do; but with so much Art, that I verily think
many a Reader is persuaded you are talking all the
while to the purpose. The truth is, you have reason
to carry it as you do; for it is good to avoid underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
what cannot be perform'd: And you <hi>cannot,</hi> and
I believe <hi>know you cannot</hi> make out, That Protestants
are Absolutely Certain, that they now hold all the same
Doctrin that was taught by <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles, as
you affirm'd in your Answer to Mr. <hi>G's</hi> first Question.
And this I thought it imported to tell you plainly and
publickly, that it might be in your hands to pin the
Controversie-basket, and bring all Catholics to your
Church; where I will answer you will be sure to find
us, if you make us sure we shall find this Certainty
there when we come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51893:5"/>
6. In the mean time why has not Mr. <hi>G.</hi> done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
as much as should be done? It is plain that where
Churches differ in Faith, <hi>Infallible Faith</hi> in one, cannot
stand with <hi>Certain Faith</hi> in the other. Wherefore if Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
have fix'd Infallibility in his own Church, he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
Certainty from all that differ from her. Let us
then take and sift Mr. <hi>G's</hi> Argument, even as you put
it, who had not, I suppose, partiality enough for him,
to make it better than it was. You put it thus, <hi>p.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>All Traditionary Christians believe the same to day
which they did yesterday, and so up to the time of our Blessed
Saviour; and if they follow this Rule, they can never err
in Faith, therefore are Infallible. And you</hi> (Mr. G.)
<hi>prov'd they could not innovate in Faith, unless they did
forget what they held the day before, or out of malice alter
it.</hi> And now,</p>
            <p>That there may be no mistake, let us take each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
by it self.</p>
            <p>8. The First is, [<hi>All Traditionary Christians believe
the same to day which they did yesterday, and so up to the
time of our Blessed Saviour.</hi>] You have nothing to say
to this, I hope: For since <hi>Traditionary Christians</hi> are
those who proceed upon <hi>Tradition,</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<hi>Immediate Delivery,</hi> it follows, that unless they
believe the same to day which they did yesterday, and
so upwards, they cease to be <hi>Traditionary Christians,</hi> by
proceeding not upon an <hi>Immediate,</hi> but an <hi>Interrupted</hi>
Delivery, or some other Principle. And so there is no
denying this Proposition, but by affirming that Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary
Christians are not Traditionary Christians.</p>
            <p>9. The second Proposition is this. [<hi>And if they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
this Rule, they can never err in Faith.</hi>] This is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably
self-evident: For, to follow this Rule is <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
still the same to day which they did yesterday:</hi> And so,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51893:5"/>
if they did this from Christ's time, and so forwards, they
must still continue to believe, to the end of the World,
the self-same that Christ and his Apostles taught; and,
therefore, cannot err in Faith, unless those Authors of
our Faith did: Which that they did not, is not to be
prov'd to Christians.</p>
            <p>10. There follows this Inference: [<hi>Therefore they
are Infallible.</hi>] This is no less plainly self-evident. For
these words [<hi>They can never err in Faith</hi>] in the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
and [<hi>They are Infallible</hi>] in the Consequent,
are most manifestly the self-same in sense, and perfectly
equivalent.</p>
            <p>11. The fourth and last (which according to you,
aim'd to prove, that they could not innovate) is this.
[<hi>They could not innovate in Faith, unless they did forget
what they held the day before, or out of malice alter it.</hi>]
And this is no less unexceptionable than its Fellows.
For, if they <hi>knew not</hi> they alter'd Faith, when they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
it, they had <hi>forgot</hi> what they believ'd the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
If they alter'd it <hi>wittingly,</hi> excuse them from
<hi>Malice</hi> who can; who, believing, as all who proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Tradition do, that Tradition is the certain Means
to convey the Doctrin of Christ, would notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alter the Doctrin convey'd to them by Tradition,
Pray what ails this Argument? and what wants it,
save bare Application, to conclude what was intended
as fully and as rigorously as you can desire? And, pray,
what need was there to apply it to the Roman Church,
and say she follow'd Tradition, to you who deny it not
either of the Roman or Greek Church? As every
thing is true, and every thing clear; who now besides
your self would have thought of an evasion from it?
And yet you venture at one, such as it is.</p>
            <p>12. You tell us then, (<hi>p.</hi> 5.) That <hi>you thought the best way
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51893:6"/>
to shew the vanity of this rare Demonstration, was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an Instance of such as follow'd Tradition, and yet Mr.</hi>
G. <hi>could not deny to have err'd, and that was of the Greek
Church,</hi> &amp;c. You had e'en as good have said, what Mr.
<hi>G.</hi> says is true, but yet he does not say true for all that.
For to pitch upon nothing for false, is, in Disputes, to
own that every thing is true. The <hi>best way,</hi> say you?
I should have thought it every jot as good a way to
have said nothing when one has nothing to say. But
yet the World is oblig'd to you for letting them know
what Scholars knew before, that Protestants <hi>think it
the best way</hi> to answer Catholic Arguments, to give
them no Answer at all: For you are not to be told
that this Instance of yours is not an Answer to Mr.
<hi>G.</hi>'s Argument, but a new Argument against him of
your own, which undoubtedly you might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
as well as my Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> if you had been, as
my Lord <hi>Falkland</hi> was, <hi>arguing.</hi> But it is your turn now
to <hi>answer.</hi> And must you be minded of what every
Smatterer in Logic knows, that an Answerer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to his <hi>Concedo,</hi> his <hi>Nego,</hi> and <hi>Distinguo,</hi> as the
Propositions which he is to speak to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are True, False
or Ambiguous? He may deny the Inference too, if he
find more or other Terms in the Conclusion than in
the Premises. But <hi>these</hi> are his Bounds; and Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
turns Babbling, when they are exceeded. Must
you be minded that the Business must be stopt before it
come to the Conclusion, and that otherwise there is
no speaking against it? For you know that if the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses
be right, and the Inference good, the Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
must be as necessarily. True, as it is that the same
thing cannot be, and not be at once; that is, must be
more certain than that <hi>England,</hi> for Example, shall not
crumble into Atoms, or be swallow'd up in the Sea to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51893:6"/>
morrow: For this, and a thousand such things <hi>may</hi>
happen to all material Nature; that a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should prove True, <hi>cannot.</hi> And 'tis perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
that Terms which cohere in the Premises, by
being the same with a Third, should not cohere with
one another in the Conclusion. Must you be minded that
an <hi>Arguer</hi> is to <hi>prove</hi> his Conclusion, and an Answerer to
shew he does not, by assigning where and how he fails?
Do you do any such matter? Do you so much as go
about it? And would you have what you say pass for
an Answer? Pray consider the Case: The Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> is Infallible, says Mr. <hi>G.:</hi> She is not, say you.
He brings his Argument, and you your Instance against
it. What are People the wiser now? and which shall
they be for; the Argument or the Instance? They
have reason to think well of the <hi>Argument,</hi> because
you have no fault to find with it; and they may think
as they please of the <hi>Instance.</hi> You would not, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
have them believe you both, and think the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for your sake <hi>Fallible,</hi> and, for his, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi>
at once. Pray what assistance do you afford
them to determin either way? And what do you more
than e'en leave them to draw Cuts, and venture their
Souls as handy-dandy shall decide, for you or Mr. <hi>G.?</hi>
'Tis true, when <hi>Zeno</hi> would needs be paradoxing against
the possibility of Motion, his Vanity was not ill ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul'd
by the walking of <hi>Diogenes</hi> before him. For 'twas
palpably and ridiculously <hi>vain</hi> to talk against Motion
with a Tongue, that must needs move to talk against
it. And there may be <hi>vanity</hi> too in our Case, for
ought I know: But where shall it be lodg'd? Why
more with Mr. G's. Argument than your Instance?
Why is it more <hi>vain</hi> to pretend to prove Infallibility,
upon which depend the Hopes which Millions and Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51893:7"/>
have of a blessed Eternity, and which is prov'd
by Arguments, to which you think it <hi>your best way</hi> not
to attempt to Answer, than it is to except against a
Conclusion, against the Premises whereof there lies no
Exception? That is, to find fault with a Sum Total,
and find none in the particulars or the casting up:
For a Conclusion is a kind of Sum Total of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
But it is infinitely more <hi>vain</hi> to talk against
one Infallibility, unless you will set up another. For,
if there be no Means, by which Men may be secur'd,
that the ways they take to arrive at their greatest and
only Good will not <hi>deceive</hi> them it cannot be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they will take all the pains that are necessary to
compass that Good, which for ought they can tell, they
may not compass with all their pains. 'Tis a pleasant
thing in you to talk of the <hi>vanity</hi> of Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s. Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
when, by seeking to take Infallibility out of the
World, you are making the whole Creation <hi>vain.</hi> For
all Material Nature was made for Rational Nature, and
Rational Nature requires Rational Satisfaction in all
its proceedings, and most of all in the pursuit of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness:
And what Rational Satisfaction can there be,
if there may be <hi>Deceit</hi> in whatever can be propos'd for
Satisfaction? In short, the Result of your Instance,
whatever was the Aim, it is to amuse and confound
People, and hinder them perhaps from seeing what
otherwise would be clear; but it shews them nothing,
nor <hi>can;</hi> for that Argument of yours is not at all of a
shewing Nature.</p>
            <p>13. 'Tis, at best, but an Argument (as they call it)
<hi>ad hominem;</hi> which you know are of the worst sort of
Arguments. They serve for nothing but to stop an
Adversaries mouth, or shame him, if he cannot answer
without contradicting himself; but are of no use to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51893:7"/>
the Discovery of <hi>Truth.</hi> For a thing is not the
more or less True, because such a Man's Tongue is ty'd
up for speaking against it. But is it so much as an
Argument <hi>ad hominem?</hi> As all the little force of the
Topic consists in the Obligation which a Man may have
to grant or deny what it <hi>supposes</hi> he does, it affords
no Argument at all against the Man who has no such
Obligation. And pray where does it appear that Mr.
<hi>G.</hi> is oblig'd not to deny that the Greek Church has
err'd in matters of Faith? And how can <hi>you,</hi> of all
Men, suppose he is? You, who in your Rational Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
(<hi>p.</hi> 32.) quote these words from <hi>Peter Lombard; The
Difference between the Greeks and Latins, is in Words
and not in Sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Name <hi>Thomas a Iesu,</hi> and <hi>Azorius,</hi> and
tell us of other Roman Catholic Authors, of the
same judgment, whom I suppose you could name.
Pray, how comes Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to lye under an Obligation,
from which Men of Reputation in his own Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
are exempt? And what a wise Argument <hi>ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem</hi>
have you made against him, whom your self
have furnish'd with an Argument <hi>ad hominem</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
it when he pleases? In fine, he goes to work like
a Scholar, puts his Premises, and infers his Conclusion,
which you know cannot but be True, if there be no
Fault in his Premises: And 'tis for you to find one when
you can. You put nothing to shew how the Inference you
make should be True, but barely assume, without proof,
that he <hi>cannot deny it</hi> (p. 5.): As if Truth depended on his
Denying or Affirming, and that what People say or
think, made things True or False. And even, for so
much, you are at his Courtesie: If he be not the better
Natur'd, and will crossly affirm or deny in the wrong
place, you and your Argument are left in the lurch.
In a word, one may see he aim'd at Truth, who takes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51893:8"/>
at least the way to it: what you aim'd at, you best
know; but no body shall ever discover what is, or is
not True, by your Method.</p>
            <p>14. But that you may not complain, your Cock is
not suffer'd to fight, let us see what your Instance will
do. You put it thus, (<hi>p.</hi> 5.) <hi>The Greek Church went upon
Tradition from Father to Son, as much as ever the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
did. And I desir'd to know of Mr.</hi> G. <hi>whether the
Greek Church notwithstanding did not err in matters of
Faith; And, if it did, then a Church holding to Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was not Infallible.</hi> How! <hi>If it did?</hi> Why then it is
apparent if it did not, your Argument holds not.
And will you assume that the Greek Church errs, who
believe she does not? Will you take a Premise to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a Conclusion, upon which the Salvation of People
depends, which Premise your self in your own heart
think is not true? Can you deal thus with their Souls,
who pin them upon you, perswade them of what you
are not perswaded your self, and offer them a Securiy
for their Eternity, in which your own judgment tells
you there is a flaw? For you have declar'd your self
upon this Matter in your <hi>Rational Account,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
great pains to clear the Greek Church, at least
upon the Article of the Holy Ghost, in which consists
their main difference with the Latins, and to which
the other two you mention were added, I suppose,
for fashion sake. I know you there propose to free
that Church from the charge of Heresie. But pray
what difference betwixt <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Error in matter of
Faith?</hi> unless you will trifle about Obstinacy, and
such collateral considerations; which neither concern
us here nor were any part of your Defence there. I
see too that you word it here conditionally, and with
reference to Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s. Answer: As if his Answer made
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51893:8"/>
or marr'd, and the Greek Church did or did not err, as
he says, <hi>I,</hi> or <hi>No.</hi> Whatever Mr. <hi>G.</hi> may say, or you
have said, unless the Greek Church actually does Err,
your Instance is no Instance of a Church that goes
upon Tradition and Errs; and your Inference that
<hi>then a Church holding to Tradition was not Infallible,</hi> is
wondrous pertinently inferr'd from the Example of a
Church that <hi>errs not.</hi> Pray take it well that I intreat
you by all the care you have of your own Soul, and
should have of others, to manage Disputes about Faith
a little otherwise, and not propose Arguments, in
which you must needs think your self there is no force.
For there is plainly none in this, if the Greek Church
<hi>does not</hi> err; and you at least think she does not. I
am sure 'tis what I would not do my self for all the
World.</p>
            <p>15. But to proceed to Mr. G's. Answer, (<hi>p.</hi> 5.) <hi>It was</hi>
say you, <hi>that the Greek Church follow'd Tradition, till the</hi>
Arians <hi>left that Rule and took up a new one,</hi> &amp;c. And why
has he not answer'd well? You assum'd that the Greek
Church err'd while it went upon Tradition; If you
did not, you said nothing; for, that a Church may
follow Tradition at one time, and leave it at another,
is no news. 'Tis the case of all erring Churches which
ever follow'd Tradition at all. Mr. G's Reply then that
Tradition was follow'd till another Rule was taken up,
denies that Tradition and Error were found together,
as you contended, in the Greek Church. And pray
what more direct or more full Answer can there be to
an Argument, than to deny the Premises? As slightly as
you would seem to think of him, he understood dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
better than to start aside into an Exception
against your Conclusion, but answers fair and home by
denying the Assumption from which you infer it;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51893:9"/>
which now he has done, you know it rests with you
to prove it; and yet you never think on't, as far as I
see; but, as if you had no more to do, fall a complaining
against Mr. <hi>G.</hi> for speaking of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and not of
the present Greek Church; and against his Copy, for
leaving out the Inference which you drew. In doing
which, if he did so, he did you no small kindness;
there being no Premises to draw the Inference from,
as has been shewn above; or if any, such as put you
to contradict your own Doctrin ere any thing could fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from them.</p>
            <p>16. As for the omission of the Inference, I know not
how it happen'd, nor mean to meddle with matter of
Fact. But I see they had reason, who observ'd before
me, that 'tis a thing of no manner of Consequence, I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
think, in your own Judgment. Unless you think
the Age we live in so dull, that, without much ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering
it into their Heads, it cannot be perceiv'd, that
if a Church <hi>has</hi> err'd which held to Tradition, a
Church <hi>may</hi> err which holds to Tradition. Or, unless
you think it of mighty Consequence to have an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
stand in the Relation which fell with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
at the Conference. Mr. <hi>G.</hi> took them away by
his denial, and you must begin again, and bring some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from whence you may draw an Inference, if you
will needs have an Inference; for an Inference cannot
be drawn from nothing. Pray divert us not perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
from minding what we are about; but remember
the Question now is, Whether the Greek Church held
to Tradition and err'd at once? and bethink your
self, if you please of a <hi>Medium,</hi> which will infer
that Point for you; for Mr. <hi>G.</hi> you see denies it.</p>
            <p>17. From his mentioning the <hi>Arians</hi> you take occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
speak big, and bear us in hand he was hard put to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51893:9"/>
it, and sought an occasion, and affirm (<hi>p.</hi> 6.) you could
get <hi>no Answer at all</hi> to the Case of the present Greek
Church. As if his Answer pincht on the <hi>Arians,</hi> and
were not as full to the present as past Greek Church.
It goes on this, That those who err in Faith, let them
be who they will, and the Error what it will, and in
what Time and Place you will, all leave Tradition.
Whether the Case of the present Greek Church be the
same with the <hi>Arians,</hi> is matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> with which
Mr. <hi>G.</hi> did well not to meddle; it is for you to make
it out, if you will make good your Argument. Modern
or Ancient Heresie is all one to his Answer, which is
applicable to <hi>all</hi> Heresie: And you complain of the
want of an Answer when you <hi>have</hi> one. Pray, if a
Man should put an Objection to you about an Animal,
for Example, and you answer it of <hi>all</hi> Animals, would
you think it just in him to quarrel with you for not
mentioning the Rational or Irrational in particular?
And yet this is your Quarrel to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> All your mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Talk (<hi>p.</hi> 6.) of <hi>undeniably true, granted by</hi> Mr. G.
<hi>known to every one, &amp;c.</hi> as apt as I see it is to make a
Reader believe your Instance is notoriously true, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> has nothing to say, cannot make
me, or any Man of Reason, who examins the Point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he has any Reason to say more, till you do. He has
answer'd directly, and positively deny'd, that Error and
Tradition can be found together in the Greek Church,
or any other, modern or ancient. There it sticks, and
you may drive it on farther (it being your own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
if you please. Only when you tell us (<hi>p.</hi> 6.) that
the present Greek Church <hi>in all its Differences with the
Roman, still pleaded Tradtion, and adher'd to it,</hi> I wish
you had told us whether you speak of Differences in
<hi>matter of Faith,</hi> or no. For Differences may be occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51893:10"/>
by matters of Faith, which are not Differences in
Faith. If you do not, you support your Instance very
strongly, and prove the consistence of Tradition with
Error in Faith very Learnedly, from Differences which
belong not to Faith. If you do, as Nature itches after
strange Sights, I long to see by what Differences, or any
thing else, it can be made out, That an erring Church
<hi>can still plead Tradition, and adhere to it.</hi> Not but that for
<hi>Pleading</hi> much may be, there are such confident doings
in the World. As certain as it is, that the Religion in
<hi>England</hi> now, is not the same which it was before
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, I think there is confidence enough
in <hi>England</hi> to plead Tradition for it. 'Tis but finding
some Expression in an ancient Writer, not couch'd with
Prophetical foresight enough to avoid being understood,
as some will desire it should, and it will serve turn to
pretend to Antiquity, and bear the Name of Tradition.
So I suspect you take it your self, when you say the
<hi>Arians</hi> insisted on Tradition: For sure you do not think
in earnest, that Doctrin contrary to Consubstantiality,
was taught by <hi>Christ,</hi> and believ'd from Father to Son
till the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> This, or some such thing may
perhaps have been <hi>pleaded;</hi> but for <hi>adhering to Tradition,</hi>
Your Servant. For, pray, did <hi>Christ</hi> teach any Error?
When a Father believ'd what <hi>Christ</hi> taught him, and the
Son what the Father believ'd, did not the Son too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what <hi>Christ</hi> taught? Run it on to the last Son that
shall be born in the World, must not every one believe
what <hi>Christ</hi> taught, if every one believ'd what his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
believ'd? And will you go about to persuade us,
that there actually is a company of Men in the World
who <hi>adher'd</hi> to this Method, all Sons believing always
as their Fathers did, whereof the First believ'd as <hi>Christ</hi>
taught, and who notwithstanding err'd in matters of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51893:10"/>
Faith? They would thank you for making this out,
who would be glad that <hi>Christ</hi> taught Error and were
not God. But it is not plainer that Two and Three
make Five, than it is that this cannot be. And yet you
would top it upon us, and bear us in hand it is not only
true, but apparent in the Greek Church, and known to
every body who knows any thing of it. The comfort is,
there is nothing for all these Assertions but your Word;
in which, where you stick not to pass it for an arrant
Impossibility, I for my part do not think there is Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Certainty.</p>
            <p>18. I see not what there remains more, but to bear
in mind where we are. At the Conference, instead of
answering Mr. <hi>G's</hi> Argument, you would needs make
one of your own, which was in short; <hi>The Greek Church
goes upon Tradition and errs, therefore another Church
may err which goes upon Tradition.</hi> There was no need
to trouble the Greek Church for the matter: It had
been altogether as methodical, and as much to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to have instanc'd in the Latin Church it self, and
never gon further; and shorter, to have spar'd Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
too, and have said without more ado, <hi>Mr. G's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
is not true:</hi> For you do no more, till you make it
appear, that the Church you pitch upon for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
do's indeed <hi>adhere</hi> to Tradition and <hi>err.</hi> But,
because this had been too open, and People would have
sooner perceiv'd that it had been to say, <hi>I know not how
to answer Mr. G's Argument, but will notwithstanding
stand to it, that his Conclusion is false,</hi> you thought the
best way to divert the Reader's attention from what's
before him, was to travel into <hi>Greece;</hi> and yet when
you come there, do no more than if you had stay'd at
home: For you barely <hi>say</hi> there is both Tradition and
Error in the Greek Church, and you might have said
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51893:11"/>
as much of the Latin; or, without mentioning either,
have said, <hi>Tho' Mr. G. has prov'd a Traditionary Church
cannot err, I say it can and has.</hi> All is but <hi>Saying</hi> till
you come to <hi>Proving:</hi> Only to make a formal shew
with an Antecedent and a Conclusion, you say it with
the Ceremony of an Argument; of which since Mr. G.
deny'd the Antecedent, he had no more to do till you
prov'd it.</p>
            <p>19. So it stood at the Conference, and so it stands
still, and for ought I see, is like to stand: For tho' you
have writ two Letters since, there appears no word of
Proof in either, or sign that you do so much as think on
it: You only say your Instance over again, and would
have the Face you set upon it, and great Words you
give it, make it pass for plain and undeniable, when all
the while it is plainly impossible, and actually deny'd.
Mr. <hi>G.</hi> I hope, will bide by his Answer, because it is a
good one, true in it self, and direct to the Point: For
it denies just what you assum'd, That the Greek Church
stood upon Tradition, and fell at the same time into
Error. And speaking as you do, or should do, of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
in matter of Faith, <hi>Euclid</hi> never made any thing
plainer than it is, That where ever Error comes in, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
goes out. Of necessity therefore, if the present
Greek Church have adher'd to Tradition, it has not
err'd: If it have err'd, it has not adher'd to Tradition.
Which of the two is the Case, neither concerns Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
nor can he dispute it without following bad Example,
that is, falling to Argue now it is his Part to Answer.
You would pass it upon us, that the Greek Church has
err'd without swerving from Tradition; and you must
either make it out, or acknowledge you have made
much ado about nothing: For your Instance is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
till it appears to be true; Till you do it, there is
no Work for Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:51893:11"/>
20 At the close (<hi>p.</hi> 7.) you <hi>desire</hi> Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to <hi>make good two
things,</hi> and tell us why you desire it, and what will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
if he accept or decline your Motion. I neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
how your Proposals follow from your Reasons,
nor your Consequences from your Proposals: But think
it no more worth losing time upon them, than you
<hi>thought it worth boasting of the Victory.</hi> The First is,
<hi>That we</hi> [Protestants] <hi>have no Absolute Certainty as to
the Rule of our Faith,</hi> viz. <hi>the Scripture; altho' we have
a larger and firmer Tradition for it,</hi> viz. the Consent of
all Christian Churches, <hi>than you</hi> [Catholics] <hi>can have
for the Points of Faith in difference between us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21. I can tell you a better Reason for this Proposal
than any you give. There was no avoiding to own
Absolute Certainty to a Man who talk'd of quitting
your Communion without it. But you knew well
enough that your <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> would be thwittled
into <hi>Sufficient Certainty,</hi> and <hi>Sufficient Certainty</hi> into <hi>no
Certainty</hi> at last; and had your Wits about you when
you thought of this Proposal: For it is in effect to say,
<hi>This Certainty of Faith is a troublesom matter, and not for
my turn; Let us go to something else, leave Faith and pass
to Scripture; of which you, Mr. G. shall prove we have no
Absolute Certainty: For, if I should go about to prove we
have, I foresee, that while I am seeking harbor in my larger
and firmer Tradition, I shall venture to split upon your
Infallibility,</hi>
               <note place="margin">There can be no necessity sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Society of Men, either to attest or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings among Christians.</note> 
               <hi>to contradict my 15th Principle for the Faith
of Protestants, and fall at unawares into the Snares laid for
me in</hi> Error Nonplust, <hi>from</hi> p. 90 to p. 96, <hi>which I have no
mind to come near.</hi> But whatever Reasons you had to
make this Proposal, I see none that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> has to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it. Do you prove, if you please, that you have
Absolute Certainty; you, who bear those in hand who
consult you, that you have;<note place="margin">Dr. St. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple 15.</note> and Absolute Certainty
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51893:12"/>
too of that of which you profess'd your self absolutely
Certain, <hi>viz.</hi> That you <hi>now hold all the same Doctrin
that was taught by Christ and his Apostles;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. St's <hi>Copy.</hi>
               </note> which by your
own confession there, is the true Point. For you know
very well, one is not certain of his <hi>Faith</hi> by being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of <hi>Scripture:</hi> Your self take all who dissent from
yours, to have not only an <hi>Vncertain,</hi> but a <hi>Wrong</hi> Faith,
else why do you dissent from them? And yet they
have all as much Certainty of <hi>Scripture</hi> as you. The
truth is, if you were prest to make out your Absolute
Certainty even of Scripture in your way, you would
perhaps find a hard Task of it, for all your Appeal to
Tradition. But it was not the Point for which the
Conference was, nor ought it be the Point here, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to meddle with it, and you trust
much to his good Nature to propose it: For, besides
that all the thanks he would have for his pains, would
be to have the Arguments against your Certainty,
turn'd against the Certainty of Scripture one day, as if
he did not believe Scripture Certain: You would have
him undertake a matter in which he has no concern, to
save you from an Undertaking in which you are deeply
concern'd, but with which you know not how to go
thorow; which is a very reasonable Request. In a
word, it is for you either to make manifest now, what
you should have made manifest at the Conference, <hi>viz.</hi>
That Protestants have Absolute Certainty, not only
of the Scripture, which they call their <hi>Rule,</hi> but of the
<hi>Faith</hi> which they pretend to have from that Rule; or
else to suffer another thing to be manifest, <hi>viz.</hi> That I
said true when I said you <hi>cannot</hi> do it; and thither I am
sure it will come.</p>
            <p>22. However, I am glad to hear any Talk from you
of <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> even tho' it be but Talk: 'Tis a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51893:12"/>
great Stranger, as coming from your Quarters, and has
a friendly and an accommodating look, and therefore for
both regards deserves a hearty welcome. For, this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Profession makes a fair approach towards the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> or rather 'tis the self-same with
it; it being against Common Sense to say you judge
your self <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> of any thing, if at the same
time you judge you may be <hi>deceiv'd</hi> in thus judging.
But I accept the <hi>Omen</hi> that you seem to grant you are
thus <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> or Infallible, by virtue of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
for this makes Tradition to be an Infallible
Ascertainer in <hi>some</hi> things at least; and, so, unless some
special difficulty be found in <hi>other</hi> things that light into
the same Channel, it must needs bring <hi>them</hi> down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
too. Now I cannot for my heart discern what
great difficulty there can be to remember all along the
yesterdays Faith, or to be willing to be guided and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by their yesterdays Fathers, Teachers and
Pastors; especially the sense of the Points (to omit
many other means) being determin'd by open and
daily Practice. Yet I a little fear all this your seeming
kindness for Tradition, is only for your own Interest;
and that, because you were necessitated to make use
of it to abet Scripture's Letter, you allow it in that
regard, these high Complements; but in other things,
particularly in conveying down a Body of Christian
Faith (which is incomparably more easie) it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
become useless and good for nothing. In the
former exigency you esteem it <hi>A worthy Rule,</hi> but in the
later duty, <hi>A Rule worthy</hi>—</p>
            <p>23. Now to let the Reader plainly see that it was
meer Force, and not Inclination, which oblig'd you to
grant an Absolute Certainty in Tradition conveying
down Scriptures Letter, we will examin what you
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51893:13"/>
allow'd it when you laid your <hi>Principles,</hi> and so spoke
your own free thoughts unconstrain'd by any Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
Your fifteenth Principle is put down (<hi>p.</hi> 90.) in
<hi>Error Nonplust,</hi> and that part of it that concerns this
present Point, is thus reflected upon by your Adversary
(<hi>p.</hi> 92, 93.) [<hi>Again, tho all this were true, and that</hi> the
Scriptures were own'd as containing in them the whole
Will of God so plainly reveal'd, that no sober Enquirer
can miss of what's necessary to Salvation, <hi>and that
therefore there needed no Church to</hi> explain <hi>them: Yet
'tis a strange Consequence, that</hi> therefore there can be
no necessity of any Infallible Society of Men to <hi>Attest
them, or to witness</hi> that <hi>the</hi> Letter <hi>of Scripture is right.
This is so far from</hi> following <hi>out of the former part of
Dr.</hi> St's. <hi>Discourse, that the</hi> contrary <hi>ought to follow; or,
from prejudicing his own pretence, that it conduces exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
to it. For certainly his</hi> Sober Enquirer <hi>would less
be in doubt to</hi> miss of what's necessary to Salvation
<hi>in case</hi> the <hi>Letter, on which all depends, be</hi> well <hi>attested,
than if it be not; and most certainly an Infallible Society
of Men can</hi> better <hi>attest that Letter than a</hi> Fallible <hi>one:
and those Writings can with better shew of Reason be</hi> own'd
<hi>to</hi> contain <hi>in them the</hi> Will of God, <hi>if their Letter be
attested beyond possibility of being wrong, than if</hi> left <hi>in a
possibility of being</hi> such; <hi>for if the</hi> Letter <hi>be wrong,</hi> All <hi>is
wrong in this case</hi>—] As manifest then as 'tis, that to
be <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> of any thing, is not to be <hi>Fallibly
Certain</hi> of it; that is, as manifest as 'tis, that to be <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
Certain</hi> of a thing, is to be <hi>Infallibly Certain</hi>
of it; so manifest it is, that you <hi>there</hi> contradict your
self <hi>here,</hi> and, that, however you may endeavour to
come off, you allow not heartily, nor without some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
and reluctancy, an Absolute Certainty to Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
even in <hi>Attesting</hi> Scripture's <hi>Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:51893:13"/>
24. In these words of yours (<hi>p.</hi> 7) [<hi>As to the Rule
of our Faith</hi>] give me leave to reflect on the word
[<hi>OVR,</hi>] and thence to ask you, <hi>who are YOV?</hi> A
Question which I ask not of your Name or Sirname,
but of your Judgment (as you call it) of Discretion.
Are you a Socinian, an Arian, a Sabellian, an Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> or what are you? Are you a whole, or a
half, or a Quarter-nine-and thirty-Article Man? Do
you take them for Snares, or Fences, and when for the
one, and when for the other, and wherefore? These
words [<hi>The Rule of OVR Faith</hi>] make you all these
at once; for all these profess unanimously Scripture's
Letter is <hi>their</hi> Rule of Faith. Mr. <hi>G.</hi> when he came to
your House, imagin'd he was to treat with a <hi>Protestant,</hi>
or something like it, and to have learn'd from you
what Absolute Certainty you would assign for <hi>your,</hi>
(that is, <hi>Protestant</hi>) Faith; and you give him only a
Generical Latitudinarian Rule, common to all the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies
in the World. The Project of the Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
Bill was a trifle to this: It brings into one Fold
all the most enormous Straglers that have been since
Christ's time, nay Wolves, and Sheep and all. It blends
into one Mass the most heterogeneous and hitherto irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable
Sects. Nay, it miraculously makes Light
and Darkness very consistent, and <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Belial</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good Friends. For your own Credit sake then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
your kind of Protestants (if you be indeed
one of that Church) from that infamous Rabble of
stigmatiz'd Hereticks; and let us know what is the
Proper <hi>Difference</hi> that restrains that Notion of a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
Rule to your <hi>particular,</hi> as such a kind of <hi>Protestant,</hi>
and shew us that specifical Rule to be Absolutely Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
I say, <hi>such a kind;</hi> for even the word <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
too is a <hi>Subaltern Genus,</hi> and has divers <hi>Species,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:51893:14"/>
and 'tis doubted by many, who are no Papists, under
which Species you are to be rankt. But, why should I
vex you with putting you upon manifest Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
For the Letter being the common Rule to them
all, and, as daily experience shews us, variously explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that which particularizes it to belong specially to
this or that Sect, as its <hi>proper</hi> Rule, can be only this,
[<hi>According as my self, and those of my Iudgment under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
or interpret it.</hi>] The <hi>Difference</hi> then constituting
<hi>your Protestant Rule,</hi> as distinguisht from that of
those most abominable Heresies, can only be [<hi>as my
own Iudgment, or others of my side, thus or thus interpret
Scripture's Letter</hi>] and wriggle which way you please,
there it will and must end at last. Go to work then,
distinguish your self by your Ground of Faith, and then
make out this your proper Rule to be <hi>Absolutely Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
or <hi>Infallible;</hi> and then, who will not laugh at
you for attempting it, and assuming that to your self,
which you deny to God's Church, and preferring your
self as to the Gift of Understanding Scripture right,
before the whole body of those many and Learned
Churches in Communion with <hi>Rome?</hi> Nay, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Socinians too; without so much as pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make out to the World, that you have better
Means, either Natural or Supernatural, to interpret
those Sacred Oracles, than had the others.</p>
            <p>25. My last Exception is, that you pretend the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Scripture is a Rule of Faith for your People,
which not one in a Million, even of your own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
relies on, or ever thinks of relying on, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to make choice of their Faith, or determining what
to hold. This pretence of yours looks so like a meer
Jest, that I cannot perswade my self you are in earnest,
when you advance such a Paradox. For, 'tis manifest
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51893:14"/>
that while <hi>your</hi> Protestants are under Age, and not yet at
years of Discretion to judge, they simply believe their
Fathers and Teachers; that is, they follow the way of
Tradition, however misplac'd. And, when they
come to Maturity, pray tell us truly, how many of
your <hi>Sober Enquirers</hi> have you met with in your life,
who endeavour to abstract from all the prejudices they
have imbib'd in their Minoriy, and, reducing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
thoughts to an equal Balance of Indifferency,
do with a wise Jealousie, lest this Popish way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
immediate Fathers and Pastors should delude
them, as it has done the whole World formerly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to examin the Book of Scripture it self, read it
attentively, pray daily and fervently, that God's Spirit
would discover to them, whether what they have
learn'd hither to be true or no, and what is; and, in
a word, use all the Fallible means (for you allow them
no other) which your <hi>Sober Enquirers</hi> are to make
use of to find out their Faith? I doubt, if you would
please to answer sincerely, you would seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
you scarce ever met with such a one in your life;
that is, never met with any one who <hi>rely'd</hi> upon Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture's
Letter <hi>practically</hi> for his Rule of Faith, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you may have taught them to <hi>talk</hi> by rote. Can
any Man of Reason imagin, that all the Reformed in
<hi>Denmark</hi> or <hi>Sueden</hi> (to omit others) did light to be so
unanimously of one Religion meerly by means of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your <hi>Letter-Rule,</hi> and your <hi>Sober Enquiry?</hi> Or can
any be so blind, as not to see, that 'tis the following the
natural way of Tradition, or Childrens believing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
(that is, indeed, of Education) that such multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
in several places, continue still of the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion;
and that you consequently owe to this way,
which you so decry in Catholics, that any considerable
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51893:15"/>
number of you do voluntarily hang together at all?
And that those Principles of yours, which you take up
sor a shew, when you write against Catholics, would,
if put in practice, in a short time crumble to Atoms all
the Churches in the World? Perhaps, indeed, when
your Protestants come at Age, they may receive some
Confirmation from their Fathers and Preachers, quoting
Scripture-places against what Catholics hold, or what
they shall please to say they hold; and by the same
means come to believe a Trinity, the Godhead of Christ,
Christ's Body being absent in the Sacrament, and such
like; but do the Hearers and Learners make it their
business to use all careful disquisition (for a slubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
superficial diligence will not serve the turn in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of such high Concern) whether the Catholics, and
those great Scripturists, who deny those other Points,
do not give more congruous explications of those places
than their own Preachers do? unless they do this, or
something equivalent, 'tis manifest the Letter of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is not their Rule, but honest Tradition. And
that they do no such thing, is hence very apparent, that
they rest easily satisfi'd, and well appaid with their
Parson's interpretation of Scripture, they presently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it for right and good, and readily swallow that
sense, which some Learned Men, of their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
assign it, without thinking themselves oblig'd
to observe your Method of <hi>Sober Enquiry.</hi> You may
rail against the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as you will, for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
any to interpret Scripture against the Sense
which the Church holds; but 'tis no more than what
your Hearers perpetually practise, and the Preachers
too (for all their fair words) expect from them. And
I much doubt even your self (tho' your Principles
are the most pernicious for taking matters out of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51893:15"/>
Churche's, and putting them into private Hands, of
any Protestant, I ever yet read) would not take it very
well if some Parishioner of yours, presuming upon his
Prayers for Direction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should tell you that you err'd
in Interpreting Scripture, and that the Sense he gave it,
was sound and right Faith, yours wrong and Heretical;
and I would be glad to know what you would say to him,
according to your Principles, if he should hap to stand out
against you, that he understands Scripture to be plainly
against a Trinity and <hi>Christ</hi>'s Divinity, as <hi>Iohn Biddle</hi>
did against the Minister of his Parish, and the whole
Church of <hi>England</hi> to boot. 'Tis plain you ought to
cherish and commend him for standing firm to his Rule;
But I am much afraid you would be out of humor with
him, and esteem your self affronted. You may pretend
what you please of high Expressions given by Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
of Scripture's incomparable Excellency, and Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
for the Ends it was intended for, which we do not
deny to it; but I dare say, even your self do's not think,
that either the Ancient Faithful, or the Modern Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
meant that any of the <hi>Ecclesia credens,</hi> or Believing
Church, should have the liberty to Interpret Scripture
against the <hi>Ecclesia docens,</hi> or Teaching Church, <hi>i. e.</hi>
Pastors; or Coyn a Faith out of it, contrary to the
present or former Congregation of which he was a
Member.</p>
            <p>26. The sum is; 'Tis evident hence, that Tradition
of your Fathers and Teachers, and not Scriptures Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is indeed your <hi>Rule;</hi> That by it you Interpret
Scripture; which then only is call'd your Rule, and
made use of as such, when you are Disputing against
us; because having thus set it up, to avoid and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance
the Authority of the former Church you left,
you make account your own private Interpretation of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51893:16"/>
it may come to be thought Argumentative against the
great Body of those Churches from whose Communion
you departed; and yet you judge no private Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
should claim the same Priviledge against you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
affronting your great Learning, and Pastoral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
But I much wonder you should still venture
to call Scripture's Letter a Rule of Faith, having been
beaten from that Tenet so pitifully in <hi>Error Nonplust,</hi>
from Pag. 59. to Pag. 72. where I believe you may
observe divers Particulars requisit to be clear'd e're the
Letter can be in all regards <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> which the
Consent of all Christian Churches will never reach to
by their meer Authority, unless you will allow the
Sense of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Doctrin descending by Tradition, did
preserve the Copy substantially right and intire.</p>
            <p>27. Your pretended Rule of Faith then, being in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
the same that is challeng'd by all the Heretics in
the World, <hi>viz.</hi> Scripture's Letter Interpreted by your
selves; I will let you see in this following short Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
how far it is from being Absolutely Certain.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>God has left us some Way to know surely what
Christ and his Apostles taught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. <hi>Therefore this Way must be such, that they
who take it, shall arrive by it at the End it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for; that is, know surely what Christ and his
Apostles taught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. <hi>Scripture's Letter Interpretable by Private
Iudgments, is not that Way; for we experience Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
and Socinians</hi> (for example) <hi>both take
that Way, yet differ in such high Fundamentals, as the
Trinity, and the Godhead of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:51893:16"/>
IV. <hi>Therefore Scripture's Letter Interpretable by
Private Iudgments, is not the Way left by God to
know surely what Christ and his Apostles taught, or
surely to arrive at right Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. <hi>Therefore they who take only that Way, cannot
by it arrive surely at right Faith, since 'tis impossible
to arrive at the End, without the Means or Way that
leads to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>28. I do not expect any Answer to this Discourse, as
short as it is, and as plain and as nearly as it touches
your Copyhold; it may be serv'd as Mr. <hi>G's</hi> Argument
is, turn'd off so so with an Instance, if there be one at
hand; or, with what always is at hand, an Irony or
scornful Jest, your readiest, and, in truth, most useful
Servants: But you must be excus'd from finding any
Proposition or Inference to deny, or any thing, save the
Conclusion it self: Which, tho' it will not be fairly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
I cannot hope should be fairly admitted, unless I
could hope that Men would be more in love with Truth
than their Credit. Till Truth be taken a little more to
heart, Catholic Arguments will and must always be
faulty; but they are the most unluckily and crosly
faulty of any in the World; faulty still in the wrong
place. When fault is found in <hi>other</hi> Arguments, it is
always found in the <hi>Premisses;</hi> in these, 'tis found in
the <hi>Conclusion:</hi> In which, notwithstanding, all who
know any thing of a Conclusion, know there can be
no fault, if there be none in the Premisses. Indeed,
they shew that to be true which Men cannot endure
should be true; and that is their great and unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
fault. That you may not think I talk in the Air,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51893:17"/>
I declare openly, that you <hi>cannot</hi> Answer this Discourse,
unless you will call some unconcerning Return an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
and I engage my self to shew the Proposition true,
and the Inference good, which you shall pitch upon to
deny; And the Distinction, if you will make any, not
to purpose. The truth is, I engage for no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for I know beforehand you can no more Answer
now, than you could to <hi>Error Nonplust,</hi> or can prove an
Absolute Certainty in Protestant Faith.</p>
            <p>29. To return now to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> the Second thing which
you desire him to make good, is, <hi>That the Tradition from
Father to Son is an infallible Conveyance of Matters of Faith,
notwithstanding the Greek Church is charged by</hi> him <hi>with Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
which adher'd to Tradition.</hi> That is, you desire him to
prove over again, what you tell us your self he has prov'd
once already: For you tell us (<hi>p.</hi> 5), he prov'd, That
<hi>they</hi> [Traditionary Christians] <hi>could not innovate in
Faith, unless they did forget what they held the day before,
or out of malice alter it.</hi> Pray, when it is prov'd, that
the Conveyance of Faith by Tradition, excludes the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of Change in Faith, save by forgetfulness or
malice, is it not prov'd, That, where there could be
neither forgetfulness nor malice, there could be no
change in Faith? You do not, I suppose, desire he should
prove, that Men had always Memories, or that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were never malicious enough to damn themselves
and Posterity wittingly; and yet it can stick no where
else: If it can, said Mr. <hi>G.</hi> assign where. Now you
know very well, that a Conveyance which makes it
impossible that Faith should ever be chang'd, is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Conveyance; and the very thing is prov'd
which you desire should be prov'd. What reason has
Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to prove it a second time? And what reason
have you to desire it? If Proof would content you,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51893:17"/>
you have it already; but a second cannot hope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
you better than the first, unless it be worse.</p>
            <p>30. Yes, but you would have him prove, <hi>Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Greek Church</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>p.</hi> 7.) <hi>Notwithstanding?</hi>
Why do you think it is with Arguments as with Writs,
where the want of a <hi>Non obstante</hi> spoils all? When a
Truth is once prov'd, is it not prov'd, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Objections? And will any <hi>Notwithstanding</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it again? Will your <hi>Notwithstanding</hi> shew us
there was a time in which Men were not Men, nor acted
like Men? Will it shew us, that a thing which cannot
possibly be chang'd, may yet possibly remain not the
same? Will it shew us, that a Cause can be without
its Effect, or an Effect without its Cause? Will it shew
us, that a thing can be and not be at once? Unless it
can do such Feats as these, you may keep your <hi>Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>
to your self, for any Service it will do you here:
For all the <hi>Notwithstandings</hi> in the world cannot hinder
a thing which is true, from being true; nor the Proof
which proves it to be true, from being a Proof. Mr. <hi>G's</hi>
Proof shews, that Tradition from Father to Son is an
Infallible Conveyance of Faith as plainly as that Men are
Men: And would you persuade us with the Rhetorick
of your <hi>Notwithstanding,</hi> that we do not see what we
see? Tho' you had brought twenty of them instead of
one, we could see nothing by them, but that you had a
good Fancy; for they shew us nothing of the Object,
nor offer at it. You shew us not how the Operations
of Human Nature should be suspended in our present
Case, nor any thing which should or could suspend
them, but would have us believe Men were prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
forgetful or malicious, purely for the sake of an
Imagination of yours. I pray rub up afresh your old
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51893:18"/>
Logical Notions, and reflect whether it were ever heard
of in University Disputes, that when an Argument is
advanc'd, the Defendant is allow'd to make Objections
against it; and instead of Answering, bid the Arguer
prove his Conclusions to be true, <hi>Notwithstanding</hi> all
his Objections? Consider how perfectly this confounds
the Offices of the Disputant and Defendent, and makes
all Regular Discourse impossible. Consider how this
new Method of yours destroys the very possibility of ever
concluding any thing that is, the very Faculty of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning;
For Objections being generally multipliable
without end, if all of them must be Solv'd e're any
Argument concludes, nothing will be concluded, nor
any Conclusion admitted: And so a long so Farewel
to Rational Nature. Consider that Truth is built on its
own Intrinsecal Grounds, and not on the Solving Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.
For your own Credits sake then with Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men and Logicians, do not seek to evade with <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandings,</hi>
but Answer fairly and squarely to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
as it lies: Consider, that who has found the
<hi>Cause,</hi> has found the <hi>Effect.</hi> Mr. <hi>G.</hi> has found us a
<hi>Cause</hi> of Infallible Conveyance, and therefore has
shew'd us an Infallible Conveyance. You pretend,
that tho' there was the Cause, there was not the
Effect; and this 'tis known beforehand cannot be,
and you knew it as well as any body: But you knew
likewise there was no saving your Stakes without
playing a new Game; and therefore, give you your
due, did all that could be done, in trying to divert
our sight from a Matter plain before us, and amuse us
us with a Matter of Fact, which you are sure will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
enough, by that time it is handled long enough.
The Terms you put, viz. <hi>Tradition, Error,</hi> and the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51893:18"/>
               <hi>Greek Church,</hi> must needs bring into Dispute, whether
such and so many Quotations, or some one or two
Men disclaiming their Tenet to be a Novelty, be a
Proof of Tradition from Father to Son; whether
the Error be any Error; and whether, and for how
much, an Error in <hi>Faith,</hi> and how much of it belongs
to <hi>Divinity;</hi> whether the Greek Church be ingag'd by
a Citation from a Greek Author; of two that be
cited, one against another, which shall be preferr'd,
and thought to speak the sense of his Church;
and which is a Latiniz'd, which a frank Grecian.
And who shall see through the Mists which these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
will raise? More too will fall in in process of time:
There will be wrangling about the sense of Words,
the propriety of Phrases, the preference of Readings,
and twenty such important quarrels; which will tire
out every body, and satisfie no body. In short, you
saw that if you could perswade People not to think
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Infallible, till all be said, which
will occur to be said of the Greek Church, you are
safe enough; For Doomsday will come before that
day. Till then you may carry it with a shew of Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
because there must be abundance of Greek ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And this is all which can come of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
and I wish it were not all you had in your
Eye.</p>
            <p>31. In the mean time you have not answer'd Mr.
<hi>G.</hi> because you have found no fault in any Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or in the Inference of his Argument; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it rests with you to answer it. He has answer'd
you; because he has found this fault with your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which you make your Antecedent, that it is
not true; and that the Greek Church did not at once
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51893:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
err in faith, and adhere to Tradition: and therefore
it rests again with you to prove it; and yet while you
are <hi>Debtor</hi> both ways, you call upon him to <hi>pay.</hi> Ere
we part, Take this along with you, that the Debt
which you are precisely bound to satisfie, first is to
answer his Argument, and till you do this, you can
claim no right to <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>Argue.</hi>
