         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

from places of profit, trust, and honor, wherof the Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots would never be thought worthy, if such (as the penal laws exclude) did conform to the Church of England. And when any one doth becom a conformist, none is more sorry for his Conversion then they that pretended to design and effect it by persecution; because the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Proselits doth diminish the profit, and destroy the projects they had of begging Recusants fines and forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Your Genious and generosity, <hi>My Lord,</hi> are so much above these base, and destructive ways, that you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com the refuge of all persons afflicted for their Conscience. To be popular vpon this score, and to be the patron of so numerous and conscientious a party, as it is the effect of your Wisdom and vertue, so it is a just cause for your Prudent Prince to confide in your Ministery, and to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance your popularity.</p>
            <p>I do acknowledge, <hi>My Lord,</hi> that in som districts of the Church of Rome, men are punished for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science or contumacy, by a Court of Iustice, called the <hi>Inquisition.</hi> How worthy the <hi>Inquisition</hi> is of imitation, I leave to the Judgment of others: But this I do maintain in my book, that our penal and Sanguinary statuts are much more severe and vnreasonable then the Canon law, wherupon the Inquisitors Sentences are grounded. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Canons against Innovators of Religion, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as ancient as <hi>Constantin</hi> the first Christian Emperor.


<pb facs="tcp:38521:4"/>
2. They seemed so conscientious and convenient to all his Catholick Successors, and other Soveraigns, that they have incorporated into the laws of their Dominions, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, wherby the Inquisitors are directed to punish here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, or pretended reformations of Religion; and therfore the first Protestant Reformers in England durst not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish their doctrin vntill these statuts against heretiks had bin repeald by Act of Parliament 1. <hi>Edu.</hi> 6.3. the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors pretend not to act by human commission against mens opinions; they proceed as spiritual Pastors, and the Apostles Successors, and therfore endeavor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the obstinat <hi>Nonconformists</hi> by producing thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of learned and lawful witnesses to proue, that the Roman faith is built vpon the very same Apostolical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations reasons and miracles, wherby the primitive Church and the Catholick world had bin converted from Paganism to Christianity. But our English penal and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary statuts punish men for adhering to the ancient and authentick Religion of Christendom, and for not embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a new interpretation of Scripture, for which there is no credible testimony, or proof, that it is the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical; neither is there as much as a pretence of any miracles to confirm Protestancy, or that monstrous Shee-suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which was imposed vpon men, only to make <hi>An Bullens</hi> daughter Queen of England, and to exclude the right heirs and now reigning family from the Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:38521:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>Notwithstanding this great disparity, <hi>My Lord,</hi> between the severity of the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> and of our penal statuts, J wish both equally excluded from this Monarchy; and that no compulsion be used against Conscience, but that every one be left to choos his own Religion, according to his capacity; it being likely that none will have a greater care of saving any mans soul, then himself, who is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therin, then any other, whether Prince, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Pastor. That God may inspire into every soul that one faith without which none is saved, ought to be the only common prayer imposed vpon us; for that by this vniformity of prayer every man is left to his own <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,</hi> which is much more agreable to our genious then that of Spain; and more likely to make us agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our selves, then any penal or Sanguinary statuts; all which I humbly submit to <hi>your Graces</hi> Iudgment, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging your Pardon for this trouble, and your protection for this Treatise.</p>

by God in order to the performance of his <hi>Declaration at Bredà</hi> for liberty of conscience, then in order to the non-performance of so publick and solemn a promise.</p>
            <p>And albeit I cannot say that our desired peace will be so absolutly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by liberty of conscience in England, as it is in other Countries by the Tenets and vniformity of the Roman Religion: yet is it manifest, that persecution for promoting Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick Protestancy will rather increas our confusions, then work our conversion; not only becaus the non-conformists, are the more numerous party, and by consequence can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be forc't to obey laws against their Consceince; but also becaus it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by the very Prelaticks, that Christians may be saved though they do not conform to the Church of England; nay they must grant, that such as do conform to its doctrin and disciplin, may be damned for so doing, becaus it is a fallible (and by consequence for ought they or any one knows a fals) Church. That a Church believed by the members therof to be infallible, and the only way of salvation, doth persecute such as revolt from its faith and obedience is thought by some a rational (though by me a rigorous) practise: but that the Church of England, wherof it is a fundamental Article, that the whole visible Church, or all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Congregations (and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it self) hath erred, or may err in doctrin, should persecute such as revolt from it, or men of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry persuasion, for having a stronger faith, grounded vpon Christs promis of never forsaking vs, and a better opinion of Gods providence, and of their own Churches doctrin, seems not agreable to the rules of the Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, nor of human prudence. For, whether the Protestants sectaries per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion of their own privat spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, or the Roman Catholicks belief of their general Councells in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, be true or fals, the Church of England will never be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade or prove, that any Christians ought to be persecuted by penal and sanguinary statuts, for not exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that assurance of Divine faith which themselves are persuaded they have, for a bare Prelatick probability of the same faith; or for a confessed possibility of being mistaken in the doctrin of salvation. Seing therfore of two evils the least ought to be chosen, and that if liberty of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be an evil, it is a less one then persecution, becaus it will cause less dangers and disturbances in the Nations, then laws which force the Prelatick probability, and vniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:

And though it be a common and true saying, that the greatest Clerks are not the wisest men, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, not so fit to prescribe rules for governing as wordlings that are not Divines, or as wranglers that are Lawyers; yet I humbly conceive that when the misfortunes of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceed not from want of jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gment or resolution in the Councel, but from want of faith, or (which is the same) from an acknowledged vncertainty of faith in the Church, Catholick Divines (seing we are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous in matters of Christian belief and do persuade the best part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom that our Church is infallible in the same; and if heard, we doubt not to prevail with these British Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions also to credit vs in that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant point, however improbable, it may seem to them at first sight) I hope this supposed, we Catholick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines may without offence pretend to be better able to shew and salve the spiritual sore of this state, then any Protestant Statists or schoolmen, who want sufficient unity, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith in themselves, to make their cure and care credible to others.</p>
            <p>Seing therfore the foundation not only of Christian Religion, but of a peaceable government, doth consist in a firm persuasion of the people go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, that the doctrin professed and established by Law is infallible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of Divine inspiration, not of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man invention; and by consequence that the decrees and determinations of the State (which in all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought to be proportioned to the doctrin of its Church) are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and intended for the common good; not designs, or devices to fool the multitude, feed the ministery, or favor the soveraign; and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidence of falshood, but vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of truth, in matters of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, must needs render the Church and State that profess such an vncertainty, so weak and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the subjection to either can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwise secured then by the force and fear of a standing Army; and that such a subjection doth savor

            <p>It's now above a Century of years since the great Statsmen of England have employed their wit and indust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in devising how to setle Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy vpon Protestancy; but (vnder favor) we Catholick Divines do shew (and all Protestants may suspect by the success) that in so great an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair they have proceeded like vnskill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Architects, that busy themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves altogether in proportioning and adorning the superstructures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inquiring into the strength and solidity of the foundation: They mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took sand for stone, fals translations for true Scripture, a lay ministery for a lawful Clergy, a temporal sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty for a spiritual supremacy: They layd for the first stone of their <hi>New</hi> fabrik, a sworn spiritual rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion (the oath of supremacy) against the chief Prelat and common Father of all Christendom <hi>S.

If notwithstanding the legal and long possession or prescription, of a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prem spiritual superiority, the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop of Rome may (by the principles and prerogative of Protestancy) be reformed, and reduced to be only Patriarck of the West, or a privat Bishop; what temporal soveraignity can be absolute or secure among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants?

That the Zealous and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise sort of Protestants did convene, and covenant against the King and


<pb facs="tcp:38521:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Bishops, for endeavoring to deprive them of this their Evangelical liberty of the Reformation, was but a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral result of the same fundamental principle of Protestancy. That <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cromwell</hi> by counterfaiting Zeal and piety, and by humoring the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat spirits and interpretations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Sectaries, did ruin his King, and rais himself from a mean subject, to be absolut Soveraign, needs not to be enumerated among the casualties, or favors of fortun, there being not any thing more feasible then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne a Protestant Monarch by his own Religion; because it is nothing but an arbitrary interpretation of Scripture, and by consequence gives such a latitud for justifying rebellion vpon the score of refining the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by a new sense of Scripture, that every Protestant (without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the principles, but rather stic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the prerogative of Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy) may embrace any more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and popular sense of the Text, however so prejudicial it prove to his lawful Soveraign, or however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it be to the sense of Scripture established by law, or by acts of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</p>
            <p>But, that notwithstanding so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny warnings and wars as we have had, so great and grave a Councel as the Parliament of England, should think fit to continue the same vnsuccessfull cours of setling Monarchy, the same statuts wherby Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the right heirs and now reigning family, the same fundamental Tenet of the Reformation wherby every subject is made interpreter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by consequence Iudge of his Soveraign, and of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which must be subordinat to Scripture) is not only to me, but to the Christian world, the cause of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test admiration. And becaus every Religion hath some incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible mysteries, I will number this among those of Protestancy; but withall must beg pardon for thinking that it is rather <hi>against,</hi> then <hi>above</hi> reason; for, to grant the principle, wherupon the independency or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of every Protestant subject is grounded; and yet to make Acts of Parliament (in favor of the Church of England) against the same subjects independency, or Soveraignty, is a kind of contradiction. So discerning a people as the English, can hardly be hindred from seing the manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion that is between the Protestant subjects liberty of interpreting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the not submitting their judgments, or actions to any human laws or Government, if contrary to their own interpretations. And so Religious and scrupulous a people as


<pb facs="tcp:38521:10"/>
they are, will not be easily persuaded, that an Act of Parliament is sufficient to dispense with their obligation and inclination of sticking to that funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Tenet of Protestancy.</p>
            <p>I confess that in some Countreys (as in France) the Protestant people are now kept in so great subjection, that they dare not go so far as the principles of Protestancy lead; and in other more Northern Climats, they are of so dull and peaceable a consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that they want either curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to examin, or courage to assert the priviledges of the reformation; and therfore are apt to submit their Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (by an implicit faith) to the opinions of <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or of their own Clergy. But with us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re every one thinks his own spirit as divin, and his Iudgment as good, as that of <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or of the Bishops; where the stoutness and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borness of our nature makes us ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon any thing whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These are some of the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies whervnto the government is lyable by the principles and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Protestancy; and though I humbly conceive that nothing but liberty of conscience can content so many dissenting parties, yet I am of opinion that before such a liberty be granted, some previous conferences concerning Religion, (like that of Hampton Court in K. <hi>James</hi> his reign) be allowed, but without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding from those Conferences Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, or any party that will offer to give reason for their Religion. For, as to accept of a <hi>Bill of comprehension</hi> before men examin the consequences and qualifications of the Religions comprehended may breed greater confusion; so to except any Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion from being examined, doth argue that in our Conferences we consult not conscience.

Now, if the Protestant Bishops think that the Catholick Bishops were legally and lawfully dispossessed of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and their Doctrin legaly and lawfully condemned, and changed by <hi>Luther, Calvin, Cranmer,</hi> or the Prelaticks interpretation of Scripture, confirmed by Act of Parliament; how can they imagin to make the world believe that it is now either a sin or sacriledge, to be dispossessed themselves of the Church revenues, by an Act of Parliament, confirming as probable an interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as theirs, or as that of <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi> is; especially seing they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess their doctrin fallible, and that the revenues were never intended (by those that gave them) for preaching or promoting any kind of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy? Doubtless this incoherency, and their backwardness in reasoning of Religion, will render their Zeal for the Church revenues, as much suspected, as their forwardnes in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting tender Consciences, hath renderd their persons odious.</p>
            <p>And that there may be no ground for them to work vpon, nor to doubt of the Roman Catholick Clergy's loyalty and sincerity in petitioning, and pressing for publick conferences of Religion, it will be found (I doubt not) in case any such security be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, or valued, that we shall as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily now, as in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> reign, resign all the right we can pretend to the revenues of the Church, and (as then) bestow them vpon the Crown, for the use and ease of our Country.

            <p>In the conclusion of this Preface I must endeavor to excuse the bulk of my book, and the positivenes of my Assertions. For the first, I could har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly draw into a narrower compass so transcendent a subject; and yet I have placed in the end of this Treatise an <hi>Index,</hi> wherin the substance of the whole book is contained; to the end every one may find out with ease any point he hath a mind to read. As to the positivenes of my assertions, most of them being articles of my faith, or deductions from my <hi>Creed,</hi> I could not but utter them in the <hi>Tone</hi> of our infallible Church. But becaus I speak to Protestants that condemn our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, I attempt to demonstrat, their censure against the same is as rash, as they fancy our belief is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. J must also ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that it is part of my design, to diminish the authority of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and Prelatick writers; but seing my arguments are taken out of their own writings, and are no other then their wilfull and vndeniable falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Scripture and Fathers, I hope none that detests so horrid a crime, will condemn my Censure, or defend their credit. Whether I have bin faithfull in setting down their falsifications, I must submit to the Iudgment of my Readers, as also beg pardon for intermedling with so much of government as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily depends of Religion, and ought to be proportioned therunto; our Protestant Statesmen, will not only pardon, but protect me, when they reflect vpon the impossibility there is of regulating the motions, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing the mutinies of a body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litik,


<pb facs="tcp:38521:11"/>
by a faith so vncertain as that of the fallible Church of England; or by a rule of Religion so appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to rebellion, as the letter of Scripture is, when left to every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat mans arbitrary interpretation.</p>

                     </note> I see no difference between it and that of the heretiks which himselfe derides, and condemns [<hi>Pag:</hi> 257.] but that the Heretiks say he did shew his body to the assembled Disciples through some chinck of the wall, or through the Key-hole of the doore; and M.r Bonart says Christ shot or thrust his Body in, through the indiscernable pores which are in euery body; and how the whole or the parts of a human body (such as that of Christ then was, and now is) can be conueyed entire through one or many such litle and distant pores, without loosing all human shape, (if a perfect penetration be not allow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed) I do not understand.

                     </gap>loud of Christ, because the greatness and figure of the parts of <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> are changed, though al the rest doth remain. If therfore the greatness, figure, (and by consequence the shape) of Christs Body, and its parts, be changed, or proportioned to the pores of the penetrated body (as they must of necessity be before they can pass or be shot through them) Christs Body, and the parts therof, do loose the substance, as well as the shape of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body, according to M.r Bonartes doctrin.

If an <hi>Atom</hi> be so thick that a corporeal instrument may touch one side therof, and not touch or reach the other side, there is ground and room enough for Gods po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to separat one side from the other; for if one side of a <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Atom</hi> can be wrought upon independently of the other, it may exist also, or be moued, independently of the same, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence is distinct and separable from it. And indeed, if to be toucht, and <hi>not to be toucht</hi> be not contradictions sufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve real distinction between the sides, or extremes so denominated, no kind of contradictions can inferre real distinction.</p>

and not <hi>toucht</hi> argues only a verbal (not a real) distinction in the <hi>Atom</hi> wherof one side is realy toucht, the other not realy toucht; and to pretend that this is cleerly deduced from the first notion or nature of a <hi>Body,</hi> or <hi>extense</hi>; because forsooth, the notion of <hi>Parts</hi> must suppose not only one <hi>extense</hi> but many,<note place="margin">pag. 297.</note> with a certain manner and measure of extension; and that therfore an <hi>Atom</hi> may be extended, and yet not partible: To maintain this discourse I say, seemeth to me a begging of the question, and as difficult as any other opinion in this matter. For 1. It is not easy to conceiue how any extension whatsoeuer, can include in its first notion or nature, an exclusion of division. 2. In M.r Bonart his own principles it seemeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible how any <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Atom</hi> that hath so much extension [that is so much length, bredth, and profundity] as to be capable of being toucht on the one side, with out being toucht on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is not composed of parts distinct one from the other. For, [pag: 303.] he grants that if in the <hi>expansion</hi> or exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of an <hi>Atom</hi> did appeare any little <hi>line</hi> or <hi>point,</hi> that line or point would conclude a real distinction of parts in the Atom. Now why the touch of any corporeal instrument [suppose of a Painters pencil framed and managed by Gods hand] may not leaue an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of it selfe [which impression you may call a <hi>line</hi> or <hi>point</hi>] in that place or side of the <hi>Atom</hi> that is toucht, no reason can be giuen; and by consequence there can not be any for denying real distinction, and division of the parts in the <hi>Atom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly: It must be concluded that the <hi>Atoms</hi> are either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, or penetrated: Because if they be not partible, they do touch each other wholy, and euery where, according to their dimension, and extensions; and if they touch in such a manner, they are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated, or in one and the same place: And if they be penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or penetrable, impenetrability can not be the essence or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Body which they compose, and wherof it only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists. This is only sayd [by the way] to shew that the best wits may mistake the notion and nature not only of a spirit, but also of a Body; and that they are not the best Guides when they steere themselues and others more by their own privat discourses, then

Now what ground Protestants can have to believe that the Devill hath altered his ould custom, or why they should prefer the Devills


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38521:37"/>
Scriptural interpretation, before that of the visible Church, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and Fathers, is not intelligible. 2. It is not credible that if all the visible Church of Christians did err in professing Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and committed Idolatry by hearing Mass, and adoring the Sacrament, that the Devills would dissuade them from that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous Religion; his design and desire is to seduce men, not to reduce them to the way of saluation. 3. It is not likely that God would compel the Devill to be chief instrument of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Catholik Religion, and Church; in the ould law he never committed so great a charg unto him, he employd ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men and Prophets to convert the Iews and Pagans; 'tis strang that in the law of grace the Devil should become an Apostle. When <hi>Dives</hi> (who was but the Devills Camerade) desired lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve to come into the world, and preach to his Brethren, God did not judg him a fit Messenger, or Missioner; it was answered that his brethren ought to believe <hi>Moyses</hi> and the Prophets, that is the Church, and the Ministers therof. And though this be a <hi>parable,</hi> it contains real doctrin, wherby we are instructed that Gods Church would never be so low brought, as to stand in need of Preachers from Hell.

Untill <hi>Luther</hi> had conferred with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, he durst not vent this principle; he appealed indeed from the Pope to a generall Councell, and from a generall Councell (when he perceiued one was summon'd) to the <hi>Church diffusiue</hi>; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his conference with Satan, he ventured to say: <note n="[a]" place="margin">

Our interpretation is the sence of the holy Ghost, that which others bring, though they bee great, though many, proceedeth from the spirit of Sathan, and from a distracted mind.</hi> The reasons why <hi>Luther</hi> and all Protestants run this desperat course, is, because hauing examined and found that orthodox an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity was Roman Catholik, and not one Church, parish, or person ever Protestant, before 1517. they are inforced to maintain (by mis-interpreting Scripture) that the whole visible Church er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that God sent them to reform it.</p>
                     <p>The second principle of Protestancy is, to admit of no rule of faith but only Scripture, of no other infallible Judg of the letter or sence of Scripture, or of any controversies in Religion, but every particular <note n="[b]" place="bottom">

The first office of a Priest is to preach

the word &amp;c. But this is common to all: next is to baptyze; and this also may do euen women <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The third is to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat bread and wyn; but this also is common to all, no less then Priests; and this I avouch by the authority of Christ him-self, saying, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me</hi>; this Christ spook to all there present, and to come afterwards; whosoever should eat of that bread, and drink of that wine &amp;c. This also is wittnessed by <hi>S. Paul,</hi> who 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. repeating this, applyeth it to all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, making them all as him-self was, that is to say, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrators; &amp;c. If then that which is greather then all, be given indifferently to all men and women, I meane the word and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, then that which is less, I mean <hi>to consecrat the supper, is also given to them.

                     <p>With <hi>Luther</hi> in this doctrin concurred all the reformed Churches, even the Prelatick of England seems to approve ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the 23. and 25. articles of Religion; and <hi>M.r Horn</hi> Bishop of Winchester in the Harbrough An. 1559. n. 2. saith concerning the Ministery, Preaching, or Priesthood of women: <hi>Jn this point


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38521:47"/>
we must vse a certain moderation, and not absolutly in every-wise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr women herein, &amp;c. J pray you what more vehemency vseth</hi> S. Paul <hi>in forbidding women to preach, then in forbidding them to vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their heads; and yet you know in the best reformed Churches of all Germany, all the maids be bareheaded.</hi> They who know this to have bin the Doctrin of <hi>Luther,</hi> and of the reformed Churches, are not so much startled at Q. Elizabeths spiritual headship of the Church, nor at the Act of Parliament 8. Eliz. 1. wherin it is declared that she and her successors may authorise <hi>any person whatsoever</hi> (whether lay man or woman) <hi>to exercise any spiritual jurisdiction or power</hi> in any matter whatsoever, even of consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Archbishops, Bishops, Priests &amp;c. And albeit afterwards (<hi>art.</hi> 27.) there hath bin an explanation made concerning the supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, excluding from the Church a <hi>shee; or Lay Ministery and Priesthood</hi>; yet the words of the Oaths both of supremacy and Episcopal homage, and the laws of the land (especialy this Act 8. Eliz. 1.) maks it most manifest, that even Prelatik protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy maks the temporal Lay Soveraign to haue the source of all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual power and jurisdiction; and that the letters Patents of the Kings of England, directed to <hi>any person whatsoever,</hi> renders him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of consecrating Archbishops, Bishops, Priests &amp;c. as may be seen in the aforesaid Act of Parliament. And <hi>if any person whatsoever</hi> may by vertue of the Kings letters patents consecrat Bishops, Priests, &amp;c. without doubt the King that gives that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual authority, and the Lay men, or women so authorised, must of necessity have the caracter of Episcopacy and Priesthood which they communicat to others: vnless it be maintained that men can give what they have not themselves.</p>
                     <p>Thus was Protestancy begun, principled, and propagated, by <hi>Martin Luther</hi> and his Disciples; and because their Sects agree in nothing so vnanimously as in protesting against the doctrin of the Roman Catholik Church, and the Imperial Decrees enacted in behalf therof, though some Lutherans only (exhibiting the Confession of their faith at Auspurg) were the Protesters, yet all others who pretend a Reformation, like the name, and call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

                  <p>And the first protestant Reformers abroad (part of whose design was to get all spiritual jurisdiction rather into their own hands then into the hands of their temporal Soveraigns) were much troubled at K. <hi>Henry's</hi> supremacy, and <hi>Calvin</hi> writ a smart though short treatise against it, and no Protestants make a lay Prince spiritual head of a Church, but our English Prelaticks.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding that the lateness of the discovery together with K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8 motives of his supremacy made it so incredible that no Catholick Soveraign would assume to him-self that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, nor any forraign Protestants approve therof, yet his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty made most of his English subjects swear that, which neither themselves nor the world could believe; for had it bin any way probable by Scripture, History, or Tradition, that temporal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns (as such) are spiritual Superiours, how is it possible that all Christian Princes before <hi>Henry</hi> 8. should be so short-sighted, and stupid in their own interest, and in a matter of so great consequence, as not to see a thing so obvious, and aduantagious?

Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and persuade England that his Daughter <hi>Marys</hi> reign would eclipse the light of the ghospel, which then began to shine. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had made the Protector so odious, that none could endure to hear his name, or to live vnder his government, he thought it a proper tyme to establish by Parliament that new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith, which he knew could not be effected without the consent and concurrence of that great Assembly. And though he was not ignorant of the absurdities contained in the best of the new reformations, yet because since the setlement of the spiritual headship of our Kings, he perceived the common people might be led any way, and that an Act of Parliament was held suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make them believe the ancient Christian Religion was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane; and that any protestant reformation was the primitive and Apostolick faith; he wrought so much by the feare of the army and the Kings authority, that albeit in the first Parliament and year of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. reign, nothing more could be obtained in favour of Protestancy, but an indemnity for the preachers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from penalties enacted by the ancient laws against married Priests, and Heriticks; and a repeal of the English Statuts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Imperial Edicts against heresies; yet in the second year, and Parliament of <hi>Edward the VI.</hi> It was carried (though by few votes, and after a long debate of aboue four months) that the <hi>Zuinglian,</hi> or <hi>Sacramentarian</hi> reformation should be the Religion of England.</p>

And when the news was come, that both houses had ordered they should be vnderstood <hi>figurativly,</hi> and not <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teraly, Peter Martyr</hi> said he admired how any man could be of an other opinion, though he knew not the day before what would be his own.

                     <p>These were the men who framed the 39. Articles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion the Liturgy and the Book of Sacraments, rits, and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Protestant Church of England: and though it may seem incredible that a Iew, an Atheist, a Contemporiser or meer Polititian, a Presbiterian, a rigid Lutheran, half-Lutheran and an Anti-Lutheran, or Sacramentarian, should all agree to make one Religion, yet when men do but dissemble, and deliver opinions to please others, and profit themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have no Religion at all, they may without difficulty concurr in some general points of Christianity, and frame negative articles impugning the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular truths therof. This was the case of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. For though <hi>Hooper,</hi> and <hi>Rogers</hi> were prity obstinat in the Presbiterian, or Zuinglian doctrin of the Sacrament, and prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therin so far by the Protectors countenance, as to reform the common praier-Book, and to confound the caracter of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy with single Presbitery, as if there had bin no real di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between both, nor no imposition of Episcopal hands required for either, but only a bare election of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Magistrat; yet rather then loose the revenues of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Bishopricks, they were content (contrary to their solemn confederacy) to connive at the Episcopal disciplin, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious decency of surplises, square Caps, and Rochets; The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of Priests and Bishops they were content to admit of in the common praier-Book, so the caracter were not mentioned in their new form of ordaining them, but rather declared not to

And as for <hi>Ochinus</hi> the Jew, <hi>Bucer</hi> the Atheist, and the rest of the protestant Divines, their vots as wel as their livelyhoods depended of <hi>Cranmer</hi> his wil and pleasur.

                        <hi>Hooper</hi> and <hi>Rogers</hi> agreed vpon an ecclesiastical Government inconsistent with Monarchy; which was, <hi>that over every</hi> 10. <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or Parishes in England there should be a learned Superintendent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, who should have faithful readers vnder him, and that all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Priests should clean be put out:</hi> And to draw all publick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of state and Religion to them-selves, they composed a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise to prove: <hi>That it is lawful for any privat man to reason and writ against a wicked Act of Parliament, and vngodly Councel, &amp;c.</hi> see Fox pag. 1357. col. 1. num. 72.

And truly it is a hard case that Scripture should warrant our worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Prophets, or recommending our selves to the Prayers of Saints, when they convers with vs vpon earth; and yet that it should not be lawful for vs to do the same when they ar in heaven; as if their enjoying the presence and sight of God, did diminish their dignity, or charity. Or as if a Saint in Gods glory were not as fit an object and as capable of our Religious worship as a Prophet, Apostle or Bishop is in this world, to whom we kneel out of the religious respect we own to their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual caracter, or Ecclesiastical dignity, though their natural qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities deserve not such respect.

And if it be not only lawful but comendable to kneel to his Grace, or at least to others who are true Bishops, and to shew a religious respect of the like nature to his picture or presence; and that all this may bee don without daunger of Idolatry, or of derogating from the Deity; I see no reason why men should condemn in vs, the like worship of Saints in their Images, or Reliques. It is not the outward action, but the inward intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that maks the worship unlawful. So long as we do not adore Images as Gods, or Idols, we may bow and kneel to them with as much ceremony, as Protestants do to their Prelats, or Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal pictures. The simplest Papist can hardly be so stupid by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or at least so destitut of instruction, as to believe a stock or stone, can be God; or that there is no difference between the worship due to Saints, (whom they know to be but Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants) and the worship due to their Master and Creator.</p>
                  <p>The 23.

But they were loath to explain their meaning in this particular, for feare of scandalizing their brethren abroad, that admit of no such Supremacy in temporal Princes.</p>
                  <p>In the 24. Article they make it a point of the Protestant faith, that Scripture expresly commands the publick prayers and ministring of the Sacraments not to be in Greek, Latin, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew (wherin the Scriptures were written) because the common people vnderstand not these languages, but vnder pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation must be in English, Dutch, Irish, Welsh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, it were not lawful for a Priest or publick Minister, to offer Sacrifice, or negotiat for a multitude of iliterat people in languages they do not vnderstand; or as if it were not sufficient for them to vnderstand, that in publick or privat prayers, they thank God for his benifits, and crave new favours. So that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Article, a Greek Priest cannot offer publick prayers for the Latins, or even his own Grecians, who vnderstand not the learned Greeck, nor a latin Priest for the Grecians, or any other nation that vnderstands not Latin; neither is it sufficient that God who alone is able to grant what is demanded, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the petition, and heare the publick Minister, but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily required that the demand be made in a barbarous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, because the common people vnderstand no other.</p>
                  <p>In the 25. Article they cut of five of the seaven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as not being Sacraments of the Ghospel, or ordained by Christ; this extravagancy of doctrin was thought necessary for the disciplin of the protestant Churches, which despairing of


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:38521:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a succession of true Bishops, excluded the Episcopal Caracter, and all Sacraments that had dependency therof.</p>
                  <p>In the 26. Article they endeavour to excuse their own lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and liberty (though by inculcating truth) to wit, that the effects of the Sacraments are not taken away, by the defects of the Ministers.</p>
                  <p>In the 27. they condemn (against their own principle in the 6. Article) their Brethren the Anabaptists, for not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing their children: which error cannot be confuted by Scripture without Tradition.</p>
                  <p>In the 28. they tel vs it is plain in Scripture that when Christ sayd <hi>This is my Body,</hi> he meant <hi>This is not my Body,</hi> and therfore that <hi>Transsubstantiation</hi> cannot be proved by holy Writ: if they can prove by Scripture that Christ means the contrary of what he speaks we shal confess that neither transsubstantiation nor any other thing can be proved by holy Writ, but only this, that Scripture cannot be vnderstood, nor be a rule of faith.</p>
                  <p>They add that the mean, wherby the Body of Christ is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualy received and taken in the supper, is faith. To receive, and eat spiritualy the Body of Christ (if it signifies any thing) must signifie that we ought to believe that the Body of Christ is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and eaten. And if this belief be true (as it must, if it be Divine) then Christ's Body is realy received and eaten, though in a spiritual manner, that is in a manner not perceptible by our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.

the whole visible ancient Church, that hath bin confirmed by continual and vndeniable Miracles; they can give no assurance or probability of them selves being or continuing in the right way of saluation, because if all the Roman Catholick Churches did err in doctrin, how can their reformations pretend not to be subject to the same mis-fortun or mistake? And if the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed frailty and fallibility of the Church of Rome be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause to question and condemn it's authority, how can the Church of England, or any other Protestant congregation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act from their Sectaries, greater respect, and obedience, then the first reformers gave to their Roman Superiours?

As for the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which the Prelatick religion receives from the laws of the land, that gives but little advantage, seing the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick doctrin hath bin confirmed by the temporal laws of every Kingdom, Country and Citty, besor, and at the tyme that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy succeeded, and prevailed; and yet that legality was not valued by the Reformers.</p>
                  <p>The 35.

                  <p>The ancient Fathers, as also the second Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> have long since declared the Protestant Doctrin against Images to be heresy, and the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> confirms the same decree of <hi>Nice,</hi> and demonstrats how far that the Catholick doctrin of worshiping Images is from any danger of Idolatry. The words

of the Councel <hi>sess.</hi> 25. are:
<q>The Images of Christ, of the Virgin Mother of God, and of other Saints are to be had and retained, especialy in Churches; and that due honour is to be imparted vnto them, not for that any <hi>Divinity</hi> is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be in them, or vertue, for which they are to be worshipt or that any thing is to be begg'd of them, or that hope is to be put in them, as in tyms past the Pagans did, who put their trust in Idols; but because the honour which is exhibited to them, is referr'd to the first pattern which they resemble. So that by the Images which we kiss, and before which we vncover our heads, and kneele, we adore Christ and his Saints, whose likness they beare; we reverence that which is ratified by the Decrees of Councels, especialy of the second of <hi>Nice,</hi> against the impugners of Images.</q>

                     </note> Yet this wil not serve their turn, for before they can have a true Clergy, they must change the Caracter of the Ordainers, as wel as the form of ordination: a valid form of ordination, pronounced by a Minister not validly ordained, gives no more caracter then if it had continued invalid, and never bin altered: The present Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Bishops, who changed the form of their own Ordination vpon their Adversaries objections of the invalidity therof, might as wel submit to be ordained by Catholick Bishops, as alow (by altering the from after so long a tyme, and dispute) that it was not sufficient to make themselves, and their Predecessours Priests or Bishops.</p>

                  <p>In the 38. and 39. articles they endeavour to supress so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me errors of the Anabaptists, which necessarily follow from the foundation and principles of Protestancy: for if it be lawfull to deprive men of a spiritual authority and jurisdiction, wherof they are in present possession, and which their Predecessours had peaceably enjoy'd, tyme out of memory, the consequence of the lawfulness to deprive men of their temporal jurisdiction, Dominions, riches, and goods, is evident by a parity of reason: for if peaceable and present possession, confirm'd by a prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many ages, be not sufficient to ground right for the Roman Bishop and Clergy to govern souls, and to enjoy the Church livings, ther is no temporal Prince, or person can be secure, or have a right to govern subjects or possess his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. So that by the same warrant wherby Prelatick Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants have taken from the Pope, and Roman Clergy their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual jurisdiction, and temporalities, the Anabaptists and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may evidently demonstrat, that all goods are common, and no one person can pretend right to Superiority, or any thing he doth possess.</p>

wherby both are rendred vnsignificant.

So charitable were the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, that they delay'd the penalties of such as they could not convert, and connived at them who endeavored to escape by absenting or concealing themselves.

                  <p>Some are of opinion that if the more modern Prelaticks had not forsaken their ould way of being ordained Bishops by the Queens letters patents, or by some such publick testimony and superficial ceremony of their Congregations, without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them-selves with the doctrin of the inward caracter given by imposition of Episcopal hands, so contrary to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the reformation a broad, and to the 23. and 25. of their own 39.

                     <hi>Mr. Hooker, Dr. Couel</hi> and some other Prelaticks in their writings towards the end of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign, began to inculcat the doctrin of making Ordination a spiritual caracter imprinted in the soul by imposition of Episcopal hands, and not a bare formality, of the secular Magistrat's election, by some outward ceremony, or letters patents, as all English Protestants had believed and practised vntil <hi>Hooker</hi> and <hi>Couel</hi> broacht this among their other Popish novelties, and therfor were publickly blamed, and complained of by Prelatick Writers, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by <hi>Dr. Willet</hi> in his worck vpon the 112.

By his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage he obtained the confederacy of Denmarck and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Princes of Germany for recovering of England. <hi>Cecil</hi> and others of the English Councel, observing how prudently this young King had ordered his affairs, and prepared him-self for being their Master, courted him, and vnknown to the Queen, gave him dayly intelligence, and thought it their best course to fix vpon him for her Successour; seing they could hardly keep him out, they invited him to the Throne after his enemie's death; and he finding that very Protestancy by which his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and him-self had bin so long excluded from their right (and would have bin for ever, if Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had bin as capable as t'is sayd she was desirous of Posterity) was deeply rooted in the hearts of most of his English subjects (who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not see he chang, or not observe the motives and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries therof) King <hi>James</hi> J say, reflecting vpon this inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people to Protestancy, conformed him-self vnto that Reformation which had bin setled by law in England; discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced the Puritans, by whose doctrin he had bin persecuted in Scotland; and would have tolerated the Catholick, if the <hi>gun powder Treason</hi> (wherunto some few discontented and desperat Papists were cunningly drawn by <hi>Cecil,</hi> to make their Religion odious) had not blasted our hopes, and blotted out of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie's memory what we had suffered for his Mother, and how not only our persons, but our principles had bin persecuted for supporting the title of his Family to the British Empire.</p>
                  <p>By King <hi>James</hi> his learned works, and discourses, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest he had a design to reform the principles of Protestancy, and reduce them to some rules of reason, and confine that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous liberty which they give to every privat Protestant, of


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:38521:77"/>
being supreme Judg in all spiritual Controversies to one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain interpretation of Scripture that might be less prejudicial to Monarchy, Monarchs, peace and all civil Government, then the Protestant arbitrary interpretations have proved hitherto. To that purpose he commanded the Bible to be truly translated, and those fraudulent and foolish corruptions to be corrected, which had bin imposed vpon the people for God's word by Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Clergy, for maintaining her title, and securing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the Church to them selves. But his command was not obey'd, some falcifications in the ould and new Testament were corrected, but very few, in respect of what remain and pass now current for true Scripture. He declared that Catholicks and their Religion had no hand in the <hi>gunpowder treason,</hi> those few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons excepted, which had bin executed. He was not, afraid to acknowledg that the <hi>Pope</hi> was the first Bishop of Christendom, and <hi>Rome</hi> the mother Church; he suspended the rigor of the sanguinary and penal Statuts; commended not apostatised Priests, that became Protestants, as he said, to get wenches, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. These things he did, not out of any inclination to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but out of his zeal to Protestancy, which he perceived would in a short time become as infamous, as it is intolerable to Monarchs, in case it's principles were not corrected and brought neerer vnto Catholick Tenets.</p>
                  <p>After King <hi>Iames</hi> his death, his son King <hi>Charles</hi> 1. pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued the Father's design; but found by sad experience that the Protestant liberty of interpreting Scripture, cannot be restrained to reason by any human industry of the wisest Princes; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialy so long as they are guided by a fallible Church that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth it's own vncertainty of doctrin.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the 1. was persuaded by his Councel and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy that the Laws which had bin enacted in favour of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick fallible Church, and doubtful jurisdiction, were of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient force and authority to contain Protestant subjects in awe, and obedience, and to stop the cours and consequences of those fundamental, and violent principles of their reformation against


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:38521:77"/>
superiority, at the Church of Rom's doore; and keep them from passing further, or entrenching vpon the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But the mistake soon appeared; they who are allowed by the Prelatick principles to rebell against their Roman Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, vnder the pretence of a Religious interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and evangelical Reformation, could not then, nor cannot for the future, be contain'd, or deterr'd by any authority from rebelling against their Protestant Kings, and Bishops vpon the same score, whose superiority could not be more authentick, then the Roman Catholick. And therfor because the King, had engaged in the Bishops quarel, he drew vpon himself the <hi>odium</hi> of all Protestants that with the spirit and zeal of Reformation stuck to the fundamental principles of Protestancy, which is, to contemn all authority both spiritual and temporal, which any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat person judges contrary to his own interpretation of Scripture; and seeng the Prelatick Church of England doth grant this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin was lawful in <hi>Luther, Calvin, Cranmer, Parker,</hi> and other particular persons, Churches, and States against the Pope, and others their then acknowledged spiritual and temporal superiours, it will be very difficult to shew why now a <hi>Presbiterian</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick</hi> Congregation may not as rationally pretend, and as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully practise the same doctrin as their primitive Protestant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours had don. And so in vertue of this fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Protestancy, was the sacred person of a good King jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and murthered, by a rude and wicked multitude, without regard to innocency, or respect to Soveraignty: And by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable revolution of tyms, and interests, the grandson came to loose his head for vpholding that same Prelatick Religion and Clergy which by Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had bin rays'd for the destruction of his Grand-mother, and the exclusion of his family from the crown.</p>
                  <p>Since Christian Soveraigns have reign'd, the like Tragedy hath not bin acted; many Princes have bin murthered by their Subjects, but never by any such formality of Law, and a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Court of Judicature, pretending superiority in themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, and Scripture for their rule and warrant.

                  <p>For, either it must be granted that all the Pastors, and Prelats who lived in the time that any alteration of doctrin began, were so stupid as not to take notice of so important and remarcable an object; or so wicked as to observe, and yet not oppose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties so destructive to the souls committed to their charges.

                  <p>The truth of this Protestant supposition is not only incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, but impossible; because the supposed chang of Christian Religion into Popish superstition is not pretended to have bin only a chang of the inward persuasion, but of the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, visible and observable in ceremonies and practises, ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werable to the Mysteries believed; as the adoring of the <hi>B.

Moreover, the chang from youth, and stately buildings, into gray hairs, and ruinous edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, is wrought insensibly by the hand of time without any perceptible concurrence of any other cause; Time wears out and consumeth structure, strength, youth, and beauty, whether men gaze or not gaze vpon such gay objects; but the planting, preaching, or inculcating of new doctrin, and new ceremonies of Religion, are of a quite contrary nature; they have not such dependency of time alone, they must be effects of attention and observation of discourses and disputs, of Sermons and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms; they must be also professed and practised in the view of the world. Time without these and the like notorious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises and observations, can not alter Christian Religion, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a contrary superstition.</p>

Granted there were no fallacy in the similitude, nor disparity in the Comparison; the examples are better retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against Protestancy, then applied to Popery; for, though haires may begin to grow white, and buildings to decay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great notice taken of their chang, yet when either coms to the height, or even to the mediocrity of their chang, that chang is observ'd by as many as have eyes to see; and is not only observed, but resented, and remedied (according to their power) by them who are most concerned in such decays and defects. If then a white head is so easily discern'd from black, and a ruin'd edifice from a new Palace, and a decay'd fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce from a beauty, by all kind of people that make use of their senses, and if so much industry is used by them who are most sensible of those imperfections, to hinder their further progress or appearance; how is it possible that all or any orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians (being so greatly and particularly concern'd in the purity and truth of their Religion, and in the observation of it's rites and Ceremonies) could be for many ages so stupid, as not to distinguish it's doctrin and profession from the quite contrary? or so carless in applying remedies against the grouth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of errors both damnable and discernable? Is it not more probable and possible that <hi>Martin Luther</hi> (a man so impious, proud, and passionat, that him-self acknowledgeth he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Idolatry in the Church at <hi>Wittenbergh,</hi> to vex his Scholler <hi>Carolostadius</hi>; should (to disgrace the Pope and Papists his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) be seduc'd (by his confessed disputation and submission) in his diabolical doctrin, then that the whole visible Church, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councels before <hi>Luther</hi> for at least 1000. years, should not only forsake Christ's doctrin, but mistake the true sence of

                  <p>If no Pastor nor Prelat had the courage to oppose Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and superstition, sure some one or other would have had the curiosity to describe the occasion, beginning, and progress of so great and remarkable a change; and would mention, (if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn) the stupidity of the whole Church, in not opposing do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin so inconscionable, and vnreasonable.

But because the Nicen Synod is read to have computed this book in the number of holy Scripturs, J have acquiesced, or complyed with your demand.</hi> Out of which words it is manifest 1.

                     <p>As to this work of Doctor <hi>Cosins,</hi> it may be properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Cosenage,</hi> independently of an allusion to his name; had not his book bin sufficiently confuted by the absurdity of his fundamental principles, denying that the Apostles or Christian Church could declare any book of the old Testament, Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, which the Iews omitted or rejected, and affirming that no parts of the New Testament were ever questioned by any Church ancient or modern, I should set down many more of his willful falsifications, and weake evasions; but that labour being rendred superfluous by the incoherency of his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, and by the inconsistency of his principles with including in that Canon of Scripture (which he vndertakes to defend) the epistles above mentioned of <hi>Peter, Iohn, Paul,</hi> and <hi>Iude,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> (for it is evident by the quoted testimonies both of ancient Fathers and learned Protestants, that these epistles of <hi>Iohn Iude, Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> as also the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> were doubted of by many Christian Churches, for three or foure ages) I do not think fitt to trouble the Reader nor my self with a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular confutation of this rather fantastical then Scholastical History of the Canon of Scripture: fantastical J say, because

he fancies to him-self that the authority and sayings of men who writ before this controversy had bin decided by a general Councel, and at the same time professed a faith which obliged them so submit ther writings and judgments to the decrees of Councels, can be of any force against that general Councel by which the contrary was decided, and they would have bin gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by, if they had bin now living, as <hi>St. Austin</hi> saith of <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> in a point of doctrine which was determined by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councel against the holy Martyrs opinion, long after his death.</p>
                     <p>Whosoever can take delight in seing the pittifull shifts, and sleights wherby interested writers endeavour to blind mens eyes, and vnderstandings, let him peruse this book of Doctor <hi>Cozins</hi> and he will find more sport in observing how he tosses and turns the sayings of the Fathers against them-selves, then could be wished in so serious a subject.

                     <p>He is also troubled that <hi>St. Austin</hi> doth favour so much the doctrine of Purgatory, and the authority of the Catholick Church (in declaring books of the Old Testament to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, which were rejected by the Iews) as to say (<hi>lib.</hi> 18. <hi>de Civit.

This is not only <hi>Luther's</hi> shift, all Protestants follow their first reformer in this point, having the same necessity imposed vpon them by their own reformations and translations, so contrary to the known letter of Scripture. <hi>Luther</hi> being told by <hi>Zuinglius [tom.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Luther. l. de Sacram. pag.</hi> 412. <hi>&amp; seq.] Thou dost corrupt the word of God, thou art seen to be a manifest and common corrupter and perverter of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, how much are we ashamed of thee, who have hitherto estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thee beyond all measure, and now prove thee to be such a man?

And truly if the Apostles were not only fallible, but did teach errors in manners and matters of faith, after the holy Ghost descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon them, their writings can be no infallible Rule to direct men to saluation; which conclusion is so immediatly and cleerly deduced from this Protestant doctrin, that the supposal and premises once granted, their can be no certainty in Scripture; and indeed this all the Reformers aymed at,

                     <p>To excuse many of their corruptions and falls Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Doctor Whitaker writ a book, wherin he endeavored to shew that some Greek and Hebrew words might be taken in that sense which the English Translators gave them; but he never could prove that the profane and Poetical signification wherunto the Translators and he had applyed them, could make sense in holy scripture, nor be accommodated to ecclesiastical disciplin, and Divine doctrin. And therfore <hi>Doctor Reynolds</hi> in his reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of <hi>Whitaker's</hi> works, proves the absurdity of his defence, and of the English Translations, by this example. Suppose (saith he) that a yong spruce Minister should step into the pulpit, and exhort his Parish to prepare them-selves for the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and the Anabaptists for baptism; according to the stile and phrase of the English Protestant scripture, wherin <hi>Priest</hi> is caled <hi>elder, Church, Synagogue, holy ghost, holy wind, Lord Baal.

The Minister therfore who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proper and ecclesiasticall sense of these words might have spoken sense thus, <q>I that am your Priest placed in this Church by the holy Ghost, for the feeding of your soules, do denounce vnto you in the name of Christ our lord and Master, that vnless your soules be regenerated by Baptism, and prepared for the Sacrament of the Altar, you shall be condemned body and soule into hell, and your portion shall

To attempt so difficult an enterprise would argue as much vanity in me, as it doth folly in lay Protestants, that thinck, them-selves safe in conscience and sufficiently informed of the way of saluation, by asking a Protestant Bishop or Minister, whether he be a Cheat? or (which is the same thing) whether the doctrine wherby alone he can live, and hope to thrive in this world, be not sufficient to save the soule? Few men will confess their guilt, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce an infamous sentence against them-selves, though they be guilty; neither will it be a tollerable excuse in the day of Judgment for any discreet Protestant to say, that he made Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his Religion (no indifferent but) indigent persons, that have no other interest, credit, or lively-hood, but to preach and maintain Protestancy, whether it be sufficient or not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for saluation, the Bishop or Minister lives by saying it is sufficient, and the true Religion. I can not deny but that some Protestant Bishops and Ministers have recanted and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their errors; but few, before they were summon'd out of this world by approaching death, or before they had lost their interest and hopes, by the violence of warr and the vicissitude of times.</p>

is not, whether the Church ever received the true sense of Scriptures, but whether that sense continued as well as the letter in the Church; and whether the interpretations of <hi>Luther, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Cranmer, Hamond, &amp;c.</hi> or of the Prelaticks of England, ought to be preferr'd before that of the Roman Catholick Church; because the true sense of Scripture, is supposed by all Protestants, to have bin lost for many ages, and that the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le visible Church of God was either so careless as to forget the ancient sense, or so wicked, as to forge a new sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>And first it seems against reason, to believe that any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Congregation could be less carefull of the sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then of the letter, because the sense is that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth most for preservation of the faith. Therfore if the Prelats and Pastors of the Church have bin so watchfull and diligent in all ages, as to find out and correct all heretical cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the letter of Scripture, how is it possible they would neglect the same industry for preservation of the sense which is the principal part of God's word? And if Protestants think the letter was safe in the custody of the Roman Chatholick Church, from which they received it, how can they suspect the purity of that sense which was kept and delivered to them by the same Church and authority? And if God's providence (as they confess) was engaged in keeping the leaves, and letter of Scripture from corruption, surely it could not be so vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for the integrity of the sence, and substance, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to perish. Besides, it is much easier to keep the sense of Scripture incorrupt and pure, then the letter: The letter was writ only in paper or parchment, the sense in the heads and hearts of the Bishops, Doctors, and People of the Church: a dash of a pen may alter the letter, but cannot have access to the sence, which lodgeth in the hearts and heads of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>John Calvin</hi> (whom the Magistrat of <hi>Noyon</hi> condemned for infamous Sodomy) was by his freind <hi>Beza</hi> canonized for extraordinary Sanctity; but <hi>Sclusselburg</hi> a man of so great esteem among Protestants that he was made <hi>Superintendent</hi> and general Inspector of many Churches in Germany, after relating <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin's</hi> Sodomy and vices, saith;
<q>I know <hi>Beza</hi> writ otherwise of <hi>Calvin's</hi> life, manners, and death; but seing him-self no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the same Heresy, and almost with the same sin as the history of <hi>Candida &amp;c.</hi> witnesseth, none can credit him.</q>
Therfore I am induced to believe <hi>Bolseck</hi> the Phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of Geneva, who begins his book of the life and death of <hi>Calvin</hi> with this protestation.
<q>I am heer, for the love of the truth to refute <hi>Theodor Beza</hi> his fals, and shamless lyes in the praise of <hi>Calvin,</hi> protesting before God and all the holy Court of heaven, before all the world, and the Holy Ghost it self, that neither anger nor envy, nor evill will hath made me speake or write any one thing against the truth and my conscience.</q>
Then he relates how <hi>Calvin</hi> was branded for Sodomy with a burning iron on the shoulder, and therfore retired from his Country (<hi>Noyon</hi> in Picardy) and how this punishment was testified by that Citty vnder the hand of a publick and sworn Notary to <hi>Mons.r Bertelier</hi> Secretary to the Councell of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which testimony (sayth <hi>Bolseck</hi>) is yet


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:38521:111"/>
extant. Then he describeth <hi>Calvin's</hi> delicat dyet, how his wine was choyce, and carried with him in a silver pot, when he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned abroad; that also special bread was made for <hi>Calvin</hi> only, and the same made of fine flower, wet in rosewater, mingl'd with sugar, Synamond, Aniz-seeds, besides a singular kind of bisket; and this he affirmeth as a matter known to all Geneva: This delicasy of dyet was not prescribed to preserve his health, but prepared to foment his lust and lewd conversation with a Gentleman of <hi>Lausann's</hi> wife, and others; his ambition was so great, that he aym'd at being Lord of Geneva, approving of their notorious rebellion and deposition of their lawfull Prince from his temporal right and jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>His death is described by the aforsaid <hi>Schlusselburg (lib.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 72.) in these words.
<q>God in the rod of his fury visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Calvin</hi> did horibly punish him before the fearfull houre of his death; for he so stroke this Heretick (so he term'd him in regard of his doctrin concerning the Sacrament and of God being the Author of sin) with his mighty hand, that being in despaire, and calling vpon the Devil, he gave vp his wicked soule swearing, cursing, and blaspheming; he dyed of the disease of lyce and worms (a kind of death wher with God often striketh the wiked as <hi>Antiochus, Herod &amp;c.</hi>) increasing in a most lothsom vlcer about his privy parts, so as none present could endure the stench.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Miracle (for he never attempted to work more then one, or two) is recorded not only by <hi>Bolseck,</hi> but also by <hi>Nin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerda Lindanus, Copus,</hi> and others, and it was thus. <hi>Calvin</hi> pretending extraordinary vocation, thought necessary, for the confirmation therof, and his own credit, to cheat the world with a feign'd miracle; to that purpose he agreed with a poore man caled <hi>Bruleus</hi> to feign him-self dead, promising him great rewards if in this Trage-comedy he would be secret, and act his part hansomly; non knew of the plot but <hi>Bruleus,</hi> and his wife, who vpon the day and howr appointed, sart in her house lamenting her husband's death; <hi>Calvin</hi> passing by with a great

number of his freinds [as it were by chance] and hearing the lamentations of the poore woman, seemed to pitty her sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and moved, forsooth, with charity and compassion, fell down vpon his knees with the rest of the company; praying in a loud voice; and beg'd of God that for the manifestation of his glory, and confirmation of his servant <hi>Calzin's</hi> doctrin and mission, he would vouchsafe to revive the dead Carcass, which he took by the hand, and bid him rise in the name of the Lord. The wife seing her husband did not move nor rise, as he had promised, drew neer, and perceiving he who had bin well but half an houre before, was now dead, lamented in good earnest the loss of her husband, reviled <hi>Calvin</hi> as a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, Cheat, Hypocrit, Heretick <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and related to the whole company what had past between them; <hi>Calvin</hi> seing <hi>Bruleus</hi> had acted his part more naturaly then he wished, retired with hast and confusion to his lodging. I leave it to the judgment of any disinteress'd person whether <hi>Bolseck</hi> and other grave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, would report such remarkable lyes (as Calvinists will pretend, this and other passages of <hi>Calvin's</hi> life and death to be) and set down in print so many circumstances, in a time wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were so notably disprovable. This kind of miracles, as <hi>Tertulian</hi> sayth, is proper to men who teach new doctrin contrary to that of the Apostles; as their doctrin is contrary, so ought their miracles to be; the Apostles raysed men from death by miracles, their Antagonists by miracle make men dead. <hi>Jsti (Apostoli) de mortuis suscitabant, ipsi de vivis mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuos faciunt.</hi> Tertulian. <hi>in lib. de preter.

                  <p>It is commonly sayd that though many stats-men be Atheists, yet they will never permit Atheism to be made the legal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the state, because they know that men who do not believe there is a God, or providence, cannot be kept in awe of the government, or brought to observe any other laws but their own appetits, seing they neither feare punishment nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect rewad in an other life for vice or virtue, and without this feare and hopes, the multitude cannot be govern'd in this world.

We say that our being mistaken, is but their privat opinion which opinion though it were back't by a publick Act of their Church can pretend (at most,) but to probability; and so much they must also grant to our contrary censure, and Judgment of their justifying faith: and seing that of two probable opinions the generality of men follow that which favors most their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inclinations, and interests, very few protestants will vary from the most favorable explanation, of iustifying faith, or will wave the comfort that the 11.

<q>If vpon every aboad in sin the party be again vncertain of his salvation, then was the former certainty no certainty at all. For (his sin notwithstanding) he yet remembreth his former supposed certainty, and therfore if he was once truly assured, he can not during every his aboad in sin forget, how that he was so assured, which his only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance therof suffiseth to continue, and preserve his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer supposed certainty even during his aboad in sin.</q>
So that if <hi>Cromwel</hi> by his justifying faith was once sure of his salvation, or predestination, Protestants must believe he could never loose that assurance, and must grant that he went to heaven without any punishment (even in Purgatory) for his murthers, periury, hypocrysy, adulteries &amp;c. Such a belief must needs raise other <hi>Cromwells</hi>; for who will not venture his life for a Crown, by the most vnjust means, when he is sure to be cron'd in God's glory, though, he miss of his ayme in this world, and perish in the attempt?</p>
                  <p>As it cannot be denyed but that these, and the like dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous consequences do naturally flow from this principle of Protestancy, so we must acknowledg and admire the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary skill and constancy of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who sit at the helme, and steer the ship of this great Common-wealth so stedily in so tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent a sea, and stormy weather, against the most violent cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of perverse inclinations and principles: long may they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their prosperous course; but surely them-selves do appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that at long running, no human industry will be able to escape the rocks and shelves wher vpon this great ship must be driven, If our Pilots, and Parliaments will be overruled by the loud and rude outcrys of the Scumme of the people, against Toleration, or liberty of conscience; and will think it sound

                  <p>How impossible is it to govern peaceably so pratling and presuming a Protestant multitude either in Church or state, is too manifest by the last experiences in England, wher the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of reducing this Protestant arrogancy to some kind of reason, was the occasion, and object of the Rebellion. <hi>King Charles I.</hi> and his Councel for attempting to make the inferiors subordinat to their superiors, in doctrin and disciplin, and the subjects obedient to the laws of the land, were aspers'd as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and destroy'd as enemies to the Evangelical liberty of Protestancy, and as subverters of the fundamental principles of the Reformation. Popish rebellions happen because the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motors therof fall from that fervor of their faith, and devotion which they ought to practise; but the English Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion was raised and continued by the most devout, pure, fervent, and zealous sort of Protestants, in persuance and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their Religion. Other rebellions are commonly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected chances, springing from a sudain fury or feare of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat people, but the late Rebellion was, and is to this day, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by many to have bin a pious, and sober proceeding (the King's murther only excepted) of the prudent and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men of the Nation, assembl'd in Parliament; and is so justifiable by the principles of Protestancy, that he must be thought not only a wise but a fortunat King of England that can prevent or suppress the like revolution in his Reign, so long as Protestancy doth reign with him.</p>
                  <p>The reason is as manifest as the experience, and the cause as the effect. For, if a Common-wealth were so instituted that every privat person might pretend (by his birth-right or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege) to admit of no other Iudg or Interpreter of the laws, but him-self, or at least might lawfully and legaly appeale from all Courts of Judicature (even from the highest which is the

Parliament) to his own privat Judgment, what intollerable confusion would it breed? what justice, subordination, peace, propriety, or prosperity, could be expected in such a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? The same laws and authority which ought to decide all differences, would be the subject and occasion of perpetual quarrells. This is the condition and constitution of Protestant Churches and States. Every privat person is a supreme Iudg of Religion, and sole Interpreter of Scripture; he may appeale both from Soveraigns; and Bishops; from their temporal and Ecclesiastical laws to his own privat judgment, or spirit; and him-self must determin the difference and conclude whether the Decrees of Church and State be agreable to God's word that is, to his own Interpretation therof, which commonly is byassed by privat interest, or some singular fancy of his own.

There is greater danger that Protestants may abuse this spiritual Soveraignty, by an indirect application therof to temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, then the Pope his; who being a stranger, and at such a distance, can not (if he would) have the conveniencies, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and occasions of plotting rebellion, which Natives and subjects may lay hold on, with less danger of a discovery, and greater hopes of success.</p>

                  <p>Among the protestant Confessions of faith, the 39. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the prelatick Church of England is estem'd an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent piece; and yet the same Articles acknowledg <hi>that the visible Church of God hath erred, and may err from time to time</hi>; and by consequence the prelatick may have erred in this very as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, as in most of the 39. Articles. How this acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vncertainty of truth can agree with the certainty or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity of faith, or with any hopes of salvation, I can not comprehend. But albeit these articles seem as insufficient for salvation, as men are vncertain of their truth, yet are they thought usefull to the government; for, though they want the substance, (that is, the certainty) of faith, yet they have the face of religion, and formality of law; because they talk of God, Christ, Trinity &amp;c. And are confirmed by acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But that which makes them to be so much insisted vpon, is, that they are so indifferent, and appliable to all Protestant Religions, that with much reason he is censured a very wilfull Presbiterian, and fanatick, who will not submit, and subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be to articles so indulgent, and indifferent. Therfore not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now but formerly in the beginning of all distempers groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon Diversitie of Protestant opinions, it was thought good policy to commit the 39.

well as with the zeal of the Protestant Religion against the Church of England. And an. 1633. when the <hi>Symptoms</hi> of that rebellion were first discerned, there was printed, by special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, a Book setting forth, the agreement of the 39. Articles with the doctrin of other reformed, but rebellious Churches of <hi>France, Germany, Netherlands, Basil, Bohemia, Swethland, Suitzerland &amp;c.</hi> The Title of the book is, the Faith, Doctrin, and Religion, professed and protected in the realm of England and Dominions of the same, expressed in the Articles <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The sayd Articles analized into propositions; and the propositions proved to be agreable both to the writen word of God, and to the extant confessions of all the neighbour Churches Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly reformed.

                  <p>We may say without either vanity or flattery, that were it possible to maintain the Soveraignty of a King, the peace and prosperity of a people togeather with the principles of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, the English Nation would have don it, wanting nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther witt or judgment to find out the expedients after long experience (of 100. years) since the pulling down of Popery; and yet we see that nothwithstanding the wisedom of them who govern, the learning of the Clergy, the worth of the gentry, the sincerity of the common sort, and the natural inclination to loyalty of the whole Nation, since Protestancy came among vs we have violated the laws of nature and Nations, we have by publick acts of State don many things, wherof but one perpetrated by a privat person (whithout any countenance from the governement) were sufficient to make not only him-self, but his whole family, and Country infamous; Murthers of Soveraigns by a formality of justice, breach of publick faith for the Protestant interest, were never heard of in England, nor acted by English men vntil they were Protestants: Therfore the infamy, and reproach therof must be left at the doores of the English Protestant Church, without blaming our English Nation, or nature. It is the nature of an arbitrary Religion to pervert good natures; It confounds the state more then any arbitrary government.

                  <p>How arbitrary and applicable all Protestant Religions are to every particular interest, and fancy, notwithstanding their publick professions and confessions of faith, is visible by the 39.

study, information, or seeming reason moves him to the contrary.

                  <p>The learned Protestants who are not Iews, Turks, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, become Atheists, or meer Rationalists; Because there is not any thing moves learned men so much either to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism, or to have no Religion but naturall reason, as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Religions, and the confessed vncertainty of such as are professed. The interpretation of Scripture and Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left by their principles of the Reformation to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular person's discretion, maks Protestants differ as much in Christian belief as in human opinions, concerning any ordinary, and obscure matter; and their supposition of the fall of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church into errors of doctrin, togeather with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged fallibility, and vncertainty of their own Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, takes away (as we proved in the last Section) all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and Christianity of belief. What doubt therfore can be made but that such learned Protestants as turn not Jews, Mahometans, or Arians, will either become <hi>Atheists, Socinians,</hi> or meer <hi>Rationalists?</hi> such as observe that the Prophecies sett-down in Scripture concerning the spendor, extent, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Christ's Church vpon Earth, are not accomplished in their own petty Reformations, and withall are so peevish, and maliciously bent against the Roman Catholick faith, as not to

                  <p>There is not any one Protestant Writer, in whose works you may not find this heretical Strain. Neither is it to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired that men whose Religion is occasioned by pride, and grounded vpon singularity of judgment, do betray and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare those passions in their discourses, they being the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of their Symbols and the Conclusions most cleerly deduced from their principles.

And truly <hi>Socinus</hi> doth defend his error concerning Christ, with as many and as cleer texts of Scripture (not vnderstood in the sense of the Roman Catholick Church) as any point of Protestancy is maintained by other Protestants.</p>
                  <p>The Puritans (now called Presbiterians) vse the same way of arguing against the Prelatiks, and with no less success, then <hi>socinus</hi> against <hi>Volanus,</hi> as may be seen in <hi>Cartwright</hi> in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reply against episcopacy (<hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 484.) <hi>And that it may appear</hi> (saith he) <hi>how justly we call this Canon of the Councell</hi> (the first generall of <hi>Nice,</hi> in the Canon touching the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan which the Prelatiks vrged in favor of Episcopacy) <hi>vnto the tuch stone of the word of God, let it be considered &amp;c. In the same Councell appeareth that to those chosen of the ministery vnmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, it was not lawfull to take any wife afterwards &amp;c. Paphnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius sheweth, that not only this was before that Councell, but was an ancient Tradition of the Church, in which both him-felf and the whole Councell rested &amp;c. If the ancient Tradition of the Church can not authorise this, neither can ancient custome authorise the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prelatick Clergy would fain hould Episcopacy by virtue of Tradition, and of the authority of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and yet would have Priests marry, contrary to the same tradition, and authority. In like manner, as the same <hi>Mr. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> well observeth (<hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 582.) the Bishops of the Church of England would needs have the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell be of sufficient authority to maintain Arch-Bishops, but not the

                     <hi>Pope,</hi> wheras the on is as cleerly expressed as the other, and no less necessary for the government of the Church.
<q>If (saith he) an <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> be necessary for calling a Provincial Councell, when the Bishops are divided; it is necessary there be also a <hi>Pope,</hi> which may call a generall Councell when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision is among the Arch-Bishops; for when the Churches of one Province be divided from other (as you ask me, so I ask you) who shall assemble them togeather? who shall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish them of their duties, when they are assembled? If you can find a way how this may be don without a <hi>Pope,</hi> the way is also found, wherby the Church is disburdned of the <hi>Archbishop.</hi>

                  <p>When Prelaticks dispute with Presbiterians about Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy and ceremonies &amp;c. they extoll the four first general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells; but when they dispute with Roman Catholicks, about the vnmarried life of Priests, the Pop's supremacy, or any other point of Popery, then they extenuate the authority of the same Councells, and will admitt of no other rule of faith but Scripture. So that a Prelatick Protestant against Presbiterians is a Papist, and against Papists is a Presbiterian: what he is, or would be if both did argue against him at the same time, is not well known to me (nor as I suppose to him-self;) but if he admits of the two main pillars wherby protestancy is supported, which are the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended fall and fallibility of the visible Church, and the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary interpretation of Scripture, he may be any thing he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and (to speak more modestly of him then <hi>Modestinus</hi> of <hi>Calvinists</hi>) he is in a faire way to be a baptised Iew, Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or Arian, and can not miss that way, if he will be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Protestant principles, and follow the track of the most learned of the reformation.

In this Section J will discover the design, and declare the weakness therof. In the next I will demonstrat the falshood of the doctrin wherby they intended to carry on their design. Protestants proceed in this affair as weak Mini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sters of state; when they find by experience they have bin mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in taking their measures, and in the management of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick concerns, they would fain be reconciled, and make strict leagues with such Potentats as formerly they had disobliged, and them-selves now stand in need of their friendship, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they can effect all by inculcating vnto them general notions of a common danger, grounded vpon the power and pride of some neighbouring and emulous Prince.

                  </p>
                  <p>But sure Protestants forget the <hi>invisibility</hi> of their own, when they except against the <hi>Universality</hi> of ours. If theirs was <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>Universal</hi> when they were so few, that for the space at least of 1000. years not one Protestant could be found in the whole world, they have no reason to deny the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Catholick</hi> to the Roman, which always hath bin so conspicuous and numerous.

                  </p>
                  <p>And as Protestants have no reason to believe that the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality or <hi>Catholicism</hi> of the Church consists not so much in the number of persons, as in the antiquity and identity of faith of the Professors with that of the Apostles, so have they not any reason to object partiality, and illegality against the testimony and judicature of the Roman Church and Councells when they censure Protestant opinions.

That the Judgment and censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in all ages were issued but by on part, and this, the Roman Catholick party that lived in communion with the Bishop of Rome, and the Councells that acknowledged his jurisdiction, we prove by the confessed examples of every Century.</p>
                     <p>In the first, the controversy of the legal ceremonies was determined by <hi>S. Peter</hi> and the Apostles in a Councell wherin S. <hi>Peter</hi> presided <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</p>

                     <p>In the third Century, by the Pope <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Roman Councell the <hi>Novatian</hi> heresy was condemned (<hi>Euseb. ex ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione Rufini, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>histor. cap.</hi> 33.) and though there were not

                        <pb n="250" facs="tcp:38521:147"/>In the 13. Century, Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. condemned the error of <hi>Ioachim the Abbot,</hi> in the Lateran Councell.

                     <p>In the 14. Century Pope <hi>Clement</hi> 5. condemned the errors of the <hi>Begards,</hi> in the Councell of Vienna.</p>

                     <p>Now what reason can Protestants give why <hi>Pius.</hi> 4. Bishop of Rome, and the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> (though of his calling and party) might not condemn the opinion of <hi>Protestants,</hi> as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and legaly, as his Predecessors had don in every age the like opinions of other Reformers? Both condemners and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned were Christians, for hereticks must be baptised, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they are rather Pagans then hereticks: The condemned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were often Patriarchs and Bishops, some-times as many as the Condemners; and yet neither could their Plea of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or pretence of Scripture, or parity in dignity, or equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in number, exempt them from the validity and legality of the Roman Censures, vnto which if they did not submit, all the Catholick world held them for obstinat hereticks. Therfore we may not, without contradicting both reason and authority, the common sense of the Church, and the general custom of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian antiquity, allow the exceptions which Protestants plead against the Pope, and the Councell of his Bishops, that forsooth they are but a part of the Catholick Church, and therfore as party concerned, incompetent Judges and witnesses in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of Christian Religion.</p>
                     <p>We have seen the weakness and ill success of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant design in this distinction of <hi>fundamentall</hi> and not <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi> articles of faith, and how they are rejected as hereticks by the Greeck Schismaticks, and other sectaries whom they courted to be admitted as a part of their Church, we have also proved the

So that to believe the testimony or proposal of the Church in a matter absolutly necessary for salvation, and not to believe it in a matter not absolutly necessary (when equaly proposed by the same testimony, and authority) is as much as to say, that God can speak by his Church, litle vntruths, but not great vntruths, or that he may permit his <hi>veracity</hi> to be violated, or vitiated in litle, but not in great matters; as if forsooth, the authority and infallibility of the Church were to be measured by the matter it proposeth, and not by the manner and supernatural marks of the proposal and by the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the speaker.</p>

And yet the same Protestants say the Roman Catholick Church is also infallible in fundamentals; but the Roman Catholick, and Protestant Church contradict on the other in this doctrin of fundamentals, Therfore one of both must erre; and that on must be the Protestant, because it maintains that two Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches teaching contradictory doctrins, may both be infallible therin.

If by cleer reason for an assent of Divine faith, be meant that the truth of the mystery assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto, must of necessity be cleer to the Assenter either in it self, or in it's necessaire connection with the Revelation, it is a gross mystake; for that the difference between an assent grounded vpon cleer evidence of the truth, or of reason, and an assent grounded vpon Divine authority is, that the first is a cleer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual sight of the truth itself, the second is not so, but a cleer sight of our own obligation of assenting to the truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed or related, because wee see cleer and convincing signs of the sincerity and veracity of the Author or relator. Now our obligation of believing God to be the Author of the doctrin of the Church, being evident to ourselves, we are bound to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the same Doctrin according to the evidence of our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, that is with greather assurance then appearance of the truth. The evidence of our obligation to assent, is a sufficient ground for our assurance of the truth assented vnto.</p>

Wherfore God's worth veracity, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to truth, being infinit, we ought not to exact a cleer sight of the truth it self, nor of any things evidently connected therwith; if we do, we neither trust nor believe him: his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation therfore to truth being infinit, we ought not to retain the least suspition or feare of being deceived either by himself, or by the Church whervnto he gives the charge and signes of declaring and proposing his word to vs: because he who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly inclined to speak truth, is inclined to do it, not only when himself speaks, but every way that truth can be spoken, or by every person and <hi>Organ</hi> that may be prudently taken to speak by his commission. The Roman Church therfore being prudently taken for the <hi>Organ</hi> of God's voice, it is as impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we should be misledd by it's doctrin, as it is that God should go against his infinit inclination to truth, or should violat his own veracity.

Church, it had not bin infinit, his credit would have ended with Christ's preaching to the Apostles; and though they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re bound to believe their Master, non could be obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. But seing God's veracity is infinit, and <hi>his words must continue for ever,</hi> they can be as little confined to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons or Pastors of any on certain age, as infinit veracity to on particular truth, or infinit excellency and goodness to any one degree of perfection.

For what can be more absurd then to pretend, that as moral virtue is a mean or mixture of two extremes, so the truth of Christian Religion is a mean between two contrary opinions, or a mixture of Popery, and Presbitery, which are two extremes involving contradictory Tenets. <hi>Morality,</hi> I confess is a mediocrity and a kind of Mixture: For, <hi>liberality</hi> (for example) doth seeme to participat some thing of covetousness, and some thing of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, which are extreme different; but <hi>Christianity</hi> being truth and Divine truth, is no <hi>mean</hi> between the two, but one of the two extremes; it is no mixture, because truth admits no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of falshood; nor division, it can be but on one side. Therfore when a Presbiterian or Fanatick saith, that Scripture is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule of faith, and Judge of Controversies, the Catholick say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es it is not; not both, but one of them speaks truth, Yet the Prelatick would f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And indeed that is the <hi>mean,</hi> wherin Prelatick Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy doth consist; when their writers defend it against Presbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, they grant the doctrin of Papists; when they answer and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Seing therfore it is the nature of Protestancy (as of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religions, grounded vpon voluntary and privat interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of an obscure writing) to breed disorders and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all Common-wealths, wherin the liberty of interpreting that writing is not restrained by law; and if restrained by law, the legislative power is opposed, and it's authority contemned as contrary to the law, and word of God; and this opposition is waranted by the principles of protestancy, which exempt all reformed Christians from any conscientious obligation of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to Church or state Governors in matters of Religion; supposing I say, this to be the nature of Protestancy, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent how contrary it is to policy to enact or continue lawes against the profession of the Roman Catholick faith, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone amongst all Christian Religions needeth not the support

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:38521:183"/>
the other against the Pope's Iurisdiction, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Sea Apostolick. Touching the first, you say you have God's word with you, yea and all Doctors. I would here ask but one Question of you: whether God's word be contrary to it self, and whether the Doctors teach doctrin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them-selves, or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, you Mr. <hi>Cranmer,</hi> have taught in this High Sacrament of the Altar three contrary doctrins, and you pretend in every one <hi>Verbum Domini</hi> the word of God.</p>

                        <p>Then there you defended an other doctrin touching the Sacrament: by the same token, that you sent to <hi>Lynne</hi> your printer, that wheras in the first print there was an affirmative that is to say, Christ's body realy in the Sacrament, you sent then to your printer to put in a <hi>Not,</hi> wherby it came miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously to pass, that Christ's body was clean conveyed out of the Sacrament.</p>

But in the end, to give content to such as remained affected to the former Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, it was agreed vpon that a mixt form, consisting partly of the order of Geneva, and partly of the Book of England, should be digested, and received till the first of April, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in the mean time to be had of some other cours which should be permanent, and oblidging for the time to come.</p>

with the Earle; who willed him that the next time M.r <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> dined at his table, he should take occasion after dinner to propose the same; which he did soon after; and receiving certain trifling answers from M.r <hi>Iewell,</hi>

(for that he supposed it might be by oversight) the other commanded notwithstanding the print to go forward, and passed it over as it was, which this man seeing, that had a conscience and sought the truth indeed, resolved to take another way of finding it out: and having found it in the Catholick Church, where only it is to be found, he resolved also to follow it, and so he did, and went voluntarily into banishment for the same, where yet he liveth vnto this day in Finance, with good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation both of learning and godliness.</q>

Thus much the Author of the three Conversions.</q>

                     <p>I am credibly informed by a person then present, that Primat <hi>Bramhall</hi> and some of his Majesties Chaplains (who now are Bishops (persuaded or endeavored to persuade our most gratious Soveraign Charles 2.

                  <p>The <hi>Albigensis</hi> were another Sect of hereticks, rysing some 30. or 40. yeares after the <hi>Waldenses</hi> an. 1216. and their begi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was at a Town called <hi>Albigium,</hi> neere <hi>Tolosa.</hi> They agreed with Protestants in the deniall of the Popes supremacy, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and some other points, but differed in many; as first, they held with the <hi>Manichees</hi> that there are two Gods, one good and another evill. 2.

                  <p>As for <hi>Wickleffs</hi> opinions, by <hi>Fox</hi> his own relation (pag. 400.) they are different from the Protestant articles.

Now if <hi>Fox</hi> did prove that this great stone was stayed miraculously from falling vpon <hi>Luther,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing it were; but how can he make that appeare? he may as well maintain that every stone, or tyle falling from a decayed building, was miraculously stayed from falling vpon every man's head that passeth vnder, and escapes such casual and dayly dangers.</p>
                  <p>But to the end you may be rightly informed of <hi>John Fox</hi> his judgment and spirit in discerning and describing su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall things; I will relate a miracle or revelation that happned to himself, in his own words.
<q>And first you must know that he was resolved to prove by Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ure that Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> 8. was Anti-Christ, and to that purpose quotes a Text out of the 20, chapter of the Apocalips, and then maketh his account thus. The binding vp of Sathan after peace given to the Church (counting from the 30. year of Christ) was an.

                     </q>
This he endeavored to confirm out of the 13. Chapter of the Apocalips, where it is sayd, that power was given by the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon to the Beast (to wit to Anti-Christ) to speak blasphemy and to do what listeth him for 42. months; which make (as all men know) 3. years and a half: and is the time allotted by S.t <hi>Iohn</hi> (according to all the ancient Fathers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> for proof wherof he describes a revelation of his own thus.
<q>Because the matter (saith he) <hi>being</hi> of no small importance, greatly appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto the publik vtility of the Church, and least any should misdoubt me herein to follow any privat interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my own, I thought Good to communicat to the Reader that which hath bin imparted to me in the opening of these mysticall numbers in the foresaid Book of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contained, by occasion as followeth &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>As I was in hand with these Histories &amp;c. Being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed and turmoiled in Spirit about the reckning of these num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and years, it so happened vpon a Sunday in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, lying in my bed, and musing about these numbers; suddenly it was answered to my mynd, as with a Majesty, thus inwardly saying within me, <hi>Thou fool, count these months by Sabbaoths as the weeks of Daniel are counted by Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths.</hi> The Lord I take to witness, thus it was; wherupon thus being admonished, I began to recken the 42. months by Sabboths, first of the months, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that would not serve; and then by Sabboths of years, and then I began to feele some probable vnderstanding, yet not satisfied herewith, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to certain Merchants of my acquaintance. (Of whom one is departed, a true and faithfull servant of the Lord, the other two yet alive, and witnesses hereof) to whom the number of these foresaid months being propounded, and examined by Sabboths of years, the whole summ was found to surmount to 294. years, conteining the full and just time of the foresaid persecutions, neither more nor less &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus you have the revelation made to <hi>John Fox,</hi> which he saith that he relateth vnto vs, for that we shall not misdoubt the truth therof, nor think that he followeth any privat Interpretation of his own, but that it came from God immediatly: as if every fanatik did not fancy and pretend the same. And this is the dream of <hi>John Fox</hi> in his bed.</p>
                  <p>The second ridiculous point is that he went to three mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants


<pb n="370" facs="tcp:38521:207"/>
to conferr this revelation and that they approved there of. The third point is open falshood, and folly, where he saith that this number of 294. conteineth the full and just time of the first persecutions of Christians vnder Pagan Emperors, neither more nor less; seing that from Christ to the victory of <hi>Constantin</hi> against <hi>Maxentius,</hi> there are assigned by <hi>Eusebius</hi> 318. years, and yet did not this persecution cease then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but continued vnder <hi>Licinius,</hi> and other Tyrants, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers years after, see then how just these numbers fall out, neither more nor less: all which being considered, I find no one thing so true or credible in all this revelation (saith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the three Conversions, who confuted <hi>Fox</hi> his Acts and Monuments) as those words of the spirit vnto him, saying, <hi>Thou fool</hi>: for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this maketh him a fool indeed by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>What credit Protestants give to <hi>Fox</hi> his revelations I do not know, but sure Iam, they give too much to his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: notwithstanding the absurdity of the whole work in composing a Catholick Church of condemned hereticks, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out subordination or succession; and making wicked Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

All this was don with design to make the Roman Catholick reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion odious, and to exasperat the generality of the people against the Priests and professors of the same. And though judicious Readers may easily discern in perusing the Book, the weaknes of the Author, and of the cause he vndertakes to maintain, yet the vulgar sort are much taken with both, and doubt not but that Protestants have as much reason to put Catholiks to death, as Catholiks had to punish those mad fellows whom <hi>Iohn Fox</hi> calls Martyrs, and would needs dy rather then recall

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:38521:216"/>
that a man is sure of his predestination by faith; and the like Protestant doctrins, are causes of much virtue among them, as the contrary doctrins held by Papists, are causes of wicked life on their parts. So he answereth to his accusation with so manifest an absurdity as to say, that men are inclined to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve God's Commandments by holding it impossible to keep them, wheras (if they be not mad) that principle must dissuade them from attempting any such observation, seeing it is a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to endeavor an impossibility, and to believe that God doth command things impossible. Of their assurance of predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and justification, we have proved heretofore, how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent it is with good works, moral virtue,<note place="margin">

                  <p>And as for their making the first motions of concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence a sin without consent, it is the sink and source from whence Protestants suck most of their errors. From hence they inferr, that all the best actions of man are infected with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal crime, because they pass through the stinking Channell of human corruption, hence they deny the merit of good works wrought by grace, hence the impossibility of fulfilling God's Commandments for that every action of the just is of it's own nature a transgression of his Laws. Hence no inherent but a vain <hi>imputative Justice,</hi> hence the justification by faith alone; hence no freedom of will to perform any morall good; no liberty in man to cooperat with God when he first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, awaketh and calleth him out of the state of sin &amp;c.

                           </note> I found therin no satisfaction, for I saw in effect (saith Mr. <hi>Walsingham</hi>) nothing but a colerick Jnvective against the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the defence, telling him first and facing him down that the cause why there was no publick disputation, was in him and his fellowes, as being afraid to come to that tryal. Which kind of answer contented me not, for that I expected

he would have sayd, <hi>that disputation should be procured, and that he and all the rest of our Clergy would ioyn in that suit to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty that then was.</hi> Secondly, to all the ways set down by the defence for trying of a Catholick and heretical spirit, he sayd only, that he and his, would be tryed by Scriptures; wheras the Controversies would be about the sense and Jnterpretation of Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, to that of <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, Beza,</hi> their lives and doctrines, which principaly I desired to see discussed, he seemed to me to answer scarce any thing to the purpose, but ran into a great exclamation of popish slanderers, and against the absurdities of Indulgences &amp;c. which were not now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: he ought to have examined the place out of <hi>Luther's</hi> own writings about himself and others, both for life and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin: but this was not don, only in general he would seem to excuse matters, or rather to divert the reader from atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto them with this florish of words.
<q>As for <hi>Berengari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These words J say, may be as well applyed (as an Apology) to Turks, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, and all hereticks, as to <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza, Cranmer</hi>; for Turks, Iewes and all hereticks agree with Catholicks and <hi>Athanasius</hi> in some points of faith; though in their imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (as blasphemies, Iudaisme, Turcisme, heresy &amp;c.)

                     <p>THe first Reflexion is. How education, and a persuasion of the truth grounded therupon, can not be safely or prudently relyed vpon in matters of that one only faith, without which it is impossible to please God, and be saved; especialy when we acknowledge the fallibility of our Church, and have reasons to suspect our Clergys sincerity. The protestant Church of England doth acknowledge it's own fallibility, and that Clergys interest and <hi>intrigues</hi> in vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Religion wherby <hi>alone</hi> they may live above the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their parentage, and patrimony, together with our Catholick continual exceptions and proofs against it's novelty,


<pb n="432" facs="tcp:38521:238"/>
and libertinism, and the publick offers of learned disinteres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and conscientious persons to demonstrat how much lay-Protestants are abused by their Clergy, and mistaken in their fancied Scripture and reformed Doctrin (in case the state wil give way to a faire tryal) doth leave no room for the illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terat layties ordinary excuse, to wit, that they are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to study Controversies, or read the Fathers; so much is not exacted of them, they are bound notwithstanding to examin (every one according to his capacity) which of the two Clergys, Protestant or Catholick, do corrupt and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sify Scripture, the Fathers and Councells; or if that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence be not compatible with the meanes, and condition of many of them, no more is required of such, then to observe which of both partyes and Clergyes hinders, or is most back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in coming to a publick tryal therof, this (being but matter of fact, discernable by the eye, without Metaphysical speculation, or historical erudition) can not in conscience be rejected or neglected by any Christian, learned or vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Though Mr. <hi>VValsingham</hi> was a protestant Divine, yet he never had read any Catholick Books, and by consequence was (before he lighted vpon the <hi>defence of the Censure</hi>) as ignorant in our Tenets as any lay-protestant, and as avers from reading our Controversies: yet being a conscientious, and judicious person, he thought himself bound vnder pain of damnation, to examin whether what that Book said of Protestants, was true: Particularly when he reflected vpon their putting of, and declining all publick disputations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion, and their persecuting such as offered to dispute.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Reflexion. How easily a company or Corporation of necessitous and mean persons do conspire and concurr in a beneficial fraud; and how difficult it is to make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess a fault, in the maintenance wherof their fortunes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and by consequence how accomptable the protestant layty is to God, for not mistrusting and examining the truth


<pb n="433" facs="tcp:38521:238"/>
and sincerity of their own Clergy, being so indigent and so interessed persons, and so confidently charged and so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caught with falshoods? what fraud can be more visible then to make men believe that so infamous and dissolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> &amp;c. were Saints, sent by God to restore his Church vnto it's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive doctrin, and spirit? or that they, and all protestants do agree in all matters of faith, against Papists. Their dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, vices, and wickedness are so manifest, that they can not be denyed without impudency, and without giving the lye to the whole world, and contradicting their own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. And yet the Arch-bishop of Canterbury and his <hi>Junta</hi> of Divines, would face down Mr. <hi>Walsingham,</hi> that there was no such matter; and because the poore man humbly petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to have the matter decided, by comparing their own books (which were in the next roome) with his notes, he was censured and called a <hi>foolish bold Knave, impudent fellow, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And after that by his own importunity Mr. <hi>Walsingham</hi> had obtained of Doctor <hi>Covell</hi> to shew him <hi>Luther's</hi> book wherin he acknowledged this conference and conviction of the Devill's arguments,<note place="margin">

By what particular indirect means, cavills, and Calumnies, the Arch-bishop himself endeavored to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the protestant Religion, and discredit the Catholick, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering to Mr. <hi>Walsingham</hi> Mr. <hi>Bell's</hi> libell against the Iesuits, as an invincible fortress against the Roman faith; and his other book full of corruptions and falsifications, as a very sincere and solid piece; which falsifications being shewed to them all sitting in their <hi>Junta,</hi> and Iudgment about that affaire, the Arch-bishop durst not send into his study for the Fathers works that were affirmed by Mr. <hi>Walsingham</hi> to have bin cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by <hi>Bell</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi>

His Lordship's confessed pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise also of burning Catholick Books argues the weaknes of the protestant cause, and proves how much they are afraid their own false dealing, and the impiety of their principles should be discovered.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Reflexion. That Mr. <hi>Walsingham's</hi> case hath bin and is revived and practised now every day, when any conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious protestant begins to doubt of the safety and sincerity of his Religion. The protestant Clergy tells him that he is in a sure way of salvation, and yet this assertion is against one of their articles of faith, to wit, that which acknowledgeth their Church is fallible in proposing Christ's doctrin and the true sense of Scripture, and by consequence, (for all they know) themselves may be in damnable errors. Then they tell him the Papists are Jdolaters, worship Anti-Christ, &amp;c. that our Books of Controversyes are full of lyes, and fables; and to make good these their impostures, they not only corrupt our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but translate into English all infamous libells, though they treat not of controversies, as the <hi>Jansenists Letters, Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fox</hi> his relations: and for the renegat <hi>Fr.

                     <p n="5">5. Reflexion. One of my Lord of Canterburyes reasons to Mr. <hi>Walsingham</hi> against crediting the Popish book was, <hi>do you not know when two men go to law together, one will speak the worst he can by the other</hi>? And though this ought not to be practised in law suites, much less in controversies of Religion, yet seeing my Lord would have protestants read our books with that prejudice, reason doth dictat that theirs ought not to be read without caution; especially Seeing every protestant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:38521:240"/>
and no Judge ought to give sentence before both sides be heard. Suppose therfore that the protestant and Catholick Clergy are engaged not only in a dispute of Religion, but in a suit of Law, to wit, whether the revenues of the Church of the three Kingdoms belong of right rather to the present possessors, then to the ancient proprietors? neither party (say you) ought to be Iudge in his own cause, who then must decide the business? The Layty; Content, let my Lord Chancellor of England (notwithstanding his known Jnclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to favor and promote protes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Let it be tryed in publik Court, which of the two parties are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of counterfeiting evidences? that is, of changing the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient letter and sense of Scripture, and of corrupting and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifying the Catholick Fathers and Councells. It is but matter of fact, and may be soon resolved. We have given our charge against our Adversaries long since, in our printed Books, and in this do renew the same. Let the Court command them to put in their answer.</p>
                     <p>And because the Protestant Clergy hath alwayes endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to make vs odious and obnoxious to the state, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural subjects and ill patriots, and will strive now to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade the world that our zeale in manifesting their frauds and falsifications, proceeds not from a desire of manifesting the truth, but from covetousness of possessing their lands, we doubt not but that in case reason and equity appeareth to be on the Catholick side, the Catholick Clergy will resign vnto his Majesty all their claim and right to the Church livings of the three Kingdoms, to be freely disposed of in pious and publik vses, as he and his Parliament will think most fit for the honor of God, and defence of this Monarchy against forrein enemies, and seditious subjects. Wherin we do no more then duty, and our Brethren did in the like occasion in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> reign. And as our offer can have no design but duty, so this Tryal can not be against conscience, and may


<pb n="437" facs="tcp:38521:240"/>
prove to be of great consequence, both for the salvation of soules, and satisfaction of his Majestyes subjects. It can not be against the tenderness of Protestant consciences, because Roman Catholicks (who pretend to a greater certainty of doctrin, as believing the Roman Catholick Church to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible) have admitted of such a tryal in France an. 1600. in presence of the King, (then a Catholick) the princes, and of all the Court; and hath bin translated into English in the third part of the 3.

French Iesuit, discovering at least a thousand falshoods of his part. And the Bishop of <hi>Eureux</hi> (afterwards Cardinal <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>) Protested vpon his honor in the pulpit, that he could shew more then 500. Falsifications in the Book for his part.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the Duke of <hi>Bovillon, Monsieur Rosny,</hi> Mr. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers</hi> and other Protestant Lords, began to call for a tryal of the truth, for that it seemed to touch all their honors, as well as that of their Protestant Religion. It were to be wish'd that some of our English Protestant Nobility and Gentry did imitat the French Hugonots, rather in this example of the sense they shewed both of honor and conscience, then in the fashion of their cloaths, cringies and congies.

If you add to this insulting dress the impudent drift of the book, which is to dissuade all the Irish, and English Catholicks from popery, you will find that the credit and Religion of prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tik Protestants is more deeply engaged in maintaining the truth of Bishop <hi>Taylor's</hi> cause, then the French <hi>Hugonots</hi> in vindicating Monsieur de <hi>Plessis,</hi> and defending his book against the Mass.

                        </gap> is, that in the first page of his first Tome he placeth the Image of the Roman Church in form of a woman with a heavy wodden Cross on her shoulders &amp;c·
<q>This is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lye (saith Mr. <hi>Sutcliff</hi>) for that the Roman Church that now is possessed of the triple Crown, was never subject to the Cross of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> for that the Pope claimeth a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er above all Emperors, liveth in delights &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>His second charge of wilfull falsification is, that wheras the sayd picture had two great keyes of the Popes cellar (as Mr. <hi>Sutcliff</hi> saith) hanging down vnder it, <hi>he lyeth impudently,</hi> saith Sutcliff, <hi>where he signifieth that Christ gave the Keyes to the Pope and his adherents &amp;c.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth charge of wilfull falsification is, that Mr. <hi>Sutcliff</hi> supposing <hi>Baronius</hi> and the Pope do mean to worship that wodden Cross layd vpon the pictures shoulders, he saith, <hi>that if Baronius mean the true Church, he lyeth, for that the true Church did never worship any woodden Cross.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fifth charge is about these words <hi>subegit Gentes</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the picture, <hi>this is a lye</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Sutcliff) for that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens, Turks, and Gentils, have prevailed against the Pope and his followers &amp;c. regaining the Holy Land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The sixth charge is that the holy Ghost hovereth over the triple Crown, the <hi>B.

                        <pb n="486" facs="tcp:38521:265"/>What I desire the Protestant Reader should observe in the charges of wilfull falsifications and lyes which they print against our Catholick Authors is, the difference between our charges against them, and of theirs against us. We charge Protestants with heresies, and with corrupting Scripture, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Councells, to prove heresies, and we demonstrat the same so home, that either they omit to answer the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and falsifications objected, or answer them with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding new falsifications to the old, as hath bin manifest hitherto; but the Protestant writers objections against us are either fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, impertinent, or forged by themselves. And when they can find no matter to carp at in such works as those of <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Belarmin,</hi> wherin there is such a multitude and variety of quotations, and relations, it may be well imagined how litle they will find in modern Catholick writers, who for the most part borrow from those two Cardinals what they say in Controversies of Religion. Had <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza, Kemnitius, Melancton,</hi> and <hi>Jewell,</hi> bin as sincere in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings against Catholicks, as <hi>Canisius, Coccius, Bellarmin, Gual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus, Peron, and Baronius</hi> are against Protestants, we could not have discovered so many palpable falsifications in the later Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant writers as our Books manifest to the world; wherof I have sayd more, J fear, then my Readers will have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to peruse. Yet I shall entreat them for the Conclusion of this matter to permit me to mention somewhat of <hi>Luther's,</hi> and <hi>Calvin's</hi> sincerity, the two chief Apostles of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Reformation; and of two others, the most eminent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats and writers of the Church of England, <hi>Usher</hi> and <hi>Laud,</hi> one called the <hi>Irish Saint,</hi> the other the <hi>English Martyr.</hi> When such Primats are proved Falsifiers, we need not examin further the writings of the Inferior Clergy, and petty Ministers, but remit the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi> is so far from expressing any fear or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of danger that the Church should be changed into <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panar errorum,</hi> a stews of errors, by addition of novelties, or falling from the primitive doctrin, that as if he had foreseen this corruption of his meaning, and cutting short his words practised by Mr. <hi>Laud,</hi> he declares in that very place by him quoted, that only hereticks and vngodly men can entertain any such thoughts of Christs spouse, <hi>sed avertat hoc a suorum menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus divina pietas, sitque hoc potius impiorum furor,</hi> these are his words, and concealed by the Bishop: who also striks out of <hi>Vincentius Lirin</hi>: other words wherby it did appear what a kind of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the Church is of the truths deposited with her, and how litle danger there is of corrupting the old, or admitting of new doctrin.

<q>To the same intent he conceales with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the rest that followes, which would have cleered all, and left no room for the Bishops fraud: for <hi>Vincentius Lirin</hi>: his words are, <hi>But the</hi> Church of Christ is a diligent Depositary or Keeper of the truths committed to her, never changes any thing at all in them, <hi>lessens nothing, adds nothing; nether cuts away things necessary, nor adjoyns things superfluous; neither looseth what is hers, nor vsurpes what belongs to others.</hi>

It is but every particular mans fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and word; no other proof is required by Protestants; nor indeed can any better be produced to make good, that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honest and learned searchers of Scripture as have bin and are in the Roman Catholick Church, can not, or will not see the pretended light of Scripture, so largely diffused among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, and distributed to every Fanatick, Presbyterian, and Prelatick, whose faith can not be maintained without this rash judgment, and most dangerous consequences, as prejudicial both to Church and state, as our late distempers have manifested.</p>

That the Catholicks are to represent the ten tribes, (because forsooth they are more numerous) and Protestants <hi>Juda:</hi> wheras no paralel can be more pat then the Protestants compared with the ten tribes, who left <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the High Priest, and rebelled with <hi>Jeroboam</hi>; which King out of vngodly policy, the better to secure his vsurped Crown (just as Queen Elizabeth) caused the people to desert the old and true Religion, set vp new Priests, Sacrifices &amp;c.</p>

Neither is there any doubt but that it was po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, though not piety, in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (whose title could not stand with popery) to bestow the sayd revenues vpon any men that would call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a <hi>Clergy,</hi> and engage to fool the vulgar sort with fals Scripture for framing a Religion or reformation agreable to her title and interest, against the Royal line of the <hi>Stewards,</hi>


                     <pb n="522" facs="tcp:38521:284"/>
lawfull heires of this Monarchy. As litle question can be made, that the present possessors, and pretenders of Bishopricks, and Benefices, will endeavor to justify and continue Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> cours, though the case be altered; and that such of the layty as have vnlawfull designs in their hearts, will side with the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, and strive to gain, or make a party, and win the hearts of ignorant and seditious people, by pretending great zeal for that prelatick Religion wherby Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> vsurped the Crown, and her Creatures the revenues of the Church; not despairing but that as she by the advice of her Councel and Clergy forc't, or foold this Nation out of their loyalty, and duty to the <hi>Stewards</hi> (by pretending that popery is <hi>Idolatry</hi>) so them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves may vpon any occasion, (and perhaps vpon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of liberty of conscience) have the like success against K. <hi>Charles</hi> the second, as Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had against the Queen of Scots. This is the only objection can be made against liberty of Conscience, from which (say they) will spring Popery and will be the plea of policy against piety, in case the falshood of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick protestancy, and the frauds of the faction interested therin, should be as zealously cryed down, as we presume it to be cleerly discovered in this Treatise.</p>
                  <p>Our answer to this plea is. 1. That liberty of conscience, and legal changes of Religion in England, have bin alwayes made by Acts of Parliament, as we may see in the statuts of K. Henry 8. K. Edward 6. Q. Mary, and Q. Elizabeth; and against resolutions taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in so legal and general a way, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious designs have ever prevailed in this Monarchy; nor can; because in a Parliament is involved the free consent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Prince and people; and in case it should be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conscionable and convenient that liberty of Conscience be granted to all Christians, (though thereby it could be feared the Roman Catholick Religion would be restored to these Kingdoms) it must be at the instance of the people, and by vote of Parliament; for that the Royal family, and the privy Councel are at present nothing inclin'd to Popery: But we


<pb n="523" facs="tcp:38521:284"/>
hope and pray that in time God may open his Majesties and his Councells eyes to see the Divin truth, and the Temporal conveniences annexed to the ancient faith wherof this Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy hath bin so long deprived. 2. The case between the Queen of Scots, and her Royal issue now reigning, is very different; for albeit her right was as cleer (according not only to Catholick principles, but to Acts of our Protestant Parliaments) as it is, that a man can not have two Wives at once, or that Q. Elizabeths mother could not be wife to K. Henry 8. during Q. <hi>Catherins</hi> life, nor her self legitimat; yet the Protestant principles, and her Fathers Testament, seemed to favor her succession; and the Queen of Scots mariage to the <hi>Dolphin</hi> of France made the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (even Catholicks) more slow then <hi>they</hi> would have bin otherwise, in declaring for her right in the due time (which was a litle before, and immediatly <hi>after</hi> Q. Mary dyed) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not inclined to be subject to a French King, or governed by his <hi>Viceroy.</hi> None of these circumstances and considerations now concurring, it is not likely that designing or discontented persons can take any advantage against the royal family that now reigns, in case liberty of conscience, or even the restoring of the Roman Religion should be judged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious, and convenient by the Parliament.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Protestant Clergys sincerity is now much more suspected, and the common people less incensed against popery, then in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes; when the Protestant Bishops and Ministers Sermons, and Bibles made men believe, that <hi>Images</hi> were <hi>Idols,</hi> the <hi>Pope Anti-Christ; Priests, Traytors, Agents for the King of Spaine</hi> &amp;c. which things now are discovered to be calumnies and impostures; for the Bible making <hi>Images Idols,</hi> is corrected by publick authority; the <hi>Pope</hi> known to be a civil person, like other men, not the beast of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps: Nor Rome the whore of Babylon: Priests have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King faithfully at home and abroad; and if any of them hath in our late troubles negotiated with the King of Spain, or his Ministers, it was then intended, and since hath


<pb n="524" facs="tcp:38521:285"/>
proved, and bin owned by our gratious Soveraign to have had bin for his Majesties, and his Royal Highness benefit; and (when they were in exile) in order to their subsistance and restauration; not any way against their interest. Wherfore seing the people of these nations are naturaly inclined to piety, though whilst they were abused by the Protestant Clergy, and countenanced by the interest of an illegitimat Prince, they did persecute Priests and popery as the greatest obstacles of peace and salvation; yet now, seing they are better informed, and that in this particular of our desire to apply the Church reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to the Crown for the defence of this Empire against all forreign and domestick Disturbers, we can have no design but duty to our King, and love to our Countrey, there can be no ground to fear, that the bare word or clamors of interested Adversaries, will disturb the Government, or incense a well meaning multitude against Papists, Priests, or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that desire nothing but a peacable and publick Conference in order to liberty of Conscience, and to ease these Nations of those heavy burthens vnder which they grone. And indeed it concerns so much the soul and state, the publick good, and all privat persons to examin, whether English men (after so many changes) may not, and have not bin mistaken in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and misled by education, that we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to hope some worthy and zealous Protestants will be pleased, (for their own, and the worlds satisfaction) to move in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that our objections against the novelty of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, and the sincerity of their Clergy, may be taken into Consideration, and a publick Tryall allowed for the discovery either of their Cheat, or of our Calumny. If I be found a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator (no other joyned with me in this work) I do engage in the word of a Christian, to present my self to due punishment, in case J escape the pestilence, wherunto J have resolved to expose my self for the benefit and salvation of my brethren; but if the Protestant learned Clergy be found Cheats, I humbly and only beg, that the revenues which they possess


<pb n="525" facs="tcp:38521:285" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may be better bestowed; not vpon the Catholick Clergy, but vpon the Crown, for the defence and ease of the Countrey. If the Protestant Religion be true, by a fair Tryal it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no damage, nor the state incurr any danger: if false, besides the conversion of souls to the Catholick truth, the Commonwealth may declare (to whom it appertains) the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity there is of seising vpon the Church livings for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the people; and by their approbation conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously enjoy the same.</p>
                  <p>And albeit never any Protestant contributed to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Bishopricks, or Benefices; but that all such pious works in these Kingdoms have bin founded by our Roman Catholick predecessors, with an express obligation of prayer for the souls in Purgatory, and of preaching the Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; yet I question not but that they who (by vertue of the last wills and Testaments of the Founders, and long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of lawfull Predecessors,) ought to be in possession of the Temporalities of the Church, are so good Patriots and dutifull subjects, as to declare they will resign their right vnto his Majesty, whensoever these three Kingdoms will think fit to grant liberty of Conscience, or to return the ancient true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and therby the world may be satisfyed, that our quarrell with the Protestant Clergy is not for lands, but for souls; and of this we have given heretofore sufficient evidence in the change of Religion made by Q. <hi>Mary</hi>; having then resigned our Abbeys,<note place="margin">

And as for any other indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and infallible Judge, the Bishop thinkes there is none as yet in the world; and yet its certain that a Iudge or <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi> that is not believed infallible, is not for the purpose, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause neither party can be obliged to submit their judgments to its sentence in matters of faith.

And yet we granted to them in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> reign as free a disputation as they desired; we gave them their choice of books and notaries, and time, not only to put in their arguments and answers in writing, but to review and correct what they dislik't vpon more mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.</p>
                  <p>To Arch-bishop <hi>Lauds</hi> reason for not allowing a <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> is answered, that we desire so much the salvation of souls and service of the state, that we will give vnder our own hands and seals (the powers of Rome we cannot Command) that if Protestants will admit of such a <hi>Trial</hi> as was granted to them in England, and to their party in <hi>France</hi> (which we have related in this Treatise) we are content to submit to my Lord keeper of England and other noble persons judgments therin: And let our Adversaries choos either to argue or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; let them object falsifications of Scripture and Fathers against us; or answer to such as we shall charge them withall. And if they cannot maintain their <hi>Reformation</hi> without such fraudulent dealing as we object against them, let them loose the Church revenues; if we can not defend our Religion without the lik fraud, let us not only be debarred from liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conscience but loose our lives.

Had the dispute between them and us, bin about conveniency of disciplin, or decency of Ceremonies, a change in such things, (alterable according to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of time, place and persons) might be pious and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,

because it might take away occasion of cavills; but to alter the essential forms of Priesthood and Episcopacy, and to add therunto (now after a Century of years) words which (hitherto wanting) concludes the Nullity of their Church, and Clergy, must rather augment the doubt, then avoyd the cavil.

J fancy they have hopes that some other <hi>Spalato</hi> will Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, and then by this new vndoubted form make them real Bishops. Yet that will not serve their turn; their want of spiritual Jurisdiction makes their caracter vseless; and want of jurisdiction together with their errors in Doctrin doth vn-Church a Congregation, as well as want of Orders.</p>
                  <p>As this want of ordination renders them incapable of the Benefices and Bishopricks which they enjoy; so their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scripture, and Falsifications of Councells and Fathers, make them vnworthy: And he can not be a true Christian that will stick to their interest after that he is informed of the nullity of their calling, and of the falshood of their doctrin. Wherfore it will not be in the power of any prelatick politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian to make himself popular vpon the score of patronizing such a cause, or Clergy against Liberty of conscience or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences: and the Prelatick caracter and disciplin is to all other Protestant parties as odious, as our late distempers have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced.</p>
                  <p>The only objection now remaining is, that Presbyterians and other Sectaries will take the advantage of an Act for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conscience, or even for a change in Religion (in case the Parliament should resolve vpon it) for crying down of Monarchy. But (as we said) t'is well known these Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries


<pb n="531" facs="tcp:38521:288"/>
either desire Liberty of Conscience, or their animosity is as great against Prelatick Protestancy as against Popery; and if now they be kept in obedience and aw of the government, the King and Parliament will be better able hereafter (in case of any such liberty, or change to keep them to their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (by the addition of the Church revenues) then they are at present. Besides, it is very certain that among those Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries many are moral and conscientious persons, and would conform to the truth of the Roman Catholick Religion, had they bin rightly informed, and the Tenets therof had not bin rendred odious and ridiculous by the impostures of Protestant preachers, and the vulgar errors of a homly education; all which obstacles will be easily removed, if Catholicks have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to speak and reason for themselves. So that consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the influence which Truth alwayes hath vpon honest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions (such as our English are) and the prejudice which all men retain against falshood, when it is discovered (and it is not their interest to promote it) I see no danger of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people into a Rebellion vpon the account of Liberty of Conscience, or of opposing a change from Protestancy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the old Religion; especialy seing the generality may hope thereby to see the Church Revenues lawfully and legaly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to their own ease, and against all disturbers of the peace, and Trade of these Nations. Let us therfore have a fair Trial and conference in order to Liberty of Conscience, and then judge of the truth and sincerity of both Clergys, and of both Religions.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the evident conveniency of this humble proposal, I fear we do in vain flatter our selves with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of a publick Conference. We are inclined to believe what we wish for, notwithstanding that former experience, and our learned Adversaries knowledge of so cleer evidences on our side, casts vs again into despair. Did the busines depend of the vote, of the whole multitude of the Protestant Clergy, we might assure our selves of a conference, because many of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary


<pb n="532" facs="tcp:38521:289"/>
                     <hi>Persons</hi> are honest, and most so ignorant, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themselves to be in the right way of saluation; for, they take all that Bishop <hi>Jewell,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Fox</hi> say, for truth, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver examining it further. But the Bishops and great Doctors are of another stamp; I fear their guilt of conscience, will busy them in opposing all Treaties and Trials of Truth; and yet methinks not any one thing should render them more suspected of fraud, and falshood, then so vnreasonable an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. 1. Because it argues diffidence of their cause. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Church being confessedly fallible, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence vncertain of the truth, they ought not to refuse any means wherby men may be further informed therof. Though we Papists believe the Roman Catholick Church infallible in matters of doctrin, yet whensoever our Adversaries desire to conferr about Religion, their Request is granted: nay the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> (how ever inconsiderable Protestants make it) invited all the learned Protestants of the world to propose therin all their doubts and difficulties, offering all safety and civility to their persons. And though the infallibility of our Church be not consistent with a submission of our faith to the judgment of a <hi>Third</hi> in point of doctrin, yet that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative doth not debarr us from submitting ourselves in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, and falsifications, to a fair trial of indifferent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. As for the Pope and general Councells not submitting to a Third in controversies with Protestants, it is no pride; but a prerogative of all supreme Magistrats, whether spiritual or temporal, as our Adversaries confess, and contest to be reasonable when their own Bishops deal with Non-conformists; and all Lay Soveraigns must maintain the same, when they treat with their revolted Subjects; which Subjects are judged very vnreasonable if they refuse to treat with their King (of grievances) vnless he submits the controversy to the decision of a <hi>Third:</hi> and much more intollerable, if no competent <hi>Third</hi> were to be found, as it is in our case; vnless we think that Turks, Iews, or Pagans, are fit men to judge of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian


<pb n="533" facs="tcp:38521:289"/>
Religion. Wherefore, if the Church of England thinks it unreasonable, that her Sectaries should not conferr with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick Divines, unless they have it under the seal and powers of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that the Arch-Bishops, or the Convocation will submit to the judgment of a Third; I understand not how Arch-Bishhop <hi>Laud</hi> could exact the like condition from the Pope or a general Council, before Protestants would confer with Roman Catholicks.</p>
                  <p>The other reasons alledged for refusing to Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks a publick Trial of Falsifications, and an amicable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Religion, makes the refusal yet more unreasonable. Popery (saith every Protestant) is <hi>a growing Religion</hi>; if dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes thereof be admitted, we shall turn all Papists: If they be not persecuted, their profession will prevail: If liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science be granted, very few will frequent Protestant Churches. The prelatick Clergys last reason is, <hi>Venient Romani &amp; tollent locum nostrum.</hi> If we come once to reason the matter with Roman Catholicks, infallibly we shall loose our Revenues. But, I may assiure them that the Roman Clergy covet not their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues; if it be found that we have any right to the Church livings, we will lay our pretensions at his Majesties feet, and Petition the Pope (as we did in Queen Marys days) to leave all to the King and Parliaments disposal, for the ease and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our fellow Subjects, and the terror of our Enemies. And as for our Religion being <hi>a growing Religion,</hi> we cannot deny it, and rejoyce that our Adversaries confess so much; how could it otherwise be the <hi>Catholick,</hi> or become universal? <hi>Protestancy</hi> is confined to this Northern Climate, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding its liberty, of open and sensual allurements; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan perswasion is propagated by force of Arms, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Wives; the <hi>Greek</hi> Schism is but a spite and spleen against the Primacy of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore is justly Become a Slavery to the <hi>Turk.</hi> No Religion but the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick doth grow and flourish, <hi>maugre</hi> the Storms of outwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That without Uniformity in Religion, or without Liberty of Conscience, it is impossible for a Monarchy to be long pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable, or powerful, is manifest by Reason and Experience. Reason doth dictate, that when Mens minds are Discontented and Oppressed by Persecution for their Conscience, they will hazard their <hi>all</hi> to be satisfied and saved; their Rebellion against the Soveraign will be thought the ground of their Salvation, or at least the only way to preserve their Posterity from being damned, and brought up in the state false Religion. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience doth shew that diversity of Opinions, if but one be permitted, doth not only occasion Domestick differences, as the parting of Man and Wife, of Parents and Children, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Sisters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But is the cause of publick Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, as jealousies between Princes and Subjects, from whence proceed civil Wars, which are the greatest obstacle of Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in an Empire, or Commonwealth. Whilst the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were persecuted in <hi>France, France</hi> was not so considerable; Here in <hi>England</hi> we are more afraid of persecuted <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Fanaticks,</hi> and other <hi>Sectaries,</hi> than of the <hi>French, Danes</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>; seeing therefore Liberty, or Uniformity in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is so necessary for the Peace and Power of a Monarchy, all States-men must grant the Religion fittest for the State is that, which is most likely to be generally embraced, if Men may have their free choice. Now whether that be <hi>Protestancy,</hi> or <hi>Popery,</hi> is the question. It is not <hi>Protestancy,</hi> because 'tis now a hundred years and more, since it hath been endeavoured by

all ways imaginable to bring the Subjects of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> unto an Uniformity in <hi>Protestancy,</hi> even by Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and Penal Statutes; and yet the design doth not take, and indeed cannot: Because it involves a contradiction; for, <hi>to be a Protestant,</hi> is to have the liberty of <hi>op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Besides, the Protestant Church (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Prelatick, Presbyterian,</hi> or <hi>Fanatick</hi>) is not as much as pretended to be Infallible in Doctrine, or in its Interpretation of Scripture; and it's a great vanity for a Church that professeth Fallibility in explaining the Scriptures, and admitteth a liberty or Latitude of applying the Letter of the same, to every private mans Spirit and Interpretation, to oblige men to any unity, or certainty of Faith, and therefore our Acts of Parliament are so inefficacious. Again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith is not Christian, unless the Believers hold it certain; and no Believer can hold his own Faith certain, if he submits and comforms his Judgment to the Doctrine and Decrees of a Fallible Church: For that no man can think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self certain of what he knows may fail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> evident therefore it is, that the <hi>Protestant</hi> Faith is neither Christian nor certain; because the Professors thereof (if they be guided by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed fallible Church) must know that their Faith may be False.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman Catholick Church</hi> (seeing it is believed Infallible by all <hi>Catholicks</hi>) may teach a Faith which must be thought by us to be Certain, Conscientious, Christian, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence convenient, fit for both Soul, and State.

For, these Signs of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence are so far above the force and course of Nature, and so visible to all the World, that not only the Learned, but all sorts of people who are not wilfully obstinate, must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess a sufficient evidence of Gods Commission, and Authority in our Church; and by consequence they deny Gods veracity, who contradict the Doctrine of a Congregation that hath so notorious, and significant badges of his Divine trust for propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Articles of Faith, and composing all differences in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that having for our guide a Church of so Authentick Authority, &amp; a Testimony to rely upon, so visibly confirmed by supernatural Miracles, &amp; marks of Gods Commission, the same Church must needs have his Infallible assistance in discharging her trust, of instructing Mankind; wherefore we <hi>Catholicks</hi> may &amp; do uniformly agree &amp; acquiess in her <hi>Difinitions,</hi> with

                  <p>He must be very unreasonable, who (after being informed of these motives of credibility, or marks of Gods Church) will refuse to submit his judgment to so convincing arguments of the Divine Authority; and this is the reason why not only the Natives of one Country, or the Subjects of one Monarch, but whole Kingdoms and Kings of most different tempers, and interests, do so easily, constantly, and unanimously submit and adhear to the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religon, both now and in former Ages; whereas they who at any time opposed the same, could never agree among themselves, or with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but were, and are divided into as many opinions, as there are fancies, or occasions offered of changing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, or of raising their fortunes.</p>
                  <p>And now our States-men may easily conclude which of both Religions is not only most conscientious for the soul, but most convenient for the power and peace of the State, if they will reflect upon the different ways of planting and preserving both Religions, the <hi>Catholick,</hi> and <hi>Protestant.</hi> To omit other examples, let them consider how St. <hi>Austin</hi> our Apostle of <hi>England,</hi> arrived at <hi>Kent</hi> with forty Monks and Preachers, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into <hi>Canterbury</hi> (as our Adversary <hi>Fox</hi> confesseth p. 150.) in procession with a <hi>Crucifix</hi> carried before him, and singing <hi>Litanies</hi>; and how they converted that Kingdom and all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from <hi>Paganism</hi> to the very same <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion we now profess, in every particular; not by force of Arms, or by Frauds of falsifying the Letter and Sense of Scripture;<note place="margin">

                  <p>Seeing therefore our Adversaries do confess that the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> is a <hi>growing Religion,</hi> even in this groaning and sad condition wherein we are kept in these Kingdoms; who doubts but that if made the Religion of the State, and countenanced by Law, or even tolerated, it will soon grow to such a hight, that all other persuasions will be rendred contemptible, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of thwarting the Designs and Decrees that will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved upon by the King and Parliament? when Law, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Reason walk hand in hand, there is no room or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text left for <hi>Rebellion</hi> upon the score of conscience.

A <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> so supernaturally qualified, cannot be prudently suspected to be a Cheat, or humane Invention; And if once, I do not say, established, but permitted, in these Kingdoms, its Doctrine needeth not be fenced with Sanguinary Statues, nor favoured by any <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> for <hi>Vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>; all which rigorous proceedings will be superfluous, as also the continual care and vast charges of suppressing unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Assemblies.

All these impieties and disorders I say, will be quasht when liberty is granted to declare unto the ignorant and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed people, the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> truths, and the motives that induce to believe them: and no Nations in the World are more inclined to embrace the truth, and wholsom docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than these Islands; witness the multitude of our anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Saints, the magnificence of our Churches, &amp; even the zeal of the present <hi>Seekers,</hi> and <hi>Sectaries,</hi> in their mistaken way of Salvation.</p>

                     <pb n="541" facs="tcp:38521:293"/>By all which it appeareth there would soon be an Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in Religion in these Kingdoms, if the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> were Tolerated. That the King would have a considerable and conscientious Revenue (to support the Honour of this Monarchy, and suppress all sinister designs) by the addition of the Church Livings, when resigned by the <hi>Roman Clergy,</hi> needeth no proof; I believe there will be found more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in His Majesty to accept, than in the <hi>Catholick Clergy</hi> to offer such a Donative; seeing His Piety is now so great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards unlawful Ministers, doubtless it would be refined in case He did see the mistake. Let us suppose therefore that God hath heard our continual Prayers, and will open the eyes of him and of these Nations, and that they will acknowledge the Errors of their Education; in such a case I say, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Clergy</hi> ought to press (and without doubt will) their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues upon His Majesty and the <hi>Commonwealth</hi>? 1. To let the World see they seek not so much Worldly Interest as the salvation of Souls. 2. Because the Kings <hi>Catholick Ancestors</hi> and theit Subjects of the same Profession, founded all the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks</hi> and <hi>Benefices</hi> of these Kingdoms; and it is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and practice of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> that in case of necessity, the Heirs of the Founders ought to be maintained and relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Foundations.</p>
                  <p>But the principal reason to move His Majesty not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the <hi>Roman Catholick Clergy</hi> to make so dutiful an offer, is the absolute necessity there is of a greater publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, then at present the Crown doth possess. For though the <hi>English</hi> Valour should force advantagious Articles of Peace from our Enemies, that Peace will not be lasting, unless they see we are in a condition to force the performance as well as the Peace; if at any time a breach of Articles should happen, or new injuries be offered. Nothing is more uncertain than the solemn agreement of Princes: Their Leagues last no longer than until they be at leasure, and recover strength to renew the War; and if one of them wants a constant &amp; considerable

Revenue, he and his Subjects will be contemned and his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions made a prey to his more powerful Neighbour, though lately reconciled Friend. The best pledge therefore of a Peace with Foreigners, is our own power: if we rely wholly upon the word of the <hi>French,</hi> or upon the worth of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> we shall be mistaken, and repent our credulity.</p>
                  <p>But shall our power so depend of Parliaments, that before the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> can meet, or Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Without doubt our power must depend of Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> espicially of one annexing the Church Revenues to the Crown, seeing no other <hi>found</hi> doth appear. Never <hi>Parliament</hi> did give greater proofs of love and liberality to a King, than this present; but the more people have given, the less able they are to give; their will is still the same, their ability is not: what then? must <hi>Church-men</hi> (whose profession ought to be poverty, especially when the State is empoverish'd) think of enjoying <hi>Millions</hi> of Revenue, and see that the <hi>Laity</hi> is not able to bear the burden of the War? or must the <hi>Fng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Monarchy be reduced to such a condition, that if the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> will but send a Messenger to have a Place of importance delivered to them, it must be done, because the King hath not Money to maintain a War, and defend His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? I do not say this hath been, but I fear it may be the case of <hi>England,</hi> if the King's Revenues be not made much more considerable than they are. And how they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably, conscientiously and conveniently raised otherwise than I have proposed (by the Lands of the <hi>Church</hi>) I do not understand, and wish that others find out a better expedient. As for relying upon extraordinary Taxes and Subsidies, raised from the empoverished, and discontented <hi>Laity</hi> by new Acts of Parliaments, according to occasions offered, it is not safe; for that such Taxes are look'd upon by all wise men, to be more dangerous than durable, as depending upon a popular Vote and Vogue, whereupon neither the secret and solid designs of


<pb n="543" facs="tcp:38521:294"/>
State, nor the Peace of the Monarchy, nor the power of the Monarch (all which require a constant and sure Revenue) can be well built.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore that extraordinary Taxes cannot be made, that ordinary and constant Revenue, which is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the maintenance of Peace as well as of War, and that the <hi>Laity</hi> cannot contribute much more than they have done, and that the Revenues of the <hi>Clergy</hi> may be so conscientiously applied to the <hi>Crown,</hi> I see not any scruple of <hi>Sacriledge</hi> that may deter the King or Parliament from such a resolution. There is not one <hi>Catholick</hi> Divine thinks it <hi>Sacriledge</hi> to apply sacred things to pious uses; and what use can be more pious, than the publick safety, the defence of King and Country, the ease of poor Subjects, the maintenance of Soldiers and Sea-men that venture their lives for our repose? or then Pensions to their Widows and Children, when themselves perish in the Service? Seeing I say, this is lawful and laudable in all other Countries, I see not why our <hi>Bretish Clergy</hi> should be excepted from so general a rule, and excepted from so particular a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?

                  <p>But in such a case, how shall the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Clergy be maintained? by Gods Providence, and Christian Charity, as they have been, when our Ancestors were first Converted.

Its undeniable that the two best Provinces of <hi>France (Normandy</hi> and <hi>Aquitain</hi>) are our Kings antient Patrimony, and undoubted Inheritance; neither can his right to that whole Kingdom be much que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, seeing that the <hi>Salick Law</hi> (if ever any such thing was) extended no further than <hi>Franconia,</hi> a Province of <hi>Germany</hi>; and had it been intended for <hi>France,</hi> the Line Male of the Kings thereof, had not been so frequently changed: but it seems the <hi>French</hi> would have one Law for us, and another, or none at all, for themselves. Our antient Kings regarded not this <hi>Salick</hi> Pretext, they claimed by Law, and conquered by Arms that great Empire; But the difference between the <hi>white</hi> and <hi>red Rose,</hi> occasioned the loss of our <hi>French Lillies</hi>; when those dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences

were compos'd, and the Titles of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> united in King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. instead of recovering <hi>France,</hi> he made a breach with <hi>Rome</hi>; and by the Protestant Reformation, which he began, and his Successors continued, they have been so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and distracted at home, that they wanted both means and opportunity to prosecute their claim to the best Kingdom of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed so long as Protestancy doth so much prevail in these Islands, we may despair of having any Dominion in the Catholick <hi>Continent.</hi> We have had late experience how the two emulous great Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> conspired to recover (contrary to the ordinary maxims and practises of state) <hi>Dunkirk</hi> out of our hands; neither was it bestowed upon us with any other intention then of taking it from us when a peace should be concluded, tho' <hi>Cardinal Mazarin</hi> endeavour'd to make <hi>Cromwell</hi> believe the contrary. But that which must make our hopes (even of <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Aquitain</hi>) quite vanish, is the prejudice which the generality and nobility of <hi>France,</hi> and of those two mention'd Provinces, retain against the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which our former Kings not only professed but pressed upon others. The <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>Gascoins</hi> do love our King as their undoubted and natural Prince; but they are so averse from being of his Religion, that they had rather endure the hardships of a Jealous (but Catholick) Government, then try and trust the Faith and <hi>Caresses</hi> of a Protestant. And truly our proceedings in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Principles whereupon we have grounded the <hi>Settlement</hi> of that Nation, seem to have so little regard to the performance of Promises, Solemnity of Treaties, and engagements of publick Faith made to Roman Catholicks, that few of that Profession will be induced to take a <hi>Protestants</hi> word, or trust his Religion in another occasion; seeing that, notwithstanding the Kings inclination, and <hi>Declaration</hi> to make good his <hi>Articles of Peace,</hi> such is the priviledge of <hi>Protestancy,</hi> and the Power or Prerogative it gives to the <hi>Protestant Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> that a King cannot be just to <hi>Papists,</hi> without running

the hazard of being injurious to himself, and of loosing his Crown by a <hi>Protestant</hi> Rebellion. Is it likely that <hi>Catholick</hi> stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers will become Subjects to this Monarchy, when the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Natives are by our Laws made Strangers, and incapable of Trust or Employment, only because they are <hi>Catholicks</hi>? Is it credible we shall maintain the Priviledges and Rights of Foreign <hi>Catholick</hi> Corporations, when we make a Law that no <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> shall enjoy his own Lands, or freedom in our Corporations, notwithstanding the express Articles of a proclaim'd Peace to the contrary, in favour of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Natives. Therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we resolve to be more moderate in our Religion at home, it is a vanity to claim our Right, or to think of diverting our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad. As for designs built upon the Strength of the <hi>French Hugonots,</hi> they can have no other ground but our desires; that Party is brought so low in <hi>France,</hi> that the King made his aversion to their Religion, and Themselves, no state secret; and scrupled not to tell their Agents representing Grievances, that though <hi>his Grandfather loved them, and his Father feared them, yet he did neither love nor fear them:</hi> And truly all that <hi>England</hi> can expect from them, is but the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Prayers of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton,</hi> and of their other <hi>Calvinian</hi> Congregations, for the good success of <hi>Puritans</hi> against <hi>Prelaticks</hi> and <hi>Royalists.</hi> But if the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> were Restored, or at least Tolerated in these Kingdoms, by Act of Parliament, we should be more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to the <hi>French</hi> Kings, then ever our Ancestors have been, and no less successful. <hi>Normandy,</hi> and <hi>Aquitain,</hi> could have then no pretext to except against their Lawful Princes; the <hi>Scots</hi> (who always hindred) would now help to Conquer the rest of that Kingdom. The Princes of the <hi>French</hi> Blood could not be kept in such awe, as they are at present, if we had any footing in <hi>France,</hi> and the odious Name and Faith of <hi>Protestants,</hi> were (by granting liberty of Conscience) a little sweetned; otherwise if the Princes (who perhaps desire to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour any Foreigner, whether <hi>Protestant</hi> or <hi>Catholick</hi> to make their Cousin less Absolute) did joyn with <hi>Protestants,</hi> their Power

would be rendred useless, and themselves odious, because they joyned with Persecutors of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Faith.</p>
                  <p>Besides; the <hi>Spaniard</hi> (whose Interest it is to have <hi>France</hi> divided, and embroil'd) would countenance our Designs, and contribute to our Conquest, if we Tolerated <hi>Catholicks</hi>; which now he dares not do either for scruple of Conscience, or at least for fear of loosing the Reputation and Name of the <hi>Catholick</hi> King, that gets him so many grants of Church Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, <hi>Comiendas,</hi> and <hi>Cruzadas,</hi> and so great Contibutions from the Clergy. If he joyn'd with us (as now we are) in recovering our Right, he would only gain the Name and Opinion of a <hi>Fautor</hi> of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and loose the Donatives and Devotion of his Church Friends, and perhaps the duty of his Lay Subjects. But if <hi>England</hi> did grant liberty of Conscience, it were much more for his Interest to dispose of his Daughters, and (with them) of <hi>Flanders</hi> to our Royal Family, than to the <hi>German House</hi> of <hi>Austria.</hi>

                  <p>Hitherto the Polititians of <hi>Europe</hi> have been employed in keeping the scales equal between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> to the end neither of those two great Crowns might gain too far upon their Neighbours, and so by degrees devour all petty States and Princes, and afterwards endanger other Monarchs; hence every Crown concerned it self not only in protecting <hi>Allies,</hi> but in fomenting Rebellions, as Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did that of <hi>Holland,</hi> and of the other <hi>Vnited Provinces.</hi> But of late the case is altered; <hi>Holland</hi> now Copes with <hi>England</hi>; the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath had so many losses of Armies, Navies, and Kingdoms, that now he is more pittied then feared, or envy'd; and <hi>France</hi> is arrived to such a height of Power, by uniting to it self the Provinces of <hi>Lorain, Alsatia,</hi> and <hi>Rossillon</hi>; the Cities of <hi>Perpignan,</hi> and <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norole,</hi> (the Keys of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>) the greatest part of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois</hi>; And the most important Towns of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and other Provinces, and moreover the <hi>French King</hi> hath setled so vast a Revenue upon his Crown, independent of his Parliament, or of the vote of the People, that he and <hi>France</hi> is become a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror

Therefore leaving this Argument, I will return to that which is more proper for my profession, and shew how manifestly God hath confirm'd our Catholick Faith, (and confuted the <hi>Protestant</hi> persuasion) by Miracles, which are the greatest Evidence that is consistent with the nature and merit of Christian belief. For every point wherein <hi>Protestants</hi> &amp; we differ, I will relate Miracles wrought in favour of our Doctrine, and our sense of Scripture, against theirs, not recorded by uncertain or obscure Authors, but by the prime Saints and Doctors of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> in the Ages wherein they lived.</p>

purpose, and their confusion, that some true miracles have bin and are wrought in confirmation of that Roman Catholick Doctrin, which they deny, or doubt of, and we believe.</p>
                  <p>And first we are to know, that no Confessors (Martyrs have a priviledge, Martyrdom it self being a notorious miracle) are canonized, or worshiped by the Roman Catholick Church, before the Pastors therof see authentick proofs, of supernatural miracles wrought by those Confessors, or their Reliques. A holy life and conversation, if not confirmed by supernatural signs, is not sufficient to canonize a Roman Catholick Saint, because hypocrisy may deceive all human observation, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearances of morality are no infallible evidence of the internal acts wherby men are justifyed, and wherof God alone is witnes and Iudge; and therfore before his declaration and approbation of the persons true sanctity by working vndoubted miracles, none can be honored by the Church as his faithful and beloved servant. In the inquiry, and examination of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses concerning the truth of miracles, the care and caution of the Bishops, and other officers, is no less then the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a matter, wherin the credit not only of themselves, but of the whole Catholick Church is concerned; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the quality and capacity of the Jnformers and Jnquisitors is considered, as well as the nature and circumstances of the miracle, and the judgment of able Physitians (when it is a cure) demanded, least some natural accident or art, might pass for a supernatural miracle. And this not only of late, hath bin the practice of the Church, but continualy since the primitive times, as you may read in <hi>St. Austin</hi> (Breviar. Collat. di. 2. cap. 14.) who also (de oper. Monach. c. 28.) reprehendeth some vain and wicked Monks that for filthy lucre carried about fals, or doubtfull reliques of Martyrs. But the Church always provided <hi>Antidots</hi> against such Jmpostures; witnes the 14. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the 5. Councell of Carthage against revelations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques not approved of, and <hi>St. Gregory</hi> the Great in his letters to <hi>St. Augustin</hi> our Apostle of England (ep. 9.) And Innocent. 3. in the Councell of Lateran. c. 2.</p>

                     <pb n="555" facs="tcp:38521:300"/>And if the same be not exactly observed in these British Kingdoms, it must be attributed to the want of the States per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Roman Clergy for exercising that power which Catholick Canons give them, over such as pretend to be Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culists, Prophets, or to have revelations &amp;c. Where the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man disciplin and doctrin is obeyed, there are officers, or Jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors appointed, whose duty it is to inquire after, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the life, doctrin, and conversation of such as pretend to have supernatural gifts, and extraordinary illuminations, or to work miracles, which none dares to allow for true, much less print or publish, vntil the fact, and circumstances be maturely examined by the Bishops and their Divines, or by the Jnqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. Whefore all these diligences being applyed in so many different and distant places, by indifferent and eminent persons, it is as impossible the miracles returned by them as authentick, should be counterfeited, as it is that such men, no way related either among themselves, or to the person of whose life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation they inquire, and inform, should conspire to discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and damn themselves for an imposture that can not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and wherby they are to expect no benefit, but the loss of their benefices, dignities, perpetual imprisonment, and infamy. No marvel therfore if it was never heard that any one miracle related in the process or Bull of any Saints Canoniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was found to be fals, or as much as contradicted by any credible Testimony; so wary and circumspect the Church hath always bin, as also the Congregation of Cardinals, and Prelats, to which that charge is committed.</p>

                        <hi>This miracle failed once when it was shewed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly to a yong english Lord, and this failing was printed in the Italian Gazets as very strange news.</hi>
                     </note> but when in the festival of the Saint (or at other times) it is carryed in procession, or layd on the Altar at Mass together with the head, it is liquified and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in such sort, that it seemeth to boil, and assume a lively and fresh colour. This happens every year, and never faileth but when some great and general calamity doth immediatly ensue, and fall vpon the City and Kingdom of Naples. By this permanent miracle, which every Protestant Traveller may see, is confirmed our Roman Catholick Religion in general, and in particular the Sacrifice of the Mass, Transubstantiation, prayer to Saints, and the worship of their Reliques.</p>

Some noble men who came early to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (rather to pray for his soul, then to inquire of his health) were surprized to see him saying Mass at the Altar, and could not credit their eyes, vntill they were informed of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable means wherby he was rather revived then recovered.

                  <p>To that ordinary objection of Anti-Christs miracles which (though fals and feigned) yet will seem so true to many, that most of the world will be seduced, we answer. 1. That there will be an apparent difference between Anti-christian and our Catholick miracles, though for want of due reflexion, prudence and piety, men will not consider the difference, nor compare his miracles with ours. 2. Christs words and warning of Anti-Christs feigned miracles, is a sufficient evidence of their falshood, becaus we must not credit our selves, or any outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, against the express words of Christ. This is the reason why in the Sacrament of the Altar we are not deceived by the <hi>Species</hi> or appearance of bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>Though there were no other argument that Anti-Christs miracles are fals, but this,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The difference between true and fals miracles, is, that true miracles are works <hi>besides</hi> or <hi>against</hi> the order of nature, and of secundary causes, and therfore may be don only by the divin power; as to receive the dead, to cure diseases of the body, and distempers of the mind, without the application of any natural means, or remedys. And becaus the Devil hath less power over souls then over bodys, the cure of a distemper of the mind, wherof no natural cause appeareth, is a greater and more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick miracle, then any cure of the body how ever so prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.

Now if we prove that this marvellous and vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous


<pb n="564" facs="tcp:38521:305"/>
contradiction of our senses can not be a miracle of the Devil, protestants must grant it is a miracle of God; and from thence may conclude what censure themselves deserve for being obstinat against our doctrin, and for running with the appearance of sense against the express words of Scripture, confirmed by so supernatural and visible a miracle as our not condescending, or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to that evidence which we (as men) are naturaly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to follow.</p>
                  <p>It is an vndoubted Maxim wherin both Catholicks and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants agree, that God only can work vpon the soul (while it is in the body) immediatly, without the help of our senses, or without making impressions vpon the Organs therof. The Devil can not suggest or convey hereticall opinions into our minds otherwise then by so tempering the objects, and tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with our senses, that the soul doth willfully, though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily, embrace deceitful appearances for real truths. His whole power and art consists in humoring the soul in its mistake of these sensual appearances, and allurements, making them to seem vnquestionable evidences; for it would quite destroy his drift, and spoil his market, if the soul did suspect a fallacy, or at least reflect vpon the vanity of sensual objects, and appearances. Wherfore he always inculcats that the best rule in matters of faith, is, not to contradict or contemn (vpon any score what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever) the experiments and appearances of sense.</p>
                  <p>Even in <hi>Paradise</hi> before mans soul was wounded and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he attemped, and compassed the fall of our first Parents by a fallacy, grounded vpon the evidence or appearance of their senses against Gods word, and warning; God told them they should dye if they did eat of the forbidden fruit; but by the sight and tast of the forbidden fruit, the Devil wrought so vpon their souls, that they believed him and their senses, and preferred that fallacious evidence before Gods express word. And if <hi>Sathan</hi> prevailed with them in the state of innocency to judge of divin revelations rather by their own senses, then by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral sense of Gods word, how vnlikely is it that after such suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess

he will tempt their posterity in a contrary manner? or that he will suggest to men, that they ought not to believe their eyes and senses in the Controversy of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rely vpon the litteral sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Christs words, <hi>This is my Body?</hi> Seing therfore it is a strange and singular miracle, that so many pious and learned men of different tempers, interests, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and Nations, after so frequent and serious debates, in a matter wherupon depends their eternal happiness, should (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any present, or prudent advantage or allurement) resolve to contradict their own senses, and curb their nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of judging according to their sight, tast, &amp;c. and that this great miracle can not be attributed to the Devil, whose suggestions and impressions reach not the soul, vnless they be conveyed through our senses, and our selves consent to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual solicitations, and appearances wherwith Sathan doth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, and allure us; it followeth, that our Roman Catholick resistance, and resolution of not condescending to those solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and of not crediting such appearances, must be a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God, and the effect of his supernatural grace, not of the Devil, or of any natural power of our own. So that our adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, and our belief of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation (which are the things Protestants most except against in the Catholick Religion) if they reflect vpon them, will be found to be supernatural miracles, and convincing motives for their Conversion to our Roman Catholick Faith.</p>
                  <p>Let Protestants number also the particular doctrins wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ from Roman Catholicks, and observe how our belief and practise in such particulars go against sensual appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and pervers inclinations, and they will find we have as many visible miracles as there are doctrinal and practical diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in our Church from Protestancy.</p>
                  <p>To these may be added the general signs or marks of the Church, as our vnity in faith, the continuance, and vniversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our doctrin, our Apostolical succession, our conversion of Nations to Christianity &amp;c. No Protestant can rationaly deny

that every one of these is a visible and supernatural miracle, which can be as litle attributed to human industry, as to chance, or fate; For if they might, how comes it to pass that not one of these signs, can or could ever be found in any other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Christians but ours? This much I thought fit to say, not to satisfy the curiosity, but the conscience, of them who desire to see any one vndeniable miracle that favors Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. And albeit any one true miracle doth confirm the whole doctrin of our Roman Church, yet J will set down more then one for confirmation of most particulars wherin we differ from Protestants; and begin with what we have in hand, concerning Transubstantiation, and the adoration of Christ in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which our Adversaries pretend to be a kind of Idolatry; for that our selves confess the <hi>Species</hi> or accidents of bread and wine do remain,<note place="margin">

It happened, that a litle boy (whose father was a Jew by profession, and a maker of glass by his trade) being among the rest, did eat also his share of the aforesaid reversion of the Blessed Sacrament, but coming somewhat late home, and his parents demanding the cause, the child told innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what he had don; which the Jew his Father vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he was so enraged, that vnawares to his wife, he cast his litle son into the burning oven wherin he vsed to melt and frame his glass. The mother missing the Child, sought for him for three days together, but hearing no news of him abroad, she returned home with an heavy heart, and sitting down at the work-house door, she began to bewail the los of her son, calling him by his name; the boy hearing and knowing his mothers call, did answer within the oven;


<pb n="569" facs="tcp:38521:307"/>
wherat the woman starting, burst the work-house door, and rushing in, espied her Child standing amidst the Coals with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving any harm. After coming out, being demanded how he escaped burning so long, a woman, said he, came oftentimes vnto me, and brought me water to quench the force of the fyer, wherwith I was invironed, and withall gave me meat as often as I was hungry. This accident being told vnto the Emperor <hi>Justinian,</hi> he caused the mother and boy to be baptized, which becaus the obstinat father refused to yeild vnto, by the Emperors commandment he was hanged vpon a Gibet.</q>
This and the former example of <hi>St. Cyprian,</hi> shew that God is not displeased with receiving the Communion vnder one Kind; and that it was a thing indifferent in the primitive Church.</p>

                     <p>Here we see first: How <hi>St. Bernard</hi> took those people to be hereticks, and calls them <hi>wolves</hi> according to the phrase of the Ghospell, becaus they denyed the very same doctrin of the Roman Catholick Church that Protestants do deny; as the <hi>real presence,</hi> and <hi>Transubstantiation, Purgatory, the Popes supremacy, prayer to Saints, worship of Images, Indulgences &amp;c.</hi> We see how God declared by true miracles that the Saint was not mistaken in censuring them as hereticks, and by consequence all who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinatly maintain the same opinions which they did, to be of the same stamp. <hi>Osiander</hi> a learned Protestant sayes, that though he takes not <hi>St. Bernard</hi> for a Conjurer, but rather for a holy man, and honours him as a Saint, yet he thinks his miracles were don by the Devil. And though this evasion be most absurd, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy either a Scholler, or a Christian, yet is it the common and best plea of Protestants against such evidences. J say the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is most absurd. 1. for that <hi>St. Bernards</hi> miracles exceeded the Devil and natures power. 2. If he was a Saint, God would not have permitted the Devil to abuse him so grosly in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith, without the purity and profession wherof there can be no true sanctity. 3. Much less would he have permitted the Devil to make <hi>St. Bernard</hi> an instrument for the establishing of Jdolatry, and other damnable errors of Popery, in case the contrary belief of Protestants, and <hi>Petrobusians</hi> be the Catholick: for albeit God hath permitted the Devil to make vse of wicked

                     <hi>St. Austin</hi> (de Civit. Dei l. 22. c. 8.) telleth how that in the presence of him and others, a devout woman called Palladia, who being sore diseased, and repairing for her health to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of <hi>St. Stephen,</hi> as soon as she prayed to the Saint, <hi>sana surrexit,</hi> she received health. And in the same Chapter a little before he relates the like miraculous example of one Florentius of Hippo, and of Eucharius a Priest of Spain, as also of Ten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm persons in his presence miraculously cured; and sundry dead restored to life. In the ninth book of his Confessions cap. 7. he telleth how the dead bodyes of <hi>St. Gervasius</hi> and <hi>Protasius</hi> were after many years found vncorrupted; and that at their dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a blind man received his sight.

                  <p>
                     <hi>St. Gregory Nazianzen</hi> saith that <hi>St. Cyprians</hi> Reliques are omnipotent to work miracles, if applied with faith, as experience doth shew: and (orat. 1. in Iulianum) he relateth how <hi>Gallus and Iulianus</hi> two Brethren, and Nephews to the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius,</hi> joyning to build a famous Church over the Reliques of <hi>St. Mamans</hi> Martyr, the part which <hi>Gallus</hi> (a good Catholick) vndertook, went on most prosperously; but the part of <hi>Iulian</hi> (who was then perverted in his Iudgment, and became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Apostata) could never as much as have the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion layd, for that the earth by continual and vnusual earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, did always cast from it self, and in a manner vomit forth all that was layd in it by Iulianus.</p>
                  <p>And the reason was saith <hi>St. Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> becaus the Martyrs are so linkt in charity, that <hi>St. Mamans</hi> would not be honored by him, who in time was to decry the worship of his


<pb n="589" facs="tcp:38521:318"/>
Brethren, and disgrace them. But the Centurists above cited say, that God hindred <hi>Julianus</hi> his fabrick to shew that he was not pleased with the superstitious worship of Martyrs; and yet they do not consider that he was pleased to let <hi>Gallus</hi> his fabrick prosper. Such fopperies as these we must expect even from lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men that vndertake to maintain new opinions against the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient doctrin of Gods Church, confirmed by evident miracles.</p>

                     <hi>St. Anselm</hi> whom Protestants commend, as one of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest Prelats of the Church both for piety and learning, recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his book of the Miracles of our B. Lady this story.</p>
                  <p>The Devil (who out of his inveterat hatred, and enuy to man, seeks all means possible to ruin him) took human shape, and put himself into the service of a Nobleman, with whose hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor he did so comply, as in a short time he was steward of his family, and Master of his will: taking the advantage of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor he persuaded him to commit many mischiefs, and murthers; walking one day in the fields with some of his servants not much better then himself, he abused a devout Priest, and carried him prisoner to his Castle. At night the Priest signified to him that hee had a busines to impart to his Lordship, in which he was much concerned, but it must be opend to him in presence of all his servants. He longing to know the busines commanded all his servants should be called; and all appeared, the steward only excepted, who retired to his chamber, pretending he was not well; and being pressed to come, answered, he could not stirr: the Priest replyed to the Lord, that the stewards presence was absolutely necessary; wherupon other servants were ordered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to bring him in their arms, he still counterfeiting the sick man. When the holy Priest did see him, he commanded, and conjured him in the name of Almighty God, to declare who he was, and to what end he had thrust himself into that Noblemans service. The steward answered, and confessed he was the Devil, and that his end of serving that man was, to procure his destruction and damnation, which he had long before effected, had not the B. Virgin interposed herself, and interceeded to God, for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.

Bishops can confirm Christians. Doctor Taylors Discours of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation is an excellent Interlude all circumstances considered; He proves the necessity and holines of Confirmation, contrary to the 25. article of his faith; then he proves that only true Bishops can confirm; whence some, say it followes that his Protestant Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy is not for that purpose. 3. he pretends that the <hi>Jesuits</hi> (though he knowe the contrary) are enemies to this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.

                     <p>In the time of <hi>Conrede</hi> (saith <hi>St. Bede.</hi> l. 5. c. 14. hist.) who reigned after King <hi>Edilrede,</hi> there was a certain Captain in great favor with the King, for his valor, but careless of his soul. Wherfore the King often admonished him to make humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of his sins, and amend his life, least by deaths sudain preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="600" facs="tcp:38521:324"/>
he might loos time of repentance; but he, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this gentle admonition of his Souveraign, deferred his confession. In the mean time being visited with sicknes, the King came to his Chamber (for he loued him tenderly) and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him that at the least now he would confess before he died, No, quoth he, J will not be confessed now, but when J am well recovered I will, least if I should now do it, my fellows would say that I did that for feare of death, which I did not in health. When the King came the next day to visit him, and give him good councel, he cryed out incontinent, with a pitiful and lamentable voice, saying: <hi>Alas, what mean you Sir, why come you hither? you are not able to do me any good. The King answered, say not so, see ye play the wise mans part. Nay, saith he J do not rave, but J have here before mine eyes a wicked conscience all wounded and mangled.</hi>
                        <q>And what is the matter, sayd the King; A litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you came, quoth he, two beautifull yong men came in and sate down by me, one at my head, the other at my feet; and one of them took a fine book out of his bosom, but litle in quantity, and gave it me to read: Jn the which when I loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a litle while, I found all the good deeds that ever I had don fair written; and God knoweth they were few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and little in effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when I had don, they took the book of me again, and sayd nothing. Then sudenly came there about me a whole legion of wicked spirits, and besieged the hous round about, and sitting down, replenished every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner within. Then he that for his foul face and highest seat appeared to be greatest among them, taking, out a book terrible to all mens sight, vnmeasurable for greatnes and for weight importable, commanded one of his black guard to bring it to me to read. When I read a litle I found all the enormous detestable sins that ever I had committed, not only in word and deed, but also in thought, written there in great black letters: and he said to the two faire yong men that sate by me, why sit you here, knowing most certainly that this fellow is ours? They answered, True it is, take him

and lead him away to the bottomless pit of damnation; and with that they vanished away. Immediatly two wicked spirits having fier-pronges in their hands, rose vp, and struck me one in the head and the other in the sole of my feet, the which now with great torment and anguish creep vp into the bowels, and other internal parts of my body, and when they meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether J shal dy, and be drawn hence by the Devils into Hell without redemption. Thus spake that miserable man lying in extreme desperation, and so dyed out of hand. Jt is evident (saith <hi>St. Bede</hi>) hee had not these visions for his own sake, whom they availed nothing at all, but for other men, who knowing his lamentable end might be afraid to differr, and prolong the time of <hi>Repentance,</hi> while they have opportunity and leasure.</q>

               <head>The Conclusion.</head>
               <p>I have sayd as much as I think necessary for the information and instruction of such Protestants as desire to know the truth, and do not find my conscience guilty of any one falsification in this whole Treatise: And truly it were a great absurdity in me to commit wittingly that crime which J so much cry down in others. Such mistakes as have crept into the printed book, will J hope, he attributed to the Printer, or Transcriber: I am sure I have bin so diligent in examining the quotations and assertions pro and con the Catholick cause, that want of care cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; and if there be no want of sufficiency in the work, that commendation is not due to me, but to the goodnes and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the cause I maintain. For, what acutenes of wit is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit to defend a Religion that never was impugned but by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons so leud, and vnreasonable, that at the very first appearance of their opposition, they were condemned as hereticks by the whole visible Church that then was? What profundity of judgment can be thought necessary to demonstrat that the ancient primitive let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and sense of Scripture ought to be preferred before the Devils interpretation therof embraced by Luther; or before any new Canon and fancies of the like debauched fryers and Priests? What litle learning is not more then sufficient to discover so palpable frauds and falsifications as the Protestant Writers practise, to make their Reformations seem agreable, to Gods word? What Erudition is so mean that doth not surpass the history of one age, or of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy; a Religion so lately sprung vp, and raysed from the pride, ambition, liberty, and lewdnes of the first reformers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Northern parts of this least part of the world? How can such a Religion be Catholick either in length of time, extent of Territories, or Conversion of Nations?</p>
               <p>Jts true that for the space of 100. yeares England hath bin so blind as not to see such gross errors; but this misfortune was occasioned by their fondnes of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; to make good her title to the Crown they separated themselves from the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion


<pb n="606" facs="tcp:38521:327"/>
of the Church; and when her interest vanished with her death, and for want of posterity, few were living after her long reign, that observed the motives of her reformation; most En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen beleived the changes she made, had no relation to her illegitimacy, but proceeded from pure zeal of the Ghospell. Her new Clergy both then, and eversince, have endeavored to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the people in that persuasion, by falsifying Scripture, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and Fathers; but the discovery of the frauds, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Protestancy practised against the late innocent King, have opend the eyes of many to discern the flaws of the Reformation, and the fallacies of their own education; And now that it is as much the concern of the whole Nation to tolerat the Roman Catholick faith, as it was Q. Elizabeths interest to change it into protestancy, I doubt not but that every particular persons ease in the addition of a revenue to the publick, will excite both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and curiosity to examin, whether the prelatick Religion and Clergy of England, have not more of human invention, then of divin institution? And if after perusing this Treatise, and proposing the arguments and instances therof to their learned Ministery, no satisfactory answer can be given to the particulars wherwith their doctrin and function is charged, to what purpose should men continue in mistakes so damnable to the soul, and dangerous to the state?</p>
               <p>But if the Protestant Clergy can divert the Layty from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining any thoughts of curiosity, or scruples of conscience in order to the examination of this matter of so great importance, and can make them believe that K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. passion to <hi>Ann Bullen</hi> was a just cause to introduce the Reformation, and to assume the Supremacy; or that the Earle of Hartfords ambition of being absolutly Protector of England, (quite contrary to K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. Testament, and to his own Oath of not assuming any power above his Collegues and Tutors of K. <hi>Edward</hi> 6.) was a divin inspiration to bring in Zuinglius his Sacramentarian Religion into the Realm; or that the Duke of Northumberlands poysoning the yong King, and excluding the next and lawfull heirs from the

               <p>Now let us come to particular reflexions vpon both. <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> retained some parts of Scripture as well as Protestants; and had as good grounds to reject what he did not fancy of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and sense therof, as Protestants have to be choosers of their own Canon, and interpretation. Mahomet gives as many rules of Morality as Protestants; and though he allows of many wives, Protestants do the same; with this only difference; that Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met says tis lawfull to keep many at once; Protestants say you must keep but one at a time, and that you cannot have the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of wives men so much desire,<note place="margin">

<pb n="609" facs="tcp:38521:328"/>
Successors. In all other things Mahomets sect is more austere, in fasting, praying, abstaining from wine &amp;c. then Protestancy. And becaus both agree in the incoherency, and absurdity of their principles, both also agree in planting, propagating, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their doctrin not by miracles, or rational arguments, but by force, and sanguinary statuts. And this is the reason why Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks are as litle permitted to dispute, or reason for the Roman Religion in these Kingdoms, as Christians in Turky; and Priests are as much perseeuted for writing books of Controversies, as Printers and Stationers and severely punished. Thus much as to the paralell of both doctrins.</p>
               <p>But If we compare their persons, or vertues, we shall find that Mahomet was an honester man, and deserved more credit then <hi>Luther, Calvin, Cranmer,</hi> or any of the first Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers. He never was baptized, at least never professed any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, vntill he composed his own, with the help of an <hi>Arian</hi> Monk; but all the first Reformers had first professed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick faith, which afterwards they renounced, pretending that God had forsaken his Church for many ages; and presumed to say that he had authorised and inspired them to reform (without shewing any warrant) that doctrin vnto which their betters in learning, vertue, and judgment actualy submitted, as vnto the true Catholick, and themselves also had embraced as such, vntill their pride and lust prevailed against their conscience. <hi>Mahomet</hi> married a Widdow, and had made no vows not to marry; the first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers married Nuns, and themselves also were votaries, <hi>Calvin</hi> only excepted; but his incontinency was no less scandalous, and notorious, then theirs; having lived in adultery with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of <hi>Mongis,</hi> that left her husband at <hi>Lansan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

&amp;c. for by his <hi>Dove,</hi> or fitts of the falling sickness he made people believe that the holy Ghost appeared and inspired to him the <hi>Alcoran</hi>; but the Protestant Reformers had not so much to shew for their new doctrin, Canon, Translations, and their new sense of Scripture. <hi>Mahomet</hi> was constant to his principles; the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Parliament and Reformers were as changable as the times, and humors of the giddy people; and therfore may with more reason then the Turks give the <hi>Moon</hi> crescent for the Crest of their Religions, as Catholicks do the <hi>Cross.</hi> Here in England they changed with <hi>Henry</hi> 8. the Roman faith for <hi>Articles of Religion devised by the Kings Majesty.</hi> As soon as he dyed they changed that faith into Zuinglianism, to comply with the Protector <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set</hi>; within two or three years after they changed Zuinglianism into Calvinianism, at the suit of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and reformed the Liturgy accordingly. After <hi>K. Edward</hi> 6. death they returned with <hi>Q. Mary</hi> to the old faith. With Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> they restored the new, but with some alterations. When <hi>K.

Prelatick Protestancy being restored again by <hi>K.

               <p>These things maturely considered, makes Mahometism, as probable a Religion as the best kind of Protestancy, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would be no great wonder, if they who believe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant and Prelatick Clergy, and take their word and fancies for true Scripture and Christianity, should alter their belief vpon the

If any Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Prince could pretend a title to this British Monarchy, (with probability of prevailing) why may not we think he would find the Protestant Clergy as ready to comply with his Religion, (therby to secure their own, and promote his interest) as they were ready to change the Catholick and legal Religion, which was professed in Q. Maries time, for complying with <hi>Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> and fortifying her weak title against the legitimat and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Heirs? All things weighed, there is less difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mahumetism and prelatick Protestancy, then between pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick Protestancy and Popery; for that Popery and Protestancy agree only in the name of <hi>Christianity,</hi> in the motive and manner of faith, they differ, and in the ground therof, as also in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, letter, and Sense of Scripture; but Mahumetism and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy though they agree not in the letter of Scripture, (Protestants admitting into their Canon more books therof then the Turks) yet they both agree in the rule of Religion, (though not in the application,) as also in the rule wherby their Canon and sense of Scripture is discerned, which is, every mans privat judgment in controverted matters; in that point which is not controverted, (to wit, one Deity) the consent and concurrence of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the world, or evident reason, is the foundation as well of Mahumetism as of protestancy; as also in the point of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the soul. Therfore I see no impossibility or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability


<pb n="612" facs="tcp:38521:330"/>
(said this great wit) why <hi>Mahumetism</hi> may not in time be made the Religion of these Nations, without violating the principles, or altering the grounds of Protestancy, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick Clergy be as much applauded,<note place="margin">

               <p>God almighty deliver us from so great evils, and open the eyes of them that do not see the precipices wherunto their souls are led by such principles; and grant the learned prelatick Clergy grace to prefer truth before falshood, conscience before conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, and eternity before the few days which they are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Benefices, and Bishopricks. But in case they do not (for fear of loosing their credit and conveniences) recant their errors. J hope the Protestant Layty will have so much curiosity as to examin whether it be possible that so many Catholick Authors as have written books of Controversies, should damn and discredit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by forging and feigning Protestant frauds and falsifications, quoting the very places and pages where they are to be found; affirming that without such practices, protestancy cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; to examin I say whether we Catholicks can be so wicked and witless, as to accuse men of such grievous crimes without hopes of any honor, or profit to our selves, but rather with a certainty of an immediat discovery of our impostures.</p>
               <p>If this one thing be maturely considered, the Protestant Layty and their vnlearned Clergy that rely so much vpon the sufficiency and sincerity of <hi>Cranmer, Jewel, Fox, Morton, Andrews, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, Fulk, Perkins, Vsher, Laud, Abbots, Chillingworth, Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, Cosins, Hamond, Taylor,</hi> &amp;c. will believe us, or at least examin, and certainly find most palpable vnexcusable corruptions and contradictions in every one of their own Authors books com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed against the Roman doctrin, and conclude with us, that <hi>Piety and Policy is mistaken in promoting Protestancy, and persecuting Popery,</hi> and that a good revenue, may be conscientiously setled (if legaly demanded) vpon the Crown; and vpon the poor sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,

Mary,</hi> who notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the tendernes of her conscience, was satisfied there could be no scruple of Sacriledge in applying (with consent of the true owners) ecclesiastical livings to pious and publick vses.</p>
               <p>And now I hope I may conclude this Treatise with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly desiring a Conference or examination of Protestant and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick books, at least of one for each side; let the quotations of Doctor <hi>Taylors Dissuasive</hi> be viewed, and that book or any other writ against the Roman Religion, stand for the Protestants sincerity, tis like he writ nothing carelesly, or rashly, his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red drift being to make a whole Nation Protestants, and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himself to be only <hi>Amanuensis</hi> to a prelatick Convocation of reformed Bishops, which in his Preface he compares with that Assembly of the Apostles wherin choyce was made of <hi>Iudas</hi> his Successor, and sayes the lot of <hi>St. Mathias</hi> fell vpon himself, and that some other like himself was <hi>Barnabas the just.</hi> Jf this holy Convocation of Protestant Apostles should set forth a Book that hath more lyes then leaves, I hope men may advise their friends to consider whether a Religion that cannot be maintained but by such men and means, and a Clergy that practiseth such frauds and falsifications, ought to be preferred before a Religion and Clergy that not only professeth (as all others do) to write truth, but presseth to come to a publick trial therof in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I do not instance Bp. <hi>Taylors Dissuasive from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> for the Trial, as if his falsifications to maintain Protestancy were more numerous, or more enormous then those of other writers that have defended the same cause.

all the advantages that the learning of the Author and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Convocation can afford. Jf they have a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the sufficiency of Bishop <hi>Jevell,</hi> then of Bp. <hi>Taylor,</hi> they may fix rather vpon his Apology for the Church of England, then vpon Doctor <hi>Taylors</hi> Dissuasive from Popery, authorized by the Church of Ireland.

                  <p>HOw necessary a rational re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is for a peaceable go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and wherin doth the reasonableness of Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. How dangerous for a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Soveraign to pretend a spiritual supremacy over his subjects. Heathen Princes durst not assume it without a persuasion in their subjects that it was due by descent from some Deity, or that the Gods signified their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation therof by prodigies and miracles. The great Turk, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his tyranny, thinks it not policy to pretend a spiritual juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over his subjects, though slaves. The ground of policy piety and peace consists in establishing by law a Religion confirmed by miracles: that such a Religion will make the Prince powerfull and popular, the Prelats respected, the people willing to obey and pay taxes. It takes away all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts of rebellion vpon the score of a tenderness of conscience. How ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary it is for the Government to have a devout Clergy, and that Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy at the Soveraigns devotion, and Some of them emploied in State af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. Therby all disputes between the spirituall and temporall jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are prevented. With how much reason Statesmen dread such disputes. For the space of 1500. years the Catholick world believed that the Bishop of Rome had the supreme spiritual jurisdiction over souls, as being Christ's Vicar vpon earth: and that only such as were of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and vnder his obedience, were members of the Catholick Church: and therfore the Greeks for exempting the Bishop of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople and themselves from that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, were declared Schismaticks: others were condemned as Hereticks

for teaching and professing doctrin contrary to the Roman. Both the doctrin and authority of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bishops and Clergy, hath been confirmed by vndeniable true mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, even here in England. Jt was held to be the only Catholick do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin in <hi>St. Gregory</hi> the great his time. That faith which wee Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks now profess is the same (in every particular) with that of <hi>St. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> and of all Orthodox Christians of his time, and for confirmation wherof true miracles have been wrought.</p>

                  <p>OF the Author and beginning of Protestancy. The first Preacher therof was <hi>Martin Luther</hi> an Augustin Friar; who from his youth had bin lianted by the Devil, and presumed to have bin possessed. He resolved to preach and write against the Mass, praying to Saints, and other Catholick Tenets, after that the Devil had appeared to him, and convinced him by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant arguments. How weakly the Protestant writers endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse <hi>Luthers</hi> disputation, instruction and familiarity with the Devil. Others acknowledge it and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Devils doctrin ought to be believed when it agrees with the Protestant interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is, with every privat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation contrary to the sense of the whole visible Church. How much it is against piety and policy to make the Protestant, or any other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat interpretation of Scripture, the Religion of the State, or to preferr it before that of the Church, and of the holy ancient Fathers, <hi>quoted subsect.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; passim.</hi>

                  <p>OF the principles ad propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Protestancy. How <hi>Luther</hi> begun his reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by gaining Poets, Players, Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Printers, to discredit by their Poems, Pamphlets, pictures and ballads, the Roman Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and its Clergy. How he drew also many dissolute Friars and Priests to his side, and married nine of them to so many Nuns in one day, taking also one to himself. How he made his reformation plausible to Libertins by teaching that <hi>only Faith</hi> was necessary for Salvation, without troubling themselves with good works: and popular, by preaching that no Christian ought to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to an other, and how therupon the Clowns, and Tenants of Germany


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38521:332"/>
rebelled against their Princes and Landlords. The three fundamental principles of Protestancy are. 1. That for many ages the whole visible Church had bin in damnable errors, and so continued vntill <hi>Luthers</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. 2. That there is no rule of faith but Scripture as Protestants are pleased to interpret it. 3. That men are justified by <hi>only faith.</hi> How from these principles have issued innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Protestant Religions contrary one to the other. <hi>Luther</hi> did see his own reformation divided into 130. disagreing sects of Protestants. None could ever prove there was one true miracle wrought to confirm the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants doctrin, or their pretended authority for reforming the Tenets of the Roman Catholick Church; Protestants are forced to say that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are ceased, and that ours are Diabolical or counterfeit. Because no true Bishops were Protestants, and by consequence they could have no Priests ordained, and so their Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood must have perished after the death of the first <hi>Apostatas Luther</hi> and others, the Protestant reformers and Churches taught, that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are Priests both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: and this doctrin is supposed to be true by the Church of England in their 39. articles, and in the Act of Parliament 8. Eliz. 1.</p>

                  <p>OF the Protestant Prelatick Church of England. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of <hi>K. Henry</hi> the 8. divorce from <hi>Q. Catharin,</hi> and of his revolt from the Church of Rome, was his passion to <hi>An Bullen</hi>: the words of S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> concerning his brothers wife, absurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applyed to <hi>K. Henrys</hi> marriage, with his Brothers widdow. How zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously he had formerly maintained the Popes supremacy: how cruelly he afterwards persecuted the professors therof; and how impiously he judged <hi>S. Thomas of Canterbury,</hi> robbed his shrine, and burnt his Reliques. The Catholick Princes rejected his emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and solicitations for imitating his example in assuming the supremacy. And how much the protestant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were troubled and ashamed that he made his lust the motive of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. How incredible a thing is the English supremacy. <hi>K. Henry</hi> 8. at length resolved to renounce it, and returne to the duty of a Christian King, but stood upon such termes, and differrd it so long that he died in Schism, excommunicated, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of Gods mercy. His last will and testament was broken before his body was buried. The Erle of Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford made himself <hi>Protector,</hi> and

The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant confessions, and articles of faith composed, and professed by every national Church, oblige not the members of those Churches, because the Collectors and composers of such articles are not infallible, and will be thought not to agree with Scripture, at least as every particular person will explain it. The 39.

The Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and priviledges of Protestancy being inconsistent with Soveraignty and government; every Protestant Commonwealth found it necessary to mold and moderat those principles and priviledges by human lawes, according to the customs and constitutions of every Kingdom; and therfore <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> (without which our Parliaments could not be legal) was here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland continued with prelatick Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, though contrary to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of Protestancy, and to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of other Protestant Churches.

Laws en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted to favor Religion, ought to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, not pretend to make the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion reasonable. Reason is the ground of human laws; but human laws can not be the ground of Religion. How dangerous it is to press too much the Act of vniformity against so great and zealous a multitude as the Sectaries are. Their errors ought to be confuted with reason, not rigor. The prelatick Clergy (whose spiritual Censures and authority ought to quash all dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) doth cause the mischief, and engageth the state in perpetual trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for maintaining (by force of law) the improbability of their cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter and jurisdiction, against the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of reason.</p>

By pretending a <hi>mean,</hi> and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration between Papists and Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, the Prelaticks fall into manifest contradictions in defending their own caracter, doctrin, and disciplin. How learned Protestants are forc't to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that the Prince may force his subjects by laws to his Protestant persuasion; and that every Protestant subject (notwithstanding the Prince his prerogative) hath a privat autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to judge of the Prince his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and is bound to stick to his own contrary judgment. What great confusion this must occasion. It is the nature of all Religions that give privat men liberty to judge of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious controversies, to cause such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. How this inconvenience is prevented in the Roman Catholick. One of the differences between it and the Protestant is, that when Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants rebell, they do not violat the principles of Protestancy, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes every man Supreme in matters of faith, and by consequence of state. When Catholicks rebell, they go against their principles, that give no such supremacy or liberty. Jn these last one hundred years there have bin more rebellions vpon the score of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy, then have bin since Christs time vpon the score of the Roman Catholick Religion. In what sense the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> is a growing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Whether it be policy to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute a Religion that encreaseth against the rigor of the lawes; and to promote a Religion that doth not encrease with all the helps of lawes and favors

of the Prince. The sanguinary and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal statuts are thought to be so vnjust, (even by Protestants) that no honest and sober man thinks them fit to be put in execution.

All se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious persons begin their designs against the government with pressing the execution of the statuts: and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times therby make the zealous and giddy multitude rebell. Whether it were not piety and policy to repeal statuts, that, if put in execution, make the nation and government infamous; if not put in execution, may occasion rebellion, by reason of an indiscreet zeal in the giddy multitude? Besides, their being enacted to suppress the principles and destroy the persons of the Catholick party, which maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Stevards</hi> right to the Crown, ought to facilitat the repeal.</p>

Many Protestant mistakes wherwith the common sort were fooled, are now cleered; and their own conveniency wil invite them to examin further the errors of doctrin incident to educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from which errors the Protestant Church doth acknowledge it self not exempted. If the Protestant faith be true, such a trial as we desire will be of great satisfaction to the Professors therof, and confirm them in their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and convert Papists and Sectaries to the same; if it be falfs, besides the salvation of souls by a discovery and prosession of the Roman truth, these kingdoms will be able not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves, but offend foreign E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies after we are enabled thervnto by a conscientious addition of a milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sterl. per an, to the publik revenue.

or Protestant) abuseth their Flocks by a cheating Religion.</p>
            <p>Not many years since, one <hi>Mrs. Stanhop,</hi> an English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Gentlewoman that resided in Paris, had thoughts of changing her Religion, her chief motive being the novelty of Protestancy: <hi>Dr. Cossins</hi> (now Bishop of <hi>Duresme</hi>) after taking vpon himself in that Citty the Charge of the English Prelatick Congregation, notwithstanding his conformity with the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Hugonots, and his frequent excursions to <hi>Charenton</hi>; and being vexed to loose so vertuous and exemplar a soul as <hi>Mrs. Stanhop</hi> was reputed to be in his Protestant Church, he seriously endeavored to persuade her, that the antient Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of England was Protestancy; and that Popery was the novelty. But it seems the Gentlewoman (though shee had not pervsed S. <hi>Bedes</hi> Ecclesiastical History) had read our Cronic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, the Annals of <hi>Iohn Stow,</hi> and other Protestant lay-writers, much more sincere then <hi>Dr. Cossins</hi>; and whereas before his discours shee only doubted, after shee had considered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected vpon the improbability and extravagancy of his impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, her doubt changed into a certainty of the falshood of Protestancy, seing so learned a Doctor could not maintain its antiquity and truth by a better argument. I Think shee is yet living, and a Religious in Paris; I am sure many persons of credit and quality yet living, can testify the truth of this passage, which is but a petty Protestant fraud in respect of other sleights and Falsifications mentioned in this Treatise, wherin <hi>Dr. Cossins</hi> also beareth a part.</p>
            <p>I have not presented <hi>Your Honors</hi> with this story of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Cossins</hi> as if it had bin a rarity; it is the ordinary prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise among Protestant Prelats and Preachers to feed their Flocks with such stuff<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there can be no other against the vniversal tradition, and all the Histories of Christendom. My design in recounting such a passage, is only this, that <hi>your Honors</hi> may be pleased to consider, whether Doctor <hi>Cossins</hi> (or any other Protestant Prela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Will any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Protestant Minister stick to imitate such an example, knowing it is the only way for such persons as they are, to thrive, and become great in the English Church and State? <hi>Your Honors</hi> Charity may be so great as to suspend your Iudgments concerning their sincerity, but your consciences are so tender, that you will not keep these Actions in suspence of a matter wherin they are so much concerned. The only way to satisfy them, and your selves, as I said before, is, that yee be mediators to the King and Parliament for a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blik Trial either of the Protestant Clergys cheat, or of the Catholick Clergys Calumnies. If what is layd to the protestant Clergys charge in this Treatise, be proved, the Crown gains a million sterl. per an. If not, the Protestant Church and Clergy gains credit; so that these nations can be no loosers by the Trial we humbly desire; for that, if granted, it will be known which of both is the true Religion, and perhaps that may appear to your selves to be the true Religion, which offers to treble the publik revenues, and to make this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy not only the most Christian, but the most considerable of the <hi>Vnivers</hi>; and then will be fulfilled the vulgar prediction of our King, <hi>Erit Carolo Magno Major</hi>; and <hi>your Honors</hi> will be the chief instruments in making him so great, and his subjects happy; which is the only design of</p>
