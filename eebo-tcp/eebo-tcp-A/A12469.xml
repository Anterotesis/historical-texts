            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For a man of warre, a well ordered Taunt-mast is best, but for a long voyage, a short Mast will beare more Canuasse, and is lesse subiect to beare by the boord: Their Rules are diuers, because no Artist can build a Ship so truly to proportion, neither set her Masts, but by the triall of her condition, they may bee impayred or amended: suppose a Ship of 300.<note place="margin">An example.</note> Tunnes be 29. foot at the Beame, if her maine Mast be 24. inches dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, the length of it must be 24. yards, for euery inch in thicknesse is allowed a yard in length, and the fore Mast 22. inches in thicknesse, must bee 22. yards in length; your Bowle spret both in length and thicknesse must bee equall to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

finde the maine Mast must be 24. yards long, for euery yard is 3. foot and 24. inches thorow, allowing an inch to euery yard.

The misen Mast halfe the length of the maine Mast, which will be 12. yards long, and 12. inches diameter.

               <p>When the storme is past, though the wind may alter three or foure points of the compasse, or more, yet the Sea for a good time will goe the same way; then if your course be right against it, you shall meet it right a head, so we call it a head Sea. Sometimes when there is but little wind,<note place="margin">A head Sea.</note> there will come a contrary Sea, and presently the winde after it, wherby we may iudge that from whence it came was much winde, for commonly before any great storme the Sea will come that way. Now if the ship may runne on shore in ose or mud she may escape, or Billage on a rocke, or Ancors flooke, repaire her leake, but if she split or sinke, shee is a wracke. But seeing the storme decreaseth, let vs trie if she will endure the Hullocke of a Saile,<note place="margin">Hullocke.</note> which sometimes is a peece of the mizen saile or some other little saile, part opned to keepe her head to the sea, but if yet shee would weather coile, wee will loose a Hullocke of her fore-saile, and put the Helme a weather, and it will bring her head where her sterne is; courage my hearts.</p>

And this with all, that at the Deluge there was no necessity to breake vp the springs of the deepe and to open the cattaracts of Heauen, and powre downe water continually so many daies and nights together, seeing the only with-drawing of that hand, or letting goe of that bridle which restraineth the water would presently haue ouerwhelmed all.<note place="margin">How all the hils and dry land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Sea hath made roome for the Sea, therefore they are in equall height &amp; depth.</note>

But were I to chuse a ship for my self, I would haue her saile well, yet strongly built, her decks flush and flat, and so roomy that men might passe with ease; her Bow and chase so Gally-like contriued, should beare as many Ordnances as with conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency she could, for that alwaies commeth most to fight,

                  <p>Some it may be will say I would haue men rather to feast than fight;<note place="margin">The vse of the petty Tally.</note> But I say the want of those necessaries occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions the losse of more men than in any English fleet hath beene slaine since 88. For when a man is ill, or at the point of death, I would know whether a dish of buttered Rice with a little Cynamon, Ginger, and Sugar, a little minced meat, or rost Beefe, a few stewed Prunes, a race of greene Ginger, a Flap-iacke, a can of fresh Water brewed with a little Cinamon, Ginger, and Sugar bee not better than a little poore Iohn, or salt fish with oile and mustard, or bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, butter, cheese, or oatmeale pottage on fish dayes, or on flesh dayes salt Beefe, Porke, and Pease with six shillings beere, this is your ordinary ships allowance, and good for them are well if well conditioned, which is not alwayes as Sea-men can (too well) witnesse. And after a storme, when poore men are all wet, and some haue not so much as a cloth to shift him, shaking with cold, few of those but wil tell you a little Sacke or <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> is much better to keepe them in health, than a little small beere, or cold water although it be sweet. Now that euery one should prouide those things for himselfe, few of them haue either that prouidence or meanes, and there is neither Ale-house, Tauerne, nor Inneto burne a faggot in, neither Grocer, Poulterer, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, nor Butchers shop, and therefore the vse of this petty Tally is necessary, and thus to be imploied as there is occasion. To entertaine strangers as they are in quality e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Commander should shew himselfe as like himselfe as he can, as well for the credit of the ship, and his setters sorth,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:11403:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as himselfe; but in that herein euery one may moderate themselues according to their owne pleasures, therefore I leaue it to their owne discretions, and this briefe discourse, and my selfe to their friendly construction, and good opinion.</p>
