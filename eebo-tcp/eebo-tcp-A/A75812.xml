            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of proſperity to this Nation have taken ſuch ſtrong hold upon
my Soule, and I feel my Spirit ſo powerfully drawn forth to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the things that belong to its peace, that I cannot refrain my
Pen from humbly and earneſtly ſoliciting a more firm and perfect
eſtabliſhment of the two principall Pillers of all flouriſhing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
<hi>Mercy to ſuch as ſuffer for Conſcience; and impartiall

            <p>As theſe conſiderations have engaged me once more to expoſe the
moſt ſecret and retired thoughts of my heart to be ſeen by others;
So I aſſure the Reader this ſhall be their laſt appearance in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
that he may reſt ſecure from all fear of loſing his time upon
any thing of mine hereafter: But leſt I offend too much in the
preſent trouble I give him; I ſhall imediatly apply my ſelfe to my
task, and endeavour with a gentle, yet faithfull hand, to open the
orifice of the <hi>neglected</hi> wound, humbly imploring the gratious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of Heaven to govern our <hi>Great Colledge</hi> in their grave and
charitable conſults for the perfect cure of all our ſorrowes.</p>
            <p>And in ſearching how mortall a ſtroake ſuch Oathes, as this
of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> give to the known Rights, and Priviledges of
the People of this Land, my Method ſhall be directed by theſe
Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they are Fundamentally repugnant to the Common Lawes
and ancient Statutes of this Nation. Directly contrary
to many Acts even of the laſt Parliament, and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the preſent Army. Abſolutely prohibited by the
Law of God, and inconſiſtent with the generall judgement
of all Reformed Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MAgiſtrates being originally inſtituted for this principall end,<note place="margin">Thoughts unpuniſht becauſe unoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</note>
to maintain a juſt order &amp; harmony in the outward Motions
of the multitude, it neceſſarily followes that the generall deſigne of
Government is little concerned, what noat we make in our ſingle
ſelves, if we be in tune with our Companions.</p>
            <p>Upon which ground the Common Law of this Land directs all
its care to rule and treat us, as we are conſidered in reference to
one another, and therefore neither limits our private expences,
nor obliges to any courſe of Phyſick; becauſe our particular for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
and health are of very little importance to the Publique, and
of very much to our ſelves; And ſince nothing is more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
then to entruſt thoſe with the managery of an affair, whom
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118443:4"/>
the iſſue moſt concernes, it cannot be denyed, but as this freedom
(without which we were abſolute Slaves,) is allowed us in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to our Bodies and Eſtates: So our Souls (as far as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
with the publique peace) ought to enjoy a juſt and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſhare in the ſame liberty.</p>
            <p>Much leſſe doth the Law either puniſh or reward our <hi>thoughts,</hi>
becauſe they neither diſappoint nor advance its ends; The inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Murther (though in the higheſt degree of premeditated
malice) is no way ſubject to any legall account, if the miſchievous
purpoſe ſtay at the fancy, and proceed no farther to any outward
attempt: By which neceſſary diſtinction betwixt Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Juriſdiction, the Law religiouſly preſerves its reverence to the
great Tribunall of God, before whom only, we are to anſwer for
the private errors and ſecret vices of our hearts, as we are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

            <p>If any conceive it juſt to enact a Law againſt <hi>Erroneous
Thoughts</hi> in Religion, with an Oath of <hi>Aburation</hi> to make the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
accuſe himſelf, why ſhould they not as well impoſe a penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
upon the <hi>vicious Thoughts</hi> of <hi>Hatred, Revenge</hi> or <hi>Ambition:</hi>
And then force every one to ſwear whether he be guilty? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Magiſtrates may as lawfully put us to our Oathes, whether
we have aſſented to any traiterous <hi>thought</hi> againſt our Country, or
<hi>coveted</hi> our Neighbours Goods or Wife, as what we <hi>think</hi> of ſuch a
point of Divinity.</p>
            <p>Should it be pretended, that the Oath of <hi>Abjuration</hi> commits no
force upon the <hi>mind,</hi> but only upon the <hi>mouth;</hi> gives free leave
to <hi>think</hi> what we will, if we <hi>ſwear</hi> as it commands; Such liberty of
Conſcience (to believe in our hearts contrary to what we profeſs
with our lips) <hi>Nero</hi> himſelf allowed; Such liberty of Conſcience
(that is, damnable hypocriſy) is indeed the proper and naturall
effect of compulſion upon the Conſcience: Surely by this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
word (<hi>liberty</hi>) ſomething more is intended to be left us, then
what no Tyrant can take from us; Surely it ought at leaſt to be ſo
curteouſly interpreted, that by this kind phraſe (<hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>)
be underſtood a liberty conſiſtent with Conſcience; a
condition, wherein every peaceable Chriſtian may follow <hi>our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
without renouncing his <hi>own honeſty:</hi> yet I confeſſe it puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels
all the reaſon I am owner of, that they who take this Oath
(though very credibly againſt their Conſciences) ſhall enjoy the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118443:4"/>
full benefit of <hi>tender Conſciences;</hi> And if any refuſe it (becauſe
againſt his Conſcience) he is wholly excluded from the leaſt mercy
provided for <hi>tender Conſciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">Thoughts not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed becauſe incapable of proof.</note> this diſpuniſhableneſs of thoughts ariſes as well from the
impoſſibility of lawfull proof, as from their innocency in not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
others; And therefore a ſecret promiſe (though moſt

little importance to the deciſion of the main controverſie, nor is the

is the only point we diſpute upon, and which we here undertake
to prove; a proceeding altogether unknown to our Lawes, that
any one ſhould be conſtrained to inform againſt himſelf, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his own Executioner.</p>
            <p>Upon this ground Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> (a perſon compleatly
learned in the Lawes of this Land, and univerſally famous for
courage and reſolution, according to his principles) refuſed the
then new Oath concerning the Kings Supreamacy and Divorce,
alleadging for his defence at the Bar, that he never <hi>ſpake</hi> or <hi>acted</hi>
any thing againſt that Statute, and upon this Plea he relyed, as an
evident juſtification in Law, <hi>which never</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>was ſtrained ſo
far as to reach our thoughts;</hi> and for his inward judgement, he
freely profeſt that Oath to be againſt it, offering before the Judges
to ſweare, that the unſatisfaction of his Conſcience therein
was the onely cauſe of his refuſall to comply with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>And if we look back upon times behind us, we ſhall often ſee the
<hi>outward words</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> cenſured by the Magiſtrate, but never
the leaſt attempt upon the<note n="a" place="margin">Thoughts not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht by Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> 
               <hi>inward belief;</hi> though the principles
heretofore entertained concerning the uſe of force in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
have generally been far more rigid, then thoſe we now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the Acts of 5. <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. 5. &amp; 2. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 14. &amp; 2. <hi>Hen.</hi> 5.

            <p>They are forbidden to write Books in defence of their ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,

               <hi>ſaith
concerning this Statute is worth conſideration, his words are theſe.</hi>
The ſix Articles being now publiſhed, gave no little occaſion of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,
ſince to revoke the Conſcience not only from its own Court, but
from the ordinary wayes of reſolving Controverſies, to ſuch an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
deciſion of the Common Law, as is there ſet down, was thought to
be a deturning of Religion from its right and uſuall courſe; ſince the
Conſcience muſt be taught, not forced; without that it ſhould at any
time be handled roughly, as being of ſo delicate a temper, as though
it ſuffer an edge to be put on, who doth more, diminiſheth or breakes
it: Beſides to make the contravening of Doctrines, to be capitall,
before they be fully proved, is prejudiciall to that liberty, without
which none can juſtify himſelf before God or Man: For if it be death
(<hi>and Sequeſtration is a kind of death</hi>) to believe otherwiſe then wee
are commanded; how unſafe will it be to make exact enquiry? and
without it, who can ſay his Religion is beſt? Beſides the Example is
dangerous; For if Infidels and Heathens (to retain their People in
obedience) ſhould do the like, who would ever turne Chriſtian? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Cranmer</hi> for three dayes together in the open Aſſembly oppos'd
theſe Articles boldly, &amp;c. <hi>Thus far this learned Hiſtorian.</hi>

               <hi>In the Statutes of</hi> 1. Eliz. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. Eliz. 10. <hi>it is Enacted; That</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Agreeable to the former Statutes is</hi> (13 Eliz.<note place="margin">13 Eliz. 12</note> 
               <hi>c.</hi> 12.) <hi>being the
Act made for the ſubſcription to the Articles of Religion, then
newly modelled into a publique forme of confeſſion of Faith. The
words of the Act are theſe.</hi> If any ſuch Eccleſiaſticall perſon ſhall
adviſedly maintain or affirme any doctrine directly contrary or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the ſaid 39 Articles, and ſhall perſiſt therein and not revoke
his errour, ſuch maintaining or affirming and perſiſting, ſhall be juſt
cauſe to deprive ſuch perſon of his Eccleſiaſticall promotions. <hi>Upon
which Statute theſe things are obſervable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, that theſe ſubſcriptions being concerning matters of Faith
are required of Schollers and Divines upon their pretence to
Church preferments, not of lay perſons, to diſpoſſeſſe them of their
temporall inheritances.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they muſt <hi>maintaine or affirm</hi> ſome doctrine oppoſite
to theſe Articles, to bring them within the penalty of that Law.
So that the <hi>believing</hi> only of the contrary is not ſufficient.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſuch maintaining or affirming is to be voluntary, and
not drawn out of them by the rack of an Oath.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it, being made a <hi>cauſe</hi> of Deprivation, muſt be by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and not by the enforced abjuration of the party.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, they are to loſe only their Eccleſiaſticall promotions,
and not to be deprived of their temporall Eſtate. Not one of
theſe ſo rationall and neceſſary cautions is at all now conſidered
in the modern proceedings againſt Papiſts; but the moſt unlearned
Tradeſman and ignorant Woman amongſt them are compel'd to
accuſe themſelves, their Judges never asking after witneſſes; And
this under forfeiture of full two thirds of all their Goods and
Lands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And even in the laſt Parliament many</hi> Ordinances <hi>have followed
the ſame way of prohibiting externall diſorders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Norby the laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf.</note> 
               <hi>occaſioned from
difference in opinions, but not preciſely for the bare difference in

               <note place="margin">11 Aug. 1645.</note> 
               <hi>Wherein it is Ordained,</hi> that what perſon ſoever ſhall

            <p>
               <hi>Conformable to this was an Order made in</hi> Parliament Decemb.<note place="margin">22 Decemb: 1646.</note>
22. 1646. The <hi>Parliament</hi> taking into conſideration, that ſome
<hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and other Sectaries have diſturbed the Miniſters and
Congregations in ſome Churches of this Realme, in disparagement
of the Lawes, Statutes and Governments thereof, do Order that
the Conſtables and Headboroughs within their ſeverall Pariſhes,
&amp;c. ſhall arreſt the bodies of all ſuch perſons as ſhall diſturbe any
Miniſters in holy Orders, whilſt he is in place of exerciſing his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Calling, by ſpeaking to him, or uſing irreverent geſtures or
actions; and that they carry the bodies of ſuch Offenders before ſome
Juſtice of Peace of the ſame County to be dealt with, as to Juſtice ſhall
appertain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So likewiſe</hi> 9.<note place="margin">9 Aug. 1650.</note> Aug. 1650. It is Enacted, that every perſon that
ſhall preſume avowedly by words to profeſſe, or ſhall by writing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to affirm any Blaſphemous, Atheiſticall or execrable Opinions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory
to the Honour of God, ſuch perſons ſo avowedly profeſſing,
maintaining or publiſhing the ſaid Opinions or any of them, ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr
the penalties of the ſaid Statute. <hi>Which ſhewes plainly that
the laſt Parliament thought it not fit to puniſh any for erroneous
Opinions, (though of the higheſt nature) If the party ſhall
onely believe them in his heart, and keep them within his own
breaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, (as a finall deciſion of this point and full ſatisfaction of
thoſe objections, which ſome make againſt the validity of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance)
it was Enacted (17 <hi>Car.</hi>) by the King, Lords, and
Commons, <hi>That no perſon whatſoever exercizing any Eccleſiaſticall</hi>
(much leſſe temporall) <hi>juriſdiction ſhall tender any Oath to any
perſon, either</hi> Ex Officio <hi>or at the inſtance of any whoſoever, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he may be charged to confeſſe or accuſe himſelf of any crime, and ſo
expoſe himſelfe to puniſhment:</hi> then which no clearer or more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive
ſentence can be imagined.</p>
            <p>And (which is very obſervable) never in former times was any
<hi>Abjuration</hi> required, but of ſuch, as were firſt legally convict of
Hereſy; Never till theſe times, was the <hi>Abjuration</hi> it ſelf made the
conviction,<note place="margin">2 Hen. 4. 15</note> and therefore in the Statute of 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 15. Theſe
two conditions are punctually expreſt, That in caſe of <hi>Abjuration</hi>
the opinion to be abjured be a known hereſy, and the party to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
be legally found guilty, before they proceed to exact his <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:118443:7"/>
According to this tenor run many other Statutes both ancient
and modern, which my deſign of brevity enforces me to omit, and
the full ſufficiency of the Lawes already cited renders altogether
unneceſſary; only I ſhall deſire leave to extract theſe few ſound
and excellent words out of the Petition of Right, 3 <hi>Car. That no
free men be compelled to take any Oath, not warranted by the Lawes of
the Realme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being then concluded, that <hi>thoughts are free from all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Lawes, and ſelf accuſation contrary to the Engliſh Lawes;</hi>
it is very ſuitable to our Method, to conſider next what proviſion
our Common-wealth has made for diſcovery and conviction of
Offenders; Wherein after I have ſlightly toucht ſome of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
mentioned in the <hi>firſt part</hi> of this <hi>Moderator,</hi> I ſhall paſs on
to thoſe aditionall reaſons I have ſince collected,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that the way of Indictment and conviction of witneſſes and
Jury is the only proceeding owned by the fundamentall Lawes
of this Land,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IS abundantly proved by the chief Author and ſureſt defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of all our Liberties, <hi>Magna Carta,</hi> ſo often confirmed
in our ancient Parliaments, ſo reverently upon all occaſions
cited by the laſt: where every Engliſh man may read with

and no Judge dare deny; only the Papiſt whom we can accuſe of no
other crime; then difference of judgement in Religion, is forced
to convict himſelf by his own Oath, without the leaſt colour of any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118443:7"/>
legall Indictment, ſo expreſly contrary to the known Lawes and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

has but a Cottage to hide his head in, may uncontrollably challenge,
and God forbid it ſhould be refuſed him; but then how is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
that Recuſants (many of them perſons of very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
quality) be diſpoſſeſt of ſo great Eſtates, upon their own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
Oaths without any due proceſs of Law?</p>

it ſhall be void.</hi> Nay ſo great account have our wiſeſt Anceſtors
made of this <hi>Magna Carta,</hi> ſo carefully provided for its preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and univerſall obſervance, that it has no leſſe then 30 times
been ſolemnly confirmed by Authority of Parliament, as is at large
declared in Sir <hi>Ed. Coke's</hi> 5. Report <hi>fol.</hi> 64. B. and in his 8. Report

according to the Law of the Land, and if any thing from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
be done to the contrary, it ſhall be void in Law and holden for
error. <hi>No Court diſallowes this advantage to the worſt of
Traitours; no Committee allowes it to the quieteſt of Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe ſo excellent Lawes (ſuch as no People under Heaven
enjoy) were made when the Legiſlative power was abſolutely in
the hands of Papiſts; all theſe Priviledge (ſo high and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
that they deſerve the name, rather of the Peoples Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
then their Liberties) the Papiſts obtain'd and eſtabliſhd in their
times, &amp; carefully tranſmitted to their poſterities: All theſe wiſe and
prudent Cautions (which ſo ſafely fence and preſerve our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Freedom from the encroachment of Arbitrary power) were
providently contrived by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and from them are happily
deſcended upon us. And ſhall we now, (having reform'd their
Faith) forget our own reaſon ſo far, as to deprive our Brethren
of the benefit of thoſe Lawes, which their Fathers made, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they reſemble them moſt in Religion? Shall we ſo far yeild
to paſſion, as utterly deny them the immmunities of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118443:8"/>
Or can we poſſibly arrive at this degree of partiality, as
not permit the greateſt Malefactor to be his own accuſer, and yet
enforce the moſt peaceable Recuſant to be his own condemner?
Nay though the Thief (arraign'd at the Bar) confeſſe his guilt,
our Judges mercifully decline to condemn him, without ſome Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of witneſſes: But if a Recuſant will not voluntarily both
arraign and condemn himſelf, the practiſe of <hi>Haberdaſhers Hall</hi>
is, (without thinking of further proof) immediatly to proceed to
Execution.</p>
            <p>Nor was this tendernes towards the liberty of the ſubject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
only in thoſe old dayes, but we have freſh Examples of a
greater zeal and jealouſie, then ever thoſe times were acquainted
with; For in the great <hi>Petition of Right</hi> (3. <hi>Car.</hi>) all theſe Statutes
were particularly recited and earneſtly inſiſted upon by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
then aſſembled. And yet a freſher inſtance is that of the
laſt Parliament, who (in their Act for Regulation of the <hi>Privy
Councell</hi> and abolition of the <hi>Star-chamber</hi>) did punctually repeat
again all thoſe Statutes, and rely upon them as the Fundamentall
and unchangeable Law of the Land.</p>

            <p>Now after all theſe Ordinances, who could be ſo undutifull as to
entertain the leaſt fear of being ever hereafter forc'd to accuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?
Upon theſe ſo many ſo ſolemn Declarations, who could have
excuſed the preſumption and perverſneſs of his heart, if he dared to
doubt of their obſervance; Eſpecially ſince the Parliament did not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118443:9"/>
proclaim to us its ſence by bare words, but advanced farther to
ſevere Executions, and by the Example of the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi>
ſtrictly prohibited the introducement of any novelty in the practice
of the Law. Againſt whom the Parliament in their third Article
brought this charge, <hi>That he had proceeded ſummarily in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Lord Mont-Norris;</hi> And in the ſixth Article, his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
was, <hi>that he had diſpoſſeſt the Lord Mont-Norris of his

Article the like charge was againe repeated; <hi>That hee had depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

            </p>
            <p>Theſe miſdemeanours (though not the only Crimes of which
he was accuſed, yet) added ſuch a weight to his other offences
that altogether they ſunk him into his Grave. In the whole
courſe of whoſe tryall I meet with nothing more worthy to be
ſtaid upon, then this conſideration; That the Parliament did not
ſo much urge againſt him the illegality, as the unlawfulneſſe of
his proceedings, nor condemn him barely for want of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
or authority, but becauſe his Actions were in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
tirannicall, and dangerous encroachments upon the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Liberty of this Nation; Yet he examined Witneſſes, but
after a faſhion of his own deviſing, and left the common road of
tryall by the verdict of a <hi>Jury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And can there be a more <hi>ſummary Proces,</hi> then to accuſe

Can there be a more quick and cutting diſpatch, then in half an

he will not ſwear againſt his Conſcience? and (which is yet
worſe) can there be a more compendious (if not prepoſterous)
way, then firſt to ſeize upon and ſecure the Eſtate, and then hear

And now when I conſider the Office of a Parliament, which is
principally to reform the abuſes, that time (conſpiring with our
corrupted nature) brings into the adminiſtration of the Lawes,
when I conſider the quality of the laſt Parliament, profeſſing ſo
ſcrupulous and preciſe a reſpect to the preſervation of our ancient
Liberties: I cannot ſufficiently wonder from what cauſe this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
effect ſhould flow, by which a free-born Engliſh-man is
compell'd to be his own accuſer in matters of ſo tender a nature,
as Conſcience and Religion, and of ſo high a concernment, as the
utter impoveriſhment of himſelfe and his family; But after a little
ranging about I ſoon diſcovered the fountain head in a dark hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
place, where three or four hundred ſprings of freſh water met
together in one channell, of which, ſome having paſſed through
hot and ſulphurous veines, quite changed the taſt and colour of the
reſt, and the ſtormy weather of that ſeaſon quickly raiſed the
whole ſtream into a fierce and violent current, whoſe fury ſoon
broke the common banks and bore down all before it like a deluge.
The truth of which Metaphor, is as eaſily proved, as the ſence of it
underſtood; being no more then that the Introducer of this cruell
<hi>Oath,</hi> was an Ordinance haſtily huddled up in the deſtroying time
of <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>War.</hi>

at the birth of this unlucky Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> and long
after.</p>
            <p>The ſecond branch of the task I undertook was, That theſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
and ſharp proceedings of ſequeſtring upon the bare refuſall
of an Oath, without any legall proceſs, were occaſioned by the
exigencies of the War; an aſſertion moſt fully and evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the firſt Ordinance againſt Delinquents and Papiſts;<note place="margin">1. Apr. 1643</note> In the
preamble whereof the Lords and Commons (reciting the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the War) declare, <hi>That all the ſequeſtred Eſtates ſhould be
applyed towards the ſupportation of the great charges of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;</hi>
And in the firſt <hi>Inſtructions</hi> to the <hi>Committees,</hi> they are
charged to uſe their beſt care and diligence for the ſpeedy executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Ordinance for Sequeſtration, as being a matter of great
neceſſity and importance for the ſubſiſtence of the Army.<note place="margin">Great Book of Ordin. fol. 360. and 511.</note> And
obſerving ſome ſlowneſs in the Committee, the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi>
(a Commander in chiefe) was empowred to execute that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
and the Sequeſtrators commanded to pay the money they
raiſed, to the Committee of the Army.</p>
            <p>One other argument there is, that inclines me to believe the
Parliament intended this <hi>Ordinance</hi> only as a proviſion in thoſe
diſtracted times, and not as a ſtanding Law for ever; elſe ſurely
they would never have put into their Commiſſion ſo ſlight a thing
as a <hi>Bayliff</hi> of a Corporation. Were it handſome that the Mayor
of <hi>Riſing</hi> ſhould come down from thatching ſome triviall Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
to tender the Oath of <hi>Abjuration</hi> to the noble Earle of
<hi>Arundell?</hi> or indeed how ſhould a common tradeſman (whom
without breach of charity we may preſume can neither write nor
read) know what he does, when he commands others to forſwear
ſuch hard long words, as <hi>Supremacy, Purgatory,</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation?</hi>
what ſhall we (that accuſe the Papiſts of blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
ſay to our ſelves, when our very leaders are ſo ſhort-ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
            <p>Tis true, all theſe fair and juſt exceptions are fully anſwered by
this one word <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> a Heteroclyte that hath no Rule, no Law,
and therefore, <hi>as it is without Law, to be judged without Law.</hi> But
then at leaſt it ought to be <hi>a Law unto it ſelfe,</hi> that is, confined
to circumſtances, wherein there is a true and reall neceſſity, and
therefore during the furious violence and careir of war, ſuch ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118443:10"/>
proceedings (to prove without Witneſs and condemn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

and not continue ſtill throwing our neighbours goods over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
ſo long after the ſtorm is ended.</p>
            <p>If any object, though the reaſon of <hi>Neceſſity</hi> remains now no
longer, ſince the gates of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall are open, and the old
crowd of Suitors march peaceably there under the <hi>Scotch Colours;</hi>
yet the Supream Authority of the Nation is bound to render no

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I reply, firſt, That ſuch Objection ſeemes rather to accuſe the
Government of Tyranny, then faithfully defend its Authority;
no ſound approaching ſo nigh Antipathy to an Engliſh Eare, as
that of being under an abſolute and unlimited Maſter, whether that
boundleſſe and uncontrollable Power be lodged in the <hi>ſingle perſon</hi>
of a King or the <hi>multiplyed</hi> of a Councill.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> When by the change of circumſtances, any Law becomes unfit
to be continued, we are not forbidden to repreſent, even to the
higheſt Powers, our reaſons for a Repeale; if we carry our Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
with ſuch regard, that they appeare to intend a Reformation of
the Errour, not correction of our Superiors.</p>
            <p>In which reſpect, never did any Parliament give ſuch high hopes
of a thorow redreſs, as that which lately ſate, by erecting ſo careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe two grand Committees for regulating the Law and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
the Goſpel, by inviting ſo ſolemnly all that would offer
their propoſalls to come into their aſſiſtance. And as the whole
Nation remains infinitely bound to the ſolicitude of the Army, for
whoſe ſatisfaction both thoſe Committees were eſtabliſh'd: So are
we all no leſs oblig'd to the Zeal of the <hi>Generall,</hi> by whoſe perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
preſence every day at <hi>that</hi> of Religion it received ſo great
Countenance and Encouragement. And therefore I ſhall not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the leaſt ſuſpition that theſe few thoughts of mine ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
any offence, ſince they aim only to propoſe the unſuitableneſs
of this new uncharitable <hi>Oath of Abjuration</hi> to the ancient and beſt
Lawes of the Land.</p>
            <p>Even the Pope admits his Subjects (when they apprehend ſome

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118443:11"/>
to himſelf better informed and yet we call his abſolute neſs, a
Tyranny, and their obedience, blindneſs. How much more then may
thoſe true lovers of their Countreys happineſs promiſe themſelves
ſecurity, if not acceptance from the Parliament, who either by
humble Petition or other modeſt and untumultuous way repreſent
to their conſideration any miſ-practiſeor inconvenience, which in

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> What ever the Supream Authority of a Nation may by abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

            <p>Before which Statute (<hi>viz.</hi> 1607.) the unreaſonableneſs and

            </p>

Firſt, <hi>That contrary to the Law of Nature and the Fundamentall

either to ruine his Soul by taking it againſt Conſcience, or his

the Presbyterian faction thought it a fit engine to skrew up their
intended</hi> Kirk-tyranny.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> By the Oath <hi>Ex Officio, men</hi> were examined <hi>upon captious queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning their very Thoughts, to the ſifting and ranſacking of
their Hearts and Conſciences, and were therein ſubjected to a farre
greater Tyranny then that of the Spaniſh Inquiſition, which extends
to words and actions onely.</hi> This of <hi>Abjuration</hi> compells even
<hi>women</hi> and illiterate perſons poſitively to renounce (by meer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118443:12"/>
or implicite Faith) many controverſiall Doctrines, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which the greateſt Divines of <hi>Europe</hi> have ſo long diſputed,
and are like perhaps never to agree; Nor is this Oath contented
with a modeſt and ſimple profeſſing, that they do not believe there
is a <hi>Purgatory:</hi> but abſolutely exacts of them to ſwear down right
there is none, in the laſt period of the Oath, where they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced,
<hi>to abjure and renounce all Doctrines in affirmation of the ſaid
points.</hi> For my part, as I thinke it a wilde conceit, to hold there
is a new World in the Moon; So I am ſure it is a deſperate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
poſitively to ſwear the contrary.</p>
            <p>That Oath <hi>Ex Officio (being commonly tendered to ſuch as are
ſuspected guilty of the crimes, whereof they are to cleer themſelves by
their own Oath, or otherwiſe to undergo a penalty) muſt in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
be an occaſion of frequent perjuries, to the loſſe not only of
many Soules, but to the great abuſe of the name and majeſty of God.</hi>
This of <hi>Abjuration</hi> expoſes men to the ſame danger, and God to
the ſame diſhonour; And beſides hath been ſo far from ever gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
any true convert to the Proteſtant Religion, that it hath made
many ſwear away that little Religion they had, and ever after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
none: For ſuch indifferent and luke-warme Papiſts, as take
this Oath, uſually ſay, <hi>they will rather truſt God with their Soules
then the Common-wealth with their eſtates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence certainly it was that the famous Judge,<note place="margin">

Coke,</hi> breaks out into this complaint; <hi>Experience now proveth,
the Conſciences of men are grown ſo large, that the respect of their
private intereſts and commodities doth for the moſt part induce them
to perjury.</hi> According to which he there ſets it down for a Rule,
that, <hi>to ſwear in a mans owne caſe is frequently in this Age, the
Devills precipice, whereby to throw men headlong into Hell.</hi> And
yet to theſe ſtraits (which my heart even bleeds to think) hath
this cruell <hi>Oath of Abjuration</hi> driven all Recuſants, live they never
ſo peaceably and unoffenſively; This dangerous ſnare (for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
no milder name, ſince we never think of endeavouring by
any rationall motives to perſwade them out of their errours) lyes
continually before their feet to entrap them. Where is our charity
to Chriſtians, profeſſing the ſame Saviour, and believing the ſame
Scriptures, with our ſelves? Where is our Juſtice to neighbours,
equally entitled by their birthright to the ſame freedom with our
ſelves? Is the extraordinary <hi>Liberty,</hi> we held forth to all the
World, ſhrunk into this narrowneſſe, that any peaceable perſon,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118443:12"/>
who profeſſes the Goſpell of Chriſt (though in ſome things miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken)
ſhould by us be compel'd to this ſad neceſſity, either of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
forſwearing himſelf, or utter impoveriſhing his family,
which in plain Engliſh ſignifies (I tremble to utter it) <hi>either De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
take his Soul, or Sequeſtrator his Eſtate.</hi> I acknowledg this a very
harſh expreſſion, but he that reflects upon the generall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
hitherto with Recuſants, that we appoint no godly and
gifted men to convert them, but only Committeemen to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
them, will I feare finde too much truth in my words.</p>

            </p>
            <p>All which extream and unſufferable inconveniences I confeſſe
are ſo evidently appliable to the <hi>Oath of Abjuration,</hi> that you
need but only change names, to make them exactly true of either
except that in the one both far more difficult queſtions are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and far greater penalties impoſed, whereas in the other, the
point in doubt was very eaſie to reſolve, whether you had ſlept
with your neighbours wife, and the puniſhment a little peece of
money to repair <hi>Pauls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And certainly it was with reflection upon this Oath of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration,</hi>

               <hi>that the learned Maſter</hi> Hobbs <hi>ſayes,</hi> There is another
errour, to extend the power of the Law (which is the Rule of actions
only) to the bare thoughts and Conſciences of men, by examination
and inquiſition of what they hold; whereby men are either puniſhed
for their very thoughts, or conſtrained to anſwer an untruth for fear
of puniſhment; By which meanes they are forced to accuſe themſelves
of their opinions, which is againſt the Law of Nature.</p>
            <p>Nor doth this Oath of Abjuration extort the ſecret thoughts
only, but compells the renouncing of ſome poſitions, which (in
the opinion of divers venerable writers) are more receivable,
then the Doctrine of ſome avowed Proteſtants. I inſtance in the

there is no Oath nor penalty againſt the <hi>publique profeſſing</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi>
no nor againſt the <hi>publick practiſe</hi> according to that

but lookers on, and only ſee the burthens laid upon refuſers of
this Oath, feel in their breſts a certain inſtinct by which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

the cruell and rigorous proceedings even of their own Party.</p>
            <p>And that this compaſſion towards ſufferers, upon the account of
Religion, riſes not ſo much from ſoftneſſe of Nature, as from the
tenderneſſe of the Spirit, will certainly finde an eaſie belief, if, in
ſtead of a flock of tame and weeping women, we can pick out an
Army of victorious Soldiers, whoſe courage neither knows to
fear the face of ſuch as threaten war, nor conſcience endures to
force the heart of thoſe that will live in peace; Of which too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

            </p>
            <p>NOw to the comfort and even amazement of the Spirit, let us
contemplat the conſtant pious intentions held forth by the
Army. No ſooner had their many victories rendred them the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118443:13"/>
of the World, (our own as fearfully as neighbouring Nations
expecting what great deſigne of blood they next would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize)
but they threw aſide the cruelty and oſtentation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
and took into themſelves the bowells of mercy; They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
look'd round about them on their afflicted Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
and, knowing nothing more precious, nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
to the godly then liberty of conſcience, by their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Declarations to the World, and zealous addreſſes to the
late Parliament, they manifeſted how unalterable they were in
their holy Principles. No licentious avarice emboldned them to
divide the ſpoile, no wantonneſſe provoked them to ſurfeit with
the fruit of the Land they had ſubdued; So far from growing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
with ſucceſſe, that even their enemies have confeſt, There
was never in any age known ſo great a modeſty in ſo continued a
victory, nor ſuch excellent diſcipline in a conquering Army. Their
own intereſt never regarded by themſelvs, only to improve the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
&amp; repoſe of the Conſciencious, was their endeavour, which they
purſued with ſo religious a noble courage, that they took their lives
into their hands, and with the greateſt hazard to ſelf-preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
removed that Power which grew ſloathfull, and halted in
the way of Godlineſſe, and have moddel'd ſuch a Government,
as ſhall intend chiefly to give balſome to the many wounds of
the afflicted. This relief is the expectation and hope of many
Conſciences now in anguiſh and tribulation, who cannot but with
comfort remember, how the Army ever had that compaſſion
which the Clergy wanted, and the Millitary piety hath beene

Men, without warrant from God, ſhould uſurp a Tyrannie over other

            <p>This preſumptuous impoſing of the ſenſes of men upon the words of
God,<note place="margin">Fol. 180.</note> and the ſpeciall ſenſes of men upon the generall words of God, and
laying them upon mens conſciences together under ſevere penalties; the
deifying of mens owne interpretations, and tyrannically impoſing them
upon others, the reſtraining of the underſtanding of men, wherein
Chriſt and his Apoſtles left them free, is and hath been the only Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Schiſmes of the Church. Take away this perſecuting of men
for not ſubſcribing to the words of men, as the words of God; require of
Chriſtians only to beleeve Chriſt; In a word, take away Tyrannie
(which is the Devills inſtrument to ſupport Errors) and reſtore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to their juſt and full liberty, and it may well be hoped by Gods
bleſſing, that univerſall liberty, thus moderated, may quickly reduce
Chriſtendome to truth &amp; unity, the contrary effects whereof happen by
the tyrannous impoſition of opinions upon other mens Conſciences,<note place="margin">Fol. 198.</note>
whereby they are, as it were grievoſly exulcerated.</p>
            <p>All the power of the world is neither fit to convince, nor able to
compell a mans conſcience to conſent to any thing; indeed worldly
terror may prevaile ſo far, as to make men profeſſe a Religion, which
they beleeve not; ſuch men, who know not that there is a Heaven pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for Martyrs, and a Hell for thoſe that diſſemble ſuch Truths
as are neceſſary to be profeſſed; But to force any man to beleeve what
he knows not, or any honeſt man to diſſemble what he doth believe, if God
commands him to profeſſe it, or to profeſſe what he doth not beleeve,
all the ſwords in the world are too weak, with all the powers of Hell to
aſſiſt them.<note place="margin">Fol. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is a damnable ſin for any man to profeſſe an error againſt his
Conſcience, though the error in it ſelfe and to him that beleeves it
be not damnable; Nay the profeſſion not only of an error but of a
truth, if not beleeved, is a mortall ſin, unleſſe hypocriſie and
diſſimulation in Religion be not ſo.</p>
            <p>If a Papiſt be convinced or perſwaded in conſcience,<note place="margin">Fol. 19.</note> that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion is irroneous, the profeſſion of it, though in it ſelfe moſt
true, would be to him damnable. <hi>See his Reaſons,</hi> fol. 132.</p>

Thus in a full ſpeed I have run over all that I could obſerve, to
ſatisfy my Spirit concerning the illegality of this Oath in <hi>Common
Law</hi> or <hi>Common Reaſon,</hi> in <hi>ancient or moderne Acts of Parliament,</hi>
in the <hi>Declarations of the Army</hi> (when ſucceſſe had left them no
employment but their piety) in the <hi>Opinions of the moſt Learned
Reformed Divines,</hi> and above all in the <hi>Law of God;</hi> And the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
I owe my afflicted Brethren hath forc'd me to communicate
this to the Godly and Religious, that they may with compaſſion
reflect on thoſe who eat their Bread moiſtned with their Teares,
and weep over their Houſes, become deſolate, becauſe they would
keep up their Conſciences from ruine.</p>
            <p>I have collected this for information of ſuch, who have bowels,
and diſdain a glory or benefit that may riſe by treading on <hi>their</hi>
necks, who ſuffer only for Religion; Who (if they err) err to their
own temporall prejudice, and can in their error have no deſign of
fleſh and bloud; Whom diſcover'd to have any conſpiracy againſt
Government I would have moſt ſeverely puniſhed, &amp; whom quiet
and inoffenſive in practiſe of their own Conſciences, I would have
pittied and relieved; And this I ſeriouſly deſire all religious ſpirits
to weigh in their moſt godly and moſt prudent thoughts; That
looking back on the laſt hundred years, they ſhall finde every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of Government in this Nation (either Papall, Prelaticall,
or Presbyterian) to have bin wrought by a too rigorous coerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Conſcience; Religion ever falling down to the duſt,
when it leanes too much on the weak treacherous Prop of humane
Policy, or endeavours to ſtand only by puniſhment of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
modeſtly diſſenting in ſome opinions.</p>
            <p>And why may not I with an humble boldneſs lay down theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
at the door of <hi>the ſupream Autority the Parliament,</hi> &amp;c.
now ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter?</hi> Why may I not ſolicite their
mercy (by contemplating, what a ſeries of providences have
fettled them in the preſent Power, and redeemed their Conſciences
from a deſign'd ſlavery) to take into their firſt conſideration the
deplorable condition of the moſt oppreſs'd people in the world?
Why may not the ſeverity of the Eternall Juſtice, executed on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Governements, inſtruct them to meekneſs towards their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in ſuch a ſad forlorn affliction? and thereby preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their ſucceſſors to a continued bleſſing by that Hand,
which ſhakes down the Pallaces of the proud and uncompaſſionate,
and out of their rubbiſh builds up a Tabernacle of glory for the
humble and mercifull.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:118443:17"/>
Nor can I at any diſtance how remote ſoever (though we ſquint
on carnall intereſts) diſcover whence any the leaſt prejudice can
reach the Government, in not offering violence by Oaths to the
Conſcience; unleſs we reckon on the loſs of that Rent is annually
extorted by violence from the Conſcience? And how unhandſom
and (above that) unchriſtian will it appear, that we can tenderly
maintain every Congregation, but only that, the not protecting
which is for our temporall emolument and ſupplies of the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
In recompence whereof, we may bring in the univerſall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the whole Nation, when liberty of Conſcience ſhall be ſo
generall, that in that harmony no one ſtring ſhall be out of tune;
Every ſpirit charitably embracing each other, and though not fully
conſenting in every circumſtance, yet all agreeing in one belief of
one God, and one acknowledging of one Mediator.</p>
            <p>And thus in a perfect unity at home, how ſafe ſhall we be againſt
the ſordidly avaritious, or diſorderly ambitious of our enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
who as they feare that Sword, which the Almighty hath
put into our hands; So will they court that Nations friendſhip,
which is ſo piouſly frindly in it ſelfe. How religious will they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all leagues? how happy all commerce with a people ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious,
that (only on the account of tenderneſs) throwes away
the covetous ſeverity of their Predeceſſors, and takes into one
common liberty every Conſcience under their protection. To of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the reputation and honour hereby to be gain'd with our moſt
powerfull Neighbours (which notwithſtanding the wiſeſt and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
Republiques have ever highly valued) may perhaps be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
as a carnall vanity; But the many bleſſings which the Eternall
Mercy may be humbly hoped, will hereupon plentifully ſhowre
down upon the mercifull, is comfortably to be reflected on.
Every Conſcience thus ſet at liberty, being obliged in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
duty, continually to invoak a happineſſe on thoſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
who have broken aſunder the fetters in which ſo many were
ſadly bound up, and who have enlarg'd them to ſing <hi>Hymnes</hi> of
praiſe for ſo great, ſo charitable a Deliverance.</p>
