            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>An Advertiſement to the Reader.</head>
               <p>IT is now juſt ten years ſince I Collected, Printed, and Publiſhed, a Catalogue of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage-Playes
that were ever till then Printed; I then took ſo great care about it, that now, after a ten years
diligent ſearch and enquiry I find no great miſtake; I only omitted the Maſques and Entertainments in <hi>Ben.
Johnſons</hi> firſt Volume. There was then in all, 690. ſeveral Playes; and there hath been, ſince that time,
juſt an hundred more Printed; ſo, in all, the Catalogue now amounts to (thoſe formerly omitted now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
806. I really believe there are no more, for I have been theſe twenty years a Collector of them, and
have converſed with, and enquired of thoſe that have been Collecting theſe fifty years. Theſe, I can aſſure
you, are all in Print, for I have ſeen them all within ten, and now have them all by me within thirty. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I took care and pains in my laſt Catalogue to place the Names in ſome methodical manner, yet I
have now proceeded further in a better method, having thus placed them. Firſt, I begin with <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi>
who hath in all written forty eight. Then <hi>Beaumont</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi> fifty two, <hi>Johnſon</hi> fifty, <hi>Shirley</hi> thirty
eight, <hi>Heywood</hi> twenty five, <hi>Middleton</hi> and <hi>Rowley</hi> twenty ſeven, <hi>Maſſenger</hi> ſixteen, <hi>Chapman</hi> ſeventeen,
<hi>Brome</hi> ſeventeen, and <hi>D'Avenant</hi> fourteen; ſo that theſe ten have written in all, 304. The reſt have every
one written under ten in number, and therefore I paſs them as they were in the old Catalogue, and I
place all the new ones laſt. I have not only ſeen, but alſo read all theſe Playes, and can give ſome account
of every one; but I ſhall not be ſo preſumptuous, as to give my Opinion, much leſs, to determine or judge
of every, or any mans Writing, and who writ beſt; but I will acquaint you with ſome of my Obſervations, and
ſo conclude. He that was the firſt Play-writer, I find to be one <hi>Heywood,</hi> not <hi>Thomas,</hi> but <hi>John Heywood,</hi>
who writ ſeven ſeveral Playes, which he calls Interludes; and they are very old, being Printed with the firſt
of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Printing; and he makes notable work with the then Clergy. And indeed, by only reading
of Playes, I find that you may be acquainted with the humours of that preſent Age wherein they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
Alſo by Playes alone you may well know the Chronicle Hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> and many other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories.
I could enlarge much on this account, having for my own fancy written down all the Hiſtorical
Playes in a ſuccinct orderly method, as you may do the like; I obſerve that Playes were not only written by
profeſſed Poets, but, alſo by the beſt Scholars, and Perſons of Honour and Eminency; eſpecially, in theſe
laſt hundred Playes, and not only Male, but Female Writers; there being ſeven of them in all, four where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in theſe laſt hundred. Although there are but 806. Playes in all Printed, yet I know that many more
have been written and Acted, I my ſelf have ſome quantity in Manuſcript; and although I can find but
twenty five of <hi>Tho. Heywoods</hi> in all Printed, yet (as you may reade in an Epiſtle to a Play of his, called
<hi>The Engliſh Traveller)</hi> he hath had an entire hand, or, at leaſt, a main finger in the writing of 220. and,
as I have been informed, he was very laborious; for he not only Acted almoſt every day, but alſo obliged
himſelf to write a ſheet every day, for ſeveral years together; but many of his Playes being compoſed and
written looſely in Taverns, occaſions them to be ſo mean; that except his <hi>Loves Miſtreſs,</hi> and, next to that,
his <hi>Ages,</hi> I have but ſmall eſteem for any others. I could ſay ſomewhat more of him, and of all the old
Poets, having taken pleaſure to converſe with thoſe that were acquainted with them, but will conclude thus;
that as <hi>John Heywood</hi> was the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Play-writer, ſo in my Opinion, one <hi>Thomas Merito<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> who writ
two Pamphlets, which he calls Playes, viz. <hi>Love and War,</hi> and the <hi>Wandring Lover,</hi> was the worſt. And
although I dare not be abſolute in my Opinion, who is the beſt of this Age, yet I ſhould be very diſingenuous,
if I ſhould not conclude, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage is much improved and adorned with the ſeveral Writings of
ſeveral perſons of Honours; but, in my Opinion chiefly with thoſe of the moſt accompliſhed Mr. <hi>John Dreyden.</hi>
