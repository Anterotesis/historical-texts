            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>MY whole alotted time would be to ſhort to
ſtand, either to ſpeak of the Pen-man heere
the holy Prophet <hi>David,</hi> or this his worke
in generall, or this his Pſalme in particular. For him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he was a man after Gods owne heart, that is his
greateſt title, and he went beyond all the Sonnes of
<hi>Adam,</hi> who was a King, and a Prophet, in all cauſes,
both Eccleſiaſticall, and pollitique, in foure particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
never yet paralleld; A Shepherd a Muſition: a
Souldier: and a Prophet.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, ye know what ſervice he did, he
ſlew a Lion, and a Beare, an abſolute tipe of Death,
and Hell, to be overcome by this victorious Lion, of
the Tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi> For a Muſitian, he was the ſweet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94802:3"/>
ſinger of Iſrael, yea he was able to charme the Devill
himſelfe, and quit that evill Spirit which vexed <hi>Saul.</hi>
For a Souldier, he was moſt famous, witneſſe that
Battell wherein he ſlew <hi>Goliah,</hi> and beheaded that
great Champion of the <hi>Philistines</hi> with his owne
ſword. For a Prophet, none ſo fully, and ſo clearly
foretels the Perſon, Incarnation, Paſſion, and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Chriſt foretold, as <hi>David</hi> did: he in his
owne perſon did oftentimes intimate many other
men, ſo that his divine writings are the <hi>Compendium</hi>
of all the ſacred Scripture, it ſeemes Chriſt himſelfe
ſet much by this booke, for you may obſerve that he
uſed the ſayings of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> more then
any other Prophet, yea more then all the Prophets
together, Moreover when the Devill tempted Chriſt,
he arged a Text out of this Prophet, as if the Devill
had obſerved how greatly <hi>Davids</hi> ſayings were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
Our Church conſidering the uſefull excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of this part of Scripture, hath ordained a more
frequent uſe, then of any other part of Divine write.
But I muſt ſtay no longer in the commendation of
this our Prophet, or his booke of Pſalmes, he rather
bids as practiſe what we finde written: young Men
and Maidens &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Which wordes are the Concluſion of a Pſalme,
which we may not unfitly ſtile by the name of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Maſque, where is ſcarce any Creature in the
whole world but the Species are in this Pſalme.</p>
            <p>Here are Angels,<note place="margin">verſe. 2.</note> and all Hoſts. Sun, and Moone,
and Starres of light.<note place="margin">verſe. 3.</note> The Heaven, and Heavens, and
the waters that be above the Heavens.<note place="margin">verſe. 4.</note> The Earth, the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94802:3"/>
Dragons, and all Depths.<note place="margin">verſe. 7.</note> Fire, Hayle, Snow, and
vapours and ſtormy winds.<note place="margin">verſe. 8.</note> Mountaines and all Hils,
Fruitfull trees, and all <hi>Cedars,</hi>
               <note place="margin">verſe. 9.</note> Beaſts, and all cattell,
creeping things, and flying Foules<note place="margin">verſe. 10.</note> Kings of the earth,
and all People, Princes, and all Iudges of the earth.<note place="margin">verſe. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And in the words of my text, Both <hi>Young Men,
and Maidens, Old Men, and Children, let them praiſe
the Name of the Lord.</hi> You that deſire ſtrange, and
rare ſights, O come hither, and view the whole
troope of Gods creatures, a <hi>Chorus</hi> that is led by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells,
followed by men, and directed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and yet ſtay not too long in contemplating of
them, for thou they ſelfe alſo of what degree ſoever,
have a part to act, as well as the reſt. <hi>Young Men, and
Maidens</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For my better proceeding herein, I ſhall firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the connection of theſe wordes, with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.
Secondly the duty that is commanded, and
that is praiſe to God. And thirdly the Actors, and
thoſe are, <hi>Iuvenes &amp; virgines</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So that you ſee the Text like the <hi>Iron</hi> gate to
<hi>Peter,</hi> opens unto us of its owne accord; and to looke
for more abroad, were like <hi>Eſaw</hi> to hunt for Veniſon
a farre off, when like <hi>Iacob,</hi> wee may have it neere our
hand. I will treat of this Text very plainely, for, <hi>Ita
non debet loqui Theologus, ut poſsit intelligi, ſed ut non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
non intelligi.</hi> Firſt that we may know that this <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi>
is worth our labour, and not unbeſeeming ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a creature as man is, our Prophet ſhewes us
that it befits the Angels in Heaven,<note place="margin">verſe. 2.</note> yea it is the
height of their felicity, to comfort themſelves in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94802:4"/>
of praiſe to Almighty God. So ſaith Saint
<hi>Luk.</hi> And ſuddenly there was with the Angels a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the heavenly Hoſts praiſing God.<note place="margin">Luk. 2. verſe. 13.</note> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
leaped out of Heaven for ioy, to congratulate
mankinde with a morning Antheme of praiſe, and
thankes. Thus you ſee the part we have of act is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
derogatory unto our worth, ſince the glorious
Angels themſelves are imployed in the ſame. But to
go on, this our Prophet ſhews; that the very Beaſts,
and Trees, and Foules can performe that, which the
Devill would perſwade us, is ſo difficult. The Oxe
knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe his Maſters crib,
but Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. <note place="margin">Eſa: 1. verſe. 3.</note>
So heere our Prophet would have us to take
notice of Beaſts, and Foules of the aire, nay the aire
it ſelfe, wind, and ſtormes fulfilling his word. Chriſt
tels the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that the Queen of the South ſhould riſe
up in Iudgement againſt them at the laſt day, and
not onely the Queene of the South, but the arie
wind of the South, ſhall as it were riſe up in Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt us at the laſt day, becauſe that alſo doth
performe the will of God; Which man will not doe.

            <p>The Duty here inioyned, is a duty of Praiſe, but

Chriſt doth not intend (ſaith he) that we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
yea twice, or nay twice with our tongues,
but that the heart ſhould firſt conſent or refuſe, and
then the tongue ſhould follow, either in yea or nay,
there ſhould be an agreement betweene the tongue,
and the heart, let your communication be, yea yea,
nay, nay, ſo likewiſe in preaching the name of God
it muſt be firſt performed by the heart, and then ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choed
out by the tongue,<note place="margin">verſe. 8.</note> and afterward commented
upon in all our actions,<note place="margin">verſe. 4.</note> as yea may ſee in this Pſalme,
where the Prophet calling upon the creatures to
praiſe God, urgeth them thereunto with an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
taken from the wind, and ſtorme, fulfilling his
word. So that it is not enough for the wind to whiſle,
or the raine to rattle, if we ſhould Praiſe God
as wee ought, it muſt by fulfilling his word:
What is that inſtrument of ten ſtrings which
our Prophet, ſpeaketh of but the devout heart of a
Chriſtian, tuned, and rightly ſet to the ten comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements?
This Muſick ſounds ſweeteſt in the eares of

<hi>Iſaack</hi> gives to his <hi>Rebechah,</hi> and which he moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemeth; theſe are they which make him take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in our beauty, therefore let us take pleaſure
not onely to ſpeake, and heare, but do the ſame: for
this is truely to praiſe the name of the Lord, and as
we muſt praiſe God in thought, word, and worke,
we muſt labour to keep an agreement between them
all; for if one onely ſtring be out of tune, although all
the reſt be rightly ſet, yet this one will ſo jar, that the
leſſon playd upon it, to a skilfull eare, will ſound as
bad as if all were out of tune. If thou doeſt forſake
drunkenneſſe, Whoredome, or ſuch like, and yet
doſt cleave to covetouſneſſe, it comes all to on recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
for he that offends in one point, is guilty of all,
(ſaith the Apoſtle) looke therefore to thy boſome ſin,
and never leave ſtriving untill thou quite extirpate
the ſame. How many are there of us, that will pray
in neceſſity, but will not praiſe in proſperity. The
husband-man ſo long as the corne is growing, will
hedge and fence the field, with all care, and dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:
but when it is reaped then he lets it lye open,
for Hogs, and other Beaſts to treade, and trample in.
When we have what we looked for, then welet the
reine ſlip, in a ſtorme we would be glad to ſhelter
our ſelves under the branches of that tree: which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward

the ſame manner the ungratefull <hi>Athenians</hi> delt
with <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> when there was any ſedition, or
uproare in the City, then who but <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> but
when by his diſcreet wiſedome, and good Counſell
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94802:5"/>
all was quieted, then who more vile, who more contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
then poore <hi>Themiſtocles?</hi> I wiſh, this might be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to too many of our times, who are fitly compared to
a Herd of Hoggs, the keeper beates them downe acornes,
and they eate them up greedily, but never look up to the
tree, onely when they find their ſtore ſpent, grunt a little
for more like as when ſome wholeſome potion is boyled
in a braſſe veſſell, yet the braſſe gives it ſuch a reliſh, that
it becomes good for nothing. Prayers, and praiſe in a good
mans mouth, is like ſweet incenſe, but in others, it is like
braſſe, and ſavours too ſtrong of the Cask, and therefore
the wiſe man ſaith, that praiſe is not ſeemly in the mouth
of a Sinner.</p>
            <p>The husband man when he is like to have a good har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt,
or the Merchant a good returne from Sea. He will
give praiſe to God, but with ſuch a relation to his gaine,
that a man may eaſily perceive it was not of free will, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed willingly did he give praiſe to Almighty
God: and indeed men doe behave themſelves ſo, as if they
were bound no more to give God praiſe, then he is to give
them benefits. <hi>The Lord hath given and the Lord hath taken
away</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob) bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>

               <hi>Quando tibi benè eſt, lauda miſericordiam Dei: quando male,
lauda iuſticiam Dei.</hi> And that luſtily, and with a good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
Our prophet <hi>David</hi> calling upon the creatures to
praiſe the Lord, he joyneth a reaſon: For (ſaith he) <hi>Let
them praiſe the Lord, for he commanded, and they were created.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we have much more cauſe; for beſides we have the
benefit common with them, we have above all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
a great benefit of redemption by Ieſus Chriſt: in
this God hath exalted men above Angels, in giving unto
them his onely begotten Sonne, as his power was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
in the creating of the world, ſo the riches of his love,
was never ſo fully ſhewed, as in ſending his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94802:6"/>
Sonne to ſuffer for us. I remember a ſtory of one <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus,</hi>
who made a law, that all adulterers ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with the loſſe of both their eyes: on a time it
came to paſſe his owne ſon was taken in the ſame fault: his
good old Father being perplexed much thereat, at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
on this courſe: that the executioner ſhould pull out
one of his owne eyes: and another of his Sonnes; that ſo
both iuſtice might be ſatisfied, and mercy ſhewed. We
likewiſe were in danger both of looſing this life, and that
which is to come, as alſo of ſuffering a double Death, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
and eternall, but God hath found out a meanes
for our delivery: Chriſt came in, and ſuffered one Death
himſelfe, to free us from the other Death. <hi>Plato</hi> gave
thankes unto the Gods. Firſt, that he was a man, and not
a Beaſt. Secondly that he was a <hi>Graetian,</hi> and not a <hi>Barhari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>
Thirdly that he was not one of the common rout, but
a <hi>Philoſopher.</hi> But beſides we are men, we are Chriſtian
men, who live in peace, and plenty with the free paſſage
of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore let us both <hi>Young
Men and Maidens, old Men and Babes praiſe the name of the
Lord. Gratiarum actio, reſpicit gratiam dantis, ubi igitur est
gratia maior dantis, ibi gratia maior accipientis.</hi> Aſſure thy ſelf
of one thing as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath, <hi>Qui non vult laudare
in hoc ſeculo, obmuteſcet in futuro.</hi> God at the laſt day, will
ſay to ſuch an one, as the King did to him, that had not on
the wedding garment. I ſhould be too tedious if I ſhould
ſtand to reckon up the manifold mercys that God hath be
ſtowed on this our land, beyond all the world beſides, our
Peace, and Plenty, with the Goſpell of Chriſt, our many,
and great deliverances, both from forreigne enemies, and
Domeſticke Traytors: ſo that we may rightly ſay, <hi>Ignem
&amp; aquam tranſivimus.</hi> God hath delivered us from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
invaſion, and the Gun-powder treaſon, and hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
us in a wealthy land. Be ye therefore filled with the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94802:6"/>
Spirit (ſaith our Prophet <hi>David)</hi> ſpeaking to your ſelves in
Pſalmes, and Hymnes, and ſpirituall ſongs: and here I might
ſpeak of the godly care of our Church, which hath ordeined
ſinging of Pſalmes, both before, and after Sermon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are very fitting to be ſung in order, for the better ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up of our affections. And here I have a iuſt cauſe to taske
them of the Seperation, who will not admit of any ſet forme
of prayer, for that (as they ſay) is curſing of the Spirit, but why
then ſhould we have a ſet forme of ſinging? For my part it ſhall
ever have my allowance &amp; I thinke that theſe their <hi>Ex tempore</hi>
prayers ſounds as harſhly in the eares of heaven, as divers
Pſalmes ſung together in ſevorall tunes, would in ours. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes mention of three graces <hi>viz.</hi>
Faith, Hope, &amp; Charity, but the chiefeſt of theſe is Charity,

we ſhall enioy both that we did beleive, and hoped for;
but love ſhall accompany us there alſo: in imitation thereof,
I ſhall alſo name three, prayer, praiſe, and Patience, but the
chiefeſt of theſe is Praiſe, and that for the ſame reaſon, becauſe
it ſhall outlaſt all other, here we ſtand in need of things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
both for the body, and ſoule, and therefore we have need
of prayer, here we are troubled, and afflicted with divers
kinds of adverſities, And therefore we had need of Patience:
but hereafter in heaven, all teares ſhall be wiped away from
our eyes, we ſhall have no need then, of Prayer, or patience,
onely praiſe ſhall ſtill remaine, then it ſhall be as it now is, the
greateſt ioy of the Angels to conſort themſelves with the
Saints, in ſinging glory, and Honour, and praiſe, to him that
ſits upon the Throne, &amp; to the Lamb for evermore. And ſo I
have done with the duty in generall. And now give me leave
a little to acquaint you with ſome obſervations; and firſt for
reproofe, there is no impartiall Chriſtian, but it would grieve
his heart to ſee the prophanation of Gods ordinances, when
Coblers, Weavers, and Taylours, and Feltmakers. <hi>Frange le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94802:7"/>
calamos, &amp; ſcinde Thalia libellos.</hi> And theſe to goe unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
nay much made on, and well countenanced: many of
our Pulpits now a dayes, do ring of the Doctrine of Devils.
On did preach publikely, that it was not fit for Parents to teach
their children the Lords prayer. Another did maintaine, and
approve, of that bloody act of <hi>Eelton.</hi> An other (to uſe his
owne wordes) would maintaine that there was no more holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the Church, then in his Kitchin, nor in our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
Table, then his Dreſſerboard. O horrid Blaſpemy! what
will become of us, if Eccleſiaſticall iurisdiction may not
curbe ſuch as theſe are. O that they might be permitted to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
theſe things, with what fury would they dart out their
thunderbolts, and with their <hi>Coruſcant</hi> beames beat theſe bats
into their accurſed holes; the houſe of God prophaned: the
memory of the Saints razed: the monuments of good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
it is great pitty to ſee, that thoſe who have beene ſpeciall
benefactors to this City, that their Monuments are defaced.
I would it might be taken into ſerious conſideration, neither
<hi>Inſignia Regalia</hi> can eſcape their cenſure. For in one Church
of this City, it was openly preached, that the Kings Crowne
ſhould be pulled downe, becauſe it had a croſſe upon it. I wiſh
we could pull downe the old man of Sinne, and leavell thoſe
mountains of Pride which are in our hearts. Gods houſe is
abuſed, and the Miniſters of God abuſed: there cannot one of
them goe along the ſtreets, but ſtraight he is taken notice on,
who he is, or the like contumelious reproaches, look yonder
goes a <hi>Ieſuite:</hi> and Abbilubber, one of <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts: one of
<hi>Canterburies</hi> whelpes.</p>
            <p>There is one place I would have you look unto: where it
is ſaid.<hi>They mocked the meſſenger of God, and deſpiſed his words,
and miſuſed his Prophets: until the wrath of the Lord was againſt his
People, till there was no remedy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chro. 36. verſe 16.</note> We read in the former verſes
that they had polluted the Temple and commited many, and
great ſins, bnt yet God did forbeare, untill they came to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94802:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his Prophets, and then there was no remedy, the
word in the originall doth properly ſignifie, that their ſore
was cancred. The decent <hi>Munimenta</hi> which have ſtood time
out of mind in divers Churches, to keepe the Lords table
from prophanaion, is fetched away by thoſe that have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
(I conceive the order of the honourable houſe of
Parliament) &amp; I do confeſſe that there were too many altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of late, but for thoſe that have ſtood decently, time out
of mind, that the rude, and inconſiderate multitude ſhould
demoliſh them! I would wiſh theſe to conſider what the holy
Prophet ſaith, <hi>He that breaketh a Hedge, a Serpent ſhall bite him:</hi>
I conceive that ye all know what I meane by the Hedge, and
I wiſh you may not too ſoon feele what is meant by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
We have too many in theſe our days are ſo invective a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Biſhops,</hi> as if they would pluck up both branch, &amp; root
in one day, although there may be ſome faulty in the Church,
therefore ſhall the Church ſuffer? Some Aldermen have been
faulty, and ſome Iudges have been Dilinquent, but therefore
ſhall there be no Iudges, &amp; no Aldermen? Let the parties,

office. So likewiſe for the booke of Common Prayer,
how is it condemned, and reviled (that I ſay) what was made
by the conſent of many godly Miniſters, and ſealed with their
deareſt blood; it hath bin termed by the name of Pottage, or
Porridge, you muſt give me leave to be a forewarner to tell:
you. For what things the wrath of God doth hang over our
heads, but by my conſeut, thoſe that will have none of the
Porridge, ſhould have none of the meat, <hi>Ex tempore</hi> Prayer,
&amp; <hi>Ex tempore</hi> Preaching, as if their glorious Lord, &amp; heavenly
Father, had deſerved no more reverence at their hands then to
ſerve for blockes, and Poſts, that when they are ready to tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
out of their way, by taken of theirin conſiderate haſt, taken
hold of theſe names, keep their tongues in play, while their
raſh invention makes a farther paſſage you ſhall read what
<hi>Method</hi> was obſerved in the building of Solomons Temple,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94802:8"/>
that it was built of ſtone, made ready, before it was brought
thither; ſo that there was neither hammor, nor Axe, nor any
toole of Iron heard in the houſe while it was in building:<note place="margin">1 King 6. verſe 7.</note> if
this Method were obſerved in the building of the Temple,
we ſhould not have ſuch hacking, and hamering, as if <hi>Babell</hi>
were now building, rather then the houſe of God; or if it
were rather a pulling downe, then a building up, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our late King <hi>Iames,</hi> cals ſuch Prayers, Monſtrous births,
and indeed how can they be otherwiſe, when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and brought forth all in one houre? Prayer is the moſt
neceſſary duty to a Chriſtian of all other, and of all other
moſt acceptable to Almighty God. <hi>Oratio fidelis eſt coeli clavis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thou (ſuch as theſe) muſt not thinke to open Heaven

Browniſts, and I ſhall acquaint you with the paſſage concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the firſt founder of the laſt of theſe ſects?</p>
            <p>It was one Browne a Miniſter who would preach no where
but in private houſes, ann deſert places, and the like: and the
reaſon that he alleadged, was, becauſe we had no true Church
but marke the event, a good benefice was offered this Brown,
which he willingly accepted of, and he, that before would
not acknowledge a Church in England, was content to be a
Parſon of <hi>A-Church</hi> a certaine towne in <hi>Northampton-ſhire:</hi>
loe here you may behold the ſincerity together with the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of theſe <hi>Browniſts!</hi> We read in the viſion of <hi>Elijah,</hi> that
there was a Whirle-wind, but God was not in the whirle-wind:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94802:8"/>
next an earthquake: next a fire: but laſt of all a ſtill
ſmall voice, and there God was.</p>
            <p>When was there a greater whirle-wind and Tempeſt in the
Land then now is, and is there not an earth-quake in this land
of ours? when one ſhall goe away with five or 600. poundes a
yeare, and a poore Vicar for 40. pounds ſhall undergoe all
the burthen? There was alſo a fire, but God was not in it, when
many of our proteſtant Martyrs in the <hi>Marian</hi> days, were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up to heaven like <hi>Elijah</hi> in chariots of fire. But as for us
throughout our ſecond <hi>Deborah's</hi> days, &amp; our ſecond Solomons
days, &amp; in the raigne of our ſecond <hi>Ioſiah</hi> (whom God long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve)
among us, we have, &amp; do heare the ſtill ſmal voice of the
preaching of the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, we have had free
liberty for the publike Worſhip, and ſervice of God, even the
full age of a man, till now of late, theſe diſturbers of the peace
of our Church, have riſen, and the wind hath begun to blow
againe in the whiſling, and bluſtering of theſe Browniſts. I
know there are ſome who are ready to taske us for medling
with theſe things we have nothing to doe with, but one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
is, what things are out of our reach, or what men in
points of Religion? I am ſure our commiſſion extends to the
higheſt <hi>Cedars,</hi> in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> as will as the <hi>Hyſop,</hi> that groweth
upon the wall. We are dogs of the flock, and therefore when
we ſee cauſe we may bark, and live too. Now I come to give
you a view of the actors: and thoſe <hi>Young Men, and Maidens,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>The parties are mentioned by couples, being tied two and
two together. <hi>Young men, and Maidens, old Men, and Children,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>And here is a double <hi>Caveat,</hi> firſt againſt preſumption, and
ſecondly againſt Deſpaire. Firſt, that the younger ſort might
deſire to praiſe God, they are exhorted to addreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the ſervice of God, to remember their Creator in
the days of their youth. Secondly, for aged men, that they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94802:9"/>
might not doubt of the acceptation of their ſervice, our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
exhorts them alſo, for the firſt you know <hi>David</hi> cals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sun, and the Moone, to praiſe God. Should the Sun
reply, I will not doe it in the morning, or at noone time, but
when I am about to ſit? or the Moone reply, I will not in the
full, but in the waine? or the Tree not in the ſpring-time, or
Summer, but at the fall of the leafe? ſo likewiſe, thou Young
man deferre not the time of Praiſing God: take the ſwinge of
thy youth &amp; do not deferre to apply thy ſelf to the ſervice of
God, till thy old age, but remember that for all theſe things,
thou ſhalt come to judgement. He that ſtiles himſelfe by the
title <hi>I am</hi> cares not for I will be, or I have been; but he that is at
this preſent: take heed therefore, thou ſtrong, and luſtie young
Man, the Divell that holds the now, will every day tie a new
cord about thee: <hi>Qui non eſt hodiè, cras minùs aptus erit:</hi> conſider
this, you that are yet yong, whom the morning Sun of light
adornes with his glorious rayes, every-one doth not live to
be old. Let us not procraſtinate Gods ſervice: For the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
we deferre to ſerve God, the farther God's grace is diſtant
from us, and the dominion of Sathan is more ſtrenghthened
in our hearts, the more we delay, the more is our debt, the
greater our ſin, and leſſe our grace. I will commend this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
unto all. He, that doth not repent to day, bath a day more
to repent of, and a day leſſe to repent in. I ſhall only conclude
this point with an hearty exortation for us all, of what ſect,
Age, and degree ſoever, I could wiſh that all our lives, might
end, like this booke of Pſalmes in bleſſing, and praiſing Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God. I will hold your patience no longer in ſuſpence,
but will conſummate all with the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Let young Men,</hi> and
<hi>Maidens, Old Men,</hi> and <hi>Children, praiſe the name of the Lord.</hi>
Yea this name eſpecially the name of our <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi>
to whom with the Father, and Holy Spirit, be all honour,
Praiſe and glory now and for evermore. Amen.</p>
