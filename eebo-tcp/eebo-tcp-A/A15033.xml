            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hath founde it written in the <hi>Annales</hi> of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> that as <hi>Alaric</hi> marched towardes <hi>Rome:</hi> there went before him a Monke of an vnknowne place: who (notwithstanding that <hi>Alaric</hi> was a blouddy tyraunt, yet béeing a Christian) vpon audience desired him, for the loue of God to moderate his ire: and to remember that he him selfe béeing a Christian, was in duty bound to forbeare the sheading of Christian bloud: much more the destruction of <hi>Rome</hi> which had no way offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: to whom <hi>Alaric</hi> thus aunsweared: know thou, thou man of God, that of my proper desire I goe not against <hi>Rome:</hi> yea further more know thou, that I am thus dayly importuned by an vnknowne perswasion: aduaunce thy selfe against <hi>Rome,</hi> destroy it, and make it desolate: wherevpon the religious man sore amased durst not reply: and so king <hi>Alaric</hi> followed his enterprise: so that it séemeth this aduersitie of <hi>Rome,</hi> was a speciall scourge of God: <hi>Paule Osorius</hi> further sayeth that as God sent <hi>Lot</hi> foorth of <hi>Sodome:</hi> euen so hee deliuered Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the first, from this heauy destruction of <hi>Rome:</hi> but if in that suggestion he had not beene partiall, he woulde haue compared the iniquitye of <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha:</hi> and so by consequence the Cardinals and rest of the Cleargy, as spotted as <hi>Labans</hi> shéepe.

Against the tyranous decrée of <hi>Pharao,</hi> which was, that the Midwiues should kill all the male children of the Hebrewes, his prouidence saued <hi>Moses</hi> from drowning, and made him his instrument to leade the children of <hi>Israell</hi> out of the bondage of <hi>Pharao,</hi> vnto the land of promise.

that he might open the gates of faith, and preach the way of saluation euen vnto his enimies.

But behold good reader how peaceably these northerne rebels were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, who are naturally men of fierce courages, and howe like a bubble the Popes bull vanished, which in times past, feared mighty Emperours &amp; Kings.

The Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> two yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">1571</note> was peaceably deliuered into the possession of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Iustice: and being by act of Parliament before attainted of treason, was beheaded at <hi>Yorke.</hi> The lingering myserie of the Earle of <hi>Westmerland,</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> the low Countries and other places of his wilfull vanishment, vnto a Noble minde, could not but be more gréeuous then death: his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test intertainment being scarce able to sustaine the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a man, and a page: and which was more gréeuous, he was driuen to beare with the arrogant disgraces of euerie rascally Spaniard: and to say the trueth, not onely the Earle, but all other the English fugitiues, labour out such a long and a myserable life, (in respect of their callings, if they had liued in the obedience of good subiectes) as they rather deserue to bée pitied then enuyed of their worst enimies. This peaceable ouerthrow in the North, touched the Pope to the quicke, and least that delay should cut him to the heart, he by his threatning Bull published open warres against her Maiestie: In May following the rebellion in the North, this terrible Bull was hanged vppon the Byshoppe of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> gate, but the hornes which should haue gored her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties good subiectes, grew to a paire of gallowes, to hange his instrument <hi>Felton</hi> in the place: <hi>Felton</hi> hanged vp the Popes Bull secreatly, and as a ranke traytor, was himselfe hanged, headed, and quartered openly: the Popes holinesse <note place="margin">1570</note> could not make him walke inuisible, neither yet could his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don protect him at his triall: this ill successe had the Pope in his English attemps, &amp; from the first houre of her Maiesties raigne, the wished euents followed the procéedings of her maiesty, both against the Pope, and other her enimies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.

The vengeance of Enuie was now broched, and the venime thereof swelled many busie heades, euen vnto their owne confusion. The same yeare a daungerous conspiracie in <hi>Norfolke</hi> by <hi>Throgmorton, Applearde, Brooke, Kete, Redman,</hi> and others was practised against strangers. But <hi>Kete</hi> discouered the matter, before the mischiefe was ripe. By which reuealement, an insurrection was peaceably defeated, and for example, of diuerse of the conspirators that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, onely, <hi>Throgmorton, Broke</hi> and <hi>Redman,</hi> were hanged, drawen, and quartered. The bloudie conspiracie of <hi>Madder</hi> and <hi>Barlowe,</hi> was shortly after discouered, and they as traytors were executed. All which preuentions of daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and publicke disturbance, may neither be attributed, to chaunce nor worldly wisedome. But aboue the rest the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vanquishing of the Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> is a bye note of Gods wonderfull prouidence, and fauour showen to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestis, and blessed Realme: his conuiction, shewed his attempt to be most perrilous, both to her Maiestie, and many of her louing subiectes. And for to performe the same, he was the most popular subiect that liued in <hi>Englande</hi> many a daye: he was setled in the fauour of most of the chiefe peares, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, he was honoured of the Commons: which vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall loue procéedeth not alwayes from true vertue: But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise sometimes from dissembling humilitie, the highest ladder of ambition.

The <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabush</hi> shotte by <hi>Appeltre,</hi> that sore wounded a water-man, <note place="margin">1579</note> within sixe foote of her Maiestie in her Bardge, sufficed to haue appauled a martiall courage, the chaunce being so rare: at the first face, could pretende no other than treason, a daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that tried her true Magnanimitie, the matter so little feared her inuincible minde, as her highnes set a part the care of her own safety, to carrie the comforting of her poore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Barge-man. The Ambassadour <hi>Mounsieur Shemere</hi> was in honour bounde (who was there present) to report in <hi>France,</hi> that in a mortall extremitie, her Maiestie, whom the feare principally concerned, was the least amased in the company: but it may be saide that this was a casuall perrill, that was not knowne before examination, and her excéeding mercy in pardoning the offender cleared al suspition of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Many a worthy prince to settle an awe in subiects, haue
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:11964:77"/>
suffered their Lawes to punish with death, more ignorant, (yea altogither innocent) offences, but certainly the least ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant would haue adiudged <hi>Apletre,</hi> for feare that destiny had marked him to bring forth some other daungerous fruit: as the <hi>Athenians</hi> did the boy that pycked out the eyes of byrdes, whom they put to death, vppon a suggestion that he woulde proue a tyrant. But to come more neare to the shame of these slaunderous Traitors: to settle (if it were possible) a feare in her Maiestie, how diuellishly, and daungerously haue they assaulted her Maiesties life. The forenamed <hi>Someruile,</hi> kept his resolution to kil her Maiestie euen vnto death: and yet al they that are worthy to behold her princely and vnappauled countenance assuredly know, that all the murthering prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of her enimies, haue impressed no feare in her Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous heart (for feare is euermore séene in the face) the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, there is no crueltie harbored in her Royal brest, which passion both bréedeth, and nourisheth feare: but principally, when the Arche-traitor <hi>Parry</hi> tolde her Maiestie that hée had passed his promise to kill her: shée was so smally abashed, as the constantnesse of her countenance made him to tremble. An other time when he was fully determined to haue slaine her excellencie with his dagger, the assurednesse of her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance (which resembled a bright sunne, shadowed with no manner of cloudes) made him to lose his resolution. The traitors owne tale, although the same were shadowed with a dissembling loyaltie sufficed to haue impressed a ielious feare in her Maiestie: but shée made so light account of her enimies threates, as shée scorned to report <hi>Parries</hi> suspitious words vnto her graue Counsell: furthermore to cléere her Maiestie from the least bleamish of Tyrannie, there néedeth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther testimonie, than the confession and records of rancke Traitours. It appeareth in <hi>Parries</hi> and <hi>Throgmortons</hi> voluntarie confessions, that her princely clemencie stayeth all sharpe courses against such Papistes, as liue like obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient subiectes, when that Lawe adiudged them death, their last hope was in her excéeding mercie.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:11964:77"/>
                        <hi>Throgmorton</hi> craued mercie with this acknowledgement, <hi>of which many haue tasted, and few haue beene depriued. Parry</hi> confessed, that the manifold vertues which shined in her Countenance, euermore made him lose his resolution to kill her maiesty. Forraine writers in their books, haue made questions, whether the greatnesse of her Maiesties mercie, were a vertue more holy in her maiestie, or daungerous for her good subiectes, because it bread presumption in those that are euill affected. I protest before God (who I knowe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily punisheth wilfull periurie) that I hearde a Papist in <hi>Rome,</hi> afore some of his companions wish (and make choise) to be her Maiesties prisoner in the Fléete, rather then (as he was) the Popes pentioner in <hi>Rome:</hi> and truely her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment is more large than the Popes allowance, saue vnto such persons which make shewe of seditious spirites. Furthermore the long raigne, and manifolde blessings, which almightie God plentifully bestoweth of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, euidently declareth that shée is no tyraunt, whose Raignes are for the most part short, and their deathes vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Yea these Calumniers and Lybellers, with these shameles detractions slaunder their owne knowledge, which is, that her mercie giueth life to condemned Papistes, if that (their Religion safe) they will but acknowledge Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall supremacie to be one to her Maiestie, which the Pope and all his power cannot plucke from her. To conclude, no one what so euer his offence be, is put to death in case of Treason, and Felonie, except the Consciences of twelue sufficient men finde him guiltie: and this I may true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, although <hi>Englande</hi> bée small in comparison of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> yet her mercie pardoneth more, that are conuicted by the Lawe, than the king of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Italy.</hi> It is a wonder to sée the wilfull stubbornesse of these vngratious Iesuites, howe they striue against their owne knowledge, howe shamelesly they slaunder the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest course of Iustice that euer ciuill pollicie administred in any common wealth: but chiefely how impudently they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch

It is the last refuge the Pope hath to vphold his wicked kingdome, to blowe into subiectes eares, slaunders of tyranny, subsidies, oppressions, and other hard impositions of their Princes: with these perswations they haue kindled many commotions, and daily settle a mortall hatred in the ignorant multitude, towards their Princes and godly procéedings, which euermore bursteth forth with the confusion of such as they seduce, for God which abhorreth Traitours seldome suffereth Treason to prosper: the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent obseruance of the euents whereof, is able to settle the duetie and obedience of a good subiect, more than the learning and Eloquence of the greatest Orators.</p>

doing of vengeance, is more readie to succour her enimies with her hand, then to spurne them with her foote: and among many that least deserue this fauour, charitie, and commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your dayly ruines, moueth me to wish vnto you after vnfained reconciliation, both the fruition of this mercie, and all your Countrey blessings. The errors of your Religion are manifested by many godly Diuines, but the blindnesse of your harts will not suffer you to sée them: and small is the maruell, though you contemne the counsels of men, when you vse the visible warnings of God to strengthen your errors. The report of the souldiers vnto the high Priests of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Christes resurrection, sufficed to haue conuerted the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but to their condemnation, the Diuell and money sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this slaunder in their harts, <hi>that his Disciples stole him away in the night.</hi> Gods iustice stroke <hi>Mahomet</hi> with the falling sicknesse, to make him know and forsake his blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, but to strengthen the peoples misbeléefe, the Diuell taught him to say, <hi>that his falling proceeded of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with an Angell, whose diuine presence his humane shape could not endure.</hi> Uppon the principall day of the sauadge murther in <hi>Parris,</hi> according to the figure in the Reuelation, that the stinging Locusts shoulde not hurt the gréene trée, when to shewe that Gods worde should flourish mauger your crueltie, a withered trée bare gréene leaues in the Church yard, which receiued many a martired carkasse, you presently applyed that preaching, or prophesying ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to the second florishing of your Romish Church, time proueth your exposition, but an idle suggestion. For although God suffered this cruell persecution of his Church, yet he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently shewed himselfe as a louing father, who burneth the rod when he hath corrected his sonne, God shortly sent an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly death to the chiefe scourge in this persecution, and with the gallowes confounded the most of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rascally <hi>Atheists</hi> his executioners: if any liue, they beare the markes of hys heauie displeasure: what honor, and to go further, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit haue you gained by this policie of your Church? to what
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:11964:82"/>
purpose hath the Pope painted this persecution about his great hall at <hi>Lateran?</hi> forsooth that it may be a monument of his crueltie, and Gods mercie: of his crueltie, who dayly murthereth, and of Gods mercy, which dayly increaseth the number of true professors. If the hardnesse of your harts had not blinded your vnderstanding, you could not but perceiue the visible plagues which fall vppon your <hi>Pharao</hi> the Pope: you sée that iustice by generall iudgement hangeth notable murtherers in chaines, that they may rot &amp; consume by péece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meales: euen so Gods iustice promiseth semblable vengeance vpon this Archmurtherer your pope: the most infirmed eyes sée the lingring consumption of his riches, reuerence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: he that sometime disposed forraigne kingdomes, can not kéepe his proper lands out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> possession of his next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors. There is no frée state in <hi>Italy,</hi> but of late yéeres haue fléesed him, nor any Christian Prince that is his best friend, which paieth his auncient tribute. He that sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the persons, goods, &amp; roial powers of anointed kings, is now driuen to waste his substance vppon Atheists, secretly to murther his supposed enimies, whose counsels (for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most) proue the halters, which hang his executioners: necessity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth him to be in league with all men, saue the professors of the Gospell: the <hi>Iewes</hi> haue their sinagogue, the <hi>Grecians</hi> their proper religion euen in <hi>Rome:</hi> strumpets haue good law to recouer the leacherous hire of their bodies: their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are his possessions, for they pay him rent to abuse them. Atheists, traitors, murtherers, théeues, and such as the lawes of all good gouernement would consume with the gallowes, are his souldiers, stipendaries, and pentioners: and what ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice do they him? they shorten their owne daies in laboring his wicked practises, all to a bootelesse successe: seldome, (but yet sometimes) his instrumentes execute hys bloodie purposes: but hys <hi>Machiuillians</hi> neuer escape the hands of vengeance: I haue shewne the example of <hi>Fraunce. Iohn Ianregui</hi> the fyrst assayler of the godlie Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> was presentlye slayne, and sundrye of hys
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:11964:83"/>
confederates were executed, the odious Atheist which wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly murthered this good prince, had a seuere death, but yet too milde for his execrable offence: but héere in <hi>England</hi> (from whence came the Lion that first plucked the prowde Eagle of <hi>Rome</hi> by the throte, &amp;c.) what successe hath followed all his pollicies? since the noble King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight shewed his rauening to the princes of the earth, he hath vomited his poisoned enuy and mallice to the chiefe destruction, disgrace, and shame of him and his partakers, his instruments of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, murther, and all inhumaine mischiefes, had their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which rid the horsse <hi>Seian</hi> which was violent death: they brought buls which gored themselues, and pardons whiche turned into halters, and hatchets which hanged and quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their maisters: I néede not name <hi>Felton, Campion, Parry,</hi> and the rest: you haue canonized them for Saincts, and we haue Chronacled them for Traitors. Since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of her sacred Maiesties raigne, whome héere in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> haue your Popes cursses harmed? I know his blessings haue brought many <hi>Englishmen</hi> to the gallowes, from which God blesse all good men, and then I meane not you, without amendment. If you haue not learned by the councels of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to forbeare the laying of violent hands vppon the Lords annointed, yet the dayly experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of your companions falles, and their frustrate attempts, sufficeth to banish the very ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of your and our most gratious soueraignes death, which all good Christians beseech almightie God many yéeres to defer. You are not so wise as the Philosophers disciples, whiche in the water woulde followe their maister but to the chin: for you follow the Pope ouer head and eares in two dangerous seas, error, and rebellion. You may learne instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of safetie of Mise, which runne from houses which are readie to fall: or of lice, that will leaue the bodie of a dying man: all the world séeth that your Popes kingdome leaneth vpon a few rotten props, yea, that the life of his glorie is at the point of death: why follow you then your owne destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in susteining of him, whome vengeance will no longer

suffer to flourish. Nature counselleth you to haue care of your liues, and charitie warneth your enimies from wishing your deathes, if you would shunne the perils that vnpolitike crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures auoid, but <hi>Pharao</hi> and his host would wilfully perish in the red sea, the like is your stobernesse and expected destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Pharao</hi> was plagued, and well warned before, and you Papists lacke neither punishment to feare you, nor perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to win you, and vnhappy are ye that neither can profit you. <hi>Mahomet</hi> to continue his irreligion by his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> forbad y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people to reason of it, a damnable policy to suppresse truth, which by disputation breaketh out of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies, as fire out of Flint, by the striking of iron. The people to blinde all the world with ignorance, appointed the Latin toong for matters of religion, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> multitude vnderstood not: if one language sufficed for a generall edifying, the holy Ghost in the forme of clouen and firie toongs sate vppon the Apostles in vaine, which instructed euerie one in their proper language, it was a policie almost as dangerous as <hi>Mahomets,</hi> which manie yéeres masked the hipocriticall blasphemy of the pope: when his dreames shadowed the truth, your mists of error might wel arise from ignorance: but now that truth hath vnmasked his hipocrisy, your blindnesse can be adiudged no better, than peruerse wilfulnesse. His policy forbiddeth you studiously to search the scriptures, it is then like his wil is that you should reade his own monuments. And I counsell you to reade <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus, Aeneas Siluius,</hi> the golden Legend of the actes of popes. <hi>Plutarke</hi> reporteth that an Atheist gouernour of <hi>Cilicy,</hi> belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">Plut. lib. de orat.

There is an old saying, <hi>Orpheus can describe hell better then Aristotle,</hi> raysed vpon a fable that he fetched his wife from thence, and truly in knowledge is assurance, and in report may be error.

vnpossible: you may by grace stumble on such grose errors, as shall constraine you to looke vpon the plaine truth: but you haue a commandement, that forbids you to looke into the liues of your Popes, because it can not be denied but that they trespasse dayly as men, when in their doctrine can bee no error, because the holy Ghost waighteth vppon their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, it may well be of their holinesse, and yet farre ynough from the Pope.

They excéede S. <hi>Peter</hi> in riches and pompe, but they come short of him in holines &amp; doing of miracles.

But you will further say, that all your doings are the documents of great learned men, whose counsels ought to worke more strongly with you then all my perswasions. That same learning in déede in stubborne wits, when it vndertaketh an error, doth the diuell and all of hurt. <hi>Plato</hi> saith, small wits do little hurt in a common wealth, the great wits are they that do all the mischiefe. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> had read much, and was very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in the scriptures, and yet he was a great while in the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and still perswaded himselfe that scripture was of his side. Learning doth stay a man in error, rather then helpe him out of it, especially if he haue chued the sense of the scripture at his pleasure, or be dronken with iuice that his fantesie hath corrupted. Saint <hi>Paule</hi> was lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned when he persecuted Christes flocke, and had read of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much as of the scripture, and yet you sée that men could neuer turne his hart: God himselfe was faine to put to his voice, to strike his body blind, and to enlighten therewith his soule. In truth it is apparant that you stop your eares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the perswasions of man. It is Gods especiall grace that must vanquish your stubbernes, which grace is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to all those that sincerely ask it in his Sonne Iesus name: speake well of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> and the rest, because they are dead, but pray not vnto them, for the dead can doo the liuing no good. Iesus signifyeth saluation, and Iesus alone must be your saluation.

more then seuen yéeres reading of controuersies. The short praier of the poore Publicane was in heauen, before the long babling of the painted Pharisie: his doctrine is nothing so dangerous as the Popes, he commandeth you to pay tribute and obedience to Princes, and not to murther or lay violent hands of the Lords annointed: if he set you about such busines, will him to teach you more fence, for he had néede to be verie skilfull that shall wound him to whom God is a buckler. It is not an enterprice to be ventured on by yong schollers, least in the striking out of their quarters their heads and all flie off. Returne your vengeance vpon this vngratious pope, who is the vengeance both of your body and soule: but now I counsel you not to strike him with carnall weapons, for the word must be his confusion, reade but the new Testament ouer with a holy conscience, &amp; you shall find many words to wound him. <hi>Marten Luther</hi> (whose very name perplexeth the Pope) neuer fought with him with other weapons then the word of God, yet in his life he so vanquished him, as being at the very point of death, his soule beheld the triumph of his destruction, and for ioy thereof sayd:

The gratious Prince, for his or her protection, is neither dutifully reuerenced, nor truely obeyed: and what is sowen for publike benefite, groweth to the ruine of the Countries prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Vpon the experience of the good gouernement of</hi> Athens <hi>and other florishing Commonwealthes corrupted, or to speake more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confounded, by such vile persons, as their principall Cities foste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: warranted the graue</hi> Socrates, <hi>being demaunded what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the wealth, of a Commonwelth, to answere, that peace was the inricher thereof: being demaunded on the contrarie part, the chiefe cause of pouertie, in a Common wealth, semblablie aunswered that peace was the meane thereof. Being asked his reasons, said, that in the time of peace Armes giue place to Lawes, and good Lawes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministreth both plentie and prosperitie, to such Countries as receiue and obay them: on the other side he alledged, that wealth the blessing of peace, bread many vices in her owne bowels, of the nature of Mothes in cloath, or canker rust in yron, which by the consuming of their suckers destroy themselues: and questionles the wheele of peace painted on either side with these fiue spokes, Peace bringeth plentie, Plentie causeth pride, Pride raiseth enuie, Enuie soweth sedition, and Sedition hatcheth pouertie, is rather the deuise of some Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers setled iudgement, than the toy of a Painters variable fancie: the Embleame, so truely portrayeth the change of all happie gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But some more quicke of wit, then in discretion perfect, will suggest, that where Law hath her full voyce, these Cankers can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer grow to the consumption of the heart: to which question I thus aunswere, that Law may haue a free passage, and yet Iustice scanted of her due course: for Lawe will not, or cannot punish an apparant trespas without an open presentment: and Iustice would chasten the concealed fault, if she could commaund the Law, and such is the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>

Vppon which reason, quoth</hi> Diogines, <hi>what auaileth it to haue profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lawes, when the good readeth them not, and the euill cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, or care not for them: but although</hi> Diogines <hi>spake truelie as touching the naturall humors of men, for vnto the good their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences are in steede of Lawes, and with the lewde, no bridle is a restraint from euill: Yet grounding my reasons vppon larger authorities, I graunt</hi> Necessitie inuentris <hi>of all policies hath founde good Lawes so necessarie, as I holde those Realmes, Regions, Cities, and Townes which are not gouerned by Lawes, rather to bee forrestes of wilde beastes, than places habitable for men: for there where Lawes are musled, Iustice goeth masked, might mastereth right, Theft is reputed honest gaine, and murther lawfull reuenge: Treasou woulde enter the priuie Chamber, and to bee short the wealthie, shoulde go to wracke, and the inferiour would order, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they had disordered all good gouernement.

In <note place="margin">Gont. de vit.

The Pope notwithstanding that he alwayes reputed him, a holy and a iust man, neuertheles could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie his accusors audience. The Bishop hauing aduertisment of these enuious suggestions, to purge his innocency, chewsed among his friends a priest whom he had much aduanced, and especially loued, named <hi>Arnold.</hi> This <hi>Arnold</hi> being rich of spirit, Eloquence, and mony: so soone as he arryued at <hi>Rome</hi> pricked forward by the diuel, studied how to depriue his Lord of this dignitie, and to seate himselfe in the Archbishopricke. And to come by the same, he subborned two lewd Cardinals with a great sum of money: afterwards instéede of fauora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble speaking in his Masters behalfe, he spake much against him: saying, that he was more bounde to God, and the truth, then vnto men: and that in verie trueth the Archbyshop was guiltie of the accusation laide against him, by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Pope was moued, and abused with the report: and therefore to procéede iudicially against the innocent Bishop: hée sent the two Cardinals, confederate with <hi>Arnold,</hi> into <hi>Almaine,</hi> who being ariued at <hi>Magonce,</hi> commaunded the Archbishop before them, and so partially heard the matter, but the one gaue sentence against him, by meanes whereof, he was depriued of his dignitie, and <hi>Arnold</hi> (who had solde him as <hi>Iudas</hi> did our sauiour Christ) was placed in his place:
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:11964:104"/>
this iudgement being pronounced, the Archbishop <hi>Henrie</hi> there present deliuered these words. God knoweth that I am vniustly condemned: neuerthelesse I haue little care to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from your sentence, for that you shalbe sooner beléeued in your leasings, than I in deliuering of the truth: for this cause I receiue your iudgement, before the iust, and eternall Iudge which is Iesus Christ, before whom I adiorne you: The Iudges hearing the same, began to smile and bad him go before and they would follow after: This sentence was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the yeare of our Lord a thousand one hundred fifty sixe. The Archbishop thus depriued, sustained his iniurie with great patience, and liued the residue of his life in a Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to conclude God would not suffer this wickednesse vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, to the ende that the innocencie of the iust might bée knowne, one yeare and a halfe afterwards, Henry died in his Monestarie, and as it is to be hoped, mounted into the glorie he so desired. The newes of his death being come to <hi>Rome,</hi> the two Cardinals vppon a day being mearie together, saide that they failed to finde the Archbishop <hi>Henrie:</hi> but within few dayes after, the one of the two was so soundly strocken, by one of his owne people, that his intrailes issued out at his fundament, and so miserablie dyed. The other grinding of his téeth, and tearing, and eating his hands, dyed mad. Touching <hi>Arnold,</hi> for his cruelties, and seditions which he intertained among the people, he was so much hated, that one day being set in a Monestarie, hée was slaine, and after left thrée dayes among the diches of the Citie, where all the people men and women, exercised vppon his bodie, all the cruelties that might be possiblie inuented.

Almost there is no matter tried by law without this censure, <hi>It is pittie, it was not ended by friends:</hi> and truely in Christian equitie, this pittie, is a blame in the Iustisers of Peace, that they wil not looke into the discorde of neighbours, which is a breach of Christian Peace: and labour to accord them, which is a point of their duetie.

Nay (quoath <hi>Cato)</hi> for my parte, I rather wishe, that all the wayes to the place of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:11964:109"/>
pleading were cast ouer with Galthropes, that the féete of such as loue so well pleading, shoulde feele so much paines of those prickes in going thither, as their heades doe of the sunne in tarrying there: He meant they were but idle, whot heades, busie bodies, and troublesome men in a Common wealth that did so nourish pleading: Good labourers and quiet men, coulde bée content to ende their matters at home, by iudgement of their neighbours and kinsefolke without spending so their money vppon procurers and aduocates, whom wée call Attorneys, Counsellers, Sergeants, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally men of Lawe. Those hée accounteth profitable Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, who attende their honest labour and businesse at home, and not stande wayting and gaping vppon their Rolles, and Processe in the Lawe: as for the other by his iudgement it was no matter what mischiefe they suffered. This the graue learned man Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> writeth in his booke <hi>De republica Anglorum:</hi> and further saieth, That these bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie heades, and inuentours of trouble, are men euen permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God like Flyes, Lyse, and other vermine, to disquiet them, who woulde imploy themselues vppon better busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and more necessarie for the common wealth. These men are hated and feared of their neighbours, loued and ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them which gaine by Proces, and waxe fatte by the expence of others: In the blame of these make-bates (as our English phrase is) farre is it from my intent, as in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie places I protest to scandilize the most necessarie vse of Lawe, or to reproch the good Lawiers. For if necessitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentris of all Artes, Polycies, and Mecanicall craftes, giueth honour to the Phisition of our corporall bodies, no doubt shée commaundeth a more larger regarde, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to bée giuen to the Phisition of the politicke body, who is the Lawier. Notwithstanding as the Medicine is of more auaile that preserueth health, than that which cureth sickenesse: Euen so the meane that kéepeth neighbours in loue, peace, and Charitie, is more profitable than the authoritie that accordeth controuersies, is necessarie. For as

after the healing of a wound, there remaineth a scarre: euen so after the agréement of Law, there abideth mallice, which lying hidde like fire vnder ashes, kindleth fresh mallice, and neuer intertaineth faithfull amitie: It is then greatly to be pittied, that these simple men for the matter of fiue shillings should be vexed, arested, brought vp to Westminster Hall, and halfe vndone at the suite of troblesome persons, of the spoyles of these good men, a great number, of the swarmes of Attourneyes, and petifoggers liue. The gratious pollicie <note place="margin">A gratious pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie abused.</note> of this Realme, for the ease of these poore men; hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in euerie countie Courtes, and giueth libertie to Lords of Manners, to holde Plea of actions vnder fortie shillings debt, but the corruption of those Courts are such, and the comming of these persons so pleasing, as almost euerie sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, Latitates, prie about Countrie Churches for poore men: whereof many owe not the price of the Proces, and before the sute be ended, it oftentimes falleth out, that the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife, and defendant are both losers, and that these daungerous make-bates liue vppon their goodes, and painefull labours. This mischiefe woulde bée much eased, if charitie raigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong neighbours, or a godly care among the ministers of the Church, in trauailing to appease the discords of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rissioners, but especially as I here before haue saide: If the better sort of Gentlemen, and Iusticers of Peace, woulde take paines in this godly exercise: whose perswasions no doubt might easily ouercome the most stubborne, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaie both benefite and quietnesse to either partie, and no doubt if the popular sort will be counselled for their profite and quietnesse, they shall finde these Maiestrates readie to redresse their iniuries so farre as Law and charitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swation will helpe them.</p>

                     <p>Examples of the miserable ends of Atheistes &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>As I haue said, the (Atheists I meane) are armed with all worldlie pollicies of wit, to strengthen their purposes, &amp; are the instruments in the practises of great Princes, these bee they that followed <hi>Abimilech</hi> when he murthered threescore <note place="margin">Iudges 9.</note> and eight of his brethren: these be the firebrandes of the Pope and the two edged sword of Tyrauntes. If they bee instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of anie goodnesse, their trauell is not of zeale, if they bee vsed in anie mischiefe they outrage without pitie: people farre more accursed then Pagans, for they hold a kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and by the working of nature deale charitablie with their neighbours.</p>
                     <p>But the reprobate Atheists contemne all religion, feare no God, and although they faine to please all men, yet they trulie loue not their owne kindred: for bee it to depose their Soueraigne, to spoile their Countrie, and to murther their dearest friendes, if they see likelihood in thier Treasons, they giue consent, if hope of aduauncement, they first set hand to their sword. But you monsters of humanitie, that are drunken with the strength of your owne wittes, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with the hopefull successe of your pollicies, esteeme it for sound counsaile that I giue you to vnderstande, that the eternal God, whom you neither feare, loue, nor do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, seeth all your wicked pollicies in his vengeance, and frustrateth them with his mercie, he searcheth the reines and <note place="margin">Ierom. 27.

If you dig a pit to burie the innocent, looke to fall into it your selues: if you rayse a gallowes to hang them, be you sure, that you shall suffer thereupon: if you edge your sword to pearce
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:11964:111"/>
their hearts: trust to it your own intrailes will be the sheath thereof. What you doe, or would doe vnto them, shalbe done vnto you. <hi>Hamon</hi> set vp a payre of gallowes to hang <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> the <hi>Iew,</hi> and he and his tenne sonnes, did die thereon. The false Iudges that sought the life of chast <hi>Susanna,</hi> were themselues stoned to death. <hi>Adonibezek</hi> that had cut off the thombes and great toes of thrée score and tenne kings, &amp; had fedde them with Crombes vnder his table, being taken in battaile by <hi>Iuda</hi> chiefe of the Army of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> had his own hands &amp; toes cut off, who confessing that God had done by him as he did by others, miserably died. If you <hi>Atheists</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not these examples in scriptures because you studie not <note place="margin">Profane exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Atheists punished.</note> the sacred Bible, looke into the examples of prophane Crona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and histories of time, from whence you fetch you pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies and cunning experiments: and you shall sée in all ages, howe God returned the mischiefes of the wicked, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their owne bowels. <hi>Diomede</hi> fedde his horses with the flesh of men, and <hi>Hercules</hi> made <hi>Diomede</hi> foode for his owne Horses. <hi>Arnutius Peterculus</hi> hearing that the tyrant <hi>Amylius</hi> offered great rewards to him that coulde deuise any new kind of torture, presented the tyrant with a brasen horse, that he had inuented. <hi>Amilius</hi> iust in this cruelty, made him first to suffer the pains which he had prepared for others. The like was the rewarde of <hi>Perillus,</hi> who presented the tyrant <hi>Phalaris</hi> with a Bul, which being heate with fire, with the outcrie of the poore patients woulde bellowe like a Bull. <hi>Apius Claudius</hi> called the prisons the proper houses of the poore people, but he himselfe by the commaundement of the Tribune of the people, was throwen into prison, where hée died among théeues and murtherers. The Emperour <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi> was a notable <hi>Atheist,</hi> and woulde in his vngodly acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alwayes dispight the Gods, but in the end as <hi>Sweronius</hi> testifieth, hée durst not repose in the night, he was so terrified with horrible visions, and he that so boldly misprised the gods at the smallest lightning and clap of thunder, would in the night, hide himselfe vnder bedde, and in the day, in the most

obscure corner, in fine, he was violentlie slaine by <hi>Chereus, Cornelius, Sabin,</hi> and other theyr confederates.

theyr pollicies are the halters that strangle most of theyr fellowes: if folly (for ouerwéening wit is no better) made them not dronken, they woulde not be so mad to rayse theyr aduancement vppon the ouerthrowe of Princes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales. The Auncients say that they must ouercome a great manie enimies, as enuie, detraction, suspect, &amp;c. and must step vp with oportunitie in a pleasing houre, that shall by any meanes obtaine the least fauour of a Prince. Through how many millions of dangers then must he runne, that by his single pollicie and strength laboreth to plucke a Prince from his throne? through more then the most of these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists can passe by the halfe, and he that with desired opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie arriueth vnto his purpose, by common destinic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth not without destruction. <hi>Salomon</hi> sayth, <hi>that there</hi>
