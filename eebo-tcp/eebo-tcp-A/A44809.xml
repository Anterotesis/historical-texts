            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO all you called, chosen, elected and beloved of the Lord, who are of the circumcision made without hands, of the feed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> who are <hi>Jewes</hi> indeed nor after the flesh but in the spirit; unto whom belongs the euerlasting promise and couenant, whom God hath and is fulfilling in you, so establishing with you: We your fellow-Citizens of the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem</hi> which is the mother of us all; and of the same body, and of the same seed, and same birth, begotten and brought forth by the immortall word of life which lives for ever, do send greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and doe embrace you in the arms of our beloued, who
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45608:2"/>
is and is to come God blessed for ever; you who are called Quakers: who are so not onely in word nor in shew, but in life and in power: whom God hath called and chosen to place his name in, and to take up his habitation among: above all the families of the Earth the Tabernacle of God is with you, and his dwelling-place is among you, and only among you is God known, and his name is great in your Assemblies.</p>
            <p>We who are of the same root and off-spring, doth bring in our witness, and doth set to our seale, That God of a truth is with you and among you: and he is the God of the living that answers by fire: he is <hi>I am,</hi> and there is none besides him: the first and the last, the beginning and the end of all things.</p>
            <p>Praise him for ever yee redeemed of him: lift up your heads your Redeemer is come: clap your hands and shout for ioy, and let the everlasting praises of God be in your mouths for ever and ever. Exalt yee his name above all Gods, and glorifie him in the sight of all the Heathen and let his marvellous works stand upon Record from generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to generation.</p>
            <p>Wonderfull hath his work been among you, and that my soule knowes right well: You that were scattered in thecloudy and dark day, and were a prey for the wild beasts of the Forrest, and were driven away as lost sheep in the wilderness, hath God gathered into the fould, to lay down by the springs of living water in fat pastures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
            <p>Your bread is sure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and your waters never failes: a feast of fat things is made unto you, of wines well refined: the Lord is become the Lot of your inheritance, and the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Cup for ever:</p>
            <p>Your Crowns have you laid down at the feet of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45608:2"/>
Lamb: and your lives and liberties have not been dear unto you: and let this never repent you, for now the Lord will exalt you and Crown you with immortall glory The everlasting day star is risen among you, which gives light unto the Nations: and the light of the Sun is as the light of seven dayes: and there is no need of a candle in your dwelling, but the Lamb is the light thereof; faire as the Sun, and clear as the Moon: yea it is he which was dead, and is alive, and behold he lives for evermore. Praise him all ye people, praise ye him ye holy Host, let all that hath breath praise him for ever. VVho can expresse his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acts? and who can declare his wondrous works? Oh my soule is ravished, and my heart is overcome; let me speak that I may be refreshed, and let me declare his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders among all people.</p>
            <p>The Lord is our King, our Judge, and our Law-giver, and our Rock of defence; Just is he in his Judgements, who hath avenged us of our Enemies: Mercy and Judgement meet, righteousnesse and peace doth embrace each other: Rejoyce for evermore ye Saints of the most High, and tell it to your Children, that they may tell it to another Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, what hath the Lord wrought among you, and what hath his hand brought to passe. Salvation is come, and plenteous Redemption, and the dead hath heard the voyce of the Son of God and liveth.</p>
            <p>Let sorrow and mourning, fly away, and be ye comforted ye that have mourned, and be ye refreshed ye that have been weary; for God hath opened the everlasting fountain, and the streams runs pleasantly, which refresheth the City of our God. He is come and his reward is with him, even he for whom we have waited, this is he who is our life, our peace and our exceeding great reward; the light of the world our Saviour, but the worlds condemner; our peace

but the worlds torment: glad tidings, glad tidings, the acceptable year is come: praise ye the Lord ye Sons and daughters of <hi>Sion,</hi> beautifull is your dwelling place, and aboundeth with pleasant fruit, for you are digged and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and enclosed a Garden of lovely branches: let the wonders of the Lord never be forgotten, nor his works ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer passe out of your remembrance, for he hath wounded and healed, killed and made aliue, raised the dead and slain the liuing, brought out of captiuity and bound with chains, gathered and scattered, brought low and exalted, saved, and condemned; all this hath your eye seen, and your ear heard: and the Heavens and the Earth hath been burned as a scroule, and the indignation of the Lord you have born: But the winter is past, and the summer is come, and the Turtle dove, and the singing of Birds is heard in our Land. O magnifie his name for ever; you are made vessels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour wherein the everlasting treasure abideth, which never waxeth old: the voyce of the Bridegroom is heard among you, and how can you have any more sorrow: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of weeping reioycing, and instead of heauinesse of heart fullness of euerlasting joy: the Lord hath fulfilled his promise, and made good his word, and his Law and Couenant is with you: and from you doth the Law goe forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the powerfull word of life, and death soundeth out of your dwelling, and you are Gods only witnesses to testifie of him in the presence of all Nations, some of you by suffering, and some by declaring: Oh endless loue, and life, and riches, an eternall Crown is upon your heads, and your suffering (which hath not been a little) is not worthy to be compared with the glory that is and shal be reuealed. I speak to you who hath an ear, to hear, my soule and heart is comforted in you, in the midst of my burdens and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, who is separated from you outwardly, yet ioyned
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45608:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and united to you by the Spirit which is unlimited, which all Nations doth comprehend: yea I behold your beauty a far off and my heart is ravished withit, and I am sick of love: let his works praise him for ever, which hee hath wrought, for his dwelling is with you in the light unto which no mortall eye can approach.</p>
            <p>The new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is come down from Heaven, and no unclean can enter: but you are made white with the blood of the Lamb, and purged as silver, and purified as gold in the burning and unto you an entrance is given, and the way is prepared, and the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made her self ready, and the way of the Lord is pleasant to you, and his commands are not grievous; no unclean thing can passe over, nor no Lyons whelps can tread therein, but it is called the way of holinesse, where only the ransomed of the Lord do walk; even your mountain is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished upon the top of all hills, and all Nations shall flow unto it. Sing praises for ever, for the kingdome of endless peace is come, which passeth understaning, and of glory, which no mortall eye can behold, and of life which no flesh can live in. Oh my beloved, come up hither and I will shew you what God hath done for you, he hath rebuked the Sea and driven back the floods of waters which compassed you about, &amp; he hath scattered your enemies with a whirlwind and he hath given you to feed upon the flesh of Kings, and of Captaines. Can you call to mind the doings of your God, and his marvellous works brought to passe, and not cry out in praises for evermore; O drink and be refreshed, and eat and be satisfied for ever, and let your soul delight it self in fatness; the planting of the Lord you are, and his own purchased possession, he hath separated you from the womb, and hath called you out of kindreds, and ye are the Royall seed, of the off-spring of the Lord Almighty, and all Nations shall call you blessed,</p>

And O thou North of England, who art counted as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate and barren, and reckoned the least of the Nations, yet out of thee did the branch spring, and the Star arise which gives light unto all the Regions round about; in thee the Son of Righteousness appeared, with wounding and with healing: and out of thee the terror of the <hi>Lord</hi> proceeded, which makes the earth to tremble and be removed: out of thee Kings, Princes &amp; Prophets did come forth in the name and power of the most High, which uttered their voyces as thunders, and laid their swords on the neck of their enemies and never returned empty from the slaughter. Though I be as by the waters of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in a strange land; and as a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim and Stranger destitute, but not forsaken; as dying, but behold I live: yet if I forget thee let my right hand forget her cunning, and let my name be blotted out of the book of life. O how I love the holy seed which in my eye is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous! no man can hinder my boasting of thee, for I am sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led among you in the Record of eternal life, to bee read among you in the light where I am known to you, and where my unity stands with you in the love and life, which never changes, and you are my mother and my brother and sister who doth the will of my Father. Our God is a consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, and his habitation is compast about with dread and terror. The Heathen shall see and fear, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth shall tremble; our God is everlasting burnings, and it is tempestuous round about his throne, and he reignes for evermore; and though thou be despised and set at nought and counted as the off-scouring of all things, and the scorn of the Heathen, yet thy King reigns upon Mount Sion, and if he utter his voice all flesh shall tremble, and before him thy adversaries shall fall, and thy persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors shall be confounded, for thou shalt never be forgotten of thy God, but with his arm wil he defend thee, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45608:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thee about, and thy seed shall be increased, and thou <hi>Ierusalem</hi> shalt be made the praise of the whole earth, for among you is laid the sure foundation, and the tryed stone, Christ Jesus the light of the world, upon whom you have believed, which unto the Nations is a stumbling stone; but unto you precious: bring in your testimony, and set to your seal; is there salvation in any other, but in him who is the light of the world? nay there is no redemption wrought but by him, nor no deliverance but through him; his is the Kingdome, the Power and the glory, and he is become all in all; and you are no more of this world, but are of the chosen generation, and of the royal Priesthood, a people, Redeemed, unto whom there is none like among the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> whose <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Lord,</hi> whose Saviour is the Prince of Righteousness, who covers your heads in the day of Battel; and smites your enemies in the hinder parts; and wounds them in the fore-head.</p>
            <p>And now my beloved, let his name be had in remembrance for evermore, and let his praises be declared throughout Ages to come, and walk you worthy of his everlasting love, wherewith he hath loved you more then your brethren; let his name be exalted by righteousness, by purity, and by a blameless life, and bring forth the fruits of righteousness and peace, and let yout light shine forth into the world, and your good works abound plentifully, for you are as a City set on a hill, and as a lighted candle to shine abroad; and are created unto good works. Let faith, hope, love and unity be increased among you; and let mercy and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and equity flow down and be established for ever; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be removed. Let joy, and long-suffering and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and temperance spring out; and be you perfect as your heavenly father is perfect.</p>

            <p>O beloved ones, who are the children of my eternall father, who have eaten at his Table, and drunken of the new wine in the Kingdome of God, who are nourished &amp; dand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he lap of everlasting love, who suck at the breasts of everlasting consolation: your beauty is comely I am ravished I am filled, Iam filled with love to you all, I am sick of love: your beauty hath ravished my heart: come sit down my dear Lambs together in the fold where no wolf can come, and let us rejoyce together, and sound forth his praise who hath washed us and cleansed us and covered us, and made us worthy to enter into the fold the Bride-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to eat with him of the bread of life for ever, at the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Table of life; the Bridegroom is come friends, of him I know you rejoyce greatly because of his voice. And now my deer beloved ones, follow him for evermore in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal light and life where we were bred, brought forth and nourished, and are unknown to all the world; but me you know, and I know you in one who is the condemnation of the world, and in him <hi>I</hi> meet you and leave you in his arms <hi>I</hi> lie down with you in the bosome of eternal love, life, peace, joy and rest for ever, where none can make us afraid</p>
