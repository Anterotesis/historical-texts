         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How with his lofty God-like Meen would the

Duty: Where were thy Thundring Firey Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of certain Death? Whose bellowing loud
reproaches had made the amaz'd Invader blush
and shrink, or tamely stand the Victim of thy
just displeasure: But why do I thus rudely Chide
my only constant Friend and great Protector:
Thy manly Soul unus'd to poor clandestine ways
to Victory, was like my poor <hi>Lycogenes</hi> and me
securely wrapt in virtuous Innocence, while the
poor Thief contriv'd and basely stole a cheap and
easie Conquest. But surely Providence has well
design'd, at least to enlarge brave <hi>Polydorus</hi>
Fame: 'Tis left for none but thee great Prince
to retrieve what poor <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> alas! could not
prevent; remember then what's owing to thy
honour, think thou'rt the great Protector of the
Pagan World: What shall I plead for injur'd
Innocence and Sacred Majesty profan'd? And

own the justice of my Love and my Pretensions,
now my kind Starrs have given a blest occasion
to vindicate my long neglected Vows, and now
my feeble contemplative Sighs (which yet, till

Rage, and makes it dwindle into slavish Flatterys:
Sometimes with noble pity she laments their rash
unthinking Zeal, and with officious Charity,
would press Favours the Gods alone beside can
offer, which, curs'd ungrateful Brutes, they
rudely slight and disavow. Prepare my lovely
charming Queen prepare, leave that unhappy

Good, till thy more powerful Rayes warm'd
their cold heavy Spirits, and with thy proper
Stock, didst first enlarge their narrow Stores of

I should have blush'd to have Sign'd this poor
mean tender of my Faith and Love, otherwise
than with my last dear Drops of Bloud: No my
Royal Mistress, I had n'er surviv'd the unhappy
Tidings of your forc'd departure, but that my
high-flown Soul, sure by Prophetick Rage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd,
bid me not only live, but hope I should
at least revenge these barbarous Affronts offer'd
to sacred Majesty: Yes most illustrous Princess.
there is yet more than a glimmering hope of
our Success; the Gods indeed can be severe, but
not unjust, and though your Rebel Slaves may
boast some small Success against your juster
Arms, yet Providence in kindness, has reserv'd
whole Bands of Valiant <hi>Iberian</hi> Slaves, whose
Loyalty shall prove the Rebels Scourge, and
brand the name of <hi>Albion</hi> for ever: Oh! Then
my dear lov'd Mistress do not grieve, this little
gust of seeming happiness, which yet your Foes
do so much magnifie, shall like some fatal Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilential
Air return, and prove the Plague of all
their curs'd Posterity; those specious names of
boasted <hi>Liberty, Religion, Property,</hi> &amp;c. They so
much urge, and which are still the Harbingers
of their intended Villainies, shall soon be expos'd
to a Test they'l never bear; and like the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
Dross cast out for ever. Think mighty
Princess as thou goest, how dearly they must pay
(and quickly too) for this poor short-liv'd Scene
of fading Glory; Look back on that presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
spot of Land, and pity its unbridled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45818:8"/>
that like some little out-cast from its

Head, and vainly would give Law to both her
Benefactors; poor feeble Vermin, whose mean
obscurity hath hitherto been their only preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
when mighty <hi>Polydorus,</hi> that Lord and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate
of more than half the solid Continent,
shall once vouchsafe to bring his conquering
Arms against them, how then will they seek for
Royal <hi>Messalina</hi>'s Favour, and from her media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
only shall have leave to live, adore, and
boast of Slavery: But why, my lovely Queen,
should we disturb great <hi>Polydorus</hi>'s more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Conquests, send but that Royal Pledge of all
our future happiness, that little Hero of the <hi>Albion</hi>
World, the <hi>Cambrian</hi> Prince, him, as the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
once their Infant King, we will with Loyal

Hark how the Winds do gently fan my Sails, and

they spend their time between the glimerings of

Stranger been to those soft Pleasures which serve

had power to heal the fatal Wound your pointed
Lightning gave; my too, too tender heart do's
still retain the impression which your early
Beauty's made, my aspiring hopes, though in
disguise, did still pursue the wandring Steps of
their lov'd cruel Object, resolv'd like valliant
Warriors n'er to yield to the suggestions of a faint
despair: No mighty Princess, <hi>Polydorus</hi> heart,
in Love as well as War's Invincible, those Charms
which once my greedy Eyes suck'd in, and run
with speed to inform my amazed heart; those
dazling Charms I say do still imploy my anxious

absence otherwise allay or stop the rage of my
devouriug Flames, than just to allow my pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
heart a breathing, which now your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
has again enflam'd; and by the addition
of diviner Beautys (which hitherto your cruel
cunning had reserv'd) as it were by Ambush,
my unwary Eyes surpriz'd, and fix'd me now
your everlasting Slave: Yes mighty Nymph,
I do not blush to own I am totally Subdu'd:
Your never erring Shafts have found an easie
passage to my yielding Soul, and now the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Poyson trills through every Vein, through

then my loud tongu'd Wrongs serve for harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Musick in thy Ears? Are then my Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

Ah ! faithless Prince, are thus my mighty hopes

Cast into the utter Regions of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and 'twere a Crime indeed to
think those lovely Eyes and Heavenly
look's, which surely are the Fountains
of all Life, could change their wonted
Natures, and effect a power of killing
all their humble Votaries, and that
come with pious Zeal to kneel before them:
Kind Heaven allows the meanest Wretch
on Earth to come and bring his Mite of

Incense with him, let also thy Divinity vouchfase
to accept the adorations of thy Slaves, and if
from any offerings they bring, there's any dare
presume to a reward, vouchfase thy <hi>Polydorus</hi>
then to plead, who brings with him a heart sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
true, and if by man thy love may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
will prove it self not most unworthy thy
Protection.</p>

he made me in order to take measures for his speedy

not be insensible how the urgency of my own affairs
(which I havs just reason to apprehend will grow ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thick and difficult upon me) have put some restraint
on my resolutions to have equipp'd him for a descent

to give some way to the present brunt, and
form such considerable Forces, in the mean time, in

our Designs; and though the Iustice of his Cause,
his own Personal Valour, and the formidable assistance
he will have with him, may justly take away all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of failure, yet I can never look on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of his designs, other than the result of my
adorable Queens Prayers, and it were a sort of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to question the success, when so prevalent a Saint

            <p>WHY should my lovely Queen, with fear and
frivolous disputes, thus aggravavate, at
least, continue the sorrowful remembrance of her
past misfortunes? Why are those eyes, where
charming <hi>Cupids</hi> should disport, and in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Sun-shine bask and play, with Pearly
melancholly showers o'rewhelm'd? Why should
the memory of a quite spent Storm, drown all
her hopes of future happy days? Revive, revive,
dear charming Saint, and think the worth of these
most precious drops, have far out-bid all that
malicious Fortune can impart: Why should thy
blooming Beauties fall a Sacrifice to the faint
pleasures of unfortunate <hi>Lycogenes</hi>'s Crown? If
'tis Ambition fills thy lofty Soul, if Rule, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
Empire be thy aim, look on some glorious
Diadem, that may sit bright and easie on thy
brow; think of that Kingdom which the united
strength of all the well-known World can scarce
disturb, much less subdue. If numerous atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
be thy care, think of that place whether
all the universe do flock, and with officious
pomp should wait thy every Motion, let not the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45818:18"/>
narrow bounds of one weak barren Isle press
thy capacious thoughts, but think when thou
hast <hi>Polydorus</hi> in thy Arms, thou hast, like <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>
once, the Lord and Arbiter of even more
than <hi>Caesars</hi> World, why should thy lofty and
unbounded Soul, stoop to the mouldy prescripts
of doting feeble Age, or which is worse of crafty
whining Priests: Great Monarchs to themselves
should be a Rule, and virtues from <hi>their wills</hi>
should have their Denominations, 'tis fit that
poor Plebeian Souls should stoop and learn,
while every action of their Prince should be,
as an infallible director; Duty, Religion,
Conscience are but names Preach'd up to keep
the otherwise Tumultuous World in order,
Honour a meer fantastick spright is urg'd, only
to hint discretion in our actions, and so preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve

'tis utter Blasphemy to think the Gods should

               </gap>vch infinity, only for us to
gaze on, not to use, and 'tis as bad to think
such multiplicity for every chooser they would
give, that we should niggardly our selves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
to one, and that perhaps misguided choice,
oh no, my lovely Queen, let's pluck and Eat
was the opinion of our first wise Parents: Let
not thy Roses, that with beauteous sweetness
lift up their blushing Cheeks, as if asham'd to
hang so long neglected on their yielding Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
fall murmuring as 'twere to the ground,
and pine away to melancholly paleness, think
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45818:19"/>
that one hour thou losest now of Life, carries
an Age of Youth and Beauty with it. Time, on
the foolish and deformed, sometimes may be
said justly to attend and wait, but Beauty,
Youth, and Wit, have no spare hours; each
minute, with a hasty soot, steps on, and leaves
the unwary gazer in confusion. Let's then, my
lovely Queen, in time repent; let's not provoke
the angry Boy too long, those Darts which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
he Shot were dip't in Juice of fresh
pluck'd Roses, fragrant Oyntments, if there
which easie fly do fail to warn us, let's beware,
his deadly Poyson'd shafts, stand ready bent
and fixt for fatal Execution. Come, let me
fly then to thy out spread Arms, let me em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
thy tender Snowy Limbs: Oh! let me
Suck that Balmy Cordial Breath, kiss, kiss,
thy rolling Dying Eyes, and ravish all thy
Beauties. Come, let me print young <hi>Cupids</hi> on
thy Lips, and Kiss them into Life, and warm
perfection. Oh, the Transporting Joys! Oh,
extasy of happiness! If such the thoughts, so kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be the dreams of what my panting soul longs
to enjoy, how shall I bear the essence of my
joys? The substance will orewhelm my fainting
Spirits, if thus the fleating shadows can tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport.
No, do not, do not grant, frown, storm,
complain, and call whole Troops of armed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
to thy guard! Tell me of honour, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
civility, and thunder loudly in my ears,
threaten disdain, scorn, and dire revenge, if ever
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45818:19"/>
I attempt, nay ask it of thee, do this and more, and
think too thou art kind for sure the joy must needs be
more than Sensible Man can bear. But oh! the weak
resolves and poor designs of Hearts bound up in magick
Chains of Love, were but thy lovely Arms once spread,
did but thy wishing eyes with one dear languet call
thy <hi>Polydorus</hi> to thy Breast: Were Serpents basilisks
Mountains of Fire, or fury's with their grizly looks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween,
and dar'd to interpose and stop my ready passage
to my Queen: Gods! with what fury would I cut along,
Arm'd with powerful Love, would meteor like glide
through their thickest fury: No, no, my Princess I did
vainly rave, 'twas lovesick folly, if thou would'st have
thy <hi>Polydorus</hi> live, look with compassion on his wounded
Heart, and gently breath new life into his almost cold
desparing Soul; warm now with gentle fires his Dying
Spirits, and think it not the least of all thy glory's, if in
the counting up thy numerous conquests, thou canst
with unexampled pride relate, the gift of Life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
to mighty <hi>Polydorus.</hi>

            <p>WHAT shall I do thou Universal Conquerour,
whether shall I retire to hide me from the danger
of thy all powerful Love; oh! thou subtile, invincible
deceiver of our Sex: By what strange magick is't thou
thus do'st draw, even the most wary, nice resisting hearts
with, within the plainly dangerous Circle of thy alluring
Tongue, oh! Virtue, Conscience, Duty now defend me,
come now Exert your utmost power and force, for less
than your united strength will ne're repel, those vigorous
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45818:20"/>
attacques are made against me: No, no alas, my Feeble
Panting Heart, proves me already more than half o're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and though some Sparks of innate Courage yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
which vainly would support, and prompt my fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Spirits, yet Fate, and Godlike <hi>Polydorus</hi> Charms;
which never sure knew pitty or repulse, come thronging
into my forsaken Breast, rifling each corner with a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Pride; and lead my now defenceless Heart in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.
Yes, yes, Great Conquerour, I see thy power;
and now can wonder at my own Resistance, now I can
see thy Dear commanding Charms, thy winning Graces,
now I can hear and with Emphatick skill distinguish each
accent of thy sweet Harmonious voice; now I can stand
and with amazing silence hearken to the persuasive Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick
of thy Tongue, each look, each word and action
new supply fresh matter to my Love and Admiration;
now I can Smile and pitty those poor Hearts who with
all heat and eagerness pursue, and toil for the dull fading
toys and pleasures of Riches; Popular applause and
Glory. Ah poor mistaken wretches, did they but know
those worlds of pleasures, I in Love enjoy, how soon
they'd quit those weak unworthy trifles, (which they, as
drowning men catch hold of Straws with blind, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
zeal pursue) and strive with eagerness to grasp
the solid never-failing Rocks of Love and Pleasure: Yes
<hi>Polydorus,</hi> I am grown a wonderful proficient in thy Art,
thy generous Rules do so convince and move, have had
so powerful an influence o're my Soul, that I can now
with pleasure hear thee plead, and teach the wondrous
precepts of all knowing Love, I now without a groan, or
figh can hear a doleful tale, of Kingdoms lost and Kings De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron'd,
unmov'd I stand when some State Polititian,
needs will tell of Tumults, Rebels, Wars and Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
alas all these stand on the slippery precipice of
Fate or chance; and since without our power, why should
we grieve: 'Tis true good manners and Civility exact my
wishes for <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> the Gods themselves can witness
how my Prayers go up with equal zeal for him as me, but
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45818:20"/>
yet kind Nature wisely did ordain self preservation always
should take place; and since the circumstances of my
Fate deny, all other Succour than my vows and Prayers,
the World can never dare condemn that care; (Nature
and Providence allow and teach) I take to mitigate the
smart and pain of my almost incurable misfortunes, yes
this alone might well be thought a Plea sufficient, even
for an erring faulty Love, but when I think I only make
returns (poor as they are) to the Divine unvalluable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Godlike <hi>Polydorus,</hi> my Love seems then to claim
Regeneration, is Sanctified, and rises free from all impure
contraminations: Take then my Heart thou only brave
great man, take to thy self that Heart which Fate by a
thousand signal circumstances has declared was from the
first design'd for thee; and thee alone, and surely thou
dost best deserve that treasure, who best know'st how to
value it. 'Tis true, I had even from my own <hi>Lycogenes</hi>
something of zealous formal Reverence, a blind obedience
whensoe're I call'd, he with all Dutiful submission paid
but yet methought 'twas such a timerous zeal, as Servants
pay to their commanding Lords, my haughty Geniu
foro'd a just compliance, but yet it look'd like Duty more
than Love, and where the payment is but just our due
there's left but little Room for thanks or Praise. Beauty
like puny Stomachs should be brib'd with Picquant Sauces
and provocatives, nor should they ever wait the leavy

my little <hi>Cambrian</hi> Prince, just now attends me, and by a
