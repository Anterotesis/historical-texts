            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A PREFACE
To the ensuing TREATISE,
Shewing the Necessity of Caring
for the Soul.</head>
                  <p>§ 1. THE only intent of this ensuing
<hi>Treatise,</hi> is to be a short &amp; plain
direction to the very meanest
<hi>Readers,</hi> to behave themselves
so in <hi>this</hi> world, that they may be <hi>happy</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the <hi>next.</hi> But because 'tis in vain to
tell men their <hi>duties,</hi> till they be perswaded of
the necessity of performing it; I shall, before I
proceed to the <hi>particulars required</hi> of every
<hi>Christian,</hi> endeavour to win them to the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>
of one <hi>general</hi> duty <hi>preparatory</hi> to all
the rest, and that is the <hi>consideration</hi> and <hi>care</hi>
of their own <hi>Souls,</hi> without which they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
think themselves much <hi>concern'd</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Man,</hi> We know is made up of <hi>two</hi> parts,
a <hi>body</hi> and a <hi>soul:</hi> The body only the husk or
shell of the <hi>soul,</hi> a lump of <hi>flesh,</hi> subject to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>diseases</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> while it lives, and at
last to <hi>death</hi> it self, and then 'tis so far from
being <hi>valued,</hi> that 'tis not to be endured <hi>above</hi>
ground, but layed to <hi>rott</hi> in the <hi>Earth.</hi> Yet to
<pb facs="tcp:96830:8"/>
this viler part of us we perform a great deal of
<hi>care,</hi> all the labour and toil we are at, is to
maintain that. But the more <hi>precious</hi> part,
the <hi>Soul</hi> is little thought of, no <hi>care</hi> taken, how
it fares, but as if it were a thing that <hi>nothing</hi>
concerned us, is left quite neglected, never consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
by us.</p>
                  <p>3. This <hi>carelesnesse</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> is the root
of all the <hi>sin</hi> we commit, and therefore whosoever
intends to set upon a <hi>Christian</hi> course, must in
the <hi>first</hi> place amend that. To the doing wherof,
there needs no deep <hi>learning,</hi> or extraordinary
parts, the simplest man living (that is not a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
fool</hi>) hath <hi>understanding</hi> enough for it,
if he will but act in this by the same <hi>rules</hi> of
<hi>common</hi> reason, whereby he proceeds in his
<hi>worldly</hi> business. I will therefore now briefly
set down some of those <hi>motives,</hi> which use to stir
up our <hi>care</hi> of any <hi>outward</hi> thing, and then apply
them to the <hi>Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. There be <hi>four</hi> things especially, which use
to <hi>awake</hi> our <hi>care,</hi> the <hi>first</hi> is the <hi>worth</hi> of the
thing, the <hi>second</hi> the <hi>usefulnesse</hi> of it to us, when
we cannot part with it without great <hi>damage</hi>
and mischief, the <hi>third</hi> the great <hi>danger</hi> of it, &amp;
the <hi>fourth</hi> the <hi>likelyhood</hi> that our <hi>care</hi> will not
be in <hi>vain</hi> but that it will <hi>preserve</hi> the thing
<hi>cared</hi> for.</p>
                  <p>5. For the first,<note place="margin">The worth of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ul.</note> we know our <hi>care</hi> of any
<hi>worldly</hi> thing is answerable to the <hi>worth</hi> of it;
What is of greatest price, we are most <hi>watchful</hi>
to <hi>preserve,</hi> and most <hi>fearful</hi> to lose; no man locks
up <hi>dung</hi> in his <hi>chest,</hi> but his <hi>money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> or what he
<pb facs="tcp:96830:8"/>
counts <hi>precious,</hi> he doth. Now in this respect the
<hi>Soul</hi> deserves more <hi>care,</hi> then all the things in
the world besides, for 'tis infinitly more <hi>worth.</hi>
First in that is made after the <hi>image</hi> of God;
it was <hi>God</hi> that <hi>breathed into man this breath
of life; Gen</hi> 27. Now <hi>God</hi> being of the greatest
<hi>excellency,</hi> and worth, the more any thing is <hi>like</hi>
him, the more it is to be <hi>valued.</hi> But 'tis sure that
no <hi>creature</hi> upon the earth is at all like <hi>God,</hi>
but the <hi>Soul</hi> of man, and therefore nothing ought
to have so much of our <hi>care. Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi>
never <hi>dies.</hi> We use to <hi>prize</hi> things according to
their <hi>durablenesse:</hi> what is most <hi>lasting,</hi> is most
<hi>worth.</hi> Now the <hi>Soul</hi> is a thing that will last for
<hi>ever,</hi> when <hi>Wealth, Beauty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Strength,</hi> nay our
very <hi>bodies</hi> themselves fade <hi>away,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> still
continues. Therefore in that respect also, the <hi>Soul</hi>
is of the greatest <hi>worth;</hi> and then what strange
<hi>madnesse</hi> is it for us to neglect them as we do?
We can spend <hi>Days,</hi> and <hi>Weekes,</hi> and <hi>Moneths</hi>
and <hi>Years,</hi> nay our whole <hi>lives</hi> in hunting after
a little <hi>wealth</hi> of this world, which is of no
<hi>durance</hi> or <hi>continuance,</hi>

                  </p>

them: But if we are in <hi>danger</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:96830:9"/>
lose our <hi>eyes</hi> or <hi>limbs,</hi> we think all the care we
can take little enough to prevent it, because we
know it will be a great <hi>misery.</hi> But certainly
there is no <hi>misery</hi> to be <hi>compared</hi> to that <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
that followes the losse of the <hi>Soul.</hi> 'Tis
true we cannot lose our <hi>Souls,</hi> in one sense, that
is so lose them, that they shall cease to be; but we
may so <hi>lose</hi> them in another, that we shall wish to
<hi>lose</hi> them even in that. That is we may lose
that <hi>happy</hi> estate, to which they were created,
and plunge them into the <hi>extremest</hi> misery. In
a word we may lose them in <hi>Hell,</hi> whence there
is no fetching them back, and so they are lost
for ever. Nay in this consideration our very
<hi>bodies</hi> are concerned, those darlings of ours,
for which all our <hi>care</hi> is layed out: for they must
certainly after death be raised again, and be
joyned again to the <hi>soul,</hi> and take part with it in
whatever state; if then our care for the <hi>body</hi>
take up all our <hi>time</hi> and <hi>thoughts,</hi> and leave
us none to bestow on the poor <hi>Soul,</hi> it is sure
the <hi>Soul</hi> will for want of that care, be made
for ever <hi>miserable.</hi> But it is as sure, that that
very <hi>body</hi> must be so too. And therefore if you
have any true <hi>kindnesse</hi> to your <hi>body,</hi> shew it
by taking care of your <hi>Souls.</hi> Think with your
selves, how you will be able to endure <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
burnings,</hi> if a small spark of <hi>fire,</hi> light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the least part of the <hi>body,</hi> be so intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
what will it be to have the whole cast into
the hottest <hi>flames?</hi> and that not for some <hi>few
howres</hi> or <hi>days,</hi> but <hi>for ever;</hi> so that when you
have spent many <hi>thousand</hi> of years in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
<pb facs="tcp:96830:9"/>
torment, you shall be no neerer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

out of it, then you were the first day you
went in: think of this, I say, and think this
withall, that this will certainly be the end of
neglecting the <hi>Soul,</hi> and therefore afford it some
care, if it be but in pity to the <hi>body,</hi> that must
bear a <hi>part</hi> in its <hi>miseries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. The <hi>third Motive</hi> to the care of any thing,<note place="margin">The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the soul is in.</note>
is its being in <hi>danger;</hi> now a thing may be in
<hi>danger</hi> two wayes, first by <hi>enemies</hi> from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
This is the case of the <hi>sheep,</hi> which is
still in danger of being devoured by <hi>wolves,</hi> and
we know that makes the <hi>Shepheard</hi> so much the
more <hi>watchful</hi> over it. Thus is it with the <hi>soul,</hi>
which is in a great deal of <hi>danger,</hi> in respect of
its <hi>enemies:</hi> Those we know are the <hi>World,</hi>
the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Divel,</hi> which are all such
noted <hi>enemies</hi> to it, that the very first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> act we
do in behalfe of our <hi>Souls,</hi> is to vow a <hi>continual
war</hi> against them. This we all do in our <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism;</hi>
and whoever makes any <hi>truce</hi> with any
of them, is false not only to his <hi>Soul,</hi> but to his
<hi>vow</hi> also, becomes a <hi>forsworn</hi> creature: A
consideration well worthy our laying to <hi>heart,</hi>
But that we may the better understand, what
<hi>danger</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> is in, let us a little consider the
<hi>quality</hi> of these <hi>enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. In a <hi>war</hi> you know there are divers
things that make an enemy <hi>terrible.</hi> The first
is <hi>subtilty,</hi> and <hi>cunning,</hi> by which alone many
<hi>victories</hi> have been won, and in this respect the
<hi>Divel</hi> is a dangerous <hi>adversary,</hi> he long since
gave sufficient proof of his <hi>subtlety,</hi> in beguiling
<pb facs="tcp:96830:10"/>
our first parents, who yet were much wiser then
we are, and therefore no wonder if he <hi>deceive</hi>
and cheat us. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>watchfulness</hi> and
<hi>diligence</hi> of an <hi>enemy,</hi> makes him the more to
be <hi>feared,</hi> and here the <hi>Divel</hi> exceeds, it is his
<hi>trade, business</hi> to destroy us, and he is no loiterer
at it, <hi>he goes up and down seeking whom he
may devour, 1 Pet</hi> 5. 8. He <hi>watches</hi> all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of advantage against us, with such <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,</hi>
that he will be sure never to let any
slip him. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> an <hi>enemy neer</hi> us is more to
be <hi>feared</hi> then one at a <hi>distance;</hi> for if he be far
off, we may have time to <hi>arm,</hi> and <hi>prepare</hi> our
selves against him, but if he be neer he may
<hi>steal</hi> on us unawars. And of this sort is the
<hi>flesh,</hi> it is an <hi>enemy,</hi> at our doors, shall
I say? nay in our <hi>bosoms,</hi> it is always <hi>neer</hi>
us, to take occasion of doing us <hi>mischiefs.
Fourthly,</hi> the <hi>baser</hi> and <hi>falser</hi> an <hi>enemy</hi> is,
the more <hi>dangerous;</hi> he that <hi>hides</hi> his malice
under the shew of <hi>friendship</hi> will be able to do
a great deal the more hurt. And this again
is the <hi>flesh,</hi> which like <hi>Job</hi> to <hi>Abner, 2 Sam.
3. 27:</hi> Pretends to speak <hi>peaceably,</hi> to us,
but <hi>wounds</hi> us to death; 'tis forward to purvey

very <hi>kind,</hi> but it has a <hi>hook</hi> under that <hi>baite,</hi>
and if we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> at it, we are lost. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> the
number of <hi>enemies</hi> make them more <hi>terrible;</hi>
and the <hi>world</hi> is a vast <hi>army</hi> against us: There
is no <hi>state</hi> or <hi>condition</hi> in it, nay scarce a <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
which d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

against the <hi>Soul:</hi> The <hi>honours</hi> of the <hi>world</hi>

seek to <hi>wound</hi> us by <hi>pride,</hi> the <hi>wealth</hi> by <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness;</hi>
the <hi>prosperity</hi> of it tempt us to forget
<hi>God,</hi> the <hi>adversities</hi> to <hi>murmure</hi> at him. Our
very <hi>Table becomes a snare</hi> to us, our meat
draws us to <hi>Gluttony,</hi> our drink to <hi>Drunkeness,</hi>
our <hi>company,</hi> nay our neerest <hi>friends</hi> often bear
a part in this <hi>war</hi> against us, whilest either by
their example, or <hi>perswasions</hi> they intice us to sin</p>
                  <p>9. Consider all this, and then tell me, whether a
<hi>Soul</hi> thus beset hath leisure to <hi>sleep;</hi> even <hi>Dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi>
could tell <hi>Samson,</hi> it was time to awake
when the <hi>Philistims were upon him.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi>
tells us, <hi>if the good man of the house had
known in what hour the thief would come,
he would have watched and not have suffered
his house to be broken up, Mat.</hi> 24 43. But we
live in the midst of <hi>thieves,</hi> and therefore must
look for them every hour, and yet who is there
among us, that hath that common <hi>providence</hi>
for this <hi>precious</hi> part of him, his <hi>Soul,</hi> which
he hath for his <hi>house,</hi> or indeed the <hi>meanest</hi>
thing that belongs to him? I fear our <hi>Souls</hi>
may say to us, as <hi>Christ</hi> to his <hi>disciples. Mat 26.
40. What could ye not watch with me one

                  <p>10. But I told you, there was a <hi>second</hi> way,
whereby a thing may be in <hi>danger,</hi> and that is
from some <hi>disorder,</hi> or <hi>distemper within</hi> it self.
This is often the case of our <hi>bodies,</hi> they are
not only lyable to <hi>outward violence,</hi> but they
are <hi>within</hi> themselves <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>diseased.</hi> And
then we can be sensible enough that they are in
<hi>danger,</hi> and need not to be taught to seek out
for means to <hi>recover</hi> them. But this is also
the case of the <hi>Soul;</hi> we reckon those parts of
the <hi>body diseased,</hi> that do not rightly perform
their <hi>office,</hi> we account it a <hi>sick palate</hi> that
<hi>tastes</hi> not aright, a sick <hi>stomack</hi> that <hi>digests</hi>
not. And thus it is with the <hi>Soul,</hi> its parts do
not rightly perform their <hi>offices.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. The <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> are especially these
three: The <hi>Understanding,</hi> the <hi>Will,</hi> and the
<hi>Affections.</hi> And that these are <hi>disordered,</hi>
there needs little proof; Let any man look seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
into his own <hi>heart,</hi> and consider, how little
it is he knows of <hi>spiritual</hi> things, and then tell
me whether his <hi>understanding</hi> be not dark: How
much apter is he to <hi>will evil</hi> then <hi>good,</hi> and then
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

how strong <hi>desires</hi> he hath after the <hi>pleasures</hi> of
sin, and what <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>faint</hi> ones towards God,
and <hi>goodness,</hi> and then tell me whether his <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
be not <hi>disordered,</hi> and <hi>rebellious</hi> even
against the vice of his own <hi>reason</hi> within him.
Now as in bodily <hi>diseases,</hi> the first step to the
<pb facs="tcp:96830:11"/>
                     <hi>cure</hi> is to know the <hi>cause</hi> of the <hi>sickness,</hi> so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
here it is very <hi>necessary</hi> for us to know how
the <hi>Soul</hi> first fell into this <hi>diseased condition,</hi>
and that I shall now briefly tell you.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>God</hi> created the first man <hi>Adam</hi> without
<hi>sin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The first Covenant.</note> and endued his <hi>Soul</hi> with the full <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi>
of his <hi>duty,</hi> and with such a <hi>strength,</hi> that
he might if he would <hi>perform</hi> all that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of him. Having thus created him, he
maks a <hi>covenant</hi> or agreement with him, to this
purpose, that if he <hi>continued</hi> in <hi>obedience</hi> to
<hi>God,</hi> without committing sin; then first that
<hi>strength</hi> of <hi>Soul,</hi> which he then had should still
be <hi>continued</hi> to him; and <hi>first,</hi> that he
should never dye, but be taken up into <hi>heaven,</hi>
there to be happy for ever. But on the other side,
if he committed sin, and disobeyed <hi>God,</hi> then both
he and all his <hi>children</hi> after him, should lose that
<hi>knowledg</hi> and that <hi>perfect strength,</hi> which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him to do all that <hi>God</hi> required of him; and
<hi>secondly,</hi> should be <hi>subject</hi> to <hi>death,</hi> and not only
so, but to <hi>eternal damnation</hi> in <hi>Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. This was the <hi>agreement</hi> made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
and all <hi>mankind</hi> in him (which we usually
call the <hi>first covenant</hi>) upon which God gave <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
a particular <hi>commandment,</hi> which was no
more but this, that he should not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<hi>tree</hi> of that <hi>garden</hi> wherein he had placed him.
But he by the perswasion of the <hi>Divel</hi>

                     </gap>e lost both the full <hi>knowledg</hi> of
his duty, and the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>performing it.</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:96830:12"/>
we being born after his <hi>image,</hi> did so likewise
and so are become both <hi>ignorant</hi> in discerning
what we ought to do, and <hi>weak</hi> and unable to
the doing of it, having a <hi>backwardnesse</hi> to all
<hi>good,</hi> and an <hi>aptnesse,</hi> and <hi>readiness</hi> to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
like a sick <hi>stomack,</hi> which loaths all <hi>whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi>
food, and longs after such <hi>trash,</hi> as may
nourish the <hi>disease.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. And now you see where we got this
<hi>sicknesse</hi> of <hi>soul,</hi> and <hi>likewise that it is like to</hi>
prove a <hi>deadly</hi> one, and therefore I presume I
need say no more, to assure you our <hi>souls</hi> are in
<hi>danger.</hi> It is more likely you will from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
think them <hi>hoplesse.</hi> But that you may
not from that <hi>conceit,</hi> excuse your <hi>neglect</hi> of
them, I shall hasten to shew you the <hi>contrary,</hi> by
proceeding to the <hi>fourth</hi> motive of care,</p>
                  <p>15. That <hi>fourth motive</hi> is the <hi>liklyhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

that our <hi>care</hi> will not be in <hi>vain,</hi>

this is wanting, it <hi>disheartens</hi> our care. A <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>

in this very respect we have a great deal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

                  <p>17. This <hi>SECOND COVENANT</hi> was made
with <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; us in him, presently after his fall,
&amp; is briefly contained in those <hi>words, Gen.</hi> 3. 15.
Where <hi>God declares that the SEED OF THE
WOMAN SHALL BREAK THE SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENTS
HEAD;</hi> and this was made up, as the
first was, of some <hi>mercies</hi> to be afforded by <hi>God</hi>
and some <hi>duties</hi> to be performed by us.</p>
                  <p>18. <hi>God</hi> therein promises to send his only <hi>Son,</hi>
who is <hi>God equal</hi> with himself, to earth, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>man, like unto us in all things, sin only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,</hi>
and he to do for us these <hi>several</hi> things.</p>
                  <p>19. <hi>First</hi> to make <hi>known</hi> to us the <hi>whole will</hi> of
his <hi>Father,</hi> in the performance whereof we shall
be sure to be <hi>accepted</hi> and <hi>rewarded</hi> by him. And
this was one great part of his <hi>business,</hi> which he
performed in those many <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>precepts,</hi>
we find set down in the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And herein he is
our <hi>prophet,</hi> it being the work of a <hi>prophet</hi> of old
not only to <hi>foretel,</hi> but to <hi>teach.</hi> Our <hi>duty</hi> in this
<hi>particular</hi> is to <hi>hearken</hi> diligently to him, to be
most <hi>ready,</hi> and <hi>desirous</hi> to <hi>learn</hi> that will of
God, which he came from <hi>heaven</hi> to <hi>reveal</hi> to us.
This 2d. thing he was to do for us, was to <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
God</hi> for our <hi>sins,</hi> not only that one of <hi>Adam;</hi>
but all the sins of <hi>all mankind,</hi> that truly <hi>repent</hi>
and amend, &amp; by this means to obtain for us <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness</hi>
of sins, the <hi>favour</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and so to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem</hi>
us from hell, and eternal <hi>damnation</hi> which
was the <hi>punishment</hi> due to our <hi>sin.</hi> All this he
did for us by his <hi>death,</hi> he offered up himself a
<pb facs="tcp:96830:13"/>
sacrifice for the <hi>sins of all those</hi> who heartily
<hi>bewail,</hi> and <hi>forsake</hi> them. And in this he is
our <hi>Priest,</hi> it being the <hi>Priests</hi> office to <hi>offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for the sins of the people.</hi> Our duty
in this <hi>particular</hi> is first truly, and heartily to
<hi>repent</hi> us of, and forsake our <hi>sins,</hi> without
which they will never be <hi>forgiven</hi> us, though
<hi>Christ</hi> have died. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Stedfastly to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
that if we do that, we shall have the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi>
of that <hi>sacrifice</hi> of his, all our sins, how
<hi>many</hi> and <hi>great</hi> soever, shall be <hi>forgiven</hi> us,
and we saved from those <hi>eternal</hi> punishments,
which were due unto us for them: <hi>Another</hi>
part of the <hi>Priests office</hi> was <hi>blessing</hi> and <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
for the <hi>people,</hi> and this also <hi>Christ</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
to us. It was his especial <hi>commission</hi>
from his <hi>Father to bless</hi> us, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> tels us
<hi>Acts 3. 26. God sent his Son Jesus to bless
you,</hi> and the following words shew wherein that
<hi>blessing</hi> consists, <hi>in turning away every one of
you from his iniquity,</hi> those means which he
has used for the <hi>turning</hi> us from our sins, are
to be reckoned of all other the greatest <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,</hi>
and for the other part, shat of <hi>praying,</hi>
that he not only <hi>performed</hi> on <hi>earth,</hi> but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
still to do it in Heaven, <hi>He sits on the right
hand of God and makes Request for us,</hi> Rom. 8,
34. Our <hi>duty</hi> herein is not to resist this unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>blessing</hi> of his, but to be willing to be thus
<hi>blest</hi> in the being <hi>turned from our sins,</hi> and not
to make <hi>void,</hi> and <hi>fruitless</hi> all his <hi>prayers,</hi> and
<hi>intercessions</hi> for us, which will never prevail
for us, whilst we <hi>continue</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p>21. The <hi>third</hi> thing, that <hi>Christ</hi> was to do
<pb facs="tcp:96830:13"/>
for us, was to <hi>enable</hi> us, or <hi>give</hi> us <hi>strength</hi>
to do what <hi>God</hi> requires of us. This he doth
<hi>first</hi> by <hi>taking</hi> off from the <hi>hardness</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi>
given to <hi>Adam,</hi> which was never to <hi>commit</hi> the
least sin, upon pain of <hi>damnation,</hi> and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of us onely an <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>hearty endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>
to do what we are able, and where we fail,
accepting of <hi>sincere repentance. Secondly,</hi>
By sending his <hi>Holy Spirit into our hearts,</hi> to
<hi>govern,</hi> and rule us, to give us strength to
overcome <hi>temptations</hi> to sin and to do all that
he now under the <hi>Gospel</hi> requires of us. And
in this he is our <hi>King,</hi> it being the <hi>office</hi> of a
<hi>King</hi> to <hi>govern,</hi> and rule, &amp; to <hi>subdue</hi> enemies.
Our <hi>duty</hi> in this particular is to give up our
selves <hi>obedient</hi> subjects of his, to be <hi>governed,</hi>
and ruled by him, to <hi>obey</hi> all his <hi>Lawes,</hi> not to
take part with any <hi>Rebel,</hi> that is, not to cherish
any one sin. But diligently to pray for his <hi>grace</hi>
to enable us to <hi>subdue</hi> all, and then carefully to
make use of it to that purpose.</p>
                  <p>22. <hi>Lastly,</hi> He has <hi>purchased</hi> for all that
faithfully <hi>obey</hi> him an <hi>eternal glorious</hi> inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> whether <hi>he is
gone before,</hi> to take <hi>possession</hi> for us. Our
<hi>duty</hi> herein is to be exceeding <hi>careful,</hi> that we
forfeit not our <hi>parts</hi> in it, which we shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
do, if we continue <hi>impenitent</hi> in any sin;
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Not to fasten our <hi>affections</hi> on this
world, but to raise them up, according to the
precept of the Apostle, <hi>Col. 2. 2. Set your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
on things above &amp; not on things on the
earth,</hi> continually longing to come to the <hi>posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of that <hi>blessed</hi> inheritance of ours, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
<pb facs="tcp:96830:14"/>
whereof all things here below should seem <hi>vile</hi>
and mean to us.</p>
                  <p>23. This is the summe of that <hi>second Covenant</hi> we
are now under, wherein you see what <hi>Christ</hi> has done,
how he executes those <hi>three great offices</hi> of <hi>King, Priest</hi>
and <hi>Prophet,</hi> as also what is required of us, without
our <hi>Faithful</hi> performance whereof, all that he hath
done, shall never stand us in any stead; For he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be a <hi>Priest</hi> to save any, who take him not as well for
their <hi>Prophet,</hi> to <hi>teach,</hi> and their <hi>King</hi> to <hi>rule</hi> them;
nay, if we neglect our part of this <hi>Covenant,</hi> our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
will be yet worse, then if it had never been made;
for we shall then be to <hi>answer</hi> not for the <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>Law</hi>
onely, as in the <hi>first,</hi> but for the <hi>abuse</hi> of <hi>mercy,</hi> which
is of all sins the most <hi>provoking.</hi> On the other side, if
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> faithfully perform it; That is, set our selves hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
to the <hi>obeying</hi> of every <hi>precept</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> not going
on <hi>wilfully</hi> in any one sin, but <hi>bewailing</hi> and <hi>forsaking</hi>
whatever we have formerly been guilty of, it is then
most certain, that all the afore-mentioned <hi>benefits</hi> of
<hi>Christ</hi> belongs to us.</p>
                  <p>24. And now you see how little reason you have to
cast off the <hi>care</hi> of your <hi>Souls,</hi> upon a conceit they are
<hi>past</hi> cure, for that it is plain th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y are not; Nay, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they are in that very <hi>condition,</hi> which of all others
make them fittest for our <hi>care.</hi> If they had not been
thus <hi>REDEEMED</hi> by <hi>CHRIST,</hi> they had been then
so <hi>hopeless,</hi> that <hi>care</hi> would have been in <hi>vain;</hi> On the
other side, if his <hi>Redemption</hi> had been such, that all
men should be <hi>saved</hi> by it, though they live as they list,
we should have thought it <hi>needless</hi> to take care for them,
because they were <hi>safe</hi> without it. But it hath pleased
<hi>God</hi> so to order it, that our <hi>care</hi> must be the <hi>means,</hi> by
which they must receive the <hi>good</hi> even of all that <hi>Christ</hi>
hath done for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:96830:14"/>
25. And now, if after all that <hi>God</hi> hath done to <hi>save</hi>
these <hi>souls</hi> of ours, we will not bestow a little <hi>care</hi> on them
our selves, we very well deserve to <hi>perish.</hi> If a <hi>Physician</hi>
should undertake a <hi>patient</hi> that were in some <hi>desperate</hi>
disease, and by his skill bring him so <hi>far</hi> out of it, that he
were sure to <hi>recover,</hi> if he would but take <hi>care</hi> of himself,
and observe those <hi>rules</hi> the <hi>Physician</hi> set him, would you not
think that man weary of his <hi>life,</hi> that <hi>would refuse to do
that? So certainly that man is weary of his soul,</hi> wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
casts it away, that will not consent to those <hi>easy</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by which he may <hi>save it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>26. You see how great <hi>kindness</hi> God hath to these <hi>souls</hi>
of ours, the whole <hi>Trinity, Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi>
have all done their <hi>parts</hi> for them. The <hi>Father</hi>

this is not the only way, whereby <hi>God</hi> hath

&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>13. But the <hi>acknowledging</hi> him for our <hi>God,</hi>
signifies yet more then this, it means that we
should perform to him all those several parts of
<hi>duty,</hi> which belong from a <hi>Creature</hi> to his
<hi>God;</hi> what those are, I am now to tell
you.</p>
                  <p>14. The first is <hi>Faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Faith.</note> or <hi>belief,</hi> not only
that forementioned of his <hi>essence,</hi> and <hi>Attributes,</hi>
but of his <hi>word,</hi> the <hi>believing</hi> most firmly, that
all that he saith, is perfectly <hi>true.</hi> This ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96830:18"/>
arises from that <hi>Attribute,</hi> his <hi>truth,</hi>
it being <hi>natural</hi> for us to <hi>believe</hi> whatsoever is
said by one of whose <hi>truth</hi> we are confident.
Now the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> being the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
we are therefore to <hi>conclu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e,</hi> that all that is
contained in them, is most <hi>true.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. The things contained in them are of
these <hi>four sorts:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of his <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations.</hi>
                     </note> First, affirmations, such are all
the <hi>stories</hi> of the <hi>Bible,</hi> when it is said, such and
such things came so and so to pass; <hi>Christ</hi> was
<hi>born</hi> of a <hi>virgin,</hi> was laid in a manger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And such also are many points of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as
that there are <hi>three Persons</hi> in the <hi>God-head,</hi>
that <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the like.
All things of this sort thus delivered in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
we are to believe most <hi>true.</hi> And not
only so, but because they are all <hi>written</hi> for
our instruction; we are to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sider them for
that purpose, that is, by them to lay that <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Christian-knowledg,</hi> on which we may
build a <hi>Christian</hi> life.</p>
                  <p>16,<note place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</note> The <hi>Second</hi> sort of things contain'd in
the <hi>Scripture</hi> are the <hi>Commands,</hi> that is, the
several things <hi>enjoyned</hi> us by <hi>God</hi> to perform;
these we are to <hi>believe</hi> to come from him, and
to be most just, and fit for him to <hi>Command.</hi>
But then this <hi>belief</hi> must bring forth <hi>obedience,</hi>
that what we <hi>believe</hi> thus fit to be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be
indeed done by us; otherwise our <hi>belief</hi> that
they come from him, serves but to make us
more <hi>inexcusable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. Thirdly, the <hi>Scripture</hi> contains threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;<note place="margin">Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</note>
many <hi>texts</hi> there are which <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:96830:18"/>
to them that go on in their sins, the <hi>wrath</hi> of
<hi>God;</hi> and under that are contain'd all the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,</hi>
and <hi>miseries</hi> of this <hi>life,</hi> both <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
and <hi>temporal,</hi> and <hi>everlasting</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
in the <hi>life</hi> to <hi>come.</hi> Now we are
most stedfastly to <hi>believe,</hi> that these are <hi>Gods
threats,</hi> and that they will certainly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to every <hi>impenitent</hi> sinner But then
the use we are to make of this <hi>belief</hi> is to
<hi>keep</hi> from those <hi>sins,</hi> to which this <hi>destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is <hi>threatned,</hi> otherwise our <hi>belief</hi> adds to
our <hi>guilt;</hi> that will willfully go on in <hi>spight</hi> of
those <hi>threatnings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Promises.</note> the <hi>Scripture</hi> contains <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi>
and those both to our <hi>bodies,</hi> and our
<hi>soules;</hi> for our <hi>bodies</hi> there are many <hi>promises,</hi>
that <hi>God</hi> will <hi>provide</hi> for them what he sees
necessary; I will name only one, <hi>Mat. 6. 33.
Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and all these things,</hi> that is, all <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
necessaries shall be added unto you:</hi> But
here tis to be observed, that we must <hi>first seek
the Kingdom of God and his righteousness,</hi> that
is, make it our first and <hi>greatest</hi> care, to <hi>serve</hi>
and <hi>obey</hi> him, before this <hi>promise</hi> even of
<hi>temporal</hi> good things <hi>belongs</hi> to us. To the
<hi>soul</hi> there are many and <hi>high promises,</hi> as <hi>first,</hi>
that of <hi>present ease,</hi> and <hi>refreshment</hi> which we
find, <hi>Mat. 11. 29. Take my yoke upon you,
and learn of me, and ye shall find rest to your
soules:</hi> But here it is apparent, that before
this <hi>rest</hi> belongs to us, we must have <hi>taken on
us Christs yoke,</hi> become his <hi>servants,</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96830:19"/>
Finally</hi> there are <hi>promises</hi> to the <hi>soul,</hi>
even of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>benefits</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> but yet those
only to such, as perform the <hi>condition</hi> requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that is, <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>sins</hi> to those that <hi>repent</hi>
of them, <hi>increase</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> to those that
diligently make <hi>use</hi> of, what they have
already, and <hi>humbly</hi> pray for more,
and <hi>eternal salvation</hi> to those that <hi>continue</hi>
to their <hi>lives</hi> end, in hearty <hi>obedience</hi> to his
<hi>Commands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. This <hi>belief</hi> of the <hi>promises</hi> must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
stir us up to perform the <hi>condition,</hi> and till
it do so, we can in no reason <hi>expect</hi> any good
by them; and for us to look for the <hi>benefit</hi> of
them on other termes, is the same mad <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,</hi>
that it would be in a Servant to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
his Master, to give him a <hi>reward</hi> for
having done nothing of his <hi>work,</hi> to which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
the <hi>reward</hi> was promised; you can easily
resolve, what <hi>answer</hi> were to be given to such
a <hi>servant,</hi> and the same are we to expect
from <hi>God</hi> in this case; nay further, it is sure
<hi>God</hi> hath given these <hi>promises</hi> to no other <hi>end,</hi>
but to <hi>invite</hi> us to <hi>holiness</hi> of life, yea he
gave his Son in whom all his <hi>promise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> are as it
were <hi>sum'd</hi> up for this <hi>end.</hi> We usually look so
much at <hi>Christs</hi> coming to satisfie for us,
that we forget this other part of his errand.
But there is nothing surer, than that the
main <hi>purpose</hi> of his coming into the
world, was to plant <hi>good</hi> life among
men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:96830:19"/>
20. This is so often repeated in <hi>Scripture,</hi>
that no man that considers, and <hi>believes</hi> what
he reads, can doubt of it. <hi>Christ</hi> himself tells
us, <hi>Mat 9. 13. He came to call sinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;</hi>
and S. <hi>Peter, Acts.</hi> 3. 26. Tell us,
that <hi>God sent his Son Iesus to bless us, in turning
every one of us from his iniquities;</hi> for it seems

                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rning us from our iniquities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
special <hi>blessing,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> intended us in
<hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Nay we are taught by S.</hi> Paul, <hi>that this
was the end of his very</hi> death <hi>also,</hi> Tit. 2. 14.
Who gave himself for our sins, that he might
redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a peculiar people, zealous of good works;
<hi>and again,</hi> Gal. 1. 4. Who gave himself
for us, that he might deliver us from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
evil world, <hi>that is from the</hi> sins, <hi>and ill</hi>
customes of the world. <hi>Divers other</hi> texts
<hi>there are to this purpose, but these I suppose</hi>
sufficient <hi>to assure any man of this one</hi> great
truth, <hi>that all that</hi> Christ <hi>hath done for us,
was directed to this</hi> end, <hi>the</hi> bringing <hi>us
to</hi> live Christianly; <hi>or in the words of
S.</hi> Paul, to teach us, that denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness
and worldly lusts, we should live
soberly, righteously, and Godly in this present
world.</p>
                  <p>22. Now we know <hi>Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st</hi> is the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>
of all the <hi>promises, in him all the
promises of God are yea, and Amen,
2 Cor.</hi> 1. 20. And therefore if <hi>God</hi> gave
<hi>Christ</hi> to this end, certainly the <hi>promises</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:96830:20"/>
are to the <hi>same</hi> also. And then how great an
<hi>abuse</hi> of them is it, to make them serve for
purposes quite <hi>contrary</hi> to what they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>encouraging</hi> us in sins,
which they will certainly do, if we <hi>perswade</hi>
our selves, they belong to us, how <hi>wickedly</hi>
soever we live. The <hi>Apostle</hi> teaches us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
use of them, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these promises, let us cleanse our selves from
all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God.</hi> When we do thus,
we may justly apply the <hi>promises</hi> to our selves,
and with comfort expect our <hi>parts</hi> in them.
But till then, though these <hi>promises</hi> be of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>truth,</hi> yet we can reap no <hi>benefit</hi> from
them, because we are not the persons, to whom
they are made, that is, we perform not
the <hi>condition</hi> required, to give us <hi>right</hi> to
them.</p>
                  <p>23. This is the <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>belief</hi> required
of us towards the things <hi>God</hi> hath revealed to
us in the <hi>Scripture;</hi> to wit, such as
may answer the <hi>end,</hi> for which they were so
<hi>revealed,</hi> that is, the bringing us to <hi>good lives;</hi>
the bare <hi>believing,</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this, is no more then the <hi>Divels</hi> do, as
S. <hi>James</hi> tells us, Chap. 2. 19. Only they are
not so <hi>unreasonable,</hi> as some of us are, for they
will <hi>tremble,</hi> as knowing well this <hi>Faith</hi> will
never do them any good But many of us go
on <hi>confidently,</hi> and doubt not the <hi>sufficiency</hi> of
our <hi>Faith,</hi> though we have not the least <hi>fruit</hi>
of <hi>obedience</hi> to approve it by; let such hear S.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96830:20"/>
                     <hi>James</hi> judgment in the point, Chap. 2. 26. As
<hi>the body without the spirit is dead, so Faith, if
it have not works, is dead also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. A Second <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Hope,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Hope.</note>
a <hi>comfortable</hi> expectation of these <hi>good</hi> things
he hath <hi>promised.</hi> But this, I told you before
of <hi>Faith,</hi> must be such, as agrees to the nature
of the <hi>promises,</hi> which being such as <hi>requires</hi>
a <hi>condition</hi> on our part, we can <hi>hope</hi> no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then we make that good; or if we
do, we are so far from <hi>performing</hi> by it this
<hi>duty</hi> of <hi>hope,</hi> that we commit the great sin of
<hi>presumption,</hi> which is nothing else,<note place="margin">Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> but <hi>hoping</hi>
where <hi>God</hi> hath given us no <hi>ground</hi> to <hi>hope.</hi>
This every man doth, that <hi>hopes</hi> for <hi>pardon</hi> of
<hi>sins,</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> life, without that <hi>repentance</hi>
and <hi>obedience,</hi> to which alone they are <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi>
the true <hi>hope</hi> is that which <hi>purifies</hi> us;
S. <hi>John</hi> saith, 1. <hi>Ep. 3 5. Every man that hath
this hope, purifieth himself, even as he is pure,</hi>
that is, it makes him <hi>leave</hi> his <hi>sins,</hi> and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
<hi>endeavour</hi> to be <hi>holy,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> is, and
that which doth not so, how <hi>confident</hi> soever
it be, may well be concluded to be but that
<hi>hope</hi> of the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> which <hi>Job</hi> assures us shall
<hi>perish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>25. But there is another way of <hi>transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi>

he is not at the present such a one, as the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi>
belong to, concludes, he can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
such, and therefore neglects all duty,
and goes on in his sins. This is indeed the sinful
<hi>desperation,</hi> and that which if it be continued
in, must end in destruction.</p>
                  <p>26. Now the work of hope is to prevent
this, by setting before us the <hi>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nerality</hi> of the
<hi>promises,</hi> that they belong to all that will

though a man have not hitherto performed
it, and so hath yet no right to them, yet <hi>hope</hi>
will tell him, that that right may yet be
gained, if he will now set heartily about it.
It is therefore strange folly for any man, be he
never so sinful, to give up himself for lost, when
if he will but change his course, he shall be
as certain to partake of the <hi>promises</hi> of merey as
if he had never gone on in those former
sins.</p>
                  <p>27. This <hi>Christ</hi> shews us in the parable
of the <hi>Prodigal, Luke</hi> 15. where we see
that Son, which had run away from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and had consumed the <hi>portion</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
him, in <hi>riotous living,</hi> was yet upon

kindness by the <hi>Father,</hi> as he that had never
offended, nay with higher and more passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
expressions of love. The intent of

our <hi>heavenly Father</hi> will receive us,
how great soever our former sins have bin, if

we shall return to him with true sorrow
for what is past, and sincere obedience
for the time to come; nay so acceptable
a thing is it to <hi>God,</hi> to have any sinner

then some little brook, and certainly it is no
less <hi>folly</hi> to suppose, that the <hi>goodness</hi> of God
doth not as much (nay <hi>infinitely</hi> more) <hi>exceed</hi>
that of all <hi>creatures.</hi> Besides the <hi>goodness</hi> of
the <hi>creature</hi> is <hi>imperfect</hi> and mixt with much
evil; but his is <hi>sure,</hi> and entire, without any
such <hi>mixture.</hi> He is perfectly <hi>holy,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be tainted with the least <hi>impurity,</hi> neither
can he be the <hi>Author</hi> of any to us, for though
he be the cause of all the <hi>goodness</hi> in us, he is
the cause of <hi>none</hi> of our <hi>sins.</hi> This S. <hi>James</hi>
expresly tells us, Chap. 1. 13. <hi>Let no man say
when he is tempted, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God cannot be tempted with evil; neither tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                  </p>

                     <hi>God</hi> is not only thus <hi>good</hi>
in himself, but he is also wonderful <hi>good;</hi> that
is, kind, and <hi>merciful</hi> to us, we are made up
of <hi>two</hi> parts, a <hi>soul</hi> and a <hi>body,</hi> and to each of
these <hi>God</hi> has exprest infinite <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness.</hi>
Do but consider what was before
told you of the <hi>second Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
therein offered, even <hi>Christ</hi> himself, and
all his <hi>benefits,</hi> and also that he offers them so
<hi>sincerely</hi> and <hi>heartily,</hi> that no man can miss of
<hi>enjoying</hi> them, but by his own <hi>default.</hi> For
he doth most <hi>really</hi> and <hi>affectionately</hi> desire we
should embrace them, and live: As appears
by that <hi>solemn oath</hi> of his, <hi>Eze. 33 11. As I live,
saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death
of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his
way and live;</hi> whereto he adds this <hi>passionate
expression; turn ye, turn ye from our evil ways,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96830:22"/>
for why will yee die:</hi> To the same purpose, you
may read, Ezek. 18. <hi>Consider</hi> this, I say,
and then surely you cannot but say, he hath
great <hi>kindness</hi> to our <hi>souls.</hi> Nay let every
man but remember with himself, the many
calls he had to <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>amendment,</hi>
somtimes <hi>outward</hi> by the <hi>word,</hi> somtimes <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
by the <hi>secret</hi> whispers of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> in
his heart, which were only to <hi>wooe</hi> and <hi>intreat</hi>
him to avoid <hi>eternal misery,</hi> and to accept of
<hi>eternal happiness;</hi> let him, I say, remember
these, together with those many other means,
<hi>God</hi> hath used towards him for the same end,
and he will have reason to confess <hi>Gods kindness,</hi>
not only to <hi>mens soules</hi> in <hi>general;</hi> but to his
own in <hi>particular.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>31. Neither hath he bin wanting to our
<hi>bodies,</hi> all the <hi>good</hi> things they injoy, as <hi>Health,
Strength, Food, Rayment,</hi> and whatever else
concerns them, are meerly his <hi>gifts;</hi> so that
indeed it is impossible, we should be ignorant of
his <hi>mercies</hi> to them, all those <hi>outward</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and <hi>refreshmets</hi> we daily injoy, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<hi>effects,</hi> and <hi>witnesses</hi> of it, and though
some enjoy more of these, then others, yet
there is no person, but injoyes so much in one
kind or other, as abundantly shews <hi>Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
and <hi>kindness</hi> to him, in respect of his
<hi>body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>32. And now surely you will think it but
reasonable we should <hi>love</hi> him, who is in all
respects thus <hi>lovely:</hi> Inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d this is a <hi>duty</hi> so
generally acknowledged, that if you should
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96830:23"/>
ask any man the <hi>question,</hi> whether he loved
God or no, he would think you did him great
<hi>wrong</hi> to doubt of it; yet for all this, it is
too plain, that there are very few, that do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>love</hi> him, and this will soon be proved to
you by examining a little, what are the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
effects</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> which we bear to men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like
our selves, and then trying, whether we can shew
any such <hi>fruits</hi> of our love to <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>33. Of that sort there are <hi>divers,</hi> but for
<hi>shortness</hi> I will name but two.<note place="margin">Fruit of <hi>Love.</hi> Desire of pleasing.</note> The <hi>first</hi> is a
<hi>desire of pleasing,</hi> the <hi>second</hi> a <hi>desire of enjoying.</hi>
These are constantly the <hi>fruits</hi> of <hi>love.</hi> For
the <hi>first</hi> 'tis known by all, that he that <hi>loves</hi>
any person, is very desirous to <hi>approve</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to do whatsoever he thinks will be
<hi>pleasing</hi> to him; and according to the degree of
<hi>love,</hi> so is this <hi>desire</hi> more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or less; where we
love <hi>earnestly,</hi> we are very <hi>earnest,</hi> and <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
to <hi>please.</hi> Now if we have indeed that
<hi>love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> we <hi>pretend</hi> to, it will bring forth
this <hi>fruit,</hi> we shall be careful to <hi>please</hi> him in
all things. Therefore as you judg of the <hi>tree by
its fruits,</hi> so may you judg of your <hi>love</hi> of

way of <hi>tryal,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> himself hath give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

us, <hi>Jo. 14. 15. If ye love me keep my comand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
and S. <hi>John</hi> tell us, 1 <hi>Ep. 5. 3. That this
is the love of God, that we walk after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi>
and where this one proof is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it will be <hi>impossible</hi> to <hi>testifie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> our love to
<hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>34. But it must yet be farther considered
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96830:23"/>
that this <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> must not be in a <hi>low</hi> or
<hi>weak</hi> degree, for besides that the <hi>Motives</hi> to
it, his <hi>excellency,</hi> and his <hi>kindness</hi> are in the
<hi>highest;</hi> the same <hi>Commandment</hi> which bids
us <hi>love God, bids us love him with all our heart,
and with all our strength;</hi> that is, as much as
is <hi>possible</hi> for us, and <hi>above</hi> any t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing else<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And therefore to the fulfilling of this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
it is necessary, we <hi>love</hi> him in
that <hi>degree;</hi> and if we do so, then certainly
we shall have not only some <hi>slight,</hi> and
faint <hi>endeavours</hi> of <hi>pleasing,</hi> but such as are
most <hi>diligent,</hi> and <hi>earnest,</hi> such as will put us
upon the most painful and costly duties, make
us willing to forsake our own <hi>ease, goods,
friends,</hi> yea <hi>life</hi> it self, when we cannot keep
them without <hi>disobeying God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>35. Now examine thy self by this: hast
thou this <hi>fruit</hi> of <hi>love</hi> to shew? dost thou
make it thy <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>greatest</hi> care to keep
<hi>Gods Commandments?</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> him in all things?
earnestly <hi>labouring</hi> to <hi>please</hi> him to the utmost
of thy power, even to the <hi>forsaking</hi> of what
is <hi>dearest</hi> to thee in this world? if thou dost,
thou maist then truly say thou <hi>lovest God.</hi>
But on the contrary, if thou willfully <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuest</hi>
in the breach of many, nay but of any
one <hi>Command</hi> of his, never deceive thy self,
for the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God abides</hi> not in thee. This
will be made plain to you, if you consider
what the <hi>Scripture</hi> saith of such, as, that they
are <hi>enemies to God by their wicked works, Col.
1.</hi> 21. That the <hi>carnal</hi> minde (and such is every
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96830:24"/>
one that continues <hi>wilfully</hi> in <hi>sin</hi>) is <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to God, Rom.</hi> 8. 7. That he that <hi>sins
wilfully, tramples under foot the Son of God,
and doth despite unto the Spirit of grace, Heb.
10</hi> 29. and many the like. And therefore
unless you can think <hi>enmity,</hi> and <hi>trampling,</hi>
and <hi>despite</hi> to be <hi>fruits</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> you must not
believe you <hi>love God,</hi> whilest you go on in
any wilful <hi>disobedience</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>36. A <hi>Second fruit</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> I told you,
was <hi>desire</hi> of <hi>injoying.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Desire of enjoying.</note> This is constantly to
be seen in our <hi>love</hi> to another. If you have a
<hi>friend,</hi> whom you intirely <hi>love,</hi> you desire his
<hi>conversation,</hi> wish to be alwayes in his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;</hi>
and thus will it also be in our <hi>love</hi> to
<hi>God,</hi> if that was as great, and hearty, as
this.</p>
                  <p>37. There is a <hi>twofold enjoying</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the
one <hi>imperfect</hi> in this <hi>life,</hi> the other more <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
and <hi>complete,</hi> in the life to <hi>come;</hi> that
in this life is that <hi>conversation,</hi> as I may call
it, which we have with <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>ordinances,</hi>
in <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>meditating,</hi> in <hi>hearing</hi> his
<hi>word,</hi> in <hi>receiving</hi> the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which are
all intended for this purpose, to bring us into an
<hi>intimacy,</hi> and <hi>familiarity</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> by <hi>speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to him, and <hi>hearing</hi> him <hi>speak</hi> to us.</p>
                  <p>38. Now if we do indeed <hi>love God,</hi> we
shall certainly hugely <hi>value,</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> these
wayes of <hi>conversing</hi> with him, it being all that
we can have in this life; it will make us with
<hi>David,</hi> esteem <hi>one day in Gods courts better
then a thousand, Psal.</hi> 84. 10. We shall be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96830:24"/>
glad to have these <hi>opportunities</hi> of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, as often as is possible, and be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to use them <hi>diligently;</hi> to that end of
<hi>uniting</hi> us still more to him, yea we shall
come to these <hi>spiritual</hi> exercises with the same
<hi>cheerfulness,</hi> we would go to our <hi>dearest friend.</hi>
And if indeed we doe thus, it is a good proofe
of our <hi>love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>39. But I fear there are not many have
this to shew for it, as appears by the common
<hi>backwardness;</hi> and unwillingness of men to
come to these; and their <hi>negligence,</hi> and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness,
when they are at them; and can we
think that <hi>God</hi> will ever own us for <hi>lovers</hi> of
him, whilst we have such <hi>dislikes</hi> to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
that we will never come into it, but
when we are <hi>drag'd</hi> by <hi>fear,</hi> or <hi>shame</hi> of men
or some such worldly Motive; It is sure you
would not think that man <hi>loved</hi> you, whom
you perceived to shun your <hi>company,</hi> and to
be loath to come in your <hi>sight.</hi> And therefore
be not so unreasonable as to say you <hi>love God,</hi>
when yet you desire to keep as far from him as
you can.</p>
                  <p>40. But besides this, there is another <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> which is more perfect, and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete,</hi>
and that is our <hi>perpetual</hi> injoying of him
in heaven, where we shall be for ever <hi>united</hi> to
him; and <hi>injoy</hi> him not now and then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for <hi>short</hi> spaces of time, as we do here, but
<hi>continually</hi> without <hi>interruption,</hi> or breaking
off. And certainly if we have that <hi>degree</hi> of
<hi>love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> we ought, this cannot but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e most
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96830:25"/>
earnestly desired by us so much, that we shall
think no <hi>labour</hi> too great to compass it. The <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years</hi> that <hi>Jacob</hi> served for <hi>Rachel, Gen. 29.
20. Seemed to him but a few dayes for the love
that he had to her:</hi> and surely if we have <hi>love</hi> to
<hi>God,</hi> we shall not think the service of our whole
<hi>lives</hi> too <hi>dear</hi> a <hi>price</hi> for this full <hi>injoyment</hi> of
him, nor esteem all the <hi>injoyments</hi> of the world,
worth the looking on, in comparison thereof.</p>
                  <p>41. If we can truly tell our selves we do
thus long for this injoyment of God we may
believe we <hi>love</hi> him. But I fear again, there
are but few that can thus <hi>approve</hi> their <hi>love.</hi>
For if we look into mens <hi>lives,</hi> we shall see
they are not generally so <hi>fond</hi> of this <hi>injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
as to be at any <hi>pains</hi> to purchase it. And
not only so, but it is to be <hi>doubted,</hi> there are
many, who if it were put to their <hi>choice,</hi>
whether they would live <hi>here</hi> alwayes, to enjoy
the <hi>profit</hi> and pleasure of the <hi>world,</hi> or go to
<hi>heaven</hi> to <hi>enjoy</hi> God, would, like the <hi>Children</hi>

                     </gap>
then according to our <hi>Saviours</hi> Rule, <hi>Mat.
6.</hi> 21. Their <hi>heart</hi> would be with him. Nay,
further yet; it is too plain, that many of us
set so little <hi>value</hi> on this <hi>injoying</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that
we <hi>prefer</hi> the <hi>vilest</hi> and <hi>basest</hi> sins before him,
and chuse to <hi>injoy</hi> them, though by it we utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>lose</hi> our parts in him, which is the case of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96830:25"/>
man that continues willfully in those sins.</p>
                  <p>42. And now I fear, according to these rules
of <hi>trial,</hi> many that <hi>profess</hi> to <hi>love</hi> God will be
found not to do so. I conclude al with the words
of S. <hi>John, 1 Ep.</hi> 3. 18. Which though spoken of
the <hi>love</hi> of our <hi>brethren,</hi> is very fitly appliable
to this <hi>love</hi> of God, let <hi>us not love in word, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>43. A <hi>Fourth duty</hi> to God is <hi>Fear;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fear.</note> this arises
from the <hi>consideration</hi> both of his <hi>Justice</hi> and
his <hi>Power;</hi> his <hi>Justice</hi> is such that he <hi>will</hi> not
<hi>clear the wicked,</hi> &amp; his <hi>Power,</hi> such that he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to <hi>inflict</hi> the sorest <hi>punishments</hi> upon them;
&amp; that this is a <hi>reasonable</hi> cause of <hi>fear, Christ</hi>
himself tells us, <hi>Mat. 10. 18. Fear him which is
able to destroy both body and soul in hell.</hi> Many
other places of <hi>Scripture</hi> there are, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to us this <hi>duty,</hi> as <hi>Psal. 2. 11. Serve the Lord
with fear: Psal. 34. 9. Fear the Lord yea that be
his Saints: Pro. 9. 10. The fear of the Lord is the
beginning of wisdom,</hi> and divers the like; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
all the <hi>threatnings</hi> of <hi>wrath</hi> against <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
which we meet with in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> are
only to this end, to <hi>work</hi> this <hi>fear</hi> in our <hi>hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>44. Now this fear is nothing <hi>else,</hi> but such an
<hi>awful</hi> regard of God, as may keep us from <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending</hi>
him. This the wise man tells us, <hi>Prov. 16.
17. The fear of the Lord is to depart f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that none can be said truly to <hi>fear</hi> God, that is

to that common <hi>fear</hi> we have towards

can do unto me.</hi> For let their <hi>malice</hi> be never
so great, he can <hi>restrain,</hi> and keep them from
hurting us, nay, he can <hi>change</hi> their minds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, according to that of the wise man,
<hi>Pro. 16. 7. When a mans wayes please the
Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace
with him.</hi> A notable <hi>example</hi> of this we have
in <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32. who whem his brother <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau</hi>
was coming against him as an <hi>enemy,</hi> God
wonderfully turned his heart, so that he met
him with all the <hi>expressions,</hi> of <hi>brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
as you may read in the <hi>next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>46. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> suppose men were left at
<hi>liberty</hi> to do thee what <hi>mischief</hi> they could;
Alas, their <hi>power</hi> goes but a little way, they
may perhaps rob thee of thy <hi>goods,</hi> it may be
they may take away thy <hi>liberty,</hi> or thy <hi>credit,</hi>
or perchance thy <hi>life</hi> too; but that thou
knowest is the utmost they can do. But now
God can do all this when he <hi>pleases,</hi> and that
which is <hi>infinitely</hi> more, his vengeance reaches
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96830:26"/>
even beyond <hi>death</hi> it self, to this <hi>eternal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery</hi>
both of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soul</hi> in <hi>hell;</hi> in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of which <hi>death</hi> is so considerable, that we
are notto look upon it with any dread. <hi>Fear
not them that kill the body, and after that have
no more that they can do,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Luk.
12.</hi> 4. And then immediately adds, But <hi>I will
forewarn you whom ye shall fear, fear him which
after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell,
yea, I say unto you fear him.</hi> In which words
the <hi>comparison</hi> is set between that <hi>greatest</hi> ill
we can suffer from man, the loss of <hi>life,</hi> and
those sadder <hi>evils God</hi> can inflicton us; and
the <hi>latter</hi> are found to be the only <hi>dreadful</hi>
things, and therefore God only to be <hi>feared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>47. But there is yet one thing farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
in this matter, which is this, it is
possible we may <hi>transgress</hi> against <hi>men,</hi> and
they not know it, I may perhaps <hi>steal</hi> my
<hi>neighbours goods,</hi> or defile his <hi>wife,</hi> and keep
it so close that he shall not <hi>suspect</hi> me, and so
never bring me to <hi>punishment</hi> for it; but this
we cannot do with God, he knows all things
even the <hi>most secret thoughts</hi> of our hearts, and
therefore though we commit a sin never so
<hi>closely,</hi> he is sure to fit us, and will as surely
if we do not timely repent, <hi>punish</hi> us <hi>eternally</hi>
for it.</p>
                  <p>48. And now surely it cannot but be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,</hi>
that it is much safer <hi>displeasing men,</hi> then
God; yet alas our <hi>practice</hi> is as if we <hi>believed</hi>
the <hi>direct</hi> contrary, there being nothing more
ordinary with us, then for the <hi>avoiding</hi> of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96830:27"/>
some <hi>present</hi> danger we <hi>fear</hi> from men, to rush
our selves upon the <hi>indignation</hi> of God. And
thus it is with us, when either to save our <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,</hi>
or <hi>credits,</hi> or our very <hi>lives,</hi> we commit
any <hi>sin,</hi> for that is plainly the <hi>chusing</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
God, rather then <hi>man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>49. But God knows this case of the <hi>fear</hi> of
<hi>men</hi> is not the only one wherein we venture to
<hi>displease</hi> him, for we commit many <hi>sins,</hi> to which
we have none of this <hi>temptation,</hi> nor indeed any
other; as for instance, that of <hi>common swearing,</hi>
to which there is nothing either of <hi>pleasure,</hi> or
<hi>profit</hi> to invite us. Nay, many times, we, who so
<hi>fear</hi> the <hi>mischiefs</hi> that other men may do to us,
that we are ready to buy them off with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<hi>sins,</hi> do our selves bring all those very <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs</hi>
upon us, by <hi>sins</hi> of our own <hi>chusing.</hi> Thus
the careless <hi>prodigal robs</hi> himself of his <hi>estate,</hi>
the <hi>deceitful</hi> &amp; <hi>dishonest</hi> man, or any that lives
in open <hi>notorious sin, deprives</hi> himself of his <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi>
and the <hi>drunkard,</hi> &amp; <hi>glutton</hi> brings <hi>diseases</hi>
on himself, to the <hi>shortning</hi> his life: And can we
think we do at al <hi>fear</hi> God when that <hi>fear</hi> hath
so little <hi>power</hi> over us, that though it be backt
with the many present <hi>mischiefs,</hi> that attend one
<hi>sin,</hi> it is not able to keep us from them? surely
such men are so far from <hi>fearing</hi> God, that they
rather seem to defie him, resolve to provoke
him, whatsoever it <hi>cost</hi> them, either in this world
or the <hi>next.</hi> Yet so unreasonably <hi>partial</hi> are we
to our selves that even such as these wil pretend
to this <hi>fear:</hi> you may examine multitudes of the
most gross <hi>scandalous</hi> sinners, before you shall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96830:27"/>
meet with one that will acknowledg he <hi>fears</hi>
not God. It is stran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e it should be possible for
men thus to cheat themselves, but however it is
certain, we cannot <hi>deceive</hi> God, he will not be

                        </gap>;</hi> and therefore if we will not now so <hi>fear</hi>
as to <hi>avoid sin,</hi> we shall one day <hi>fear,</hi> when it
will be too <hi>late</hi> to <hi>avoid punishment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>50. A <hi>Fifth duty</hi> to God is, that of <hi>trusting</hi>
in him,<note place="margin">Trust.</note> that is, <hi>depending</hi> and <hi>resting</hi> on him:
and that is <hi>first</hi> in all <hi>dangers, Secondly</hi> in all
wants. We are to <hi>rest</hi> on him in all our <hi>dangers</hi>
both <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>temporal.</hi> Of the <hi>first</hi> sort
are all those <hi>temptations,</hi> by which we are in

                     </hi> with
it, not yielding or <hi>giving consent</hi> to it in the
least <hi>degree;</hi> and whilst we do thus, we are <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi>
to rest upon God, that his <hi>grace</hi> will be
<hi>sufficient</hi> for us, that he will either remove the
<hi>temptation,</hi> or <hi>strengthen</hi> us to <hi>withstand</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>51. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral.</note> in all outward and <hi>temporal dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi>
we are to <hi>rest</hi> upon him, as knowing that
he is <hi>able</hi> to deliver us, and that he will do so, if
he see it <hi>best</hi> for us, &amp; if we be such to whom he
hath <hi>promised</hi> his <hi>protection,</hi> that is, such as truly
<hi>fear</hi> him. To this purpose we have many <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
in <hi>Scripture, Ps. 34. 7. The Angel of the Lord
tarrieth round about them that fear him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth
them;</hi> &amp; <hi>Ps. 34. 20. The Lord delivereth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96830:28"/>
the souls of his Saints, and all that put their
trust in him shall not be destitute;</hi> and divers
the like. And also we have many examples,
as that of the <hi>three children</hi> in the furnace,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 3. That of <hi>Daniel</hi> in the <hi>Lions Den,
Dan.</hi> 6. And many others, all which serve to
teach us this one lesson, that if we go on consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
in performing our duty, we need not
be dismayd for any thing that can befall us,
for the God whom we serve, <hi>is able to deliver
us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>52. Therefore in all <hi>dangers,</hi> we are <hi>first</hi>
humbly to <hi>pray</hi> for his aid, and then to <hi>rest</hi>
our selves <hi>cheerfully</hi> on him;<note place="margin">Not seek to deliver our selves by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Sin.</hi>
                     </note> assuring our

we must be sure to <hi>fix</hi> our <hi>dependance wholly</hi>
on him, and not to <hi>relie</hi> on the <hi>creatures</hi> for
<hi>help,</hi> much less must we seek to <hi>deliver</hi> our
selves by any unlawful means; that is by the
<hi>committing</hi> of any <hi>sin,</hi> for that is like <hi>Saul,
1 Sam.</hi> 28. 7. To go to the <hi>witch,</hi> that is, to
the <hi>Divel</hi> for help; such courses do common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>deceive</hi> our hopes at the present, and in stead
of <hi>delivering</hi> us out of our <hi>streights,</hi> plunge
us in greater, and those much mroe uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

we certainly <hi>forfeit</hi> when we thus seek to res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue
our selves by any <hi>sinful</hi> means. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing

have only removed the <hi>danger</hi> from that which
was less considerable, and brought it upon the

or <hi>Estates,</hi> or <hi>Lives</hi> themselves by a sin;
we have not saved them but madly <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bought</hi>
them, layed out our very <hi>souls</hi> on
them; And <hi>Christ</hi> tells us how little we shall
gain by such bargains, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 26. What
<hi>is a man profited if he shall gain the whole

resolve never to <hi>value</hi> any thing we can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess

it at the <hi>price</hi> of the least <hi>sin,</hi> but when ever
things are driven to such an <hi>issue,</hi> that we
must either part with some, perhaps all our

<hi>season</hi> for us to perform that <hi>great</hi> and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>duty,</hi> of <hi>taking up the Cross</hi> which we can
never so properly do, as in this case; for our bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

of the <hi>Cross,</hi> but then only can we be said
to <hi>take it up,</hi> when having a means of <hi>escaping</hi>
it by a <hi>sin,</hi> we rather chuse to <hi>endure the

on us by any unavoidable <hi>necessity,</hi> but we
willingly <hi>chuse</hi> it; and this is <hi>highly</hi> accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

by him, that if we <hi>fail</hi> of performing it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when

he commands nothing, which he will not

that seek the Lord shall want no manner of thing

eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon
them that hope in his mercy, to deliver their

Examples</hi> also we have of this,
as we may see in the case of <hi>Eliah,</hi> and
the <hi>poor widdow, 1 Kings</hi> 17. And many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>55. We are therefore to look up to him for

not by this, that we should so expect it from

that. <hi>He that will not labour, let him not
eat,</hi> sayes the <hi>Apostle, 2 Thes.</hi> 3. 10. And we
may believe God will pronounce the same <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi>
and suffer the <hi>slothful</hi> person to <hi>want</hi>
even necessary food. But when we have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
used our own <hi>endeavour,</hi> then we must
also look up to <hi>God</hi> for his blessing on it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it can never <hi>prosper</hi> to us. And
having done thus, we may comfortably <hi>rest</hi>

unto you, take no thought for your life, what
you shall eat, or what you shall drink; neither
for your body, what you shall put on, is not the
life more then meat, and the body then rayment?
Behold the fowles of the air, for they sow not
neither do they reap nor gather into barnes, yet
our heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not,
much better then they? which of you by taking
thought can add one cubit to his stature? and why
take ye thought for rayment? consider the lilies,
of the field how they grow, they toil not, neither
do they spin, and yet I say unto you, that even
Solomon in all his glory was not arayed like one
of these. Wherefore if God so clothe the grass of
the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast
into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you,
O ye of little Faith? Therefore take no
thought, saying, what shall we eat, or what shall
we drink, or where with all shall we be clothed.
(for after all these things do the Gentiles seck)
for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have
need of all these things? But seek ye first the
Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and then
all these things shall be added unto you: Take
therefore no thought for the morrow, for the
morrow shall take thought for the things of it
self, sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof:

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96830:31"/>
great <hi>benefits</hi> of it; as <hi>first,</hi> that by this <hi>trusting</hi>
upon God, you <hi>engage</hi> and <hi>hind</hi> him to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide</hi>
for you. <hi>Men,</hi> you know, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
highly <hi>concern'd</hi> not to <hi>fail</hi> those that
depend and <hi>trust</hi> upon them: and certainly
God doth so much more. But then <hi>Secondly,</hi>
there is a great deal of <hi>ease,</hi> and quiet in the
<hi>practice</hi> of this <hi>duty;</hi> it delivers us from all
those <hi>carkings,</hi> and <hi>immoderate</hi> cares which
<hi>disquiet</hi> our minds, break our <hi>sleep,</hi> and <hi>grieves</hi>
even our very <hi>heart.</hi> I doubt not but those
that have felt them, need not be told they are
<hi>uneasie.</hi> But then methinks that <hi>uneasiness</hi>
should make us forward to imbrace the means
for the <hi>removing</hi> of them, and so we see it too
often doth, in <hi>unlawful</hi> ones; men will <hi>cheat,</hi>
and <hi>steal,</hi> and <hi>lie</hi> and do any thing to deliver
themselves from the <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>want.</hi> But alas,
they commonly prove but <hi>deceitful</hi> remedies:
They bring <hi>Gods</hi> curse on us, and so are more
likely to betray us to <hi>want,</hi> then to keep us
from it. But if you desire a certain and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing</hi>
cure for <hi>cares,</hi> take this of <hi>relying</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God.</p>
                  <p>59. For what should cause that man to fear
<hi>want,</hi> that knows he hath one that <hi>cares</hi> for
him, who is <hi>al-sufficient,</hi> and will not suffer
him to <hi>want</hi> what is fit for him. If a <hi>poor</hi> man
had but a <hi>faithful promise</hi> fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a <hi>wealthy</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that he would never suffer him to <hi>want,</hi>
it is sure he would be highly <hi>cheered</hi> with it,
and would not then think fit to be as <hi>carking</hi>
as he was before, and yet a <hi>mans promise</hi> may
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96830:31"/>
fail us, he may either grow <hi>poor,</hi> and not be
<hi>able,</hi> or he may prove <hi>false,</hi> and not be <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
to make good his word. But we know <hi>God</hi>
is subject neither to <hi>impoverishing</hi> nor <hi>deceit.</hi>
And therefore how vile an <hi>injury</hi> do we offer
to him, if we dare not <hi>trust</hi> as much upon his
<hi>promise,</hi> as we would on that of a <hi>man,</hi> yea
and how great a <hi>mischief</hi> do we do our selves
by loading our minds with a <hi>multitude</hi> of
<hi>vexatious,</hi> and <hi>tormenting</hi> cares, when we
may so securely <hi>cast our burden upon God.</hi> I
conclude this in the words of the <hi>Apostle,
Phil. 4. 6. Be careful for nothing, but in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing by Prayer, and supplication, with
thanksgiving; let your requests be made known

                  <p>§ 1. A <hi>Sixth</hi> duty to <hi>God</hi> is <hi>humility,</hi>
that is, such a sense of our own
<hi>meanness,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Humility.</note> and his <hi>excellency,</hi> as
may work in us a <hi>lowly</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
submission</hi> to him; This <hi>submission</hi> is
<hi>twofold, First</hi> to his <hi>will, Secondly</hi> to his <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>submission</hi> to his <hi>will</hi> is also of <hi>two</hi>
sorts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
to Gods will in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> the <hi>submission</hi> either of <hi>obedience,</hi> or <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi>
That of <hi>obedience,</hi> is our ready <hi>yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
our selves up to <hi>do</hi> his <hi>will,</hi> so that when
<hi>God</hi> hath by his <hi>command</hi> made known to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
what his <hi>pleasure</hi> is, <hi>cheerfully,</hi> and <hi>readily</hi>
to set about it. To <hi>enable</hi> us to this, <hi>humility</hi>
is exceeding necessary, for a <hi>proud</hi> person is
of all others the unaptest to <hi>obey,</hi> and we see
men never pay an <hi>obedience</hi> but where they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96830:32"/>
the person commanding to be some
way <hi>above</hi> them. And so it is here, if we be
not throughly perswaded, that <hi>God</hi> is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>above</hi> us, that we are <hi>vileness,</hi> and <hi>nothing</hi>
in comparison of him, we shall never pay our
due <hi>obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3.<note place="margin">The great distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us.</note> Therefore if ever you mean to <hi>obey</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
(as you must if ever you mean to be <hi>sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>)
get your hearts possest with the <hi>sense</hi> of that
great unspeakable <hi>distance</hi> that is between
<hi>God</hi> and you. Consider him as he is a <hi>God</hi> of
<hi>infinite Majestly,</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> and we poor
<hi>worms</hi> of the earth; he <hi>infinite</hi> in <hi>power,</hi> able
to do <hi>all things;</hi> and we able to do <hi>nothing,</hi>
not so much as to make one <hi>hair white or
black,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> speaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 36.
He of <hi>infinite purity</hi> and <hi>holiness,</hi> and we

every minuts of our lives. He <hi>eternal</hi> and
<hi>immortal,</hi> and we <hi>frail mortals,</hi> that when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he <hi>taketh away our breath we die; and are
turned again to our dust, Psal.</hi> 104. 29. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
all this, I say, and you cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
a wide <hi>difference</hi> betwixt <hi>God</hi> and man,
and therefore may well cry out with <hi>Job,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had approach't so near to <hi>God,</hi> as to
discern somwhat of his <hi>excellency, Iob 42. 56.
Now mine eyes seeth thee, wherefore I abhor
my self and repent in dust and ashes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. And even when this <hi>humility</hi> hath
brought us to <hi>obedience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness</hi>
of our best work.</note> it is not then to be <hi>cast</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:96830:33"/>
off, as if we had no <hi>farther</hi> use of it; for there
is still great use, nay <hi>necessity</hi> of it, to keep
us from any <hi>high conceits</hi> of our performances,
which if we once entertain, it will <hi>blast</hi> the
best of them, and make them utterly <hi>unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>
to <hi>God;</hi> like the <hi>strictness</hi> of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see,</hi>
which when once he came to boast of,
the <hi>Publican</hi> was preferred before him,
<hi>Luke</hi> 18. The <hi>best</hi> of our works are so full
of <hi>infirmity</hi> and <hi>pollution;</hi> that if we <hi>compare</hi>
them with that <hi>perfection,</hi> and <hi>purity,</hi> which
is in <hi>God,</hi> we may truly say with the <hi>Prophet,
All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags,
Isaiah</hi> 64. 6. And therefore to <hi>pride</hi> our
selves in them, is the same <hi>madness,</hi> that it
would be in a <hi>begger,</hi> to brag of his <hi>apparel</hi>
when it is nothing but <hi>vile rags,</hi> and <hi>tatters.</hi>
Our <hi>Saviours</hi> precept in this matter must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be remembred, <hi>Lnke 17. 10. When
you have done all those things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you, say, we are unprofitable servants;</hi>
if when we have <hi>done</hi> all, we must give our
selves no better a title, what are we then to
<hi>esteem</hi> our selves, that are so far from doing
any <hi>considerable</hi> part, of what we are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded?</hi>
Surely that worser name of
<hi>slothful</hi> and <hi>wicked servant, Mat.</hi> 25. 26.
We have no reason to think too <hi>bad</hi> for
us.</p>
                  <p>5. A <hi>Second</hi> sort of <hi>submission</hi> to his <hi>will,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of</hi>
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</note> is
that of <hi>patience,</hi> this stands in <hi>suffering</hi> his <hi>will,</hi>
as that of <hi>obedience</hi> did in <hi>acting</hi> it, and is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96830:33"/>
nothing else, but a <hi>willing</hi> and quiet yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to whatever <hi>afflictions</hi> it pleases <hi>God</hi>
to lay upon us. This the formentioned <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi>
will make <hi>easie</hi> to us; for when our
hearts are throughly possest with that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and esteem</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> it will be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for us to <hi>grudg</hi> or <hi>murmure</hi> at what
ever he does. We see an instance of it in
<hi>Old</hi> Elie. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. Who after he had
heard the <hi>sad</hi> threatnings of <hi>God</hi> against him,
of the <hi>destruction</hi> of his <hi>family,</hi> the loss of
the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> the cutting off <hi>both his sons
in one day,</hi> which were all of them <hi>afflictions</hi>
of the <hi>heaviest</hi> kind, yet this one considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it <hi>was the Lord</hi> inabled him
<hi>calmly</hi> and <hi>quietly</hi> to yield to them; saying,
<hi>Let him do what seemeth him good, ver.</hi> 18.
The same effect it had on <hi>David,</hi> in his <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
Psal. 39. 9. I was dumb, I opened
not my mouth, because thou didst it: God do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
it <hi>silenced</hi> all <hi>murmurings</hi> and <hi>grumblings</hi>
in him. And so must it do in us, in all our
<hi>afflictions,</hi> if we will indeed <hi>approve</hi> our <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi>
to <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. For surely you will not think that
<hi>child</hi> hath due <hi>humility</hi> to his <hi>parent</hi> or that
<hi>servant</hi> to his <hi>Master,</hi> that when they are
corrected, shall flie in the <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
face.</hi> But thus do we when ever we <hi>grudg</hi>
and <hi>repine</hi> at that which <hi>God</hi> layes upon us.
But besides the want of <hi>humility</hi> in our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96830:34"/>
so doing, there is also a great want of <hi>justice</hi>
in it; for <hi>God</hi> hath as we are his <hi>creatures,</hi> a
<hi>right</hi> to do with us what he <hi>will,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for us to <hi>resist</hi> that <hi>right</hi> of his, is the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
injustice,</hi> that can be; nay farther, it is also
the greatest <hi>folly</hi> in the world, for it is only
our <hi>good</hi> that <hi>God</hi> aims at in <hi>afflicting</hi> us;
that heavenly Father is not like our <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
ones, who sometime <hi>correct</hi> their <hi>children,</hi>
only to <hi>satisfie</hi> their own angry humour, not
to do them <hi>good.</hi> But this is subject to no such
<hi>frailties,</hi> he <hi>doth not afflict willingly, nor
grieve the children of men, Lam.</hi> 3. 33. They
are our <hi>sins,</hi> which do not only give him <hi>just</hi>
cause, but even <hi>force,</hi> and <hi>necessitate</hi> him to
<hi>punish</hi> us. He carries to us the <hi>bowels</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
of the <hi>tenderest Father;</hi> now when a
<hi>Father</hi> sees, his child <hi>stubborn,</hi> and <hi>rebellious,</hi>
and running on in a <hi>course</hi> that will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
undo him, what greater act of <hi>Fatherly
kindness</hi> can he do then <hi>chasten</hi> and <hi>correct</hi>
him, to see if by that means he may <hi>amend</hi>
him; nay indeed he could not be said to have
<hi>true kindness</hi> to him, if he should not. And
thus it is with <hi>God</hi> when he sees us run on in
<hi>sin,</hi> either be must <hi>leave</hi> off to <hi>love</hi> us, and
so leave us to <hi>our selves,</hi> to take our own
<hi>course;</hi> and that is the <hi>heaviest curse</hi> that
can befal any man; or else if he continue to
<hi>love</hi> us, he must <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>punish</hi> us, to bring
us to <hi>amendment.</hi> Therefore when ever he
strikes, we are in all reason, not only <hi>patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
to lie under his <hi>rod,</hi> but (as I may say) kiss
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96830:34"/>
it also; that is, be very <hi>thankful</hi> to him,<note place="margin">Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for Gods <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</hi>
                     </note> that
he is <hi>pleased,</hi> not to <hi>give us over to our own
hearts lusts, Psal.</hi> 81. 12. But still continue his
<hi>care</hi> of us, sends <hi>afflictions,</hi> as so many <hi>messengers</hi>
to call us home to himself. You see then how
<hi>gross</hi> a <hi>folly</hi> it is to <hi>murmure</hi> at those <hi>stripes,</hi>
which are meant so <hi>graciously;</hi> it is like that of
a <hi>froward patient,</hi> which <hi>reproaches</hi> and <hi>reviles</hi>
the <hi>Physician</hi> that comes to cure him, and
if such a one be left to die of his <hi>disease,</hi> every
one knows whom he is to <hi>thank</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>7. But it is not only <hi>quietness,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>under them.</hi>
                     </note> no nor <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi>
neither under <hi>afflictions,</hi> that is the
<hi>full</hi> of our <hi>duty</hi> in this matter; we must have
<hi>fruitfulness</hi> also, or all the rest will stand us
in no stead. By <hi>fruitfulness</hi> I mean the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth that, which the <hi>afflictions</hi> were sent
to work in us, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>amendment</hi> of our
<hi>lives.</hi> To which purpose in time of <hi>affliction</hi>
it is very necessary for us to call our selves to
an <hi>account,</hi> to <hi>examine</hi> our hearts and lives,
and <hi>search</hi> diligently, what <hi>sins</hi> lie upon
us, which have <hi>provoked God</hi> thus to smite us,
and whatsoever we find our selves <hi>guilty</hi> of,
humbly to <hi>confess</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and immediately to
<hi>forsake</hi> for the rest of our time.</p>
                  <p>8. All I shall add concerning this duty of
<hi>patience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In all sorts of <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
                     </note> is, that we are as much bound to it in
one sort of <hi>sufferings,</hi> as another, whether
our <hi>suffering</hi> be so <hi>immediately</hi> from <hi>Gods</hi>
hand, that no creature hath any thing to do
in it, as <hi>sickness,</hi> or the like; or whether it
be such, wherein <hi>men</hi> are the <hi>instruments</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:96830:35"/>
of <hi>afflicting</hi> us. For it is most sure, when
any man doth us hurt, he could not do it,
without <hi>Gods permission,</hi> and <hi>sufferance,</hi> and
<hi>God,</hi> may as well make them the <hi>instruments</hi> of
<hi>punishing</hi> us, as do it more <hi>directly</hi> by <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi>
and it is but a <hi>counterfeit patience,</hi> that
pretends to <hi>submit</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and yet can <hi>bear</hi>
nothing from men; we see <hi>holy Iob,</hi> who
is set forth to us as a <hi>pattern of true pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
made no such <hi>difference</hi> in his <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
he took the <hi>loss</hi> of his <hi>Cattel,</hi> which
the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans</hi> rob'd him of,
with the very same <hi>meekness,</hi> with which
he did that, which was <hi>consumed</hi> by <hi>fire
from heaven.</hi> When therefore we suffer
any thing from <hi>men,</hi> be it never so <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly</hi>
in <hi>respect</hi> of them, we are yet to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess</hi>
it most <hi>just</hi> in <hi>respect</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and
therefore in stead of looking upon them
with <hi>rage,</hi> and <hi>revenge,</hi> as the <hi>common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi>
of the <hi>world</hi> is, we are to look up
to <hi>God,</hi> acknowledg his <hi>justice</hi> in the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,</hi>
begging his <hi>pardon</hi> most earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for those <hi>sins,</hi> which have provoked him
to send it, and <hi>patiently</hi> and <hi>thankfully</hi> bear
it, till he shall see fit to <hi>remove</hi> it; still say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>Job, Blessed be the name of the

                  <p>9. But I told you,<note place="margin">Submission to <hi>Gods</hi> Wisdom.</note> 
                     <hi>humility</hi> contained in
it a <hi>submission</hi> not only to his <hi>Will,</hi> but also
to his <hi>Wisdom;</hi> That is, to acknowledg
him <hi>infinitely</hi> wise, and therefore that
whatever he doth, is <hi>best</hi> and <hi>fittest</hi> to

be done. And this we are to <hi>confess</hi> both
in his <hi>commands,</hi> and in his <hi>disposing,</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering</hi>
of things: First,<note place="margin">In his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> whatsoever he <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi>
us, either to <hi>believe</hi> or <hi>do,</hi> we are to <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>
to his <hi>wisdom</hi> in both, to <hi>believe</hi> whatever
he <hi>bids</hi> us <hi>believe,</hi> how <hi>impossible</hi> soever it seem
to our <hi>shallow</hi> understandings, and to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he <hi>commands</hi> us to do, how <hi>contrary</hi>
soever it be to our <hi>fleshly reason,</hi> or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
and in both to <hi>conclude</hi> that his
<hi>commands</hi> are most fit and <hi>reasonable</hi> however
they <hi>appear</hi> to us.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Secondly,</hi>

in what concerns <hi>every</hi> one of us in <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi>
so that what <hi>condition</hi> soever he

his <hi>good</hi> that <hi>God</hi> should <hi>chuse</hi> for him, then
he for <hi>himself,</hi> even as it is much more for the

are we, we many times <hi>eagerly desire</hi>
those things, which would <hi>undoe</hi> us, if we

when if we had them, they would only prove

often <hi>denies</hi> us those things, which he sees
will tend to our <hi>mischief,</hi> and it is his <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

                  </p>
                  <p>11. A <hi>Seventh</hi> duty to <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Honour;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Honour.</note> that
is, the <hi>paying</hi> him such a <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>respect</hi>
as belong to so great a <hi>Majestie.</hi> And this
is either <hi>inward</hi> or <hi>outward.</hi> The <hi>inward</hi> is
the <hi>exalting</hi> him in our <hi>hearts,</hi> having alwayes
the <hi>highest</hi> and most excellent <hi>esteem</hi> of him.
The <hi>outward</hi> is the <hi>manifesting</hi> and shewing
forth that <hi>inward,</hi> and that is the first <hi>general</hi>
in the <hi>whole</hi> course of our lives, the living

                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:96830:36"/>
of <hi>God.</hi> Now you know if we bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
special <hi>reverence</hi> but to a <hi>man,</hi> we will be
careful not to do any <hi>foul</hi> or base thing in his
<hi>presence,</hi> and so if we do indeed <hi>honour God,</hi> we
shall <hi>abhor</hi> to do any <hi>unworthy</hi> thing in his
sight. But <hi>God</hi> sees all things, and therefore
there is no way to <hi>shun</hi> the doing it in his <hi>sight,</hi>
if we do it at all; therefore if we do thus <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi>
him, we must never at any time do
any <hi>sinful</hi> thing.</p>
                  <p>12. But besides this <hi>general</hi> way of <hi>honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

which we may <hi>honour</hi> him, and those <hi>acts</hi> are
divers according to the several <hi>particulars,</hi>
about which they are exercised. For we are
to pay this <hi>honour</hi> not only <hi>immediately</hi> to
himself, but also by a due <hi>estimation,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all those things, that neerly <hi>relate</hi> or

and every one of these is to have some degree
of our <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>esteem.</hi>
                  </p>

is his <hi>revenue</hi> or <hi>income;</hi> that is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is his <hi>peculiar possessions,</hi> set apart for
the <hi>maintenance</hi> of those that attend his <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;</hi>
those were the <hi>Priests</hi> in time of the
<hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> now with us.
And what ever is thus set apart we must look
on with such <hi>respect</hi> as not to dare to turn it to
any <hi>other</hi> use. Of this sort some are the <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will-offerings</hi>
of men, who have sometimes
of their <hi>own</hi> accord given some of
their <hi>goods</hi> or <hi>lands</hi> to this <hi>holy</hi> use; and
whatsoever is so <hi>given,</hi> can neither by the
person that gave it, nor any other be taken

                  </p>
                  <p>15. But besides these, there was among the
<hi>Jews,</hi> and hath alwayes been in all <hi>Christian</hi>
Nations, something allotted by the <hi>Law</hi> of
the Nation, for the <hi>support</hi> and maintenance
of those that attend the <hi>service</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And
it is but just and necessary it should be so, that
those who by undertaking that <hi>Calling</hi> are
taken off from the wayes of gaining a <hi>lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>
in the world, should be <hi>provided</hi> for by
them, whose <hi>souls</hi> they watch over. And
therefore it is most reasonable, which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:96830:38"/>
urges in this matter, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 11. If
we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it
a great thing if we shal reap your carnal things?</hi>
That is, the most <hi>unreasonable</hi> for men to
grudg the bestowing a few <hi>carnal</hi> things, the
<hi>outward</hi> necessaries of this <hi>temporal</hi> life on
them, from whom they receive <hi>spiritual</hi>
things, even <hi>instruction</hi> and <hi>assistance</hi> towards
the <hi>obtaining</hi> an <hi>eternal</hi> life.</p>
                  <p>16. Now whatsoever is thus appointed for
this use,<note place="margin">The great sin of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledg.</note> may by no means be imployed to any
<hi>other.</hi> And therefore those <hi>tithes</hi> which are
here by <hi>Law allotted</hi> for the <hi>maintenance</hi> of the
<hi>Ministry,</hi> must by no means be kept back, nor
any <hi>tricks</hi> or <hi>shifts</hi> used to avoid the <hi>payment</hi>
either in <hi>whole</hi> or in <hi>part.</hi> For first it is certain,
that it is as truly <hi>theft</hi> as any other robbery can
be, <hi>Ministers</hi> having <hi>right</hi> to their <hi>tithes</hi> by the
same <hi>Law,</hi> which gives any other man right
to his <hi>estate.</hi> But then <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is another
manner of <hi>robbery,</hi> then we think of, it is a
<hi>robbing of God,</hi> whose <hi>service</hi> they were given
to maintain, and that you may not doubt the
truth of this, it is no more then <hi>God</hi> himself
hath said of it, <hi>Mal. 3. 8. Will a man rob God?
yet ye have robbed me; yet ye say, wherein have
we robbed thee? in tithes and offerings</hi>
Here it is most plain, that in <hi>Gods</hi> account the
withholding <hi>tithes</hi> is a <hi>robbing</hi> of him. And
if you please, you may in the next <hi>verse</hi> see,
what the gains of this <hi>robbery</hi> amounts to, <hi>Yea
are cursed with a curse.</hi> A <hi>curse</hi> is all is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by it, and <hi>common experience</hi> shews us,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96830:38"/>
that <hi>Gods vengeance</hi> doth in a remarkable
manner pursue this sin of <hi>Sacriledg,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</note> whether
it be that of withholding <hi>tithes,</hi> or the other
of seizing on those <hi>possessions,</hi> which have been
<hi>voluntarily</hi> consecrated to <hi>God.</hi> Men think
to inrich themselves by it; but it usually proves
directly <hi>contrary;</hi> this <hi>unlawful</hi> gain becomes
such a <hi>Canker</hi> in the estate, as often eates out
even that we had a <hi>just</hi> title too. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if you love (I will not say your souls, but)
your estates, preserve them from that danger
by a strict care never to meddle with anything
set a part for <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. A <hi>Third</hi> thing,<note place="margin">The times for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> wherein we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
our <hi>reverence</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> is the <hi>hallowing</hi>
of the <hi>times,</hi> set apart for his <hi>service.</hi> He
who hath <hi>given</hi> all our time, requires some
part of it to be paid back again, as a rent or
<hi>tribute</hi> of the whole. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> kept ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>seventh day:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lords Day</note> and we <hi>Christians</hi> the <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
or <hi>Lords day,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were in their <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
especially to <hi>remember</hi> the <hi>Creation</hi> of
the world, and we in ours, the <hi>resurrection</hi> of
<hi>Christ</hi> by which a way is made for us into that
<hi>better</hi> world we expect hereafter. Now this
<hi>day</hi> thus set a part, is to be imployed in the
<hi>worship</hi> and <hi>service</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and that <hi>first</hi> more
<hi>solemnly</hi> and <hi>publickly</hi> in the <hi>Congregation,</hi>
from which no man must then absent himself
without a <hi>just</hi> cause: and <hi>Secondly,</hi> privatly at
home; in praying with, and <hi>instructing</hi> our
<hi>families,</hi> or else in the yet more private <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of the <hi>closet,</hi> a mans own <hi>private prayers,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96830:39"/>
reading meditating,</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>And that we may be at <hi>leisure</hi> for these a <hi>rest</hi>
from all our <hi>worldly</hi> business is commanded;
therefore let no man think that a <hi>bare rest</hi> from
<hi>labour</hi> is all that is <hi>required</hi> of him on the <hi>Lords
day,</hi> but the time which he saves from the <hi>works</hi>
of his <hi>calling,</hi> he is to lay out on those <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
duties.</hi> For the <hi>Lords Day</hi> was never or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to give us a <hi>pretence</hi> for <hi>idleness,</hi> but
only to change our <hi>imployment</hi> from <hi>worldly,</hi>
to <hi>heavenly;</hi> much lesse was it meant, that
by our <hi>rest</hi> from our <hi>callings,</hi> we should have
more time free to bestow upon our <hi>sins,</hi> as
too many do, who are more <hi>constant</hi> on that
day at the <hi>Alehouse,</hi> then the <hi>Church.</hi> But
this <hi>rest</hi> was commanded, <hi>first</hi> to <hi>shadow</hi> out
to us that <hi>rest</hi> from <hi>sin</hi> which we are bound to
all the <hi>dayes of our lives.</hi> And <hi>secondly</hi> to take
us off from our <hi>worldly business,</hi> and to give
us time to attend the <hi>service</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the
need of our <hi>souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. And surely if we rightly consider it,
it is a very great <hi>benefit</hi> to us that there is such
a <hi>set time,</hi> thus weekly returning for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
We are very <hi>intent,</hi> and <hi>busy</hi> upon
the <hi>world,</hi> and if there were not some such
<hi>time</hi> appointed to our hands, it is to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we should hardly allot any our selves:
And then what a <hi>starved</hi> condition must
these poor soules of ours be in, that shall never
be afforded a meal, whereas now there
is a <hi>constant diet</hi> provided for them, every
<hi>Sunday,</hi> if we will conscionably imploy
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96830:39"/>
it, may be a <hi>festival</hi> day to them;
may bring them in such <hi>spiritual</hi> food, as
may <hi>nourish</hi> them to <hi>eternal</hi> life. We are not
to look on this day with <hi>grudging,</hi> like those
in <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5. Who ask, <hi>When will the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
be gone, that we may set forth wheat?</hi> As
if that time were utterly <hi>lost,</hi> which were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from our <hi>worldly</hi> business. But we are
to consider it, as the <hi>gainfullest,</hi> as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e <hi>joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest</hi>
day of the week, a day of <hi>harvest,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we are to lay up in <hi>store</hi> for the <hi>whole</hi> week,
nay for our <hi>whole</hi> lives.</p>
                  <p>19. But besides this of the weekly <hi>Lords</hi>
day,<note place="margin">The Feasts of the Church.</note> there are other times, which the <hi>Church</hi>
hath set apart for the <hi>remembrance</hi> of some
<hi>special mercies</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> such as the <hi>Birth,</hi> and
<hi>Resurrectoon</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Descent</hi> of the <hi>Holy
Ghost,</hi> and the like; and these <hi>dayes</hi> we are to
keep in that manner which the <hi>Church</hi> hath
ordered, to wit in the <hi>solemn worship</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
and in particular <hi>thanksgiving</hi> for that <hi>special
blessing</hi> we then remember. And surely who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is truely <hi>thankful</hi> for those rich <hi>mercies,</hi>
cannot think it too much to set apart some <hi>few
dayes</hi> in a <hi>year</hi> for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>But then we are to look that our <hi>Feasts</hi> be
truly <hi>spiritual,</hi> by imploying the day thus <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily,</hi>
and not make it an <hi>occasion</hi> of <hi>intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
and <hi>discords</hi> as too many do, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
nothing in <hi>Christmas</hi> and other <hi>good</hi>
times, but the <hi>good cheers</hi> and <hi>jollity</hi> of them.
For that is doing <hi>despight,</hi> in stead of <hi>honour</hi>
to <hi>Christ,</hi> who came to bring all <hi>purity</hi> and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96830:40"/>
                     <hi>soberness</hi> in the world, and therefore must
not have that coming of his remembred in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other <hi>manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. Other dayes there are also set a part
in <hi>memory</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and other <hi>Saints,</hi>
wherein we are to give <hi>hearty</hi> thanks to <hi>God,</hi>
for his <hi>graces</hi> in them, particularly that they
were made <hi>instruments</hi> of <hi>revealing</hi> to us
<hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and the way of <hi>salvation,</hi> as
you know the <hi>Apostles</hi> were by their <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
throughout the <hi>world.</hi> And then farther,
we are to meditate on those <hi>Examples</hi> of holy
life, they have given us, and stir up our selves
to the imitation thereof. And whoever does
uprightly set himself to make these <hi>uses</hi> of
these several <hi>holy dayes,</hi> will have cause, by
the <hi>benefit</hi> he shall find from them, to <hi>thank</hi>
and not to <hi>blame</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> for ordering
them.</p>
                  <p>21. Another sort of <hi>dayes</hi> there are,<note place="margin">The Feasts.</note> which
we are likewise to <hi>observe,</hi> and those are <hi>dayes</hi>
of <hi>fasting</hi> and <hi>humiliation;</hi> and whatever of
this kind the <hi>Church</hi> injoynes, whether <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly</hi>
at set times of the <hi>year,</hi> or upon any
<hi>special</hi> and more sudden occasion, we are to
observe in such a manner as she directs; that is,
not only in a bare <hi>abstaining</hi> from <hi>meat,</hi> which
is only the <hi>bodies punishment,</hi> but in <hi>afflicting</hi>
our <hi>soules, humbling</hi> them deeply before <hi>God,</hi>
in a <hi>hearty</hi> confessing, and <hi>bewailing</hi> of our
own, and the <hi>nations</hi> sins, in earnest <hi>Prayers</hi>
for <hi>Gods pardon,</hi> and <hi>forgiveness,</hi> and for the
turning away of those <hi>judgments,</hi> which those
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96830:40"/>
                     <hi>sins</hi> have called for, But above all, in <hi>turning
our selves from our sins, loosing the bands of
wickedness;</hi> as <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaks, Chap. 58. 6.
And exercising our selves in <hi>works</hi> of <hi>mercy,
dealing our bread to the hungry,</hi> and the like,
as it there followes.</p>
                  <p>22. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gods word</note> we are to express our <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi>
to <hi>God,</hi> by <hi>honouring</hi> his <hi>Word;</hi> and this
we must certainly do, if we do indeed <hi>honour</hi>
him; there being no surer sign of our dispising
any person, then the setting light, by what he
<hi>sayes</hi> to us; as on the <hi>contrary,</hi> if we <hi>value</hi>
one every word he speaks will be of <hi>weight</hi>
with us. Now this <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is expresly
contained in the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> and
<hi>New Testament,</hi> where he speaks to us,<note place="margin">The holy Scripture.</note> to
shew us his <hi>Will,</hi> and our <hi>duty.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to this <hi>Word</hi> of his we are to beare a <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful</hi>
respect, to look upon it, as the <hi>rules,</hi>
by which we must frame all the <hi>actions</hi> of our
life; and to that end to <hi>study</hi> it much, to read
in it as often as we can, if it may be never
to let a <hi>day</hi> pass us, without <hi>reading,</hi> or <hi>hearing</hi>
some part of it read.</p>
                  <p>23. But then that is not all: We must not
only <hi>read,</hi> but we must <hi>mark</hi> what we <hi>read,</hi>
we must diligently <hi>observe,</hi> what <hi>duties</hi> there
are which <hi>God commands</hi> us to perform, what
<hi>faults</hi> they are, which <hi>God</hi> there charges us
not to <hi>commit,</hi> together with the <hi>rewards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised</hi>
to the one, and the <hi>punishments threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
to the other. When we have thus <hi>mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
we must lay them up in our <hi>memory,</hi> not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96830:41"/>
so <hi>loosely,</hi> and <hi>carelesly,</hi> that they shall presently
<hi>drop</hi> out again; but we must so fasten them
there by often thinking, and meditating on
them, that we may have them ready for our
<hi>use.</hi> Now that <hi>use</hi> is the directing of our
<hi>lives;</hi> and therefore whenever we are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the <hi>committing</hi> of any evil, we are then
to call to mind, this is the thing, which in
such a <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>forbidden</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> and all
his vengeances threatned against it; and so
in like manner when any opportunity is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us of doing good to remember, this is the
<hi>duty,</hi> which I was <hi>exhorted</hi> to in such a <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and such <hi>glorious rewards</hi> promised to the
doing of it: and by these considerations <hi>streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
our selves for <hi>resisting</hi> of the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi>
of the good.</p>
                  <p>24. But besides this of the <hi>written</hi> Word,
it hath pleased <hi>God</hi> to provide yet further
for our <hi>instruction,</hi> by his <hi>Ministers,</hi>
whose <hi>office</hi> it is to teach us <hi>Gods Will,</hi> not
by saying any thing <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
word; (for whatsoever is so, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be <hi>Gods Will</hi>) but by <hi>explaining</hi> it,
and making it <hi>easier</hi> to our understandings,
and then <hi>applying</hi> it to our particular <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,</hi>
and <hi>exhorting,</hi> and stirring us
up to the <hi>practice</hi> of it; all which is the
<hi>end,</hi> at which <hi>first</hi> their <hi>Catechizing</hi>
and then their <hi>preaching</hi> aimeth. And to
this we are to bear also a due <hi>respect,</hi> by
giving <hi>diligent</hi> heed thereto, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
being present at <hi>Catechizings</hi> and
<hi>Sermons,</hi> and either <hi>sleep</hi> out the time, or think
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96830:41"/>
of somewhat else, but carefully <hi>marking</hi> what
is said to us. And surely if we did but rightly
consider, how much it <hi>concern</hi> us, we should
conclude it very <hi>reasonable</hi> for us to do so.</p>
                  <p>25. For <hi>First</hi> as to that of <hi>Catechizing,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</note>
it is the laying the <hi>foundation</hi> upon which all
<hi>Christian Practice</hi> must be built, for that is
the teaching us our <hi>duty,</hi> without which it
is impossible for us to perform it. And though
it is true, that the <hi>Sriptures</hi> are the <hi>Fountains,</hi>
from whence this <hi>knowledg</hi> of <hi>duty</hi> must be
fetched, yet there are many who are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to <hi>draw</hi> it from this <hi>fountain</hi> themselves,
and therefore it is absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> it should
be thus brought to them by others.</p>
                  <p>26 This <hi>Catechizing</hi> is generally look't on
as a thing belonging only to the <hi>youth,</hi> and
so indeed it ought, not because the <hi>oldest</hi> are
not to learn, if they be <hi>ignorant,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all <hi>children</hi> should be so <hi>instructed,</hi>
that it should be impossible for them, to be
<hi>ignorant</hi> when they come to <hi>years.</hi> And it
neerly concerns every <hi>Parent,</hi> as they will
free themselve; from the <hi>guilt</hi> of their <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens</hi>
eternal undoing, that they be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to see them <hi>instructed</hi> in all <hi>necessary</hi>
things; to which purpose it will be fit early
to <hi>teach</hi> then some <hi>short Catechism,</hi> of which
sort none so fit as the <hi>Church-Catechism;</hi> yet
are they not to rest on these endeavours of
their own; but also to call in the <hi>Ministers</hi>
help, that he may build them up farther in
<hi>Christian Knowledg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:96830:42"/>
27. But alas! it is too sure, that <hi>parents,</hi>
have very much neglected this <hi>duty,</hi> and by
that means it is that such <hi>multitudes</hi> of men
and women, that are called <hi>Christians,</hi> know
no more of <hi>Christ,</hi> or any thing, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
their own <hi>soules,</hi> then the mearest <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>28. But although it were their <hi>Parents</hi>
fault, that they were not <hi>instructed,</hi> when
they were <hi>young,</hi> yet it is now their own if they
remain still <hi>ignorant;</hi> and it is sure, it will be
their <hi>own ruine</hi> and <hi>misery,</hi> if they willfully
continue so. Therefore whoever it be, of what
age or condition soever, that is in this <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi>
estate, or in any such degree of it, that
he wants any part of <hi>necessary saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg;</hi>
let him as he loves his <hi>soul,</hi> as ever he
would escape <hi>eternal damnation,</hi> seek out for <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi>
&amp; let no fear of <hi>shame</hi> keep any from
it; for <hi>first</hi> it is certain the <hi>shame</hi> belongs only
to the <hi>wilful</hi> continuing in <hi>ignorance,</hi> to which
the desire of <hi>learning</hi> is directly <hi>contrary,</hi> and
is so far from a <hi>shameful,</hi> that it is a most <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable</hi>
thing, and will be sure to be so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
by all <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good</hi> men. But <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
suppose some <hi>prophane, senseless</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
should deride it, yet sure that <hi>shame</hi> were
in all reason to be undergon <hi>joyfully,</hi> rather
then venture on that <hi>confusion</hi> of <hi>face,</hi> which
will at the day of <hi>judgment</hi> befal those, who to
avoidalittle <hi>false shame</hi> amongst men, have gone
on in a <hi>wilful ignorance</hi> of their <hi>duty,</hi> which <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi>
wil be so far from <hi>excusing</hi> any sins they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96830:42"/>
shall commit, that it <hi>adds</hi> one great &amp; <hi>heavy</hi> sin
to all the rest, even the <hi>dispising</hi> that <hi>knowledg,</hi>
which is offered to them. How hainous a sin
that is, you may learn in the <hi>First Chapter</hi> of
the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> where <hi>hating knowledg,</hi> ver. 29.
is said to be the thing that <hi>draws down</hi> those
sad <hi>vengeances</hi> forementioned, even <hi>Gods forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
men, <hi>laughing</hi> at their <hi>calamity,</hi> in stead of
<hi>helping</hi> them: W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is of all other conditions in
the world, the most <hi>miserable,</hi> &amp; surely they are
<hi>madly</hi> desperat, that will run themselves into it.</p>
                  <p>29. As for those who have already this
<hi>foundation</hi> laid, by the <hi>knowledg</hi> of the <hi>grounds</hi>
of <hi>Christian</hi> Religon, there is yet for them a
farther help provided, by <hi>Preaching.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Preaching.</note> And
it is no more then needs, for <hi>God</hi> knows, those
that <hi>understand</hi> their duty well enough, are too
apt to <hi>forget</hi> it; nay, sometimes by the <hi>violence</hi>
of their own <hi>lusts</hi> to <hi>transgress</hi> it, even when
they do <hi>remember</hi> it, and therefore it is very
useful, we should often be put in mind of it,
to prevent our <hi>forgetting,</hi> and also often
<hi>exhorted</hi> and <hi>assisted,</hi> to <hi>withstand</hi> those <hi>lusts</hi>
which draw us to those <hi>transgressions.</hi> And
to these purposes preaching is intended; <hi>First,</hi>
to warn us, to be upon our <hi>guard</hi> against our
<hi>spiritual enemy,</hi> and then to furnish us with
<hi>weapons</hi> for the fight; that is, such means and
<hi>helps,</hi> as may best enable us to beat off <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi>
and get the <hi>victory</hi> over them.</p>
                  <p>30. Since therefore this is the end of <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
we must not think we have done our <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
when we have heard a <hi>Sermon,</hi> though
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96830:43"/>
never so attentively, but we must lay up in our
hearts those <hi>instructions,</hi> and advices we there
meet with &amp; use them <hi>faithfully</hi> to that end of
<hi>overcoming</hi> our sins. Therefore when ever thou
comest to the <hi>Physician</hi> of thy <hi>soul,</hi> do as thou
wouldst with the <hi>Physician</hi> of thy <hi>body;</hi> thou
comest to him not only to <hi>hear</hi> him talk, and
tell thee what will <hi>cure</hi> thee, but also to do
according to his <hi>directions;</hi> and if thou dost
not so here, thou art as vain, as he that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
a bare <hi>receipt</hi> from his <hi>Doctor</hi> shall <hi>cure</hi>
him, though he never make use of it. Nay, thou
art much more vain and <hi>ridiculous,</hi> for that
though it do him no good, will do him no
<hi>harm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> he shall be never the <hi>worse</hi> for having
bin taught a <hi>medicine,</hi> though he use it not:
but in these <hi>spiritual receipts,</hi> it is otherwise,
if we use them not to our <hi>good,</hi> they will do us
a great deal of <hi>harm,</hi> they will rise up in <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
against us, and make our <hi>condemnation</hi>
so much the <hi>heavier.</hi> Beware therefore not
to bring that <hi>danger</hi> upon thy self, but when
thou hast heard a <hi>Sermon,</hi> consider with thy
self what <hi>directions</hi> there were in it, for enabling
thee to eschew <hi>evil,</hi> or to do <hi>good.</hi> And if
there were any thing especially concern'd thine
own <hi>bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ome sin,</hi> lay that close to thy heart,
and all the week after make it matter of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion,
think of it even whilst thou art at thy
work, if thou wantest other time; and not only
think of it, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et to the <hi>practice</hi> of it, do what
thou wert advised to, for the <hi>subduing</hi> sins
and quickning <hi>grace</hi> in thee. Finally look
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96830:43"/>
carefully to <hi>practice</hi> the counsel of the <hi>Apostle,
Ia. 1. 22. Be ye doers of the word not hearers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deceiving your own soules:</hi> to hope for <hi>good</hi>
from the <hi>word,</hi> without <hi>doing</hi> of it, is, it seems,
nothing but a <hi>deceiving</hi> our selves; Let us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
therefore measure our <hi>godliness</hi> by the
<hi>number</hi> of <hi>Sermons</hi> which we hear, as if the
<hi>hearing</hi> many were a certain mark of a good
<hi>Christian,</hi> but by the store of <hi>fruit</hi> we bring
forth by them, without which all our <hi>hearing</hi>
will serve but to bring us in that <hi>heavier</hi> por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>stripes,</hi> which belongs to him that
<hi>knows his Masters will and does it not, Lu.
12.</hi> 47. But this <hi>reverence</hi> which is due to
<hi>preaching</hi> we must not pay to all that is now a
dayes called so, for <hi>God</hi> knows there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>false Prophets gone out into the world,</hi> as
the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4 1. And now, if
ever, is that <hi>advice</hi> of his necessary, to <hi>trie the
Spirits whether they be of God:</hi> But what I
have sayed, I mean only of the <hi>preaching</hi> of
those, who <hi>first</hi> have a <hi>lawfull calling</hi> to the
<hi>Office,</hi> and <hi>secondly</hi> frame their <hi>doctrine</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>right rule,</hi> the <hi>written word</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
But if any man say he is not able to <hi>judg</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>doctrine</hi> be according to the <hi>Word</hi> or
no, let him at least try it by the <hi>common</hi> known
rules of <hi>duty,</hi> which he doth understand, and if
he find it a <hi>doctrine,</hi> giving men liberty to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>
those things, which are by all acknowledged
<hi>sins;</hi> such as <hi>rebellion, injustice, unmercifulness,
uncleanness,</hi> or the like he may conclude it is
utterly <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Word,</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:96830:44"/>
and then <hi>abhorence,</hi> and not <hi>reverence</hi> belongs
to it.</p>
                  <p>31. <hi>Fifthly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> we are to express our <hi>honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> by <hi>receiving</hi> his <hi>Sacraments,</hi> those
are two, <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and the <hi>Supper of the Lord.</hi>
And this we are to do; <hi>First,</hi> by our high <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem</hi>
of them; <hi>Secondly,</hi> by our <hi>reverent
usage</hi> of them; we are <hi>first</hi> to prize them at
a <hi>high</hi> rate, looking on them, as the <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of bringing to us the greatest <hi>blessings</hi>
we can receive. The <hi>first</hi> of them, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme</hi>
that enters us into <hi>covenant</hi> with <hi>God,</hi>
makes us <hi>members</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp; so gives us right
to all those <hi>precious benefits,</hi> that flow from
him, to wit <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>sins, sanctifying grace,</hi>
and <hi>heaven</hi> it self, on <hi>condition</hi> we perform
our parts of the <hi>covenant.</hi> And as for the <hi>Lords
Supper,</hi> that is not only a <hi>signe</hi> and <hi>remembrance</hi>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>death;</hi> but it is actually the
<hi>giving Christ,</hi> and all the <hi>fruits</hi> of his <hi>death</hi> to
every <hi>worthy</hi> receiver, and therefore there is a
most <hi>highest estimation,</hi> and <hi>value</hi> due to each
of them.</p>
                  <p>32. And not only so;<note place="margin">Of Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sme.</note> but in the <hi>second</hi> place we
must shew our <hi>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>erence</hi> in our <hi>usage</hi> of them,
and that <hi>First before, Secondly at,</hi> and <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after</hi> the time of <hi>receiving</hi> them. It is true
that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Baptisme</hi> being now
administered to us, when we are <hi>infants,</hi> it
is not to be expected of us, that we should in
our <hi>own persons</hi> do any thing, either before or
at the time of <hi>receiving</hi> it, those performances
were strictly required of all persons, who were
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96830:44"/>
                     <hi>baptised,</hi> when they were of <hi>years.</hi> But for
us, it suffices to give us right to <hi>Baptisme,</hi>
that we are <hi>born</hi> within the <hi>pale</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
that is, of <hi>Christian parents;</hi> and all that is
required at that time, is, what we can only
perform by others, they in our stead <hi>promising</hi>
that when we come to <hi>years,</hi> we will <hi>perform</hi>
our parts of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> But by how much
the less we are then able to do, so much the
greater bond lies on us, to perform those <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-duties
required</hi> of us, by which we are to
supply the <hi>want</hi> of the former.</p>
                  <p>33. Now if you would know what those
<hi>duties</hi> are, look over those <hi>promises</hi> which your<note place="margin">The vow of Baptisme.</note>
                     <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers</hi> then made in your
name, and you may then learn them. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give you them in a better form, then that
of our <hi>Churches Catechisme</hi> which tells: That
our <hi>Godfathers and Godmothers did promise,
and vow three things in our names; First, that
we should forsake the Divel and all his works,
the pomps and vanities of this wicked world,
and all the sinful lusts of the flesh:</hi> where by
the <hi>Divel</hi> is meant. <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>worshipping</hi> of
all <hi>false gods,</hi> which is indeed but <hi>worshipping
the Divel:</hi> A sin which at the time of <hi>Christs</hi>
coming into the world, was very common;
most part of <hi>mankind</hi> then living in that vile
<hi>Idolatry.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Baptisme</hi> was
first ordained, it was but needful to make the
<hi>forsaking</hi> of those <hi>false gods,</hi> a principal part
of the <hi>vow.</hi> And though those <hi>false worships</hi>
are now much rarer, yet there was one spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96830:45"/>
part of them, which may be <hi>feared</hi> to be
yet too common among us, and that is all
sorts of <hi>un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>leanness,</hi> which though we do
not make <hi>ceremonies</hi> of our <hi>religion</hi> as the
<hi>heathens</hi> did of theirs, yet the <hi>committing</hi>
thereof is a most high <hi>provocation</hi> in <hi>Gods</hi> eyes,
such as drew him to destroy whole <hi>Cities</hi> with
<hi>fire and brimstone,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.
Nay, the <hi>whole world</hi> with <hi>water, Gen.</hi> 6.
and will not fail to bring down <hi>judgments,</hi>
and strange ones on any that continue therein;
and therefore the <hi>forsaking</hi> them well deserves
to be look't on, as an especial part of this
<hi>promise.</hi> Besides this all dealing with the
<hi>Divel</hi> is here <hi>vowed</hi> against, whether it be by
<hi>practising witcheraft</hi> our selves, or consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with those that do upon any occasion
whatever, as the <hi>recovery</hi> of our <hi>health,</hi> our
<hi>goods</hi> or what ever else. For this is a degree
of the former <hi>sin,</hi> it is the <hi>forsaking</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi>
and setting up the <hi>Divel</hi> for our <hi>God,</hi> whilst
we go to him in our needs for help</p>
                  <p>34. But we also <hi>renounce</hi> all the <hi>works</hi> of
the <hi>Divel,</hi> and those are either in general all
those which the <hi>Divel</hi> tempts us to, or else
those <hi>particular</hi> kinds of sin, which have most
of his <hi>image</hi> on them; that is, those which he
himself most <hi>practices,</hi> such are <hi>pride</hi> (which
brought him from being an <hi>Angel of light</hi>
to the <hi>accursed</hi> condition he is now in) and <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
he is, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> saith, <hi>Jo</hi> 8. 44. A
<hi>liar,</hi> and <hi>the Father of it;</hi> and such also are
malice and <hi>envy,</hi> especially <hi>killing,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying</hi>
of others, for he was a <hi>murderer from
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96830:45"/>
the beginning. Io</hi> 8. 44. But above all, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wherein we becom so like him, as in <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
&amp; drawing others to <hi>sin;</hi> which is his whole
<hi>trade,</hi> and <hi>business,</hi> and if we make it any part of
ours, we becom like that <hi>roaring Lyon,</hi> that <hi>goes
about seeking whom he may devour, 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
                  <p>35. The <hi>second</hi> thing we <hi>vow</hi> to <hi>forsake,</hi> is
the <hi>pomps and vanities of this wicked world.</hi> By
the <hi>pomps</hi> and <hi>vanities</hi> there are several things
meant, some of them, such as were used by the
<hi>heathens,</hi> in some <hi>unlawful sports</hi> of theirs,
wherein we are not now so much concern'd,
there being none of them remaining among
us but besides that, there is meant all <hi>excess</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>diet</hi> or <hi>sports, or apparel,</hi> when we keep
not those due <hi>measures,</hi> which either by the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
rules of <hi>sobriety,</hi> or the <hi>particular</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of our <hi>qualities</hi> and <hi>callings</hi> we are
bound to. Next, by the <hi>wicked world</hi> we may
understand, <hi>first</hi> the <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>greatness</hi> of the
<hi>world,</hi> which though we do not so totally <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,</hi>
that it is <hi>unlawful</hi> for a <hi>Christian</hi> to be
either rich, or great, yet we thus far <hi>promise</hi> to
<hi>forsake</hi> them, that we will not set our <hi>hearts</hi>
upon them, nor ever either get, or <hi>keep</hi> them
by the least <hi>unlawful</hi> means. <hi>Secondly</hi> by the
<hi>wicked world,</hi> we may understand the <hi>companies</hi>
and <hi>customes</hi> of the <hi>world;</hi> which so far as they
are <hi>wicked,</hi> we here <hi>renounce;</hi> that is, we <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>
never to be <hi>drawn</hi> by <hi>company</hi> to the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
of a <hi>sin,</hi> but rather to <hi>forsake</hi> the most
<hi>delightful</hi> company, then be ensnared by it; nor
yet by <hi>custome,</hi> but rather venture the <hi>shame</hi> of
being thought <hi>singular,</hi> ridiculous persons, walk
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96830:46"/>
as it were in a path by our selves, then put our
selves into that <hi>broad way, that leads to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
by giving our selves over to any <hi>sinful
custom,</hi> how <hi>common</hi> soever it be grown. If
this part of our <hi>vow</hi> were but throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
it would arme us against most of the
<hi>temptations</hi> the world offers us, <hi>company</hi> and
<hi>custome</hi> being the two special <hi>instruments</hi> by
which it works on us.</p>
                  <p>36. A <hi>third</hi> thing we renounce is all the
<hi>sinful</hi> lusts of the <hi>flesh:</hi> where the <hi>flesh</hi> is to
be understood in that sense, wherein the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
often uses it, for the <hi>fountain</hi> of all <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered</hi>
affections. For though those <hi>unclean
desires,</hi> which we ordinarily call the <hi>lusts</hi> of
the <hi>flesh,</hi> are meant here, yet they are not the
<hi>only</hi> things here contained, there being divers
<hi>other</hi> things, which the <hi>Scripture</hi> calls the
<hi>works of the flesh;</hi> I cannot better inform you
of them, then by setting down that list S.
<hi>Paul</hi> gives of them, <hi>Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. Now

will shew you, there are many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
under this part of your <hi>vow,</hi> the <hi>forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
all the <hi>sinful lusts</hi> of the <hi>flesh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>37. The <hi>secend</hi> thing our <hi>Godfathers</hi> and
<hi>Godmothers</hi> promised for us, was that <hi>we should
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96830:46"/>
belive all the Articles of the Christian faith.</hi>
These we have summed up together, in that
which we call the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> which since
we promise to <hi>believe,</hi> we are supposed also
to <hi>promise</hi> to <hi>learn</hi> them, and that not only
the <hi>words,</hi> but likewise the <hi>plain sense</hi> of them,
for who can <hi>believe</hi> what he either never <hi>heard</hi>
of, or knows not any thing of the means of
it? Now by this <hi>believing</hi> is meant not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the consenting to the <hi>truth</hi> of them, but
also the <hi>living</hi> like them that do <hi>believe;</hi> As
for <hi>Example,</hi> our <hi>believing</hi> that <hi>God created</hi>
us, should make us <hi>live</hi> in that <hi>subjection</hi> and
<hi>obedience</hi> to him, which becomes <hi>creatures</hi> to
their <hi>Creator;</hi> the <hi>believing</hi> that <hi>Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
us,</hi> should make us yeild up our selves
to him as his <hi>purchase,</hi> to be <hi>disposed</hi> wholy by
him, and <hi>imployed</hi> only in his <hi>service.</hi> The <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi>
a <hi>judgment</hi> to come, should give us care
so to walk, that we may not be <hi>condemned</hi> in it.
And our <hi>believing</hi> the <hi>life everlasting</hi> should
make us <hi>diligent</hi> so to imploy our <hi>short</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of time here, that our <hi>everlasting</hi> life
may be a life of <hi>joy,</hi> not of <hi>misery</hi> to us. In
this manner from all the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi>
we are to draw <hi>Motives</hi> to <hi>confirm</hi> us in all
<hi>Christian Practice;</hi> to which end it is that our
<hi>learning,</hi> and <hi>believing</hi> of them <hi>tends</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without it we are very far from making
good this part of our <hi>vow,</hi> the <hi>believing all the
Articles of the Christian faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>38. The <hi>last</hi> part of our <hi>vow</hi> is, that we
<hi>should keep Gods holy will and commandments,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96830:47"/>
and walk in the same all the dayes of our lives.</hi>
Where by <hi>of Gods holy will and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
is meant our <hi>doing</hi> of all those things,
which he hath made known to us to be his <hi>will</hi>
we should perform; wherein he hath given
us his <hi>holy Word</hi> to <hi>instruct</hi> us, and <hi>teach</hi> us,
what it is that he requires of us, and now he
<hi>expects</hi> that we should faithfully do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>favouring</hi> our selves in the breach of any
one of his <hi>commands.</hi> And then in this
entire <hi>obedience,</hi> we must walk <hi>all the days of
our lives:</hi> That is, we must go on in a <hi>constant</hi>
course of <hi>obeying God,</hi> not only fetch some
few <hi>steps</hi> in his <hi>ways,</hi> but walk in them, and
that not for some part of our time but <hi>all
the dayes of our lives,</hi> never turn out of them,
but go on <hi>constantly</hi> in them, as long as we
live in this world.</p>
                  <p>39. Having now thus briefly explained to
you this <hi>vow</hi> made at your <hi>Baptisme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The strict obligation of this vow of Baptism.</note> all I
shall add concerning it, is not only to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you how neerly you are concern'd in the
<hi>keeping</hi> it: and that <hi>first</hi> in respect of <hi>justice,
secondly,</hi> in respect of <hi>advantage</hi> and <hi>benefit.</hi>
That you are in <hi>justice</hi> bound to it, I need say
no more, but that it is a <hi>promise,</hi> and you
know <hi>justice requires</hi> of every man the <hi>keeping</hi>
of his <hi>promise.</hi> But then this is of all other <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi>
the most <hi>solemn</hi> and binding, for it is a
<hi>vow;</hi> that is, a <hi>promise</hi> made to <hi>God;</hi> and
therefore we are not only <hi>unjust,</hi> but <hi>forsworn,</hi>
when ever we <hi>break</hi> any part of it.</p>
                  <p>40. But <hi>secondly</hi> we are also highly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:96830:47"/>
to keep it, in respect of our own <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</hi>
I told you before, that <hi>Baptisme</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us into <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> now a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
is made up of <hi>two</hi> parts; that is, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>promise</hi> by the <hi>one party,</hi> and something
by the other of the parties that make the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
And if one of them <hi>break</hi> his part
of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> that is, perform not what
he hath <hi>agreed</hi> to, he can in no reason look
that the other should make good his. And
so it is here, <hi>God</hi> doth indeed <hi>promise</hi> those
<hi>benefits</hi> before mentioned, and that is his part
of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> But then we also undertake
to perform the <hi>several</hi> things contained in this
<hi>vow</hi> of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and that is our <hi>part</hi> of it,
and unless we do indeed perform them, <hi>God</hi>
is not tied to make good his, and so we <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit</hi>
all those <hi>precious</hi> benefits and <hi>advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
we are left in that <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>miserable</hi>
estate of ours, <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>wrath, enemies of
God, and heirs of eternal damnation.</hi> And
now what can be the <hi>pleasure,</hi> that any or all
sins can offord us, that can make us the least
degree of <hi>recompence</hi> for such a <hi>loss,</hi> the <hi>loss</hi>
of <hi>Gods favour</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> here, and the loss of
our own soules hereafter: for as our <hi>Saviour</hi>
saith, <hi>Mar. 8. 36. What shall it profit a
man; if he shall gain the whole world, and lose
his own soul:</hi> yet this <hi>mad</hi> bargain we make,
whenever we <hi>break</hi> any part of this our <hi>vow</hi> of
<hi>Baptisme.</hi> It therefore most neerly <hi>concerns</hi>
us to consider <hi>sadly</hi> of it; to remember, that
every <hi>sin</hi> we commit, is a direct <hi>breach</hi> of this
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96830:48"/>
                     <hi>vow,</hi> and therefore when thou art <hi>tempted</hi> to
any <hi>sin,</hi> seem it never so <hi>light,</hi> say not of it,
as <hi>Lot</hi> did of <hi>Zoar, Gen. 6. 20. Is it not a
little one?</hi> but consider, that whatever it is,
thou hast in thy <hi>Baptisme vowed</hi> against it,
and then be it never so little, it <hi>draws</hi> a great
one at the <hi>heeles</hi> of it, no less then that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>forsworn,</hi> which whoever commits, <hi>God</hi> hath
in the <hi>third Commandment pronounced, he will
not hold him guiltless.</hi> And that we may the
better keep this <hi>vow,</hi> it will be very <hi>useful</hi>
often to repeat to our selves the several <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
of it, that so we may still have it ready
in our <hi>minds,</hi> to set against all <hi>temptations;</hi>
and surely it is so excellent a <hi>weapon,</hi> that if
we do not either <hi>cast</hi> it aside, or use it very
<hi>negligently,</hi> it will enable us by <hi>Gods help</hi> to
put to <hi>flight</hi> our <hi>spiritual</hi> adversary. And this
is that <hi>reverence</hi> we are to pay to this first <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
that of <hi>Baptisme.</hi>

<hi>examination,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> I must in the <hi>general</hi> tell you
that the <hi>special</hi> business we have to do in this
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> is to <hi>repeat,</hi> and <hi>renew</hi> that <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:96830:49"/>
we made with <hi>God</hi> in our <hi>Baptisme,</hi> which
we having many wayes grievously <hi>broken,</hi> it
pleases <hi>God</hi> in this great mercy to suffer us to
come to the <hi>renewing</hi> of it in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
which if we do in <hi>sincerity</hi> of heart, he hath
<hi>promised</hi> to <hi>accept</hi> as, and to give us all those
<hi>benefits</hi> in this, which he was ready to bestow
in the <hi>other Sacrament,</hi> if we had not by our
own fault <hi>forfeited</hi> them. Since then the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing</hi>
of our <hi>Covenant</hi> is our business of this
time, it followes that these three things are
necessary towards it; <hi>First,</hi> that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what that <hi>covenant</hi> is; <hi>Secondly,</hi> that
we consider, what our <hi>breaches</hi> of it have
bin; and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that we resolve upon a
<hi>strict</hi> observance of it, for the <hi>rest</hi> of our life.
And the <hi>trying</hi> our selves in <hi>every</hi> one of these
particulars, is that <hi>examination</hi> which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us, before we come to this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. And <hi>first</hi> we are to <hi>examine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of our knowledg.</note> whether
we <hi>understand</hi> what this <hi>Covenant</hi> is; this
is, exceeding necessary, as being the <hi>foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of both the other, for it is neither <hi>possible</hi> to
discover our <hi>past</hi> sins, nor to settle <hi>purpose</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them for the <hi>future</hi> without it. Let
this therefore be your <hi>first</hi> business. <hi>Trie</hi>
whether you rightly understand what that
<hi>Covenant</hi> is, which you entered into at
your <hi>Baptisme,</hi> what be the <hi>mercies</hi> promised
on <hi>Gods</hi> part, and the <hi>duties</hi> on yours. And
because the <hi>Covenant</hi> made with each of us
in <hi>Baptisme,</hi> is only the applying to our <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:96830:49"/>
the <hi>Covenant</hi> made by <hi>God,</hi> in
<hi>Christ,</hi> with all mankind in <hi>general,</hi> you are
to consider, whether you <hi>understand</hi> that;
if you do not, you must immediately seek for
<hi>instruction</hi> in it. And till you have means of
gaining better, look over what is briefly said
in the entrance to this treatise, concerning the
<hi>second Covenant,</hi> which is the <hi>foundation</hi> of
that <hi>Covenant,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> makes with us in
our <hi>Baptisme.</hi> And because you will there
find, that obedience to all <hi>Gods Commands</hi>
is the <hi>condition required</hi> of us; and is also that,
which we expresly <hi>vow</hi> in our <hi>Baptisme,</hi> it is
necessary you should likewise know, what those
<hi>Commands</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are. Therefore if you
find you are <hi>ignorant</hi> of them, never be at rest,
till you have got your self <hi>instructed</hi> in them,
and have gained such a measure of <hi>knowledg,</hi>
as may direct you to do that <hi>Whole Duty of
Man,</hi> which God requires. And the giving
thee this <hi>instruction</hi> is the only aim of <hi>this</hi>
Book; which the more <hi>ignorant</hi> thou art, the
more <hi>earnestly</hi> I shall intreat thee, <hi>diligently</hi>
to read. And if thou hast heretofore <hi>approacht</hi>
to this <hi>holy Sacrament</hi> in utter <hi>ignorance</hi> of
these <hi>necessary</hi> things, bewail thy sin in soe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but presume not to come again, till thou
have by gaining this <hi>necessary knowledg</hi> fitted
thy self for it, which thou must hasten to do.
For though no man must come to the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in such <hi>ignorance,</hi> yet if he wilfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in it, that will be no <hi>excuse</hi> to him for
keeping from this holy Table.</p>

4. The <hi>second</hi> part of our <hi>examination</hi> is
concerning our <hi>breaches</hi> of this <hi>Covenant,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sins.</note>
and here thou wilt find the use of that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi>
I spake of. For there is no way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
what our <hi>sins</hi> have bin, but by <hi>try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
our actions by that which should be the
<hi>rule</hi> of them,<note place="margin">Several sorts.</note> the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou settest to this part of <hi>examination,</hi>
remember what are the several branches of
thy <hi>duty,</hi> and then ask thy <hi>own</hi> heart in every
particular, how thou hast <hi>performed</hi> it. And
content not thy self with knowing in <hi>general,</hi>
that thou hast broken <hi>Gods Law,</hi> but do thy
utmost to discover in what <hi>particulars</hi> thou
hast done so. Recal as well as thou canst,
all the passages of thy life, and in each of them
consider, what part of that duty hath bin
<hi>transgrest</hi> by it. And that not only in the
<hi>grosser</hi> act, but in <hi>word</hi> also, nay even in thy
most <hi>secret thoughts.</hi> For though mans <hi>Law</hi>
reaches not to them, yet <hi>Gods</hi> doth; so that
whatever he forbids in the act, he forbids like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>desires,</hi> and sees them
as cleerly as our most <hi>publick acts.</hi> This par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng <hi>necessary;</hi> For there
is no promise of <hi>forgiveness</hi> of any sin, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to him that <hi>confesseth</hi> and <hi>forsaketh</hi> it. Now
to both these it is necessary, that we have a
<hi>distinct</hi> and particular <hi>knowledg</hi> of our sins. For
how can he either <hi>confess</hi> his sin, that <hi>knows</hi>
not his guilt of it? or how can he <hi>resolve</hi> to
<hi>forsake</hi> it, that discerns not himself to have
formerly <hi>cleaved</hi> to it? Therefore we may
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96830:50"/>
surely conclude, that this <hi>examination</hi> is not
only <hi>useful,</hi> but <hi>necessary</hi> towards a <hi>full,</hi> and
compleat <hi>repentance;</hi> for he that does not
take this <hi>particular</hi> view of his <hi>sins;</hi> will be
likely to <hi>repent</hi> but by <hi>halves,</hi> which will never
avail him towards his <hi>pardon;</hi> nothing but an
entire forsaking of <hi>every evil way,</hi> being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for that. But surely of all other times
it concerns us, that when we come to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
our <hi>repentance</hi> be <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat,</hi>
and therefore this strict search of our <hi>own</hi>
hearts is then especially <hi>necessary.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be true, that it is not <hi>possible</hi> by all
our <hi>diligence</hi> to discover, or remember every
sin of our whole <hi>lives:</hi> And though it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
true, that what is so unavoidably hid from
us, may be forgiven without any more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>confession,</hi> then that of <hi>Davids, Psalm
19. 12. Cleanse thou me from my secret faults,</hi>
yet this will be no plea for us, if they come
to be <hi>secret,</hi> only because we are <hi>negl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>gent</hi> in
searching. Therefore take heed of <hi>deceiving</hi>
thy self in this <hi>weighty</hi> business, but search thy
soul to the <hi>bottom,</hi> without which it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the <hi>wounds</hi> thereof should ever be
<hi>throughly</hi> cured.</p>
                  <p>5. And as you are to inquire thus narrowly
concerning the <hi>several sorts</hi> of sins,<note place="margin">Degrees.</note> so also
must you concerning the <hi>degrees</hi> of them;
for there are divers <hi>circumstances,</hi> which <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,</hi>
and heighten the sin. Of this sort there
are many. As <hi>first,</hi> when we sin against <hi>knowledg,</hi>
that is, when we certainly <hi>know</hi> such a thing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96830:51"/>
to be a <hi>sin,</hi> yet for the present <hi>pleasure</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi>
(or whatever other motive) adventure of
it. This is by <hi>Christ</hi> himself adjudged to be
a great <hi>heightning</hi> of the <hi>sin. He that knows
his Masters will, and doth it not, shall be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with many stripes, Luke 12. 47. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
when we sin with <hi>deliberation;</hi> that is,
when we do not fall into it of a <hi>sudden,</hi> ere
we are <hi>aware,</hi> but have time to <hi>consider</hi> of it,
this is another degree of the sin. But <hi>thirdly</hi> a
yet <hi>higher</hi> is, when we do it against the <hi>resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
and <hi>checks</hi> of our own <hi>conscience,</hi> when
<hi>that</hi> at the time tells us, this thing thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
not to do; Nay, layes before us the <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
as well as the <hi>sin</hi> of it, yet in spight of
these <hi>admonitions</hi> of <hi>conscience,</hi> we go on
and commit the sin; this is a huge <hi>increase</hi> of
it, such as will raise the lest sin into a most
<hi>high provocation.</hi> For it is plain, a sin thus
committed must be a <hi>wilful</hi> one, and then be
the <hi>matter</hi> of it never so <hi>light,</hi> it is most hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
in <hi>Gods</hi> eyes. Nay, this is a <hi>circumstance</hi>
of such force, that it may make an <hi>indifferent</hi>
action, that is in it self no sin, become one.
For though my <hi>conscience</hi> should erre in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
me such a thing were <hi>unlawful,</hi> yet so
long as I were so <hi>perswaded,</hi> it were sin for
me to do that thing; for in that case my will
<hi>consents</hi> to the doing a thing, which I <hi>believe</hi>
to be <hi>displeasing</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> &amp; <hi>God</hi> (who judges us
by our will, not our <hi>understandings,</hi>) imputes it
to me as a sin, as well as if the thing were in it
self <hi>unlawful,</hi> &amp; therefore surely we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96830:51"/>
that any thing which is in it self <hi>sinful,</hi>
is made much more so by being <hi>committed</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>checks</hi> of <hi>conscience.</hi> A <hi>fourth ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation</hi>
of a sin is, when it hath bin often
repeated, for then there is not only the guilt
of so many more <hi>Acts,</hi> but every Act grows
also so much <hi>worse,</hi> and more inexcusable.
We alwayes judg thus in faults committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>our selves,</hi> we can forgive a <hi>single</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
more easily then the same, when it hath
bin <hi>repeated,</hi> and the oftner it hath bin so <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,</hi>
the more hainous we account it. And
so surely it is in faults against <hi>God</hi> also. <hi>Fifthly,</hi>
the <hi>sins</hi> which have bin <hi>committed</hi> after <hi>vows,</hi>
and <hi>resolutions</hi> of <hi>amendment</hi> are yet more
<hi>grievous:</hi> for that contains also the <hi>breaking</hi>
of those <hi>promises.</hi> Somewhat of this, there is in
every <hi>wilful</hi> sin, because every such is a breach
of that <hi>vow</hi> we make at <hi>Baptisme;</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that, we have since bound our selves by
<hi>new vowes,</hi> if at no other time, yet surely at
our <hi>coming</hi> to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> that being
(as was formerly said) purposely to <hi>repeat</hi> our
<hi>vow</hi> of <hi>Baptisme.</hi> And the more of these
<hi>vowes</hi> we have made, so much the greater is
our <hi>guilt;</hi> if we fall back to any <hi>sin,</hi> we then
renounced. This is a thing very well <hi>worth</hi>
weighing, &amp; therefore <hi>examine</hi> thy self parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
at thy approach to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
thy breaches of <hi>former vowes</hi> made at
the <hi>holy Table.</hi> And if upon any other <hi>occasion,</hi>
as <hi>sickness, trouble</hi> of mind, or the like, thou hast
at any time made any other, call thy self to a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96830:52"/>
strict <hi>account</hi> how thou hast performed
them also, and remember that every sin
committed against such <hi>vowes</hi> is besides its
own <hi>natural</hi> guilt, a <hi>perjury</hi> likewise.
<hi>Sixthly,</hi> a yet higher step is, when a sin hath
bin so <hi>often committed,</hi> that we are come to
a <hi>custome</hi> and <hi>habit</hi> of it: and that is indeed a
<hi>high</hi> degree.</p>
                  <p>6. Yet even of <hi>habits</hi> some are worse
then others; as <hi>first,</hi> if it be so <hi>confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
that we are come to a <hi>hardness</hi> of
heart, have no <hi>sense</hi> at all of the sin;
or <hi>secondly,</hi> if we go on in it against any
<hi>extraordinary</hi> means used by <hi>God</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us, such as <hi>sickness,</hi> or any other
<hi>affliction,</hi> which seemes to be sent on purpose
for our <hi>reclaiming.</hi> Or <hi>thirdly,</hi> if all <hi>reproofs</hi>
and <hi>exhortations</hi> either of <hi>Ministers</hi> or <hi>private
friends</hi> work not on us, but either make us <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry</hi>
at our <hi>reprovers,</hi> or set us on <hi>defending</hi>
the sin. Or <hi>Lastly,</hi> if this sinful <hi>habit</hi> be so
strong in us, as to give us a <hi>love</hi> to the sin,
not only in our selves, but in others; if as the
<hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>Rom. 1. 31. We do not only do
the things, but take pleasure in them that do
them,</hi> and therefore intice and <hi>draw</hi> as man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
as we can into the same <hi>sins</hi> with us: Then it
is risen to the <hi>highest</hi> step of wickedness, and
is to be look't on as the utmost <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gree</hi> both of
<hi>sin</hi> and <hi>danger.</hi> Thus you see how you are to
<hi>examine</hi> your selves concerning your <hi>sins,</hi> in
each of which you are to consider how many
of these <hi>heightning circumstances</hi> there have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96830:52"/>
bin, that so you may aright <hi>measure</hi> the
<hi>hainousness</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>7. Now the end of this <hi>examination</hi> is
to bring you to such a <hi>sight</hi> of your <hi>sins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
as may truly <hi>humble</hi> you, make you sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of your own <hi>danger,</hi> that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
so great a <hi>Majesty,</hi> who is able so
sadly to <hi>revenge</hi> himself upon you. And
that will surely even to the most carnal heart
appear a reasonable ground of <hi>sorrow.</hi> But
that is not all, it must likewise bring you
to a <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>abhorrence</hi> of your <hi>baseness,</hi>
and <hi>ingratitude,</hi> that have thus offended
so <hi>good</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> a <hi>God,</hi> that have made
such unworthy and unkinde returnes to those
<hi>tender</hi> and rich mercies of his. And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
especially must melt your hearts
into a deep <hi>sorrow</hi> and <hi>contrition,</hi> the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi>
whereof must be in some measure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to the <hi>degree</hi> of your sins. And
the greater it is, provided it be not such
as shuts up the <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>Gods Mercy,</hi> the
more acceptable it is to <hi>God,</hi> who hath
promised not to <hi>despise a broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
heart, Psal.</hi> 51. 17. And the more
likely it will be also to bring us to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For if we have once felt what the
smart of a wounded <hi>Spirit</hi> is, we shall
have the lesse mind to venture upon <hi>sin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>8. For when we are <hi>tempted</hi> with
any of the short <hi>pleasures</hi> of sin, we
may then out of our own experience
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96830:53"/>
set against them the sharp <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>terrors</hi> of
an <hi>accusing conscience,</hi> which will to any that
hath felt them; be able infinitely to outweigh
them. Endeavour therefore to bring your
soul to this <hi>melting</hi> temper, to this deep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
<hi>sorrow,</hi> and that not only for the <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
you have brought upon your self, for
though that be a consideration that may and
ought to work <hi>sadness</hi> in us, yet where that
alone is the <hi>motive</hi> of our <hi>sorrow,</hi> it is not that
<hi>sorrow</hi> which will avail us for <hi>pardon;</hi> and the
reason of it is clear, for that <hi>sorrow</hi> proceeds
only from the <hi>love</hi> of our selves, we are <hi>sorry,</hi>
because we are like to <hi>smart.</hi> But the <hi>sorrow</hi> of
a true <hi>penitent</hi> must be enjoyned also with the
<hi>love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contrition.</note> and that will make us grieve for
having <hi>offended</hi> him, though there were no
<hi>punishment</hi> to fall upon our selves. The way
then to stir up this <hi>sorrow</hi> in us, is <hi>first</hi> to stir
up our <hi>love of God,</hi> by repeating to our selves
the many gracious <hi>Acts</hi> of his mercy towards
us, particularly that of his <hi>sparing</hi> us, and not
<hi>cutting</hi> us off in our <hi>sins.</hi> Consider with thy
self how many and how great <hi>provocations</hi>
thou hast offered him, perhaps in a <hi>continued</hi>
course of many years <hi>wilful</hi> disobedience, for
which thou mightst with perfect <hi>justice</hi> have
bin ere this sent <hi>quick</hi> into <hi>Hell;</hi> Nay, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
thou hast before thee many examples of
less <hi>sinners,</hi> then thou art, who have bin sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
snatcht away in the midst of their <hi>sins.</hi>
And what cause canst thou give, why thou
hast thus long escaped, but only because his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96830:53"/>
                     <hi>eye hath spared thee.</hi> And what cause of that
<hi>sparing,</hi> but his tender <hi>compassions</hi> towards thee,
his unwillingness that thou should'st <hi>perish?</hi>
This consideration if it be prest home upon thy
<hi>soul,</hi> cannot chuse (if thy heart be not as hard
as the <hi>neather Milstone</hi>) but awake somewhat
of <hi>love</hi> in thee towards this <hi>gracious,</hi> this
<hi>long-suffering God,</hi> and that <hi>love</hi> will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make it appear to thee, that it is an <hi>evil
thing, and a bitter, that thou hast forsaken the
Lord, Ier.</hi> 2. 19. That thou hast made such
<hi>wretched</hi> requitals of so great <hi>mercy;</hi> it will
make thee both <hi>ashamed</hi> and <hi>angry</hi> at thy self,
that thou hast bin such an <hi>unthankful</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But if the consideration of this one sort
of <hi>mercy, Gods forbearance</hi> only, be such an
engagement, and help to this <hi>Godly sorrow,</hi>
what will then be the multitude of those other
<hi>mercies,</hi> which every man is able to reckon up
to himself? and therefore let every man be as
<hi>particular</hi> in it as he can call to mind as many
of them as he is able that so he may attain to
the <hi>greater</hi> degree of <hi>true contrition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. And to all these <hi>endeavours</hi> most be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>earnest prayers</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> that he by his <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spirit</hi> would shew you your sins, and soften
your hearts, that you may thorowly <hi>bewail,</hi>
and <hi>lament</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>10. To this must be joyned an <hi>humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
of sins to <hi>God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Confession.</note> and that not only in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi>
but also in <hi>particular,</hi> as far as your
<hi>memory</hi> of them will reach, and that with all
those <hi>heightning</hi> circumstances of them, which
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96830:54"/>
you have by the forementioned <hi>examination</hi>
discovered. Yea even <hi>secret,</hi> and <hi>forgotten</hi> sins
must in <hi>general</hi> be acknowledged; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
there are <hi>multitudes</hi> of such, so that it is
necessary for every one of us to say with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Psal. 19. 12. Who can understand his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
cleanse thou me from my secret faults.</hi>
When you have thus <hi>confest</hi> your sins, with
this hearty <hi>sorrow,</hi> and sincere <hi>hatred</hi> of them,
you may then (and not before) be concluded
to feel so much of your <hi>disease,</hi> that it will be
seasonable to apply the <hi>remedy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. In the <hi>next</hi> place therefore you are to
look on him, whom <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>set forth to be the
propitiation of our sins, Rom. 3. 25. Even Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ that Lamb of God, who taketh away
the sins of the world Io.</hi> 1. 29. And earnestly
beg of <hi>God,</hi> that by his most <hi>precious blood,</hi> your
sins may be washed away, and that <hi>God</hi> would
for his sake be <hi>reconciled</hi> to you. And this
you are to believe will surely be done, if you
do for the rest of your time <hi>forsake</hi> your sins,
and give your selves up sincerely to <hi>obey God</hi> in
all his <hi>commands.</hi> But without that, it is vain
to hope any benefit from <hi>Christ,</hi> or his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
And therefore the <hi>next</hi> part of your
<hi>preparation</hi> must be the setting those <hi>resoluti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ns</hi>
of <hi>obedience</hi> which I told you was the <hi>third</hi>
thing you were to examine your selves of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your approach to the holy <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. Concerning the <hi>particulars</hi> of this <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Resolutions of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note>
I need say no more, but that it
must <hi>answer</hi> every part, and branch of our <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:96830:54"/>
that is, we must not only in <hi>general resolve,</hi>
that we will observe <hi>Gods Commandments,</hi>
but we must resolve it for <hi>every Commandment</hi>
by it self; and especially where we have found
our selves most to have <hi>failed</hi> heretofore, there
especially to renew our <hi>resolutions.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it neerly concerns us to look, that these
resolutions be <hi>sincere,</hi> and <hi>unfeigned,</hi> and not
only such <hi>slight</hi> ones as people use out of <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
to put on at their coming to the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which they never think of keeping <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi>
For this is a certain truth, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
comes to this <hi>holy Table</hi> without an <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
hatred</hi> of every <hi>sin,</hi> comes <hi>unworthily;</hi> and
it is as sure, that he that doth intirely <hi>hate</hi> all
sin, will <hi>resolve</hi> to <hi>forsake</hi> it; for you know
<hi>forsaking</hi> naturally followes <hi>hatred,</hi> no man
willingly abides with a thing, or person he
<hi>hates.</hi> And therefore he that doth not so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
as that <hi>God</hi> the searcher of <hi>hearts</hi> may
<hi>approve</hi> it as <hi>sincere,</hi> cannot be supposed to <hi>hate</hi>
sin, and so cannot be a <hi>worthy</hi> receiver of that
<hi>holy Sacrament.</hi> Therefore trie your resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thorowly, that you <hi>deceive</hi> not your
selves in them, it is your own great <hi>danger,</hi>
if you do, for it is certain you cannot deceive
<hi>God,</hi> nor gain <hi>acceptation</hi> from him by any
thing, which is not perfectly <hi>hearty</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. Now as you are to <hi>resolve</hi> on this <hi>new
obedience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the meanes.</note> so you are likewise to <hi>resolve</hi> on
the meanes, which may assist you in the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi>
of it. And therefore consider in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96830:55"/>
every duty, what are the <hi>means</hi> that may help
you in it, and resolve to make use of them, how
<hi>uneasy</hi> soever they be to your flesh; so on the
other side consider what things they are, that
are likely to <hi>lead</hi> you to sin, and resolve to
<hi>shun</hi> and avoid them: this you are to do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of all <hi>sins</hi> whatever, but especially in
those, whereof you have <hi>formerly</hi> bin guilty.
For there it will not be hard for you to find,
by what <hi>steps</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> you were drawn into
it, what <hi>company,</hi> what occasion it was that
<hi>ensnared</hi> you, as also to what sort of <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
you are aptest to <hi>yeild.</hi> And therefore
you must particularly fence you self against
the <hi>sin,</hi> by <hi>avoiding</hi> those <hi>occasions</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>14. But it is not enough that you <hi>resolve</hi>
you will do all this hereafter, but you must
instantly set to it, and begin the course by
<hi>doing</hi> at the <hi>present</hi> whatsoever you have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of doing: And there are several
things, which you may; nay, must do at the
<hi>present,</hi> before you come to the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. As first you must cast off every <hi>sin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of sin.</note> not
bring any one <hi>unmortified</hi> lust with you to that
<hi>Table;</hi> for it is not enough to purpose to cast
them off afterwards, but you must then actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
do it by with-drawing all <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>love</hi>
and <hi>affection</hi> from them; you must then give
a <hi>bill</hi> of <hi>divorce</hi> to all your <hi>old beloved sins,</hi>
or else you are no way fit to be <hi>married</hi> to
<hi>Christ.</hi> The reason of this is clear; For this
<hi>Sacrament</hi> is our <hi>spiritual</hi> nourishment; now
before we can receive <hi>spiritual nourishment</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:96830:55"/>
we must have <hi>spiritual life</hi> (for no man gives
<hi>food</hi> to a <hi>dead</hi> person) But whosoever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
not only in the <hi>act,</hi> but in the <hi>love</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one known <hi>sin</hi> hath no <hi>spiritual life,</hi> but
is in <hi>Gods</hi> account no better then a dead <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kass,</hi>
and therefore cannot receive that <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
food.</hi> It is true, he may <hi>eat</hi> the <hi>bread,</hi> and
<hi>drink</hi> the <hi>wine,</hi> but he receives not <hi>Christ,</hi>
but in stead of him, that which is most <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi>
the Apostle will tell you what, 1 <hi>Cor.
11. 29. He eates and drinks his own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Therefore you see how great a necessity
lies on you thus actually to put off <hi>every sin,</hi>
before you come to this Table.</p>
                  <p>16. And the same <hi>necessity</hi> lies on you for
a <hi>second</hi> thing to be done at this time,<note place="margin">Imbracing vertue.</note> and that
is the putting your soul into a <hi>heavenly</hi> and
<hi>Christian temper;</hi> by possessing it with all
those <hi>graces</hi> which may render it <hi>acceptable</hi> in
the eyes of <hi>God.</hi> For when you have turned
out <hi>Satan</hi> and his <hi>accursed</hi> train, you must not
let your soul lie <hi>empty;</hi> if you do, <hi>Christ</hi> tells
you, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 26. He will <hi>quickly return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
and <hi>your last estate shall be worse then
your first.</hi> But you must by earnest Prayer
invite into it the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> with his <hi>graces,</hi>
or if they be in some <hi>degree</hi> there already, you
must pray that he will yet more fully <hi>possess</hi> it,
and you must quicken and <hi>stir</hi> them up.</p>
                  <p>17. As for <hi>example,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quickning of graces.</note> you must <hi>quicken</hi> your
<hi>humility,</hi> by considering your many and great
<hi>sins;</hi> your <hi>Faith,</hi> by <hi>mediating</hi> on <hi>Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi>
to all <hi>penitent</hi> sinners; your <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:96830:56"/>
by considering his <hi>mercies,</hi> especially those
remembred in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> his giving <hi>Christ</hi>
to die for us: and your <hi>love</hi> to your <hi>neighbour,</hi>
nay to your <hi>enemies,</hi> by considering that
great example of his <hi>suffering</hi> for us, that
were <hi>enemies</hi> to him. And it is most particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>required</hi> of us when we come to this <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
that we copy out this <hi>pattern</hi> of his in
a perfect <hi>forgiveness</hi> of all that have <hi>offended</hi>
us, and not only <hi>forgiveness,</hi> but such a <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
also, as will express it self in all <hi>offices</hi> of
<hi>love</hi> and <hi>friendship</hi> to them.</p>
                  <p>18. And if you have formerly so <hi>quite</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
that <hi>blessed</hi> example of his,<note place="margin">Charity.</note> as to do the
direct <hi>contrary,</hi> if you have done any <hi>unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
or <hi>injury</hi> to any person, then you are
to seek <hi>forgiveness</hi> from him; and to that end
<hi>first acknowledg</hi> your fault, and <hi>secondly restore</hi>
to him to the utmost of your power, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you have <hi>deprived</hi> him of, either in <hi>goods</hi>
or <hi>credit.</hi> This <hi>reconciliation</hi> with our
brethren is absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> towards the
making any of our <hi>services</hi> aceptable with
<hi>God,</hi> as appears by that <hi>precept</hi> of <hi>Christ,
Mat. 5. 23, 24. If thou bring thy gift to the
Altar and there remembrest that thy brother
hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift
before the Altar; and go thy way, first be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to thy brother, and then come, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thy gift.</hi> Where you see, that though
the <hi>gift</hi> be already at the <hi>Altar,</hi> it must rather
be left there <hi>unoffered,</hi> then be <hi>offered</hi> by a
man that is not at perfect <hi>peace</hi> with his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96830:56"/>
                     <hi>neighbour.</hi> And if this <hi>charity</hi> be so necessary
in all our <hi>services,</hi> much more in this, where by
a joynt partaking in the same <hi>holy mysteries,</hi>
we signifie our being <hi>united</hi> and <hi>knit,</hi> not only
to <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>head,</hi> but also to each other, as
<hi>fellow-members.</hi> And therefore if we come
with any <hi>malice</hi> in our <hi>hearts</hi> we <hi>commit</hi> an
act of the highest <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> by making a <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi>
profession in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of that <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
and <hi>brotherly</hi> love, whereof our hearts
are quite void.</p>
                  <p>19. Another most necessary grace at this
time is that of <hi>devotion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Devotion.</note> for the <hi>raising</hi> whereof
we must allow our selves some time to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw</hi>
from our <hi>worldly</hi> affaires, and wholy
to set our selves to this business of <hi>preparation,</hi>
one very especial part of which <hi>preparation</hi>
lyes in raising up our <hi>soules</hi> to a <hi>devout</hi> and
<hi>heavenly</hi> temper. And to that it is most
<hi>necessary,</hi> that we cast off all thoughts of the
<hi>world,</hi> for they will be sure as so many clogs,
to <hi>hinder</hi> our soules in their <hi>mounting</hi> towards
<hi>heaven.</hi> A special <hi>exercise</hi> of this <hi>devotion</hi> is
<hi>prayer,</hi> wherein we must be very <hi>frequent,</hi> and
earnest at our <hi>coming</hi> to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
this being one great <hi>instrument,</hi> whereby
we must obtain all those other <hi>graces required</hi>
in our <hi>preparation.</hi> Therefore be sure this be
not omitted, for if you use never so much <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour</hi>
besides, and leave out this, it is the
going to work in your <hi>own strength,</hi> without
looking to <hi>God</hi> for his <hi>help,</hi> and then it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
you should <hi>prosper</hi> in it; <hi>For we are
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96830:57"/>
not able of our selves to think any thing, as of
our selves, but our sufficiency is of God, 2 Cor.
3.</hi> 5. Therefore be <hi>instant</hi> with him so to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
you with his grace, that you may come so
fitted to this <hi>Holy Table,</hi> that you may be
partakers of the <hi>benefits</hi> there reached out to
all <hi>worthy</hi> receivers.</p>
                  <p>20.<note place="margin">Necessity of these graces.</note> These and all other <hi>spiritual graces</hi> our
Souls must be clothed with when we come
to this <hi>Feast,</hi> for this is that <hi>wedding garment,</hi>
without which whosoever comes, is like to
have the <hi>entertainment,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
of him who came to the <hi>marriage</hi> without
a <hi>wedding garment,</hi> Mat. 22. 13. who was <hi>cast

of teeth;</hi> for though it is possible he may
sit it out at the <hi>present,</hi> and not be snatcht from
the <hi>Table,</hi> yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> assures him, he <hi>drinks
damnation to himself,</hi> and howsoever it may
fall on him, is uncertain; But it is sure, it
will, if <hi>repentance</hi> prevent it not, and as sure
that when ever it does come, it will be <hi>intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
for who among us can dwell with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting

                  <p>21. I shall add but one thing more concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the things which are to be done before
the <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a spiritual guide.</note> and that is an advice. That if
any <hi>person</hi> upon a serions view of himself can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>satisfy</hi> his own Soul of his <hi>sincerity,</hi> and
so doubts, whether he may come to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
He do not rest wholly on his <hi>own</hi>
Judgement in the case; For if he be a truly
<hi>humbl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d Soul,</hi> it is likely he may judge too
<hi>hardly</hi> of himself, if he be not, it is odds, but
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96830:57"/>
if he be left to the satisfying of his own
doubts, he will quickly bring himself to pass
too <hi>favourable</hi> a sentence. Or whether he be
the one or the other, if he come to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
in that doubt, he certainly plunges
himself into further <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>scruples,</hi> if not
into sin; On the other side, if he forbear,
because of it, if that fear be a <hi>causeless</hi> one,
then he <hi>groundlesly</hi> absents himself from that
<hi>Holy Ordinance,</hi> and so deprives his Soul of
the <hi>benefits</hi> of it. Threfore in the midst of
so many <hi>dangers,</hi> which attend the mistake of
himself, I would, as I said before, exhort him
not to trust to his own judgement, but to
make <hi>known</hi> his case to some <hi>discreet</hi> and <hi>Godly
Minister,</hi> and rather be <hi>guid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> by his, who
will probably (if the case be duely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>disguise</hi> discovered to him) be better
able to <hi>judge</hi> of him, then he of <hi>himself.</hi> This
is the councel the <hi>Church</hi> gives in the <hi>exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
before the <hi>Communion,</hi> where it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised,
that if any by <hi>other means</hi> therefore
mentioned, <hi>cannot quiet his own conscience, but
require farther counsel, and comfort,</hi> than <hi>let
him go to some discre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t and learned Minister

                        </gap>sel, advice, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
that his conscience may be relieved,</hi> &amp;c.
This is surely such <hi>advice,</hi> as should not be
neglected neither at the time of <hi>coming</hi> to the
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> nor any other, when we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any fear or reasons of <hi>doubt</hi> concerning the
state of our <hi>Souls.</hi> And for want of this,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96830:58"/>
many have run into very great <hi>mischief,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
let the doubt fester so long, that it hath
either plunged them into deep <hi>distresses</hi> of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;</hi>
or which is worse, they have to still
that <hi>disquiet</hi> within them, betaken themselves
to all <hi>sinful pleasures,</hi> and so quite cast off all
care of their <hi>Souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. But to all this it will perhaps be said,<note place="margin">Not to be ashamed to discover our selves to one.</note> that
this cannot be done without discovering the
<hi>nakedness,</hi> and <hi>blemishes</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and
there is <hi>shame</hi> in that, and therefore men are
<hi>unwilling</hi> to do it. But to that I <hi>answer,</hi> that
it is very <hi>unreasonable,</hi> that should be a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance.
For first, I suppose you are to <hi>chuse</hi>
onely such a <hi>person</hi> as will <hi>faithfully</hi> keep any
<hi>secret,</hi> you shall commit to him, and so it can
be no <hi>publick shame</hi> you can fear. And if it
be in respect of that <hi>single</hi> person, you need
not fear that neither; for, supposing him a <hi>godly</hi>
man, he will not think the worse of you, but
the better, that you are so <hi>desirous</hi> to set all
right between <hi>God,</hi> and your <hi>Soul.</hi> But if
indeed there were <hi>shame</hi> in it, yet as long as it
may be a means to <hi>cure</hi> both your <hi>trouble</hi> and
your <hi>sin</hi> too (as certainly <hi>Godly</hi> and <hi>faithful
counsel</hi> may tend much to both) that <hi>shame</hi>
ought to be <hi>despised,</hi> and it is sure it would,
if we loved our <hi>Souls,</hi> as well as our <hi>body,</hi>
for in <hi>bodily</hi> diseases, be they never so <hi>foul</hi> or
<hi>shameful,</hi> we count him a <hi>fool,</hi> who will rather
miss the <hi>cure,</hi> then discover it, and then it
must here be so much a <hi>greater</hi> folly, by how
much the <hi>Soul</hi> is more <hi>precious</hi> then the
<hi>body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:96830:58"/>
23. But <hi>God</hi> knows,<note place="margin">As necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the confident as to the doubtful.</note> it is not onely <hi>doubting</hi>
persons, to whom this advice might be useful,
there are <hi>others</hi> of another sort, whose <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
is their <hi>disease,</hi> who <hi>presume</hi> very <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesless</hi>

then their <hi>own</hi> in this so weighty a business.
The truth is, we are generally so apt to <hi>savour</hi>

and not onely so, but to receive <hi>dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
how to subdue and <hi>mortify</hi> those sins
they are most inclined to, which is a matter
of so much <hi>difficulty,</hi> that we have no reason

it.</p>
                  <p>24. I have now gone through those <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
parts of <hi>duty</hi> we are to perform <hi>before</hi> our
receiving.<note place="margin">At the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</note> In the <hi>next</hi> place, I am to tell you,
what is to be done at <hi>the time</hi> of <hi>receiving.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Meditation of thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness.</note>
When thou art at the <hi>Holy Table, first</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thy self in an <hi>unfeigned</hi> acknowledgement
of thy great <hi>unworthiness</hi> to be admitted
there;<note place="margin">The suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Christ.</note> and to that purpose <hi>remember</hi> again
between <hi>God</hi> and thine <hi>own</hi> Soul, some of thy
greatest, and <hi>foulest</hi> sins, thy <hi>breaches</hi> of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>vows</hi> made at that <hi>Table,</hi> especially
since thy <hi>last</hi> receiving. Then meditate on
those <hi>bitter sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> which are set
out to us in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> when thou seest the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96830:59"/>
                     <hi>bread broken,</hi> remember how his <hi>blessed body</hi>
was torn with <hi>nails</hi> upon the <hi>Cross,</hi> when
thou seest the <hi>wine poured</hi> out, remember how
his <hi>precious blood</hi> was spilt there. And then
consider, it was thy <hi>sins</hi> that caused both.
And here think, how <hi>unworthy</hi> a <hi>wretch</hi> thou
art to have done that, which occasioned such
<hi>torments</hi> to him? How much worse then his
very <hi>crucifiers?</hi> They <hi>crucified</hi> him once, but
thou hast, as much as in thee lay, <hi>crucified</hi> him
daily. They <hi>crucified</hi> him, because they <hi>knew</hi>
him not, but thou hast <hi>known</hi> both what he is
in himself, The <hi>Lord of Glory,</hi> and what he
is to thee a most <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>merciful Saviour,</hi>
and yet thou hast still continued thus to <hi>crucify</hi>
him afresh. <hi>Consider</hi> this, and let it work in
thee, first a great <hi>sorrow</hi> for thy sins past, and
then a great <hi>hatred,</hi> and a firm <hi>resolution</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>25. When thou hast a while thus thought
on these <hi>sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> for the increasing<note place="margin">The atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wrought by them.</note>
thy <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>contrition;</hi> Then in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place think of them again, to stir up thy
<hi>Faith;</hi> look on him as the <hi>sacrifice</hi> offered up
for thy <hi>sins,</hi> for the appeasing of <hi>Gods wrath,</hi>
and procuring his <hi>favour,</hi> and mercies toward
thee. And therefore <hi>beleevingly,</hi> yet <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi>
beg of <hi>God</hi> to accept of that <hi>satisfaction</hi>
made by his <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>beloved</hi> Son, and for
the merits thereof to pardon thee; whatever
is past, and to be fully <hi>reconciled</hi> to thee.</p>
                  <p>26. In the <hi>third</hi> place consider them again
to raise thy <hi>thankfulness.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness owing for them.</note> Think how much

both of <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>pain</hi> he there endured, but
especially those great <hi>agonies</hi> of his <hi>Soul,</hi>
which drew from him that <hi>bitter</hi> cry, <hi>My

27. 45. Now all this he suffered only to keep
thee from <hi>perishing.</hi> And therefore consider
what unexpressable <hi>thanks</hi> thou owest him,

to entertain, or harbour any <hi>sin</hi> in thy

a <hi>sacrifice</hi> to him, who was <hi>sacrificed</hi> for thee,

might <hi>redeem thee from all iniquity.</hi> Therefore
here make thy solemn <hi>resolutions</hi> to forsake
<hi>every sin,</hi> particularly those, into which thou

be,<note place="margin">The danger of breaking them.</note> if thou shouldst now wilfully do any thing

And as long as thou keepest in that

of men or <hi>divels</hi> can do thee no harm: For

if thou yeild to any <hi>wilful</hi> sin) then God and

                  <p>32. Nay thou wilt get an <hi>enemy</hi> within

to rob thee of thy <hi>peace,</hi> thy <hi>God,</hi> thy very

one in thy <hi>house,</hi> who thou knowest came
to <hi>rob</hi> thee of what is <hi>dearest</hi> to thee.</p>
                  <p>33. And let not any <hi>experience</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi>

is thy <hi>highest</hi> degree of <hi>wickedness</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulness</hi>
to make that <hi>goodness</hi> of his,
which should lead thee to <hi>repentance</hi> an <hi>incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement</hi>
in thy <hi>sin;</hi> besides this, I say, the
oftner thou hast bin <hi>pardoned,</hi> the less reason
thou hast to <hi>expect</hi> it again, because thy sin is
so much the <hi>greater,</hi> for having bin <hi>committed</hi>
after so much <hi>mercy.</hi> If a <hi>King</hi> have several
times <hi>pardoned</hi> an offender, yet if he still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the <hi>commission</hi> of the same <hi>fault,</hi> the
<hi>King</hi> will at last be forced, if he have any
<hi>love</hi> to <hi>Justice,</hi> to give him up to it. Now
so it is here, <hi>God</hi> is as well <hi>just</hi> as <hi>merciful,</hi> and
his <hi>justice</hi> will at last surely and heavily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the <hi>abuse</hi> of his <hi>mercy;</hi> and there cannot
be a greater abuse of his <hi>mercy,</hi> then to sin in
<hi>hope</hi> of it, so that it will prove a <hi>miserable</hi>
deceiving of thy self then to presume upon
it.</p>
                  <p>34. Now this care of making good thy <hi>vow</hi>
must not abide with thee some <hi>few</hi> dayes only,<note place="margin">The obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this vow perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</note>
and then be cast aside, but it must continue
with thee all thy <hi>dayes.</hi> For if thou break thy
<hi>vow,</hi> it matters not, whether <hi>sooner</hi> or <hi>latter.</hi>
Nay perhaps the guilt may in some respects be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96830:62"/>
more, if it be late, for if thou have for a good
while gone on in the observance of it, that
shews the thing is <hi>possible</hi> to thee; and so thy
after <hi>breaches</hi> are not of <hi>infirmity,</hi> because
thou canst not <hi>avoid</hi> them, but of <hi>perversness,</hi>
because thou wilt not: Besides the use of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian-walking</hi>
must needs make it more easie
to thee. For indeed all the <hi>difficulty</hi> of it,
is but from the <hi>custome</hi> of the <hi>contrary.</hi> And
therefore if after some <hi>acquaintance</hi> with it,
when thou hast <hi>overcome</hi> somwhat of the
<hi>hardness,</hi> thou shalt then give it over, it will
be most <hi>inexcusable.</hi> Therefore be careful all
the dayes of thy life, to keep such a <hi>watch</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thy life, and so to avoid all <hi>occasions</hi> of
temptations, as may preserve thee from all

                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> is all <hi>blasphemies,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Blasphemy.</note> yet if we do it in our <hi>hearts,</hi> by

of the <hi>actions,</hi> that is, when men who profess
to be the <hi>servants</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> live so wickedly,
that they bring up an <hi>evil report</hi> on him,
whom they own as their <hi>Master</hi> and <hi>Lord.</hi>
This <hi>blasphemy</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> takes <hi>notice</hi> of,
<hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to <hi>think ill</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as the favour of <hi>sin,</hi>
when they saw those, who called themselves

                  <p>A <hi>second</hi> way of <hi>dishonouring Gods</hi> name,<note place="margin">Swearing.</note>
is by <hi>swearing,</hi> and that is of <hi>two sorts,</hi> either
by <hi>false oaths</hi> or else by <hi>rash,</hi> and <hi>light ones.</hi>
A <hi>false oath</hi> may also be of <hi>two</hi> kinds, as <hi>first</hi>
that by which I <hi>affirm</hi> somewhat, or <hi>secondly</hi>
that by which I <hi>promise.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> is when I
say such or such a thing was done so or so; and
comfirm this saying of mine with an <hi>oath,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Assertory oaths.</note> if
then I know there be not perfect <hi>truth</hi> in what
I say, this is a flat <hi>perjury,</hi> a down right being
<hi>forsworn;</hi> Nay if I <hi>swear</hi> to the <hi>truth</hi> of that,
whereof I am only <hi>doubtful,</hi> though the thing
should happen to be <hi>true,</hi> yet it brings upon
me the guilt of <hi>perjury.</hi> For I swear at a
<hi>venture,</hi> and the thing might for ought I
knew be as well <hi>false</hi> as <hi>true,</hi> whereas I ought
never to <hi>swear</hi> to any thing, the truth of
which I do not <hi>certainly</hi> know.</p>
                  <p>2. But besides this sort of <hi>oaths,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Promissory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> by which
I <hi>affirm</hi> any thing, there is the other sort,
that by which I <hi>promise</hi> somwhat. And that
<hi>promise</hi> may be either to <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> when
it is to <hi>God,</hi> we call it a <hi>vow,</hi> of which I have
already spoken, under the head of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
I shall now only speak of that to <hi>man;</hi>
&amp; this may become a <hi>false oath,</hi> either at, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the time of <hi>taking</hi> it. At the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>taking,</hi>
it is false if either I have then no real <hi>purpose</hi> of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96830:64"/>
making it good or else take it in a sense <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>
from that which I know, he to whom I
make the <hi>promise understands</hi> it; for the use of
<hi>oaths,</hi> being to assure the persons, to whom
they are made they must be taken in <hi>their sense.</hi>
But if I were never so <hi>sincere</hi> at the <hi>taking</hi> the
<hi>oath,</hi> if afterwards I do not <hi>perform</hi> it, I am
certainly <hi>perju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The nature of an <hi>oath</hi> being then thus
<hi>binding,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Unlawful oaths.</note> it neerly concerns us to look that the
<hi>matter</hi> of our <hi>oaths</hi> be lawful, for else we run
our selves into a <hi>woful snare.</hi> For <hi>Example,</hi>
suppose I <hi>swear</hi> to kill a man, if I perform my
<hi>oath,</hi> I am guilty of <hi>murder,</hi> if I break it, of
<hi>perjury.</hi> And so I am under a <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
one way or other. But there is nothing
puts us under a <hi>greater</hi> degree of this <hi>unhappy</hi>
necessity, then when we <hi>swear</hi> two <hi>oaths,</hi>
whereof the one is directly <hi>cross</hi> and <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi>
to the other. For if I swear to give a man

I must <hi>break</hi> my <hi>oath</hi> to one of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is impossible to perform it to <hi>both,</hi> and
so I must be under a <hi>necessity</hi> of being <hi>forsworn.</hi>
And into this unhappy <hi>streight</hi> every man
brings himself that takes any <hi>oath</hi> which cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
some other, which he hath <hi>formerly</hi> taken;
which should make all that love either <hi>God,</hi>

                        </gap>ntangle</hi> themselves, by taking one
<hi>oath</hi> cross and <hi>thwarting</hi> to another. But it
may perhaps here be asked, what a person
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96830:64"/>
that hath already brought himself into such a
condition shall do? I <hi>answer,</hi> he must first hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
<hi>repent</hi> the great sin of <hi>taking</hi> the <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
oath,</hi> and then stick only to the <hi>lawful,</hi>
which is all that is in his power towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
his fault, and <hi>qualifying</hi> him for <hi>Gods
pardon</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>4. Having said this concerning the <hi>kinds</hi> of
this sin of <hi>perjury,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">God greatly dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> I shall only add a few words
to shew you, how greatly <hi>Gods name</hi> is <hi>disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured</hi>
by it. In all <hi>oaths</hi> you know, <hi>God</hi> is
solemnly called to <hi>witness</hi> the truth of which
is spoken; now if the thing be <hi>false,</hi> it is the
<hi>basest</hi> affront, and <hi>dishonour</hi> that can possibly
be done to <hi>God.</hi> For it is in reason to signifie
one of these two things, either that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he knows not whether we say <hi>true</hi> or no.
(And that is to make him no <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d,</hi> to suppose
him to be as <hi>deceiveable,</hi> and easie to be delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as one of our ignorant <hi>neighbours</hi>) or else
that he is willing to <hi>countenance</hi> our <hi>lyes;</hi>
the former robs him of that great <hi>attribute</hi> of
his, his <hi>knowing all things,</hi> and is surely a
great <hi>dishonouring</hi> of him, it being even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men accounted, one of the greatest <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces</hi>
to account a man fit to have <hi>cheats</hi> put
upon him; yet even so we deal with <hi>God,</hi> if we
venture to <hi>forswear,</hi> upon a hope that <hi>God</hi>
discerns it not, But the other is yet worse,
for the supposing him willing to <hi>countenance</hi>
our <hi>lies,</hi> is the making him a <hi>party</hi> in them;
and is not only the making him no <hi>God</hi> (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impossible that <hi>God</hi> should either <hi>lie</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96830:65"/>
or <hi>approve</hi> it in another) but it is the make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him like the very <hi>Divel.</hi> For he it is that
is a <hi>lyer,</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> of it, <hi>Jo.</hi> 8 44. And
sure I need not say more to prove that this
is the <hi>highest</hi> degree of <hi>dishonouring Gods
name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. But if any yet doubt the <hi>hainousness</hi> of
this sin;<note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it.</note> let him but consider what <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
sayes of it in the <hi>Third Commandment,</hi>
where he solemnly professes, he <hi>will not hold
him guiltless that taketh his name in vain,</hi> and
sure the adding that to this <hi>commandment,</hi> and
none of the rest, is the <hi>marking</hi> this out for a
most <hi>hainous</hi> guilt: and if you look into <hi>Zac.</hi> 5.
You will there find the <hi>punishment</hi> is answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
even the <hi>utter destruction,</hi> not only of
the <hi>man;</hi> but his <hi>house</hi> also. Therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
all men as they <hi>love</hi> either their <hi>temporal</hi>
or <hi>eternal</hi> well-fare, to keep them most strictly
from this <hi>sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But besides this of <hi>forswaring,</hi> I told you
there was another sort of <hi>oaths,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vain oaths.</note> by which <hi>Gods</hi>
name is <hi>dishonoured,</hi> those are the <hi>vain</hi> and
<hi>light oaths,</hi> such as are so usual in our <hi>common</hi>
discourse; and are expresly forbidden by <hi>Christ,
Mat.</hi> 5. 34. But <hi>I say unto you swear not at all;
neither by heaven, for it is Gods throne, nor by
the earth, for it is his foot-stool;</hi> where you see
we are not allowed to <hi>swear</hi> even by <hi>meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
because of the <hi>relation</hi> they have to
<hi>God.</hi> How great a <hi>wickedness</hi> is it then to
<hi>prophane</hi> his holy <hi>name</hi> by <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>vain oaths,</hi>
this is a sin that is (by I know not what <hi>charm</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:96830:65"/>
of <hi>Sathans</hi>) grown into <hi>fashion</hi> among us,
and now its being so, draws d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ily more men
into it. But it is to be remembred that when
we shall <hi>appear</hi> before <hi>Gods Iudgement</hi> seat,
to answer for those <hi>prophanations</hi> of his name;
it will be no excuse to say, it was the <hi>fashion</hi>
to do so, it will rather be an increase of our
<hi>guilt,</hi> that we have by our own <hi>practice,</hi> help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to confirm that <hi>wicked</hi> custome, which we
ought to have beat down, and <hi>discountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. And sure what ever this <hi>prophane</hi> age
thinks of it,<note place="margin">The sin of them.</note> this is a sin of a very <hi>high</hi> nature.
For besides that it is a <hi>direct</hi> breach of the
<hi>precept</hi> of <hi>Christs,</hi> it shews <hi>first</hi> a very mean,
and <hi>low</hi> esteem of <hi>God;</hi> Every <hi>oath</hi> we swear
is the appealing to <hi>God,</hi> to judge the truth of
what we speak, and therefore being of such
greatness, and <hi>majesty,</hi> it requires that the
matter concerning which we thus appeal to
him, should be of <hi>great weight,</hi> and moment,
somewhat wherein either his <hi>own glory,</hi> or
some considerable <hi>good</hi> of man is concerned.
But when we <hi>swear</hi> in common <hi>discourse,</hi> it is
far otherwise, any the <hi>tristingest,</hi> or lightest
thing serves for the matter of an <hi>oath,</hi> nay
often men <hi>swear</hi> to such <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>foolish</hi>
things, as a considering person would be
ashamed barely to <hi>speak.</hi> And is it not a great
<hi>despising</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to call him solemly to <hi>judge</hi>
in such <hi>childish,</hi> such wretched matters, <hi>God</hi>
is the great <hi>King</hi> of the world, now though
a <hi>King</hi> be to be resorted unto in <hi>weighty</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96830:66"/>
yet sure he would think himself much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
if he should be called to <hi>judge</hi> between
<hi>boyes</hi> at their <hi>childish games:</hi> And <hi>God</hi> knows
many things whereto we frequently <hi>swear,</hi> are
not of <hi>greater</hi> weight, and therefore are a
sign, that we do not rightly esteem of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">They lead to perjury.</note> This <hi>common swearing</hi> is a <hi>sin</hi>
which leads directly to the former of <hi>forswea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;</hi>
for he that by the use of <hi>swearing</hi> hath
made <hi>oaths</hi> so familiar to him, will be likely
to take the <hi>dreadfullest oath</hi> without much
consideration? For how shall he that <hi>swears</hi>
hourly, look upon an <hi>oath</hi> with any <hi>reverence</hi>
and he that doth not? it is his chance, not
his care, that is to be thanked, if he keep from
<hi>perjury.</hi> Nay further, he that <hi>swears</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
is not onely prepared to <hi>forswear,</hi>
when a <hi>solemn oath</hi> is tendered him, but in all
<hi>probability</hi> does actually <hi>forswear</hi> himself of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in these <hi>suddener</hi> oaths: for supposing them
to come from a man, ere he is <hi>aware</hi> (which
is the <hi>best</hi> can be said of them) what <hi>assurance</hi>
can any man have, who <hi>swears,</hi> ere he is <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,</hi>
that he shall not <hi>lye</hi> so too? And if he
doth both together, he must necessarily be
<hi>forsworn.</hi> But he that observes your <hi>comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n
swearers,</hi> will be put past <hi>doubt,</hi> that they are
often <hi>forsworn.</hi> For they usually <hi>swear</hi> indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
to things <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false, doubtful</hi> or
<hi>certain.</hi> And I doubt not, but if men who
are guilty of <hi>this</hi> sin, would but impartially
<hi>examine</hi> their own practice, their hearts would
<hi>second</hi> me in this observation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:96830:66"/>
8. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This is a sin,<note place="margin">No tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them.</note> to which there is no
<hi>temptation,</hi> there is nothing either of <hi>pleasure,</hi>
or <hi>prefit,</hi> got by it. Most other sins offer us
somewhat either of the <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re,</hi> or the other, but
this is utterly empty of <hi>both.</hi> So that in this
sin the <hi>Devil</hi> does not play the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rchant</hi> for
our <hi>Souls,</hi> as in others he does, he doth not
so much as <hi>cheapen</hi> them, but we give them
<hi>freely</hi> into his hands without any thing in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</hi>
There seems to be but one thing pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for men to hope to <hi>gain</hi> by it, and that
is to be <hi>beleeved</hi> in what they say when they
thus bind it by an <hi>oath.</hi> But this also they
constantly fail of, for there are none so little
<hi>beleeved,</hi> as the <hi>common swearers.</hi> And good
reason, For he that makes no <hi>conscience</hi> thus
to <hi>profane Gods</hi> name; Why shall any man
<hi>beleeve,</hi> he makes any of lying? Nay, their
forwardness to confirm every the <hi>slightest</hi> thing
by an <hi>oath,</hi> rather gives <hi>jealousy,</hi> that they
have some inward guilt of <hi>falseness,</hi> for which
that <hi>oath</hi> must be the <hi>clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k.</hi> And thus you see
in how little stead it stands them, even to this
onely purpose, for which they can pretend it
<hi>useful;</hi> and to any other advantage it makes
not the lest <hi>claim,</hi> and therefore is a sin
without <hi>temptation,</hi> and consequently without
<hi>excuse:</hi> for it shewes the greatest <hi>contempt,</hi>
nay unkindness to <hi>God,</hi> when we will provoke
him thus, without any thing to <hi>tempt</hi> us to it.
And therefore though the <hi>commonness</hi> of this
<hi>sin</hi> have made it pass but for a <hi>small</hi> one, yet
it is very far from being so, either in it self,
or in <hi>Gods account.</hi>
                  </p>

9. Let all therefore,<note place="margin">Necessity of abstaining from them.</note> who are not yet fallen
into the <hi>custome</hi> of this sin, be most careful
never to yield to the least <hi>beginnings</hi> of it, and
for those who are so <hi>miserable,</hi> as to be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ared</hi> in it, let them immediately, as
they tender their <hi>Souls,</hi> get out of it. And
let no man plead the <hi>hardness</hi> of leaving an <hi>old
custome,</hi> as an <hi>excuse</hi> for his continuing in it,
but rather the longer he hath been in it, so
much the more <hi>haste</hi> let him make out of it,
as thinking it too too much, that he hath so
long gone on in so great a <hi>sin.</hi> And if the
length of the <hi>cust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me</hi> have increased the <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>
of leaving it, that is in all reason to make
him set immediately to the <hi>casting</hi> it off, left
that <hi>difficulty</hi> at last grow to an <hi>impossibility,</hi>
and the <hi>harder</hi> he finds it at the present, so
much the more <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>watchful</hi> he must
be in the use of all those <hi>means,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Means for it.</note> which may
tend to the <hi>overcoming</hi> that <hi>sinful</hi> habit, some
few of those <hi>means</hi> it will not be amiss here
to mention.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>First</hi> let him possess his mind <hi>fully</hi> of the
<hi>hainousness</hi> of the sin,<note place="margin">Sence of the guilt and danger</note> and not to measure it
onely according to the <hi>common</hi> rate of the
world. And when he is fully perswaded of the
<hi>guilt,</hi> then let him add to that, the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>danger,</hi> as that it puts him out of
<hi>Gods</hi> favour at the present, and will, if he
continue in it, cast him into <hi>Hell</hi> for ever. And
sure if this were but throughly laid to heart,
it would <hi>restrain</hi> this sin; For I would ask a
man, that pretends <hi>impossibility</hi> of leaving
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96830:67"/>
the <hi>custome,</hi> whether if he were sure he
should be <hi>hanged</hi> the next <hi>oath</hi> he swore, the
<hi>fear</hi> of it would not keep him from <hi>swearing?</hi>
I can scarce beleeve any man in his wits so
little <hi>Master</hi> of himself, but it would. And
then surely <hi>damning</hi> is so much worse then
<hi>hanging,</hi> that in all reason the fear of that
ought to be a much greater <hi>restraint.</hi> The
doubt is, men do either not heartily <hi>believe</hi>
that this <hi>sin</hi> will <hi>damn</hi> them, or if they do,
they look on it, as a thing a <hi>great</hi> way off and
so are not much <hi>moved</hi> with it; but both
these are very <hi>unreasonable.</hi> For the first, it
is <hi>certain,</hi> that every one that continues <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi>
in any sin, is so long in a state of <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and therefore this being so continued in,
must certainly put a man in that <hi>condition.</hi>
For the <hi>second,</hi> It is very possible, he may be
deceived in <hi>thinking</hi> it so far off, for how
knows any man that he shal not be <hi>struck</hi> dead
with an <hi>oath</hi> in his mouth, or if he were sure
not to be so, yet <hi>eternal damnation</hi> is surely
to be dreaded above all things, be it at what
<hi>distance</hi> soever.</p>
                  <p>11. A <hi>second means</hi> is to be exactly <hi>true</hi> in all
thou speakest,<note place="margin">Truth in speaking.</note> that all men may <hi>believe</hi> thee
on thy bare word, and then thou wilt never
have occasion to <hi>confirm</hi> it by an <hi>oath,</hi> to
make it more <hi>credible,</hi> which is the onely
<hi>colour,</hi> or reason can at any time be pretended
for <hi>swearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Forsaking the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</note> Observe what it is that most
<hi>betrayes</hi> thee to this sin, whether <hi>drink,</hi> or
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96830:68"/>
                     <hi>anger,</hi> or the <hi>company</hi> and <hi>example</hi> of others,
or what ever else, and then if ever thou mean
to <hi>forsake</hi> the <hi>sin, forsake</hi> those <hi>occasions</hi> of
it.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Endeavour to possess thy heart
with a continual <hi>remembrance</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reverence of God.</note> and if
that once grow into a <hi>custome</hi> with thee, it
will quickly turn out that <hi>contrary</hi> one of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning.</hi>
Use and accustome thy self there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to this <hi>reverence</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and particularly
to such a respect to his <hi>name,</hi> as if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
never to mention It without some <hi>lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
up of thy heart to him; Even in thy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<hi>discourse,</hi> when ever thou takest his
Name in to thy <hi>mouth,</hi> let it be an occasion
of <hi>raising</hi> up thy <hi>thoughts</hi> to him. But by no
means permit thy self to use it in <hi>idle</hi> by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words,
or the like. If thou doest <hi>accustome</hi>
thy self to pay this <hi>reverence</hi> to the bare men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his <hi>name,</hi> it will be an excellent <hi>fence</hi>
against the <hi>prophaning</hi> it in <hi>oaths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. A <hi>fifth</hi> means is a <hi>diligent</hi> and constant
<hi>watch</hi> over thy self,<note place="margin">Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> that thou thus <hi>offend not
with thy tongue,</hi> without which all the former
will come to nothing. And the <hi>last</hi> means is
<hi>prayer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> which must be added to all thy <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi>
therefore <hi>pray</hi> earnestly, that <hi>God</hi> will
enable thee, to overcome this wicked <hi>custom;</hi>
say with the <hi>Psalmist, Set a watch O Lord
over my mouth and keep the door of my lips;</hi>
and if thou doest sincerely set thy self to the
use of <hi>means</hi> for it, thou mayest be assured,

                  </argument>
                  <p>§. 1. THE <hi>eight</hi> duty we owe to <hi>God</hi>
is <hi>worship;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Worship.</note> This is that great
duty by which especially we
acknowledg his <hi>Godhead, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
being <hi>proper</hi> only to <hi>God,</hi> and therefore it
is to be lookt on as a most <hi>weighty</hi> duty. This
is to be performed <hi>first</hi> by <hi>our Souls,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prayer its parts.</note> 
                     <hi>secondly</hi>
by our <hi>bodies:</hi> The <hi>Souls</hi> part is <hi>praying.</hi> Now
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96830:69"/>
                     <hi>prayer</hi> is a speaking to God, and there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
parts of it, according to the <hi>different</hi>
things about which we <hi>speak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. As <hi>first,</hi> There is <hi>Confession,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Confession.</note> the
<hi>acknowledging</hi> our <hi>sins</hi> to God. And this
may be either <hi>general,</hi> or <hi>particular;</hi> The
<hi>general</hi> is, when we onely <hi>confess</hi> in <hi>gross,</hi> that
we are <hi>sinful,</hi> the <hi>particular,</hi> when we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the <hi>several</hi> sorts, and <hi>acts</hi> of our sins.
The <hi>former</hi> is necessary to be alwayes a part of
our <hi>solemn prayers,</hi> whether <hi>publick,</hi> or <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</hi>
The <hi>latter</hi> is proper for <hi>private prayer,</hi>
and there the oftner it is used, the better, yea,
even in our <hi>daily private</hi> prayer it will be fit
constantly to remember some of our <hi>greatest</hi>
and <hi>foulest</hi> sins, though never so long since
past. For such we should never think suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<hi>confest,</hi> and <hi>bewailed.</hi> And this <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing,</hi>
must alwaies go along with <hi>confession,</hi>
we must be heartily <hi>sorry</hi> for the sins we <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,</hi>
and from our Souls acknowledge our
own great <hi>unworthiness,</hi> in having committed
them, for our <hi>confession</hi> is not intended to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct</hi>
God, who knows our <hi>sins</hi> much better
then our selves do, but it is to <hi>humble</hi> our
selves, and therefore we must not think w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
have <hi>confest</hi> aright, till that be done.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>second</hi> part of <hi>prayer,</hi> is <hi>petition.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Petitions.</note>
That is the <hi>begging</hi> of God whatsoever we
<hi>want</hi> either for our <hi>Souls,</hi> or <hi>bodies.</hi> For our
<hi>Souls</hi> we must <hi>first</hi> beg <hi>pardon</hi> of sins,<note place="margin">For our Souls.</note> and
that for the sake of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who shed his
<hi>blood</hi> to obtain it. Then we must also <hi>beg</hi> the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96830:69"/>
                     <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>assistance</hi> of Gods <hi>Spirit,</hi> to <hi>enable</hi>
us to forsake our <hi>sins,</hi> and to walk in <hi>obedience</hi>
to him. And herein it will be needful parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to beg all the several <hi>vertues,</hi> as <hi>faith,
love, zeal, purity, repentance,</hi> and the like,
but especially those which thou most <hi>wantest;</hi>
And therefore observe what thy <hi>wants</hi> are,
and if thou beest <hi>proud;</hi> be most <hi>instant</hi> in
praying for <hi>humility,</hi> if <hi>lustful,</hi> for <hi>chastity,</hi>
and so for all other <hi>graces,</hi> according as
thou findest thy <hi>needs.</hi> And in all these things
that concern thy <hi>Soul,</hi> be very earnest and
<hi>importunate,</hi> take no <hi>denial</hi> from God, nor
give over, though thou do not presently <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
what thou suest for. But if thou hast
never so <hi>long</hi> prayed for a <hi>grace,</hi> and yet find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
it not, do not grow <hi>weary</hi> of <hi>praying,</hi> but
rather <hi>search</hi> what the <hi>cause</hi> may be, which
makes thy <hi>prayer</hi> so ineffectual; see if thou
do not thy self <hi>hinder</hi> them, perhaps thou
<hi>prayest</hi> to God, to enable thee to <hi>conquer</hi> some
sin, and yet never goest about to <hi>fight</hi> against
it, never makest any <hi>resistance,</hi> but <hi>ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ldest</hi>
to it, as oft as it comes, nay puttest thy self
in its <hi>way,</hi> in the road of all <hi>temptations.</hi> If
it be thus, no wonder though thy <hi>prayers</hi> avail
not, for thou wilt not let them. Therefore
<hi>amend</hi> this, and set to the doing of <hi>thy</hi> part
sincerely, and then thou needest not <hi>fear,</hi> but
God will do his.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bodi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
                     </note> We are to <hi>petition</hi> also for
our <hi>bodies;</hi> That is, we are to ask of God
such <hi>necessaries</hi> of life, as are needful to us,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96830:70"/>
while we <hi>live</hi> here. But these onely in such a
<hi>degree,</hi> and <hi>measure,</hi> as his <hi>wisdom</hi> sees best
for us, we must not presume to be our own

                        </gap>rvers,</hi> and pray for all that <hi>wealth,</hi> or
<hi>greatness,</hi> which our own <hi>vain</hi> hearts may
perhaps desire, but onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or such a condition,
in respect of <hi>outward</hi> things, as <hi>he</hi> sees may
most tend to those <hi>great</hi> ends of our living
here, the <hi>glorifying</hi> him, and the <hi>saving</hi> of
our own <hi>Souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. A <hi>third</hi> part of <hi>prayer</hi> is <hi>Deprecation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Depr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
that is when we <hi>pray</hi> to God to turn away
some <hi>evil</hi> from us. Now this <hi>evil</hi> may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>evil</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> or the <hi>evil</hi> of <hi>punishment.</hi>
The <hi>evil</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> is that we are especially to
<hi>pray</hi> against,<note place="margin">Of sin.</note> most <hi>earnestly begging</hi> of God,
that he will by the <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>grace</hi> preserve
us from <hi>falling</hi> into sin. And whatever <hi>sins</hi>
they are, to which thou knowest thy self most
<hi>inclined,</hi> there be particularly <hi>earnest</hi> with
God, to preserve thee from them. This is to
be done <hi>daily,</hi> but then more <hi>especially,</hi> when
we are under any <hi>present temptation,</hi> &amp; in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of <hi>falling</hi> into any sin; In which case we
have reason to cry out, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> did, when
he found himself <hi>sinking, save Lord, or I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish;</hi>
humbly beseeching him either to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw</hi>
the <hi>temptation,</hi> or <hi>strengthen</hi> us to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi>
it, neither of which we can do for our
selves.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>t.</note> We are likewise to <hi>pray</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>evil</hi> of <hi>punishment,</hi> but <hi>principally</hi>
against <hi>spiritual punishments,</hi> as the <hi>anger</hi> of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96830:70"/>
God, the <hi>withdrawing</hi> of his <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
damnation.</hi> Against these we can never
<hi>pray</hi> with too much <hi>earnestness;</hi> but we may
also pray against <hi>temporal punishments,</hi> that is
any <hi>outward</hi> affliction, but this with <hi>submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
to Gods will, according to the example of
<hi>Christ,</hi> Mat. 26. 39. <hi>Not as I will, but as
thou wilt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. A <hi>fourth</hi> part of <hi>prayer</hi> is <hi>intercession;</hi>
that is,<note place="margin">Intercession</note> 
                     <hi>praying</hi> for others: This in <hi>general</hi>
we are to do for all <hi>mankind,</hi> as well <hi>strangers,</hi>
as <hi>acquaintance,</hi> but more <hi>particularly</hi> those,
to whom we have any especial <hi>relation,</hi> either
publick, as our <hi>Governours,</hi> both in <hi>Church</hi>
and <hi>State,</hi> or <hi>private,</hi> as <hi>Parents, Husband,
Wife, Children, Friends,</hi> &amp;c. We are also
to pray for all that are in <hi>affliction,</hi> and such
<hi>particular</hi> persons, as we discern especially to
be so; Yea we are to pray for those that
have done <hi>injury,</hi> those that <hi>despightfully use
us and persecute us,</hi> for it is expresly the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Christ,</hi> Mat. 5. 44. and that whereof
he hath likewise given us the <hi>highest example,</hi>
in <hi>praying</hi> even for his very <hi>crucifiers,</hi> Luc. 23.
34. <hi>Father forgive them.</hi> For all these <hi>sorts</hi>
of persons we are to <hi>pray,</hi> and that for the
very same <hi>good</hi> things we beg of <hi>God</hi> for <hi>our</hi>
selves, that <hi>God</hi> would give them in their <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
places and callings, all <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
blessings,</hi> which he sees <hi>wanting</hi> to them,
and turn away from them all <hi>evil</hi> whether of
<hi>sin,</hi> or <hi>punishment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. The <hi>fifth</hi> part of <hi>prayer</hi> is <hi>thanksgiving;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Thank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:96830:71"/>
That is, the <hi>praising,</hi> and <hi>blessing God</hi> for all his
<hi>mercies,</hi> whether to our own <hi>persons,</hi> and those
that <hi>immediatly</hi> relate to us, or to the <hi>Church</hi>
and <hi>Nation</hi> whereof we are members, or yet
more <hi>general</hi> to all <hi>mankind.</hi> And this for all
his <hi>mercies</hi> both <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>temporal:</hi> In
the <hi>spiritual, first</hi> for those wherein we are
all in <hi>common</hi> concerned, as the giving of his
<hi>Son,</hi> the sending of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and all those
means he hath used to bring sinful men unto
himself. Then <hi>secondly</hi> for those <hi>mercies</hi> we
have in our own <hi>particulars</hi> received, such
are the having been born within the <hi>pale</hi> of
the <hi>Church,</hi> and so brought up in <hi>Christian
Religion,</hi> by which we have been partakers
of those <hi>precious advantages</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi>
and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and so have had, without
any <hi>care,</hi> or pains of <hi>ours,</hi> the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
life put into our hands. But besides
these, there is none of us but have received
other <hi>spiritual</hi> means from <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. As <hi>first Gods patience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Spiritual Mercies.</note> and long-suffering,
<hi>waiting</hi> for our <hi>repentance,</hi> and not <hi>cutting</hi> us
off in our <hi>sins. Secondly,</hi> his <hi>calls</hi> and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of us to that <hi>repentance,</hi> not only <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
in the <hi>ministry</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi> but also <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
by the motions of his <hi>Spirit.</hi> But then
if thou be one that hath by the help of <hi>Gods
grace</hi> been <hi>wrought</hi> upon by these calls, and
brought from a <hi>prophane,</hi> or worldly, to a
<hi>Christian</hi> course of life, thou art surely in the
<hi>highest</hi> degree tyed to magnifie and praise his
goodness, as having received from him the
<hi>greatest</hi> of mercies.</p>

                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:96830:71"/>
10. We are likewise to give <hi>thanks</hi> for
<hi>temporal</hi> blessings,<note place="margin">Temporal.</note> whether such as concern
the <hi>publick,</hi> as the <hi>prosperity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
or <hi>Nation,</hi> and all remarkable <hi>deliverances</hi>
offered to either; or else such as concern our
<hi>particulars,</hi> such are all the <hi>good</hi> things of <hi>this</hi>
life which we enjoy, as <hi>health, friends, food,
rayment,</hi> and the like; also for those <hi>minuitly</hi>
preservations, whereby we are by <hi>Gods</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>providence</hi> kept from <hi>danger,</hi> and the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special</hi>
deliverances which <hi>God</hi> hath given us
in time of greatest <hi>perils.</hi> It will be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to set down the several mercies which
everyman receives from <hi>God,</hi> because they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> between one man and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
But it is sure that he which receives
<hi>least,</hi> hath yet enough to imploy his whole
<hi>life</hi> in <hi>praises</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> And it will be very fit
for every man to consider the <hi>several</hi> passages
of this life, and the <hi>mercies</hi> he hath in each
received, and so to gather a kind of <hi>list,</hi> or
<hi>Catalogue</hi> of them, at least the <hi>principal</hi> of
them, which he may alwayes have in his <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi>
and after with a <hi>thankful</hi> heart repeat
before <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. These are the several <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi>
and all of them to be used both <hi>publickly</hi> and
<hi>privately.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Publick Prayer in the Church.</note> The <hi>publick</hi> use of them is, <hi>first</hi>
that in the <hi>Church</hi> where all meet to joyn in
those <hi>prayers,</hi> wherein they are in <hi>common</hi>
concerned. And this (where the <hi>prayers</hi> are
such as they ought to be) we should be very
constant at, there being an <hi>especial</hi> blessing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96830:72"/>
promised to the <hi>joynt</hi> requests of the faithful,
and he that without a necessary cause absents
himself from such <hi>publick prayers,</hi> cuts himself
off from the <hi>Church,</hi> which hath alwayes been
thought so unhappy a thing, that it is the
<hi>greatest punishment,</hi> the <hi>Governours</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> can lay upon the <hi>worst</hi> offender; and
therefore it is a strange <hi>madness</hi> for men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
it upon themselves.</p>
                  <p>12. A <hi>second</hi> sort of <hi>publick</hi> prayer,<note place="margin">In the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</note> is that
in a <hi>family,</hi> where all that are <hi>members</hi> of it,
joyn in their <hi>common</hi> supplications, and this
also ought to be very careful attended to; <hi>first</hi>
by the <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>Family,</hi> who is to look
that there be such <hi>prayers,</hi> it being as much
his <hi>part</hi> thus to <hi>provide</hi> for the <hi>souls</hi> of his
<hi>children</hi> and <hi>servants,</hi> as to provide <hi>food</hi> for
their <hi>bodies.</hi> Therefore there is none, even
the <hi>meanest</hi> housholder, but ought to take
this care: If either himself, or any of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi>
can read, he may use some <hi>prayers</hi> out
of some <hi>good book,</hi> if it be the <hi>service book</hi> of
the <hi>Church,</hi> he makes a <hi>good</hi> choice; if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
read, it will then be necessary they should
be taught without <hi>book</hi> some form of <hi>prayer,</hi>
which they may use in the <hi>Family,</hi> for which
purpose again some of the <hi>prayers</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> will be very fit, as being most easie
for their <hi>memories</hi> by reason of their <hi>shortness,</hi>
and yet containing a great deal of <hi>matter.</hi> But
what choice soever they make of <hi>Prayers,</hi> let
them be sure to have some, and let no man
that <hi>professes</hi> himself a <hi>Christian,</hi> keep
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96830:72"/>
so <hi>heathenish</hi> a <hi>Family,</hi> as not to see <hi>God</hi> be
daily worshipped in it. But when the <hi>Master</hi> of
a <hi>Family</hi> hath done his duty in this <hi>providing,</hi>
it is the duty of every <hi>member</hi> of it to make use
of that <hi>provision,</hi> by being <hi>constant,</hi> and <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>
at those <hi>Family-Prayers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Private</hi> or <hi>secret Prayer</hi> is that which
is used by a man <hi>alone,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Private Prayer.</note> a part from all others,
wherein we are to be more <hi>particular,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our <hi>peculiar</hi> needs, then in <hi>publick</hi> it
is fit to be. And this of <hi>private</hi> prayer, is a
duty, which will not be excused by the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the other of <hi>publick.</hi> They are <hi>both</hi>
required, and one must not be taken in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi>
for the other. And whoever is diligent
in <hi>publick</hi> prayers, and yet negligent in <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,</hi>
it is much to be feared, he rather seeks
to <hi>approve</hi> himself to <hi>men,</hi> then to <hi>God,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the command of our <hi>Saviour, Mat.</hi> 6.
Who enjoyns this <hi>private</hi> prayer, this <hi>praying
to our Father in secret,</hi> from whom alone we
are to expect our <hi>reward,</hi> and not from the
<hi>vain praises</hi> of <hi>men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. Now this duty of <hi>Prayer</hi> is to be <hi>often</hi>
performed,<note place="margin">Frequency in Prayer.</note> by none seldomer then <hi>evening</hi> and
<hi>morning,</hi> it being most necessary that we should
thus <hi>begin,</hi> and <hi>end</hi> all our works with <hi>God,</hi> and
that not only in respect of the <hi>duty</hi> we owe
him, but also in respect of our selves, who can
never be either <hi>prosperous,</hi> or <hi>safe,</hi> but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
our selves to him; and therefore should
<hi>tremble</hi> to venture on the <hi>perils</hi> either of <hi>day</hi>
or <hi>night,</hi> without his safeguard. How much
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96830:73"/>
oftner this duty is to be performed, must be
judged according to the <hi>business,</hi> or <hi>leisure</hi>
men have, where by <hi>business,</hi> I mean not such
<hi>business</hi> as men unprofitably make to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but the <hi>necessary</hi> business of a mans <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
which with some will not afford them
much <hi>time</hi> for set, and <hi>solemn</hi> Prayer. But
even these men may often in a day lift up their
<hi>hearts</hi> to <hi>God</hi> in some <hi>short</hi> Prayers, even
whilst they are at their <hi>work.</hi> As for those
that have <hi>more leisure,</hi> they are in all reason
to bestow <hi>more</hi> time upon this duty. And let
no man that can find time to bestow upon his

leisure for <hi>prayer,</hi> but let him now endeavour
to redeem, what he hath so mispent, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
more of that <hi>leisure</hi> in this duty for
the future. And surely if we did but rightly
weigh, how much it is our own <hi>advantage,</hi>

to be as <hi>frequent</hi> as we are ordinarily <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi>
in it.</p>
                  <p>15. For <hi>first</hi> it is a great <hi>honour</hi> for us poor

<hi>King</hi> should but vouchsafe to let one of his

with him, it would be looked on as a <hi>huge</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that man how <hi>despiseable</hi> soever he
were before, would then be the <hi>envy</hi> of all
his neighbours; and there is little question,
he would be willing to take all <hi>opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of receiving so great a <hi>grace.</hi> But alas!
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96830:73"/>
this is nothing to the <hi>honour</hi> is offered us, who
are allowed nay, <hi>invited</hi> to speak to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and therefore
how <hi>forward</hi> should we in all reason be to
it.</p>
                  <p>16. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is a great <hi>benefit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Benefit.</note> even the
greatest that can be imagined, for <hi>prayer</hi> is
the <hi>instrument</hi> of fetching down all <hi>good</hi> things
to us, whether <hi>spiritual,</hi> or <hi>temporal,</hi> no <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
that is qualified as it ought to be, but is
sure to bring down a <hi>blessing</hi> according to that
of the <hi>wise man, Eccl. 35. 17. The Prayer of
the humble pierceth the clouds, and will not
turn away, till the highest regard it.</hi> You
would think him a happy man, that had one
certain means of helping him to what ever he
<hi>wanted,</hi> though it were to <hi>cost</hi> him much <hi>pains,</hi>
and labour, now this <hi>happy</hi> man thou mayst
be if thou wilt. <hi>Prayer</hi> is the never-failing
means of bringing thee, if not all that thou
thinkest thou wantest, yet all that indeed thou
dost, that is, all that <hi>God</hi> sees fit for thee. And
therefore be there never so much <hi>weariness</hi> to
thy flesh in the duty, yet considering in what
continual <hi>want</hi> thou standest for something or
other from <hi>God,</hi> it is madness to let that <hi>uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
dishearten thee, and keep thee from this so
sure meanes of <hi>supplying</hi> thy wants.</p>
                  <p>17. But in the <hi>third</hi> place this duty is in it
self so far from being uneasie,<note place="margin">Pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> that it is very
<hi>pleasant. God</hi> is the <hi>fountain</hi> of <hi>happiness, and at
his right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
Psal.</hi> 16. 11. And therefore the <hi>nearer</hi> we
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96830:74"/>
draw to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>happier</hi> we must needs be, the
very <hi>joys</hi> of heaven arising from our <hi>neerness</hi> to
<hi>God.</hi> Now in this life we have no way of
<hi>drawing</hi> so neer to him, as by this of <hi>Prayer,</hi>
and therefore surely it is that, which in it self
is apt to afford <hi>abundance</hi> of <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
if it <hi>seem</hi> otherwise to us, it is from some
<hi>distemper</hi> of our own hearts, which like a <hi>sick</hi>
palate cannot relish the most pleasant meat.
<hi>Prayer</hi> is a <hi>pleasant</hi> duty, but it is withal a
<hi>spiritual</hi> one; and therefore if thy heart be
<hi>carnal,</hi>

marvail then, if thou taste no <hi>pleasantness</hi> in
it; if like the <hi>Israelites</hi> thou <hi>despise Manna,</hi>
whilst thou longest after the <hi>flesh pots of Egypt.</hi>
Therefore if thou find a <hi>weariness</hi> in this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>suspect</hi> thy self, <hi>purge,</hi> and <hi>refine</hi> thy heart
from the love of all <hi>sin,</hi> and endeavour to put
it into a <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> trance, and
then thou wilt find this no <hi>unpleasant</hi> exercise,
but full of delight and <hi>satisfaction.</hi> In the
mean time complain not of the <hi>hardness</hi> of
the duty, but of the <hi>untowardness</hi> of thy own
<hi>heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. But there may also be another <hi>reason</hi>
of its seeming <hi>unpleasant</hi> to us,<note place="margin">Want of one another.</note> and that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

want of <hi>use.</hi> You know there are many things,
which seem <hi>uneasie</hi> at the <hi>first</hi> tryal, which yet
after we are accustomed to them, seem very <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful,</hi>
and if this by thy case, then thou
knowest a ready <hi>cure, viz:</hi> to use it oftner,
and so this consideration naturally inforces
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96830:74"/>
the <hi>exhortation</hi> of being <hi>frequent</hi> in this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>19. But we are not only to consider how
<hi>often,</hi> but how <hi>well</hi> we perform it.<note place="margin">To ask no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</note> Now to
do it <hi>well,</hi> we are to respect, <hi>first</hi> the <hi>matter</hi>
of our <hi>Prayers,</hi> to look that we ask <hi>nothing</hi>
that is <hi>unlawful,</hi> as <hi>revenge</hi> upon our enemies,
or the like; <hi>secondly</hi> the <hi>manner;</hi> and that
must be <hi>first</hi> in <hi>faith,</hi> we must believe, that
if we ask as we ought,<note place="margin">To ask in Faith.</note> 
                     <hi>God</hi> will either give us
the thing we ask for, or else something which
he sees better for us.<note place="margin">In humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> And then <hi>secondly</hi> in
<hi>humility</hi> we must acknowledg our selves utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>unworthy</hi> of any of those good things we
beg for, and therefore sue for them only for
<hi>Christs</hi> sake; <hi>thirdly</hi> with <hi>attention,</hi> we must
<hi>mind</hi> what we are about,<note place="margin">With at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</note> and not suffer our
selves to be carried away to the thought of
other things. I told you at the first, that <hi>Prayer</hi>
was the <hi>business</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> but if our <hi>minds</hi>
be wandering, it is the work only of the
<hi>tongue</hi> and lips, which makes it in <hi>Gods</hi> account
no better then <hi>vain</hi> babbling, and so will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bring a <hi>blessing</hi> on us. Nay, as <hi>Jacob</hi> said
to his mother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 12. It will be more
likely to bring a <hi>curse</hi> on us then a <hi>blessing,</hi>
for it is a <hi>profaning</hi> one of the most <hi>solemn</hi>
parts of <hi>Gods</hi> service, it is a piece of <hi>Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi>
the <hi>drawing neer to him with our lip, when
our hearts are far from him,</hi> and a great <hi>slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>despising</hi> that dreadful <hi>Majesty</hi> we
come before: And as to our selves it is a
most <hi>ridiculous</hi> folly, that we who come to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96830:75"/>
                     <hi>God</hi> upon such <hi>weighty</hi> errands, as are all the
<hi>concernments</hi> of our <hi>souls</hi> and <hi>bodies,</hi> should in
the midst forget our <hi>business,</hi> and pursue eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the <hi>lightest</hi> thing that either our own <hi>vain
fancies,</hi> or the <hi>Divel,</hi> whose business it is here
to <hi>hinder</hi> us, can offer to us. It is just as if a
<hi>malefactor,</hi> that comes to sue for his <hi>life</hi> to the
<hi>King,</hi> should in the midst of his <hi>supplication</hi>
happen to espie a <hi>butterflie,</hi> and then should
leave his <hi>suit,</hi> &amp; run a chace after that <hi>butterflie:</hi>
Would you not think it <hi>pitty,</hi> a pardon should
be cast away upon so <hi>wretchless</hi> a creature. And
sure it will be as <hi>unreasonable</hi> to expect that
<hi>God</hi> should attend &amp; grant those <hi>suits</hi> of ours,
which we do not at all consider our selves.</p>
                  <p>20. This <hi>wandring</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> is a thing we
are much concerned to arm our selves against,<note place="margin">Helps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring.</note>
it being that to which we are naturally won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<hi>prone.</hi> To that end it will be necessary
<hi>first</hi> to possess our hearts at our coming to
<hi>Prayers</hi> with the <hi>greatness</hi> of that <hi>Majesty</hi>
we are to approach,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                     </note> that so we may <hi>dread</hi> to
be <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>trifling</hi> in his <hi>presence. Secondly,</hi>
We are to consider the great <hi>concernment</hi> of
the things we are to ask,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </note> some whereof are
such, that if we should not be heard, we were of
all creatures the most <hi>miserable,</hi> &amp; yet this wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
is the way to keep us from being <hi>heard.
Thirdly,</hi> We are to beg <hi>Gods</hi> aid in this <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:</hi>
And therefore when thou settest to <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prayer for Gods aid.</note>
let thy <hi>first petition</hi> be for this <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Lastly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> Be as <hi>watchful</hi> as is possible o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96830:75"/>
thy heart, in time of <hi>prayer,</hi> to keep out
all <hi>wandering</hi> thoughts, or if any have gotten
in, let them not find <hi>entertainment,</hi> but as
soon as ever thou discernest them, suffer them
not to <hi>abide</hi> one moment, but cast them out
with <hi>indignation,</hi> and beg <hi>Gods pardon</hi> for
them. And if thou dost thus <hi>sincerely,</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently</hi>
strive against them, either <hi>God</hi> will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thee in some measure to <hi>overcome</hi> them,
or he will in his <hi>mercy</hi> pardon thee what thou
canst not <hi>prevent.</hi> But if it be through thy
own <hi>negligence,</hi> thou art to expect neither, so
long as that negligence continues.</p>
                  <p>22. In the <hi>fourth</hi> place we must look our
<hi>Prayers</hi> be with <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>earnestness,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">With Zeal.</note> it is not
enough that we so far <hi>attend</hi> them, as barely
to <hi>know</hi> what it is we say, but we must put
forth all the <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>devotion</hi> of our <hi>souls,</hi>
and that according to the several parts of
<hi>Prayer</hi> before mentioned. It is not the <hi>cold
faint request,</hi> that will ever obtain from <hi>God.</hi>
We see it will not from our selves; for if a
<hi>beggar</hi> should ask <hi>relief</hi> from us, and do it in
such a <hi>scornful</hi> manner, that he seemed <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;</hi>
whether he had it or no, we should
think he had either little <hi>want</hi> or great <hi>pride,</hi>
and so have no heart to give him. Now surely
the things we ask from <hi>God,</hi> are so much above
the rule of an ordinary <hi>almes,</hi> that we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
expect they should be given to <hi>slight</hi> and
heartless petitions. No more in like manner
will our <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>thanksgiving</hi>
ever be accepted by him, if it be not offered
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96830:76"/>
from a heart truly affected with the <hi>sence</hi> of
his <hi>mercies;</hi> it's but a kind of <hi>formal complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
which wil never be approved by him who
<hi>requires</hi> the <hi>heart,</hi> and not the <hi>lips</hi> only. And
the like may be said of all the other <hi>parts</hi> of
<hi>Prayer.</hi> Therefore be careful when thou draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
nigh to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Prayer,</hi> to raise up thy <hi>soul</hi>
to the <hi>highest</hi> pitch of <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>earnestness</hi>
thou art able. And because of <hi>thy self</hi> alone
thou art not able to do any thing, beseech <hi>God</hi>
that he will inflame thy <hi>heart</hi> with this <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fire</hi> of <hi>devoti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n,</hi> and when thou hast obtained
it, beware that thou neither <hi>quench</hi> it by any
wilful sin, nor let it go out again for want of
<hi>stirring</hi> it up, and imploying it.</p>
                  <p>23. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> we must <hi>Pray</hi> with <hi>purity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">With puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> I
mean we must purge our <hi>hearts</hi> from all <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
to sin. This is surely the meaning of
the <hi>Apostle, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 8. When he commands
men to <hi>lift up holy hands in Prayer,</hi> and he
there instances in one <hi>special</hi> sort of <hi>sin, wrath</hi>
and <hi>doubting,</hi> whereby doubting is meant those
<hi>unkind disputes,</hi> and <hi>contentions</hi> which are so
common amongst men. And surely he that
cherishes that, or any other <hi>sin</hi> in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> heart,
can never <hi>lift up</hi> those <hi>holy hands,</hi> which are
required in this duty. And then sure his
<hi>prayers,</hi> be they never so <hi>many,</hi> or <hi>earnest,</hi>
will little avail him. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> will tell
him, he shall not be <hi>heard, Psal. 66. 18. If
I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will
not hear me.</hi> Nay <hi>Solomon</hi> will tell him yet
worse, that his <hi>prayers</hi> are not onely <hi>vain,</hi>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:96830:76"/>
but <hi>abominable, Pro. 15. 8. The sacrifice of
the wicked is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> And
thus to have our <hi>prayers turned into sin,</hi> is one
of the <hi>heaviest</hi> things can befal any man; we
see it is set down in that sad <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Psal.</hi> 109. 7. Therefore let us not be so
cruel to our selves, as to pull it upon our own
heads, which we certainly do, if we offer up
<hi>prayers</hi> from an <hi>impure heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. In the <hi>last</hi> place we must direct our
<hi>prayers</hi> to right <hi>ends,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To right ends.</note> And that either in the
respect of the <hi>prayer</hi> it self, or the <hi>things</hi> we
pray for; <hi>First,</hi> we must <hi>pray,</hi> not to gain the
<hi>praise</hi> of <hi>devotion</hi> amongst men like those <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
Mat.</hi> 6. 5. Nor yet onely for <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
or <hi>fashion</hi> sake, to do as other do; But
we must do it <hi>first</hi> as an act of <hi>worship</hi> to
God; <hi>Secondly,</hi> as an <hi>acknowledgment,</hi> that
he is that great <hi>spring,</hi> from whence alone we
expect all good things; And <hi>thirdly,</hi> to gain
a supply of our own, or others needs. Then
in respect of the <hi>things prayed</hi> for, we must
be sure to have no <hi>ill aimes</hi> upon them, we
must not <hi>ask,</hi> that we <hi>may consume it upon our
lusts, Ia.</hi> 4. 3. as those do, who pray for
<hi>wealth,</hi> that they may live in <hi>riot,</hi> and <hi>excess;</hi>
and for <hi>power,</hi> that they may be able to <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi>
their <hi>enemies,</hi> and the like But our
<hi>end</hi> in all must be Gods <hi>glory</hi> first, and next
that our <hi>own,</hi> and others <hi>Salvation,</hi> and all
other things must be taken in, onely as they
<hi>tend</hi> to those, which they can never do, if
we abuse them to <hi>sin.</hi> I have now done with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96830:77"/>
that <hi>first</hi> part of <hi>worship,</hi> that of the <hi>Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>25. The other is that of the <hi>body,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bodily worship.</note> and that
is nothing else, but such <hi>humble,</hi> and <hi>reverent
gestures</hi> in our approaches to God, as may
both express the <hi>inward</hi> reverence of our
<hi>Souls,</hi> and may also pay him some <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute</hi>
from our very <hi>bodies,</hi> with which the
<hi>Apostle</hi> commands us to <hi>glorify</hi> God, as well
as with our <hi>Souls;</hi> and good reason, since he
hath <hi>created,</hi> and <hi>redeemed</hi> the one, as well
as the other, whensoever therefore thou offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thy <hi>prayers</hi> unto God, let it be with all
<hi>lowliness</hi> as well of <hi>body,</hi> as of <hi>mind,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that of the <hi>Psalmist, Psal. 95. 6. O
come let us worship, let us fall down and kneel
before the Lord our maker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>26. The <hi>ninth</hi> duty to God,<note place="margin">Repentance</note> is REPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANCE.
That this is a duty to God we are
taught by the <hi>Apostle, Acts</hi> 20. 21. where
speaking of <hi>repentance,</hi> he stiles it <hi>repentance
towards</hi> God. And there is good reason this
should be a duty to <hi>him,</hi> since there is no <hi>sin</hi>
we commit, but is either <hi>mediatly,</hi> or <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly,</hi>
against him. For though there be
sins both against our selves, and our <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi>
yet they being forbidden by God, they
are also <hi>breaches</hi> of his Commandements, and
so <hi>sins</hi> against him.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>repentance</hi> is,<note place="margin">A turning from sin to God.</note> in short, nothing but a
<hi>turning</hi> fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our <hi>former evils,</hi> and in stead thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly

which God requireth of us. And this is so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96830:77"/>
a duty, that without it we certainly

5. Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. The <hi>directions</hi> for performing the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral</hi>

and thither I refer the reader. Onely I shall

a <hi>duty</hi> to be <hi>practised</hi> onely at the time of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi>
the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> For this being the
onely <hi>remedy</hi> against the <hi>poyson</hi> of sin, we must
renew it as often as we <hi>repeat</hi> our <hi>sins,</hi> that is
daily.<note place="margin">Daily.</note> I mean we must <hi>every day repent</hi> of
the sins of that <hi>day,</hi> for what <hi>Christ</hi> saith of
other <hi>evils,</hi> is true also of this, <hi>sufficient to

of <hi>each day</hi> to exercise a <hi>daily repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
and therefore every man must thus
<hi>daily</hi> call himself to account.</p>
                  <p>28. But as it is in <hi>accounts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">At set times.</note> they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
set down their <hi>daily expences,</hi> have
yet some set time of <hi>casting</hi> up the whole
summe; as at the end of the <hi>week</hi> or <hi>moneth;</hi>
so should it also be here, we should set aside
some time to <hi>humble</hi> our selves solemnly before
God for the sins, not of that <hi>day</hi> onely, but of
our <hi>whole lives.</hi> And the <hi>frequenter</hi> these
times are, the <hi>better.</hi> For the oftner we
thus cast up our <hi>accounts</hi> with God, and see
vast <hi>debts</hi> we are run in to him, the more <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
shall we think of our selves, and the more
shall thirst after his <hi>mercy,</hi> which two are the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96830:78"/>
                     <hi>special</hi> things that must qualify us for his <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
He therefore that can assign himself one
day in the <hi>week</hi> for this purpose, will take a
<hi>thriving</hi> course for his <hi>Soul.</hi> Or if any mans
state of life be so <hi>busie,</hi> as not to afford him
to do it so often, let him yet come as neer to
that <hi>frequency,</hi> as is possible for him, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
alwayes, that none of his <hi>worldly</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
can bring him in neer so <hi>gainful</hi>
a return as this <hi>spiritual</hi> one will do, and
therefore it is very ill <hi>husbandry</hi> to pursue
them, to the neglect of this.</p>
                  <p>29. Besides these <hi>constant</hi> times,<note place="margin">In the time of affliction</note> there are
likewise <hi>occasion all</hi> times for the performance
of this duty, such especially are the times of <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,</hi>
and <hi>affliction,</hi> for when any such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals
us, we are to look on it as a <hi>message</hi> sent
from Heaven, to call us to this duty, and
therefore must never neglect it, when we are
thus summoned to it, lest we be of the <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
of them, who despise the <hi>chastisements of
the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 5.</p>
                  <p>30. There is yet another time of <hi>repentance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">At Death.</note>
which in the practice of men hath gotten
away the custome from all those, and that is
the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> which, it is true, is a time
very fit to <hi>renew</hi> our <hi>repentance,</hi> but sure not
proper to <hi>begin</hi> it, and it is a most <hi>desperate
madness</hi> for men to defer it till then. For to
say the <hi>middest</hi> of it, it is the <hi>venturing</hi> our
Souls upon such <hi>miserable uncertainties,</hi> as no
wise man would trust with any thing of the
<hi>least value.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:96830:78"/>
For <hi>first,</hi> I would ask any man,<note place="margin">The danger of defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it till then.</note> that means
to <hi>repent</hi> at his <hi>death,</hi> how he knows he shall
have an <hi>hours</hi> time for it? do we not daily
see men <hi>snatch'd</hi> away in a <hi>moment?</hi> and who
can tell that it shal not be his own case? But <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
suppose he have a more <hi>leisurely</hi> death,
that some <hi>disease</hi> give him warning of its <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,</hi>
yet perhaps he will not <hi>understand</hi>
that warning, but will still <hi>flatter</hi> himself, as
very often <hi>sick</hi> people do, with <hi>hopes</hi> of life
to the last: and so his <hi>death</hi> may be <hi>sudden</hi> to
him, though it come by never so <hi>slow</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
But again <hi>thirdly,</hi> if he do discern his
<hi>danger,</hi> yet how is he sure he shall then be
able to <hi>repent? Repentance</hi> is a <hi>grace</hi> of God,
not at our own <hi>command,</hi> and it is <hi>just</hi> and
usual with God, when men have a long time
<hi>refused,</hi> and <hi>rejected</hi> that <hi>grace,</hi> resisted all
his cals, and <hi>invitations</hi> to <hi>conversion</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment,</hi>
to give them over at last to the
<hi>hardness</hi> of their own <hi>hearts,</hi> and not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
them any more of that <hi>grace</hi> they have so
<hi>despised.</hi> Yet suppose in the <hi>fourth</hi> place,
That God in his infinite patience should still
continue the <hi>offer</hi> of that <hi>grace</hi> to thee, yet
thou that hast resisted, it may be <hi>thirty,</hi> or
<hi>forty</hi> or <hi>fifty</hi> years together, how knowest
thou,<note place="margin">The disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a death-bed repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> that thou shalt put off that <hi>habit</hi> of
resistance upon a <hi>sudden,</hi> and make use of the
<hi>grace</hi> afforded? It is sure, thou hast many
more <hi>advantages</hi> towards the doing it <hi>now</hi>
then thou wilt have <hi>then.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>31. For the <hi>first,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The custom of sin.</note> The longer sin hath kept
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96830:79"/>
                     <hi>possession</hi> of the heart, the harder it will be to
drive it out. It is trne, if <hi>repentance</hi> were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but a present <hi>ceasing</hi> from the <hi>acts</hi> of
sin, the <hi>death-bed</hi> were fittest for it, for then
we are disabled from <hi>committing</hi> most sins,
but I have formerly shewed you, <hi>repentance</hi>
contains much more then so, there must be in
it a <hi>sincere hatred</hi> of sin and <hi>love</hi> of God.
Now how unlikely is it, that he which hath all
his life loved sin, <hi>cherisht</hi> it in his <hi>bosome,</hi> &amp; on
the contrary abhorred God and <hi>goodness,</hi>
should in an instant quite change his <hi>affections,</hi>
hate that sin he <hi>loved,</hi> and love <hi>God,</hi> and
<hi>goodness,</hi> which before he utterly hated?</p>
                  <p>32. And <hi>secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bodily pains.</note> The bodily <hi>pains,</hi> that
attend a <hi>death-bed,</hi> will <hi>distract</hi> thee, and
make thee unable to attend the work of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
which is a business of such <hi>weight,</hi>
and <hi>difficulty,</hi> as will employ all our <hi>powers,</hi>
even when they are at the <hi>freshest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>33. Consider those <hi>disadvantages</hi> thou
must then struggle with,<note place="margin">Danger of unsincerity.</note> and then tell me
what <hi>hope</hi> there is, thou shalt then do that,
which now upon much <hi>easier</hi> terms thou wilt
not. But in the <hi>fifth</hi> place, there is a <hi>danger</hi>
behind, beyond all these, and that is, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>repentance</hi> which death drives a man to, will
not be a true <hi>repentance,</hi> for in such a case it is
plain, it is onely the <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>hell</hi> puts him on
it, which though it may be a good <hi>beginning,</hi>
where there is time after to <hi>per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ect</hi> it, yet where
it goes alone, it can never avail for <hi>Salvation.</hi>
Now that <hi>death-bed repentances</hi> are often one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96830:79"/>
of this sort, is too likely, when it is observed,
that many men who have seemed to <hi>repent,</hi>
when they have thought <hi>death</hi> approaching,
have yet, after it hath pleased <hi>God</hi> to restore
them to <hi>health,</hi> been as wicked (perhaps
worse) as ever they were before; Which
shews plainly, that there was no <hi>reall</hi> change
in them, and then surely had such a man died,
in that <hi>seeming repentance, God,</hi> who <hi>tries the
heart,</hi> would not have accepted it, which he
saw was <hi>unsincere.</hi> When all these <hi>dangers</hi>
are layed together, it will surely appear a most
<hi>disperate</hi> adventure for any man to trust to a
<hi>death-bed repentance.</hi> Nor is it ever the less
for that <hi>example</hi> of the <hi>penitent thief,</hi> Luc. 23.
43. which is by many so much <hi>depended</hi> on.
For it is sure, his case and ours <hi>differ</hi> widely,
he had never heard of <hi>Christ</hi> before, and so
more could not be expected of him then to
embrace him as <hi>soon</hi> as he was tendred to him;
But we have had him <hi>offered,</hi> nay <hi>prest</hi> upon us
from our <hi>cradles</hi> and yet have <hi>rejected.</hi> But
if there were not this <hi>difference,</hi> it is but a
<hi>faint</hi> hope can be raised onely from a <hi>single
example,</hi> and another we find not in the whole
<hi>Bible.</hi> The <hi>Israelites</hi> we read were <hi>fed with
Manna from Heaven,</hi> but would you not
think him stark <hi>mad,</hi> that should out of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi>
of the like, neglect to <hi>provide</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
any food; Yet it is full as <hi>reasonable</hi> to
depend upon this <hi>example</hi> as the other. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all in the words of the wiseman, <hi>Eccl. 12.
1. Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:96830:80"/>
youth before the evil dayes come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>34. To this duty of <hi>repentance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fasting.</note> 
                     <hi>fasting</hi> is
very proper to be annexed. The <hi>Scripture</hi>
usually joyns them together, among the <hi>Jews</hi>
the <hi>great day of atonement</hi> was to be kept with
<hi>fasting,</hi> as you may see by comparing <hi>Levit.
16.</hi> 31. with <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 5. and this by <hi>Gods</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special
appointment. And in the <hi>Prophets,</hi>
when the people are called on to <hi>repent,</hi> and
<hi>humble themselves,</hi> they are also called on to
<hi>fast.</hi> Thus it is <hi>Joel 2. 12. Therefore now
thus saith the Lord, turn ye unto me with all
your hearts, with fasting, and with weeping,</hi>
&amp;c. Yea, so proper hath <hi>fasting</hi> been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to <hi>humiliation,</hi> that we see even
<hi>wicked Ahab</hi> would not omit it in his, 2 <hi>Kings
21.</hi> 27. Nor the <hi>Heathen Ninevites</hi> in theirs,
<hi>Jonah</hi> 3. 5. Nor is it less <hi>fit,</hi> or less <hi>accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
since <hi>Christ,</hi> then it was before him. For
we see he supposes it as a <hi>duty</hi> sometimes to be
performed, when he gives <hi>directions</hi> to avoid
<hi>vain-glory</hi> in it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 6. and also assures
us, that if it be performed, as it ought, not
to <hi>please men,</hi> but <hi>God,</hi> it will surely be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded</hi>
by him. And accordingly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e find it
<hi>practised</hi> by the <hi>Saints: Anna Luk. 2. 37.
Served God with fastings and prayers;</hi> where it
is observable, that it is reckoned as a <hi>service</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> fit to be joyned with <hi>prayers.</hi> And the
<hi>Christians</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> times were generally
very frequent in the <hi>practice</hi> of it. Now
though <hi>fasting</hi> be especially <hi>proper</hi> to a time of
<hi>humiliation,</hi> yet is it not so restrained to it,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96830:80"/>
but it may be <hi>seasonable,</hi> whensoever we have
any <hi>extraordinary</hi> thing to request from <hi>God.</hi>
Thus when <hi>Esther</hi> was to endeavour the <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi>
of her people from destruction, she
&amp; all the <hi>Jews</hi> kept a <hi>solemn</hi> fast, <hi>Esther</hi> 4. 16.
and thus when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were to be
<hi>ordained Apostles,</hi> there was <hi>fasting</hi> joyned to
<hi>prayer, Acts</hi> 13. 3. And so it will be very fit
for us, whensoever we have need of any <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi>
directions, or <hi>assistance</hi> from <hi>God</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concerning our <hi>temporal</hi> or <hi>spiritual</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
thus to quicken our <hi>prayers</hi> by
<hi>fasting.</hi> But above all <hi>occasions,</hi> this of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi>
seems most to require it, for besides
the advantage of <hi>kindling</hi> our <hi>zeal,</hi> which is
never more necessary, then when we beg for
<hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>sins, fasting</hi> carries in it somewhat
of <hi>revenge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fasting a a revenge upon our selves</note> which is reckoned as a <hi>special</hi>
part of <hi>repentance, 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 11. For by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi>
our bodies the <hi>refreshment</hi> of our <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
food,</hi> we do inflict somewhat of <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
upon our selves, for our former <hi>excesses,</hi>
or whatever other sins we at that time <hi>accuse</hi>
our selves of; which is a <hi>proper effect</hi> of that
<hi>indignation</hi> which every sinner ought to
have against himself. And truly he that is so
<hi>tender</hi> of himself, that he can never find in
his heart so much as to miss a <hi>meal,</hi> by way
of <hi>punishment</hi> for his <hi>faults,</hi> shews he is not
much <hi>fallen</hi> out with himself, for committing
them, and so wants that <hi>indignation,</hi> which
the <hi>Apostle</hi> in the forenamed <hi>text</hi> mentions,
as a part of true <hi>repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:96830:81"/>
35. There is no doubt,<note place="margin">Such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with God.</note> but such <hi>Holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges</hi>
upon our selves for sins are very <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi>
to <hi>God,</hi> yet we must not think that
either those, or any thing else we can doe, can
make <hi>satisfaction</hi> for our offences,<note place="margin">Yet no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for sins.</note> for that
nothing but the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> can do. And
therefore on <hi>that,</hi> and not on any of <hi>our</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
we must depend for <hi>pardon.</hi> Yet
since that <hi>blood</hi> shall never be <hi>applyed</hi> to any
but <hi>penitent</hi> sinners, we are as much concern'd
to <hi>bring forth all the fruits of repentance,</hi> as
if our <hi>hopes</hi> depended on them onely.</p>
                  <p>36. How <hi>often</hi> this duty of <hi>fasting</hi> is to be
performed,<note place="margin">Times of fasting.</note> we have no direction in <hi>Scripture.</hi>
That must be allotted by mens own <hi>piety,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as their <hi>health,</hi> or other <hi>considerations</hi>
will allow. But as it is in <hi>humiliation,</hi> the
<hi>frequenter</hi> returns we have of set times for it,
the <hi>better;</hi> so is it likewise in <hi>fasting,</hi> the <hi>of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
the <hi>better,</hi> so it be not <hi>hurtful</hi> either to
our <hi>healths,</hi> or to some other <hi>duty</hi> required
of us. Nay perhaps <hi>fasting</hi> may help some
men to more of those times for <hi>humiliation,</hi>
then they would otherwise <hi>gain.</hi> For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
there are some, who cannot, without a
manifest <hi>hinderance</hi> to their <hi>calling,</hi> allow a
whole <hi>day</hi> to that work, yet such a one may
at least afford that <hi>time,</hi> he would otherwise
spend in <hi>eating;</hi> And so <hi>fasting</hi> will be <hi>doubly</hi>
useful towards such a mans <hi>humiliation,</hi> both
by helping him in the duty, and gaining him
<hi>time</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>37. I have now gone through the <hi>first</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:96830:81"/>

having no other. Of which I need say little, as
it is a <hi>forbidding</hi> of that grosser sort of <hi>heathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
Idolatry,</hi> the worshipping of <hi>Idols,</hi> which
though it were once common in the world, yet
is now so rare, that it is not likely any that shall
read this, will be concerned in it. Onely I
must say, that to pay <hi>divine worship</hi> to any
creature, be it <hi>Saint</hi> or <hi>Angel,</hi> yea or the
<hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> himself, is a <hi>transgression</hi>
against this <hi>second</hi> branch of our duty to <hi>God,</hi>
it being the <hi>imparting</hi> that to a <hi>creature</hi> which
is due onely to <hi>God,</hi> and therefore is strictly
to be abstained from.</p>
                  <p>38. But there is <hi>another</hi> sort of <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Inward Idolatry.</note>
of which we are generally guilty, and that is
when we pay those affections of <hi>love, fear,
trust,</hi> and the like, to any <hi>creature</hi> in a higher
degree then we do to <hi>God.</hi> For that is the
setting up that thing, whatsoever it is, for our
<hi>God.</hi> And this <hi>inward</hi> kind of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is
that, which provokes <hi>God</hi> to <hi>jealousy,</hi> as well
as the <hi>outward</hi> of <hi>worshipping</hi> an <hi>Idol.</hi> I might
inlarge much upon this, but because some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verals

                  <p>2 The <hi>first</hi> of them is <hi>humility,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Humility.</note> which may
well have the <hi>prime</hi> place, not only in respect
of the <hi>excellency</hi> of the <hi>vertue,</hi> but also of it

the necessity of it, I am now to speak of
humility, as it concerns our selves, which will
be found no less necessary, then the former.</p>
                  <p>3. This humility is of two sorts, the <hi>first</hi>
is the having a mean and low opinion of our
selves, the <hi>second</hi> is the being content that
others should have so of us. The <hi>first</hi> of these
is contrary to pride, the other to vain glory.
And that both these are absolutely necessary
to Christians, I am now to shew you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which
will, I conceive, best be done by laying before
you <hi>first</hi> the sin, <hi>secondly</hi> the danger, and <hi>third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
the folly of the contrary vices.</p>
                  <p>4. And <hi>first</hi> for pride;<note place="margin">The great sin of pride.</note> the sin of it is so
great, that it cast the <hi>Angels</hi> out of <hi>heaven,</hi>
and therefore if we may judg of sin by the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi>
it was not only the <hi>first,</hi> but the
greatest sin that ever the <hi>Divel</hi> himself hath
bin guilty of: But we need no better proof
of the hainousness of it, then the extreme hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of it to God, which besides that
instance of his punishing the <hi>Divel,</hi> we may
frequently find in the <hi>Scriptures, Prov. 16. 5.
Every one that is proud in heart, is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination
to the Lord.</hi> And again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 16.
Where there is mention of several things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
<hi>Lord</hi> hates, <hi>a proud look</hi> is set as the <hi>first</hi> of
them: So <hi>Jam. 4. 7. God resisteth the proud;</hi> and
divers other texts there are to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
which shew the great hatred God bears
to this sin of pride Now since it is certain,
God who is all goodness hates nothing, but
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96830:83"/>
as it is evil, it must needs follow, that where
God hates in so great a degree, there must be
a great degree of evil.</p>
                  <p>5. But <hi>secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The danger.</note> pride is not only very sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but very dangerous, and that <hi>first</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of drawing us to our sins,<note place="margin">Drawing into other sins.</note> 
                     <hi>secondly</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
us to <hi>punishments. First,</hi> pride draws
us to other sins, wherein it shews it self indeed
to be the direct contrary to humility, for as
that is the root of all vertu, so is this of all vice.
For he that is proud, sets himself up as his own
God, and so can never submit himself to any
other rules or Laws, then what he makes to
himself. The ungodly, sayes the <hi>Psalmist, is
so proud that he careth not for God, Psal.</hi> 10. 4.
Where you see it is his pride, that makes him
despise God. And when a man is once come
to that, he is prepared for the commission of all
sins. I might instance in a <hi>multitude</hi> of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
sins, that naturally flow from this of
pride, as <hi>first anger,</hi> which the wise man sets,
as the effect of pride, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21. 24. calling it
<hi>proud wrath; secondly, strife</hi> and <hi>contention,</hi>
which he again notes to be the off-spring of
pride, <hi>Pro. 13. 10. Only by pride cometh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</hi>
And both these are indeed most <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
effects of pride. For he that thinks very
highly of himself, expects much submission,
and observance from others, and therefore
cannot but rage and quarrel, whenever he
thinks it not sufficiently payed. It would be
infinite to mention all the fruits of this bitter
root, I shall name but one more, and that is,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96830:83"/>
that pride not only betrays us to many sins,
but also makes them incureable in us, for it
hinders the working of all remedies.</p>
                  <p>6. Those remedies must either come from
God or man;<note place="margin">Frustrating of remedies.</note> if from God, they must be either
in the way of meekness and greatness, or else
of sharpness and punishment. Now if God
by his goodness essay to lead a proud man to
repentance, he quite mistakes Gods meaning,
and thinks all the mercies he receives, are but
the reward of his own desert, and so long 'tis
sure he will never think he needs repentance.
But if on the other side, Gods use him more
sharply, and lay afflictions, and punishments
upon him, those in a proud heart work no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but murmurings and hatings of God,
as if he did him injury in those punishments.
As for the remedies that can be used by man,
they again must be either by way of <hi>correcttion,</hi>
or <hi>exhortation;</hi> correcttion from man will
sure never work more on a proud heart, then
those from <hi>God;</hi> for he that can think God
unjust in them, will much rather believe it of
man. And exhortations will do as little. For
let a proud man be admonished though never
so mildly and lovingly, he looks on it as a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.
And therefore in stead of <hi>confessing,</hi>
or amending the fault, he falls to reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his reprover, as an over-busy, or censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
person, and for that greatest and most
precious act of kindness, looks on him as his
enemy. And now one that thus stubbornly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
all means of cure, must be included
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96830:84"/>
in a most dangerous estate.</p>
                  <p>7. But besides this danger of sin,<note place="margin">Betraying to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> I told you
there was another, that of <hi>punishment;</hi> and of
this there will need little proof, when it it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
that God is the proud mans profest
enemy; that he hates and resists him, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the texts forecited: And then there
can be little doubt, that he which hath so
mighty an adversarie shall be sure to smart for
it; Yet besides this general ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
it may not be a miss to mention some
of those <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>xts,</hi> which particularly threaten
this sin, as <hi>Pro. 16. 18. Pride goeth before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and an haughty spirit before a fall:</hi>
Again, <hi>Pro. 16. 5. Every one that is proud
in heart is an abomination to the Lord, though
hand joyn in hand, yet they shall not be unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</hi>
The decree it seems is unalterable, and
whatever endeavours are used to preserve the
proud man, they are but vain, for he <hi>shall not
go unpunished.</hi> And this is very remarkable
in the story of <hi>Nebuchadnezar, Dan.</hi> 4.
Who though a King, the greatest in the world,
yet for his pride, was <hi>driven from among men,</hi>
to dwell and feed with beasts. And it is most
frequently seen, that this sin meets with very
<hi>extraordinary</hi> judgments even in this life.
But if it should not, let not the <hi>proud man</hi>
think that he hath escaped <hi>Gods vengeance,</hi>
for it is sure, there will be a most sad reckoning
in the next; for if God spared not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
for this sin, but cast them into hell, let no
man hope to speed better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:96830:84"/>
8. In the <hi>third</hi> place,<note place="margin">The folly.</note> I am to shew you
the great <hi>folly</hi> of this sin, and to do that, it
will be necessary to consider the several things,
whereof men use to be proud; they are of three
sorts, either those which we call the <hi>goods</hi> of
<hi>nature,</hi> or the <hi>goods</hi> of <hi>fortune,</hi> or the <hi>goods of
grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. By the <hi>goods of nature,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In respect of the goods of Nature.</note> I mean <hi>beauty,
strength, wit,</hi> and the like, and the being
proud of any of these is a huge <hi>folly.</hi> For
<hi>first</hi> we are very apt to mistake, and think
our selves hand some or witty, when
we are not, and then there cannot be a
more <hi>ridiculous folly,</hi> then to be proud of
what we have not, and such every one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steems
it in another man, though he never
supposes it his own case, and so never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
it in himself. And therefore there is
nothing more despiseable amongst all men,
then a <hi>proud fool,</hi> yet no man that entertains
high opinions of his own wit, but is in
danger to be thus deceived, a mans own
judgment of himself being of all others
the least to be trusted. But <hi>Secondly,</hi>
suppose we be not out in judging, yet what
is there in any of these <hi>natural</hi> endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which is worth the being proud.
There being scarce any of them, which
some creature or other hath not in a
greater degree then man. How much
does the whiteness of the Lilly, and
the redness of the Rose exceed the
white, and red of the fairest face?
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96830:85"/>
what a multitude of creatures is there, that
farr surpass man in strength and sweetness? And
divers others there are which as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
any useful end of theirs, act much more
wisely then most of us; and are therefore of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
in Scripture proposed to us by way
of Example. It is therefore surely great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness
for us to think highly of our
selves, for such things as are common to us
with beasts and plants. But <hi>thirdly,</hi> if they were
as excellent as we fancy them, yet they are
not at all durable, they are impaired and lost
by sundry means; a phrensy will destroy the
rarest wit, a sickness decay the freshest beauty,
the greatest strength, or however old age will
be sure to do all. And therefore to be proud
of them is again a folly in this respect. But
lastly, whatever they are, we gave them not to
our selves. No man can think he did any
thing towards the procuring his natural beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or wit, and so can with no reason value
himself for them.</p>
                  <p>10 In the <hi>second</hi> place,<note place="margin">The goods of fortune.</note> the folly is as great
to be proud of the goods of fortune; by them
I mean wealth and honour, and the like; for
it is sure, they add nothing of true worth to
the man, somewhat of outward pomp, and
bravery they may help him to, but that makes
no change in the person. You may load an
Asse with money, or deck him with rich trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings,
yet still you will not make him a whit
the nobler kind of beast by either of them.
Then <hi>secondly,</hi> these are things we have no
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96830:85"/>
hold of, they vanish many times, ere we are
aware, he that is rich to day, may be poor to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow,
and then will be the less pitied by
all in his poverty, the prouder he was when
he was rich. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We have them all, but
as <hi>Stewards,</hi> to lay out for our <hi>Masters</hi> use,
and therefore should rather think how to
make our accounts, then pride our selves in
our receipts. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Whatever of these we
have, they, as well as the former, are not
owing to our selves. But if they be lawfully
gotten, we owe them onely to God, whose
blessing it is, that maketh rich, <hi>Pro.</hi> 10. 22.
If unlawfully, we have them upon such terms,
that we have very little reason to brag of
them. And thus you see in these several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
the folly of this second sort of
pride.</p>
                  <p>11. The <hi>third</hi> is that of the goods of grace;<note place="margin">The goods of grace.</note>
that is any vertue a man hath. And here I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say, but the things are very valuable, they
being infinitely more precious, then all the
world, yet nevertheless this is of all the rest the
highest folly. And that not onely in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
respect, that we help not our selves to it,
grace being above all things most immediatly
Gods Work in us, but especially in this, that
the being proud of grace, is the sure way to
loose it. God, who gives grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
will take it from the proud. For if, as
we see in the parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 28. the talent
was <hi>taken from him</hi> who had onely put it to
no use at all, how shall he hope to have it
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96830:86"/>
continued to him, that hath put it to so ill,
that in stead of trading with it for God, hath
trafficked with it for <hi>Satan?</hi> And as he will
loose the grace for the future, so he will
loose all reward of it for the time past. For
let a man have done never so many good acts,
yet if he be proud of them, that pride shall
be charged on him to his destruction, but the
good shall never be remembred to his reward.
And this proves it to be a most wretched folly
to be proud of grace. It is like that of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that pull those things in pieces, they
are most fond of, but yet much worse then
that of theirs, for we not onely loose the thing
(and that the most precious that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
but we must also be eternally punished
for doing so, there being nothing that shall be
so sadly reckoned for in the next world, as
the abuse of grace, and certainly there can
be no greater abuse of it, then to make it
serve for an end so directly contrary to that
for which it was given, it being given to make
us humble, not proud, to magnify God, not
our selves.</p>
                  <p>12. Having shewed you thus much of this
sin,<note place="margin">Means of Humility.</note> I suppose it will appear very necessary to
be eschewed, to which purpose it will <hi>first</hi> be
useful to consider, what hath been already
said concerning it, and that so seriously, as
may work in thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not some slight dislike, but
a deep, and irreconcileable hatred of the sin;
<hi>secondly</hi> to be very watchful over thine own
heart, that it cherish not any beginnings of it;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96830:86"/>
never suffer it to feed on the fancy of thy own
worth, but when ever any such thought arises,
beat it down immediatly with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of some of thy follies or sins, and so
make this very motion of pride an occasion of
humility. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Never to compare thy self
with those thou thinkest more foolish or
wicked then thy self, that so thou mayest
like the <hi>Pharisee</hi> Luk. 16. 11. extol thy self,
for being better, but if thou wilt compare, do
it with the Wise, and Godly, and then thou
wilt find thou comest so far short, as may help
to pull down thy high esteem of thy self.
<hi>Lastly,</hi> To be very earnest in Prayer, that
God would root out all degrees of this sin in
thee, and make thee one of those <hi>poor in
Spirit,</hi> Mat. 5. 3. to whom the blessing, even
of Heaven it self, is promised.</p>
                  <p>13. The <hi>second</hi> contrary to humility I told
you was <hi>vain glory.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vain glory.</note> That is a great thirst
after the praise of men.<note place="margin">The sin.</note> And <hi>first,</hi> that this
is a sin, I need prove no otherwise, then by
the words of our Saviour, <hi>Jo. 5. 44. How can
ye believe, that receive honour one of another?</hi>
Where it appears, that it is not onely a sin,
but such a one, as hinders the receiving of
Christ into the heart, for so believing there
signifies.<note place="margin">The danger</note> This then in the <hi>second</hi> place shews
you likewise the great dangerousness of this
sin, for if it be that, which keeps Christ out of
the heart, it is sure it brings infinite danger,
since all our safety, all our hope of escaping
the wrath to come, stands in receiving him?
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96830:87"/>
But besides the authority of this text, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
experience shews, that where ever this sin
hath possession, it endangers men to fall into
any other. For he that so considers the praise
of men, that he must at no hand part with it,
when ever the greatest sins come to be in
fashion, and credit (as God knows many
are now a daies) he will be sure to commit
them, rather then run the disgrace of being
too singular, and precise; I doubt there are
many consciences can witness the truth of
this, so that I need say no more to prove the
<hi>danger</hi> of this sin.</p>
                  <p>14. The <hi>third</hi> thing I am to shew,<note place="margin">The folly.</note> is the
<hi>folly</hi> of it, And that will appear <hi>first</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
what it is we thus hunt after, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a little <hi>air,</hi> a <hi>blast,</hi> the <hi>breath</hi> of
men, it brings us in nothing of reall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
for I am made never the wiser, nor the
better, for a mans saying I am wise, and
good. Besides if I am commended, it must
be either before my face, or behind my back,
if the former, it is very often flattery, and so
the greatest abuse that can be offered, and
then I must be very much a fool, to be pleased
with it. But if it be behind my back, I have
not then so much as the pleasure of knowing
it, and therefore it is a strange <hi>folly</hi> thus to
pursue, what is so utterly gainless. But <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
It is not onely gainless, but painful,
and uneasy also. He that eagerly seeks Prayer,
is not at all Master of himself, but must suit
all his actions to that end, and in stead of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96830:87"/>
doing what his own reason and conscience
(nay perhaps his wordly conveniency) directs
him to, he must take care to do what wil bring
him in <hi>commendations,</hi> and so enslaves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to every one that hath but a tongue to
commend him. Nay there is yet a further
uneasiness in it, and that is, when such a man
fails of his aime, when he misses the praise,
and perhaps meets with the contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
(which is no mans lot more often
then the vain glorious, nothing making a man
more despised) then what disturbances and
disquiets, and even tortures of mind is he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
A lively instance of this you have in
<hi>Achitophel, 2 Sam.</hi> 17. 23. who had so
much of this upon <hi>Absoloms despising his
counsel,</hi> that he chose to rid himself of it,
by <hi>hanging</hi> himself. And sure this painfulness
that thus attends this sin, is sufficient proof of
the <hi>folly</hi> of it. Yet this is not all, it is yet
further very hurtful: For if this <hi>vain glory</hi>
be concerning any good, or Christian action,
it destroyes all the fruit of it; he that <hi>prayes</hi> or
gives <hi>almes</hi> to be <hi>seen of men, Mat.</hi> 6. 2. must
take that as his reward, <hi>Verily I say unto you
they have their reward,</hi> they must expect none
from God, but the portion of those hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
that love the <hi>the praise of men more
then the praise of God.</hi> And this is a miserable
<hi>folly</hi> to make such an exchange. It is like the
<hi>dog</hi> in the fable, who seeing in the water the
shadow of that meat he held in his mouth,
catcht at the shadow, &amp; so let go meat. Such
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96830:88"/>
                     <hi>dogs,</hi> such unreasonable creatures are we,
when we thus let go the eternal rewards of
Heaven, to catch at a few good words of men.
And yet we do not onely loose those eternal
joyes, but procure to our selves the contrary
eternal mercies, which is sure the highest pitch
of <hi>folly</hi> and madness. But if the <hi>vain glory</hi>
be not concerning any vertuous action, but
only some indifferent thing, yet even there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
it is very hurtful; for <hi>vain glory</hi> is a sin, that
wheresoever it is placed, endangers our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
estate, which is the greatest of all mischiefs.
And even for the present it is observable, that
of all other sins, it stands the most in its own
light, hinders it self of that very thing it
pursues. For there are very few that thus
hunt after praise, but they are discerned to do
so, and that is sure to <hi>eclipse</hi> whatever praise
worthy thing they do, and brings scorn upon
them in stead of <hi>reputation.</hi> And then certainly
we may justly condemn this sin of <hi>folly,</hi> which
is so ill a manager even of its own dedesigns.</p>
                  <p>15. You have seen how wretched a thing
this <hi>vain glory</hi> is,<note place="margin">

check, and resist it; suffer it not to be the
end of thy actions; But in all matters of

direct thee; and though thou mayest so far
consider in those things the opinion of men,
as to observe the rules of <hi>common decency,</hi> yet

contriving for; <hi>Secondly,</hi> Set up to thy self
<hi>another aime, viz</hi> that of <hi>pleasing</hi> God;
let that be thy inquiry when thou goest about
any thing, whether it be approved by him,
and then thou wilt not be at leisure to consider
what praise it will bring thee from men.
And surely he that weighs of how much more
moment it is to please God, who is able eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to reward us, then men, whose applause
can never do us any good, will surely think it
reasonable, to make the former his onely care.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> If at any time thou art praised, do
not be much overjoyed with it, nor think a
jot the better of thy self, but if it be vertue
thou art praised for, remember it was God,
that wrought it in thee, and give him the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
never thinking any part of it belongs to
thee; If it be some indifferent action, then
remember that it cannot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deserve praise, as
having no goodness in it; But if it be a bad
one (as amongst men such are sometimes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
to be commended) then it ought to set
thee a trembling, in stead of rejoycing, for
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96830:89"/>
then that woe of our Saviours belongs to thee,
<hi>Luk. 6, 26. Wo unto you when men speak well
of you, for so did their Fathers to the false
Prophets,</hi> and there is not a greater sign of a
hardned heart, then when men can make
their sins the matter of their glory. In the
last place let thy <hi>prayers</hi> assist in the fight with
this corruption.</p>
                  <p>16. A <hi>second</hi> vertue is <hi>meekness,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Meekness.</note> That is a
calmness and quietness of spirit, contrary to
the rages, and impatiences of anger. This
vertue may be exercised either in respect of
God, or our neighbour. That towards God
I have already spoken of, under the head of
humility, and that towards our neighbour I
shall hereafter; All I have here to say of it, is,
how it becomes a duty to our selves; that it
does, in respect of the great <hi>advantage</hi> we
reap by it,<note place="margin">Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of it.</note> which, in meer kindness to our
selves, we are to look after. And to prove
that it brings us this great <hi>advantage,</hi> I need
say no more, but that this <hi>meekness</hi> is that to
which Christ hath pronounced a blessing, <hi>Mat.
5. 5. Blessed are the meek,</hi> and not onely in
the next world, but even in this too, <hi>they
shall inherit the earth;</hi> Indeed none but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>meek</hi> person hath the true enjoyment of any
thing in the world, for the angry, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
are like such people, who we use to say,
cannot enjoy the greatest prosperities; For let
things be never so fair without, they will raise
storms within their own breasts. And surely
whoever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ath either in himself, or others ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96830:89"/>
the greatest uneasiness of this passion
of anger, cannot chuse but think meekness a
a most pleasant thing.</p>
                  <p>17. Besides it is also a most honourable
thing, for it is that whereby we resemble
Christ, <hi>learn of me,</hi> saith he, <hi>for I am meek
and lowly in heart, Mat.</hi> 11. 28. It is also
that whereby we conquer our selves, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
our own unruly passions, which of all
<hi>victories</hi> is the greatest, and most noble. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is that which makes us behave our selves
like men, whereas anger gives us the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and wildness of savage beasts. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the one is by all esteemed, and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whereas the other is hated and abhorred,
every man shunning a man in rage as they
would a furious beast.</p>
                  <p>18. Farther, yet meekness is the sobriety of
the mind, whereas anger is the direct madness,
it puts a man wholly out of his own power,
and makes him do such things, as himself in
his sober temper abhors; how many men have
done those things in their rage, which they
have repented all their lives after? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
surely as much as a man is more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
then a beast, a sober man then a mad
man, so much hath this vertue of meekness
the advantage of honour above the contrary
vice of anger.</p>
                  <p>19. Again, meekness makes any condition
tollerable, and easie to be endured. He that
meekly bears any suffering, takes off the edg
of it, that it cannot wound him, whereas he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:96830:90"/>
that frets and rages at it; whets it, and makes
it much sharper then it would be; Nay in some
cases makes that so, which would not else be
so at all; as particularly in the case of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
words, which in themselves can do
us no harm, they neither hurt our bodies nor
lessen our estate, the only mischief they can
do us is to make us angry, and then our anger
may do us many more; whereas he that meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passes them by, is never the worse for them;
nay the better, for he shall be rewarded by
God for that patience. Much more might be
said to recommend this virtue to us, in respect
of our <hi>own present</hi> advantage, but I suppose
this may suffice to perswade men to esteem of
it. The harder matter will be to gain them
to the practice of it, wherein men pretend I
know not what difficulties of natural constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and the like; Yet sure there is no man of
so <hi>Cholerick</hi> a temper; but if he did heartily
set about it, would find it were not impossible
in some good measure to subdue it: But then
he must be diligent in using means to that end.
Divers of these means there are I shall menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some few.</p>
                  <p>20 As <hi>first.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Means of obtaining it.</note> The imprinting deep in our mind
the loveliness, and benefits of meekness, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the ugliness and mischiefs of anger.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> To set before us the examples of
<hi>Christ,</hi> who endured all reproaches, yea tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with perfect, patience that was <hi>lead as
a sheep to the slaughter, Isaiah</hi> 33. 7. That
<hi>when he was reviled, reviled not again; when
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:96830:90"/>
he suffered, threatned not, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 23. And
if he the <hi>Lord of glory</hi> suffered thus meekly
and unjustly from his own creatures, with
what force can we ever complain of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
done to us? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To be very watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

peevishness,</hi> and <hi>frowardness</hi> of mind,
which is a sin in it self, though it proceed no
farther, but will also be sure, if it be cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to break out into open effects of anger.
Therefore whenever thou findest the least
rising of it within thee, make as much haste to
<hi>check</hi> it as thou wouldst to quench a fire in
thy house, but be sure thou bring no fuell to
it, by entertaining any thoughts, that may
increase it. And at such a time especially,
keep a most strick watch over thy tongue, that
it break not out into any angry speeches, for
that breath will fan the fire; not only in thine
adversary, but thy self too; therefore though
thy heart be hot within stifle the flame, and
let it not break out, and the greater the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more earnestly lift up thy heart
to <hi>God,</hi> to assist thee to overcome it. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
Often remember, how great punishments
sins have deserved, and then whether thy suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
be from God or man, thou wilt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
them to be far short of what is due
to thee, and therefore wilt be ashamed to be
impatient at them.</p>
                  <p>21. The <hi>third</hi> vertue is <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>onsideration,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and
this in a most special manner we own to our
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96830:91"/>
souls. For without it, we shall, as rash, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advised
people use to do; rush them into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
perils. Now this <hi>consideration</hi> is either
of our <hi>state,</hi> or of our actions. By our <hi>state</hi>
I mean what our condition is to God-ward,<note place="margin">Of our state.</note>
whether it be such that we may reasonably
conclude our selves in his favour. This it
much concerns us to consider and examine, and
that not by those easie rules men are apt to
frame to themselves, as whether they believe
that Christ died for their sins; that they are of
the number of the elect; and shall certainly be
saved, if these and the like were all that were
required to put us into Gods favour, none
but some very melancholly person could ever
be out of it, for we are apt enough generally
to believe comfortably of our selves. But the
rules God hath given us in his word, are those
by which we must be tryed at the last day, and
therefore are certainly the only safe ones, by
which to trie our selves now.<note place="margin">The rule by which to trie our state.</note> And the summe
of those are, that whosoever continues in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>one wilful sin</hi> is not in his favour, nor can
if he so die, hope for any mercy at his
hand.</p>
                  <p>22. Now it is highly necessary, we should
consider what our condition is in this respect
For since our life is nothing but a puffe of
breath in our nostrils, which may for ought we
know be taken from us the next minuite, it
neerly concerns us, to know how we are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for another world, that so in case we
want at present that oile in our lamps, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96830:91"/>
we are to meet the Bride-groom, <hi>Mat.
25.</hi> 8. We may timely get it, and not for want
of it be ever shut out like the foolish virgins,
from his presence.<note place="margin">The danger of inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</note> The neglect of this <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi>
hath undon many soules, some by too
easie a belief that they were in a good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without considering and trying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by the foregoing rule, but presuming
either upon some slight outward performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or upon such a false faith, as I even now
described others by the wretched careless go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on, without so much as asking themselves,
what their condition is, but hope they shall
do as well as their neighbours, and so never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
farther; which wretched carelesness
will as certainly undoe the spiritual, as the like
would do the temporal estate; yet in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man is wise enough to foresee, that a man
that never takes any accounts of his estate to
see whether he be worth somthing or nothing,
will be sure to be a begger in the end. But in
this far weightier matter we can generally be
thus improvident.</p>
                  <p>23. The <hi>second</hi> thing we are to consider,<note place="margin">Our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> is
our <hi>actions,</hi> and those either before, or after
the doing of them. In the first place we are
to consider before we act,<note place="margin">Before we do them.</note> and not to do any
rashly or headily. But <hi>first</hi> to advise with
our consciences, whether this be lawful to
be done, for he that followes his own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and does every thing which that
moves him to, shall be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re to fall into a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of sins. Therefore consider soberly and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96830:92"/>
be assured of the lawfulness of the thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou venture to do it. This advisedness
is in all worldly things accounted so necessary
a part of wisdom, that no man is accounted
wise without it; A rash man we look upon
as the next degree to a fool: And yet it is
sure there is not so much need of looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
us in any thing, as in what concerns our
souls, and that not only in respect of the
great value of them above all things else, but
also in regard of the great danger they are
in, as hath been shewed more at large in the
beginning of the treatise.</p>
                  <p>24 <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to consider our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">After they are done.</note>
when they are past also, that is, we are
to examine whether they have been such, as
are allowable by the Laws of Christ, This is
very necessary, whether they be good or bad;
if they be good, the recalling them helpeth us
to the comfort of a <hi>good conscience,</hi> and that
comfort again incourageth us to go on in the
like; and besides it stirrs us up to thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to God, by whose grace alone we were
enabled to do them. But if they be bad,
then it is especially necessary, that we thus exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them, for without this it is impossible
we should ever come to amendment; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we observe them to have been amiss, we
can never think it needful to amend: But shall
still run on from one <hi>wickedness to another,</hi>
which is the greatest curse any man can lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>25. The oftner therefore we use this <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:96830:92"/>
the better;<note place="margin">Frequency of conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> for the less likely it is,
that any of our sins shall escape our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.
It is much to be wisht, that every man
should thus every night try the actions of the
day, that so if he have done any things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse,
he may soon check himself for it, and
settle his resolutions against it, and not let
it grow on to a habit and course. And that
he may also early beg Gods pardon, which
will the easier be had, the sooner it is asked,
every delay of that being a great increase of
the sin. And surely whoever means to take
account of himself at all, will find this the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest
course, it being much easier to do it so,
a little at a time, and while passages are fresh in
his memory, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n to take the account of a
long time together.<note place="margin">Danger of omitting it.</note> Now if it be considered,
that every wilful sin must have a particular re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pentance
before it can be pardoned, me thinks
men should tremble to sleep without that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
for what assurance hath any man
that lies down in his bed, that he shall ever
rise again; and then how dangerous is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of that man, that sleeps in an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
sin? The weighing of these several
motives may be a means by Gods blessing, to
bring us to the practice of this duty of <hi>conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
in all the parts of it.</p>

and this surely is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
we much own to our

is a well-pleasedness with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
whatever it is that God hath placed

a vertue this is, may appear by the contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it hath to several great and painful vices,
so that where this is rooted in the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it subdues not only some such single sin, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
cluster of them together.</p>
                  <p>2. And first it is contrary to all murmuring
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> general,<note place="margin">Contrary to murmuring.</note> which is a sin most hateful to God,
as may appear by his <hi>sharp punishments</hi> of it on
the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the wilderness, as you may
read in several places of the book of <hi>Exodus,</hi>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:96830:93"/>
and <hi>Numbers.</hi> And sure it is also very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and uneasie to a mans self, for if, as the
<hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, it be <hi>a joyful and pleasant thing
to be thankful,</hi> we may by the rule of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
conclude, it is a sad and unpleasant thing
to be <hi>murmuring;</hi> and I doubt not every
mans own experience will confirm the truth
of it.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is contrary to <hi>ambition,</hi> the
<hi>ambitions</hi> man is alwayes <hi>disliking</hi> his present
condition,<note place="margin">To ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and that makes him so greedily to
seek a higher, whereas he that is content with
his own, lies quiet out of the road of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.
Now <hi>ambition</hi> is not only a great sin
in it self, but it puts men upon many other;
There is nothing so horrid, which a man that
eagerly seeks greatness will stick at; lying, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
murder, or any thing will down with
him; if they seem to tend to his advancement.
And the uneasiness of it is answerable to the
sin. This none can doubt of, that considers
what a multitude of fears and jealousies, cares
and distractions there are that attend <hi>ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in its progresse, besides the great and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
ruines that usually befal it in the end. And
therefore sure <hi>contentedness</hi> is in this respect as
well a happines, as a vertue.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is contrary to <hi>covetousness;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To covet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note>
this the <hi>Apostle</hi> witnesseth. <hi>Heb. 13. 5. Let
your conversation be without</hi> covetousness, <hi>and
be content with such things as ye have,</hi> where
you see contentedness is set as the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>covetousness.</hi> But of this there needs
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96830:94"/>
no other proof, then common experience, for
we see the <hi>covetous</hi> man never thinks he hath
enough, and therefore can never be content,
for no man can be said to be so, that thirsts
after any thing he hath not. Now that you
may see how excellent, and necessary a virtue
this is, that secures us against <hi>covetousness,</hi> it
will not be amiss a little to consider the nature
of that sin.</p>
                  <p>5. That it is a very great crime, is most
certain, for it is contrary to the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all good life, I mean those three great
duties to God, to our selves, to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
<hi>First,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our duty to God.</note> It is so contrary to our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to God, that Christ himself tels us <hi>Luk.
16 13. We cannot serve God and Mammon;</hi>
he that sets his heart upon wealth, must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
take it off from God. And this we
daily see in the <hi>covetous</hi> mans practice, he is
so eager in the gaining of riches, that he hath
no time or care to perform duty to God, let
but a good bargain, or opportunity of gain
come in his way, <hi>prayer</hi> and all duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
must be neglected to attend it. Nay,
when the committing the greatest sin against
God may be likely either to get, or save him
ought, his love of wealth quickly perswades
him to commit it.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To our selves.</note> It is contrary to the duty we
owe <hi>our selves,</hi> and that both in respect of
our Souls, and bodies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The covetous man
despises his Soul, sels that to eternal destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for a little pelf; For so every man does,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96830:94"/>
that by any unlawful means seeks to enrich
himself; Nay though he do it not by unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means, yet if he have once set his heart
upon wealth, he is that covetous person, of
whom the Apostle hath pronounced, that <hi>he
shall not enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor.
6. 10. Nor doth he onely offend against his
Soul, but against his body too. For he often
denies that those necessary refreshments it
wants, and for which his wealth (as far as it
concerns himself) was given him. This is
so constantly the custome of rich Misers, that
I need not prove it to you.</p>

that in both the parts of it, Justice and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
he that loves money immoderately, will
not care whom he cheats, and defrauds, so he
may bring in gain to himself, and from hence
spring those many tricks of deceit and couse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
so common in the world. As for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that is never to be hoped for from a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
man, who dreads the lessening of his
own heaps more then the starving of his poor
Brother. You see how great a sin this is that
containes under it so many others; so that
we may well say of it, as the Apostle doth
1 <hi>Tim. 6. 10. The love of money is the root of
all evil.</hi> And it is not much less uneasy, then
wicked, for between the care of getting, and
the fear of loosing, the covetous man enjoyes
no quiet hour. Therefore every man is
deeply concerned, as the tenders his happiness,
either in this world, or the next, to guard
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96830:95"/>
himself against this sin, which he can no way
do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by possessing his heart with this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>contentedness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. In the <hi>fourth</hi> place, it is contrary to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to envy.</note>
for he that is content with his own
condition, hath no temptation to <hi>envy</hi>
anothers; How unchristian a sin this of
<hi>envy</hi> is, shall hereafter be shewed; At the
present, I need say no more, but that it is also
a very uneasy one, it frets and knawes the
very heart of him that harbours it. But the
worse this sin is, the more excellent still is this
grace of <hi>contentedness,</hi> which frees us from it.
I suppose I have said enough to make you
think this a very lovely, and desirable Virtue.
And sure it were not impossible to be gained
by any, that would but observe these few di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>First,</hi> To consider,<note place="margin">Helps to contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> that whatever our
estate and condition in any respect be, it is
that which is allotted us by God, and therefore
is certainly the best for us, he being much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to judge for us, then we for our selves;
and therefore to be displeased at it, is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to say, we are wiser then he. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
Consider thorowly the vanity of all worldly
things, how very little there is in them, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e
we have them, and how uncertain we are to
keep them, but above all, in how little stead
they will stand us at the day of death or
judgement, and then thou canst not think any
of them much worth the desiring, and so wilt
not be discontented for want of them.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> Suffer not thy fancy to run on things
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96830:95"/>
thou hast not: many have put themselves out
of love with what they have, onely by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what they want. He that sees his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
possess somewhat, which himself hath
not, is apt to think how happy he should be,
if he were in that mans condition, and in the
mean time never thinks of enjoying his own,
which yet perhaps in many respects may be
much happier, then that of his neighbours
which he so much admires. For we look but
upon the outside of other mens conditions,
and many a man that is envied by his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
as a wonderful happy person, hath yet
some secret trouble, which makes him think
much otherwise of himself. Therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
compare thy condition in any thing with
those thou countest more prosperous then thy
self, but rather do it with those, thou knowest
more unhappy, and then thou wilt find cause
to rejoice in thine own portion. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
Consider how far thou art from deserving any
good thing from God, and then thou canst
not but with <hi>Jacob Gen.</hi> 32. 10. confess, that
thou art <hi>not worthy of the least of those mercies</hi>
thou enjoyest, and in stead of murmuring
that they are no more, wilt see reason to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
and praise the bounty of God, that they
are so many. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Be often thinking of
the joyes laid up for thee in Heaven; look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that as thy home, on this world, only as
an <hi>Inne,</hi> where thou art fain to take up in thy
passage; and then as a traveller expects not
the same conveniences at an <hi>Inne,</hi> that he hath
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:96830:96"/>
at home, so thou hast reason to be content
with whatever entertainment thou findst here,
knowing thou art upon thy journey to a place
of <hi>infinite happiness,</hi> which will make an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
amends for al the uneasiness, and hardship
thou canst suffer in the way. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Pray to
God, from whom all good things do come,
that he will to all his other blessings, add this
of a contented mind, without which thou
canst have no taste or relish of any other.</p>
                  <p>10. A <hi>fifth</hi> duty is <hi>diligence:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Diligence.</note> This is made
up of two parts, <hi>watchfulness,</hi> and <hi>industry,</hi>
and both these we owe to our Souls</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>First, Watchfulness,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin.</note> in observing all
the dangers that threaten them. Now since
nothing can endanger our Souls, but sin, this
<hi>watchfulness</hi> is principally to be imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that: And as in a besieged City,
where there is any weak part, there it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to keep the strongest guard; so it is
here, wherever thou findest thy inclinations
such, as are most likely to betray thee to sin,
there it concerns thee to be especially <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi>
Observe therefore carefully to what sins
either thy natural temper, thy company, or
thy course of life do particularly incline thee,
and <hi>watch</hi> thy self very narrowly in those;
Yet do not so lay out all thy care on those, as
to leave thy self<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>open to any other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that
may give <hi>Satan</hi> as much advantage on the
other side; but let thy <hi>watch</hi> be general, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all sin, though in a special manner
against those, which are like oftnest to assault
thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:96830:96"/>
12. The <hi>second</hi> part of <hi>diligence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Industry in improving gifts.</note> is <hi>indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi>
or <hi>labour,</hi> and this also we owe to our
Souls, for without it they will as little prosper
as that vineyard of the sluggard, which <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
describes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 30. For there is a
husbandry of the Soul, as well as of the estate,
and the end of the one, as of the other, is the
creasing, and <hi>improving</hi> of its riches. Now
the riches of the Soul are either natural, or
Divine. By the natural I mean its faculties
of reason, wit, memory, and the like; by the
Divine I mean the graces of God, which are
not the Souls natural portion, but are given
immediatly by God, and both these we are to
take care to improve, they being both talents
intrusted to us for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>13. The way of improving the <hi>natural</hi> is
by imploying them so,<note place="margin">Of Nature.</note> as may bring in most
honour to God: we must not let them lye
idle by us, through sloth, neither must we
overwhelme them with intemperance, and
brutish pleasures, which is the case of too
many, but we must employ them, and set
them on work. But then we must be sure it be
not in the Devils service, like many, who set
their wit onely to the profaning of God, or
cheating their neighbours, and stuff their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
with such filthiness, as should never
once enter their thoughts; our use of them
must be such, as may bring in most glory to
God, most benefit to our neighbours, and
may best fit us to make our accounts, when
God shall come to reckon with us for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:96830:97"/>
14. But the other part of the <hi>Souls riches,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of Grace.</note>
is yet more precious, that is <hi>grace,</hi> and of this
we must be especially careful, to husband, and
improve it. This is a duty expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us by the Apostle, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 18. Grow
in grace.</hi> And again, in the first chapter of
that <hi>Epistle,</hi> verse 5. <hi>Give all diligence to add
to your Faith vertue, and to vertue knowledg,</hi>
&amp;c. Now the especial means of improving
<hi>grace</hi> is by imploying it, that is, by doing
those things for the enabling of us whereunto
it was given us; This is a sure means, not only
in respect of that easiness, which a custome of
any thing brings in the doing of it, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,
as it hath the promise of God, who
hath promised, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 29. That <hi>to him
that hath</hi> (that is hath made use of what he
hath) <hi>shall be given, and he shall have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</hi>
He that diligently, and faithfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes
the first beginnings of <hi>grace,</hi> shall yet
have more, and he that in like manner hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
that more, shall yet have a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
so that what <hi>Solomon</hi> saith of temporal
riches, is also true of spiritual, <hi>The hand of
the diligent maketh rich.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. Therefore whenever thou findest any
good motion in thy heart,<note place="margin">To im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove good motions.</note> remember that is a
season for this spiritual husbandry, If thou
have but a check of conscience against any sin,
thou livest in, drive that on till it come to a
hatred, and then that hatred, till it come to
resolution, then from that resolution, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to some endeavours against it. Do this
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96830:97"/>
faithfully, and sincerely, and thou shalt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
find the grace of God assisting thee, not
onely in every of these steps, but also enable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thee to advance still higher, till thou come
to some victory over it. Yet to this industry
thou must not fail to add thy prayers also,
there being a promise, that God wil <hi>give the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit to them that ask it, Mat.</hi> 7. 11. And
therefore they that ask it not, have no reason
to expect it. But it must be asked with such
an earnestness, as is some way answerable to
the value of the thing, which being infinitely
more precious then all the world, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of his own worth, and its usefulness to
us, we must beg it with much more zeal and
earnestness then all temporal blessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gs, or
else we shew our selves despisers of it.</p>
                  <p>16. Having directed you to the means of
<hi>improving grace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The dang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> of the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary.</note> I shall, to quicken you to it,
mention the great <hi>danger</hi> of the <hi>contrary;</hi>
And that is not as in other things, the loosing
onely those further degrees, which our indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
might have helped us to, but it is the
loosing even of what we already have, <hi>For
from him that hath not</hi> (that is again hath not
made use of what he hath) <hi>shall be taken away
even that which he hath, Mat.</hi> 25. 29. God
will withdraw the grace, which he sees so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected,
as we see in that parable, the talent
<hi>was taken from him that</hi> had onely <hi>hid it in a
Napkin,</hi> and had brought in no gain to
his <hi>lord.</hi> And this is a most sad punishment,
the greatest that can befal any man, before he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:96830:98"/>
comes to hell, indeed it is some kind of foretast
of it, it is the delivering him up to the
power of the Devil, and it is the banishing
him from the face of God, which are not the
least parts of the misery of the damned. And
it is also the binding a man over to that fuller
portion of wretchedness in another world;
For that is the last doom of the <hi>unprofitable
servant, Mat. 25. 30. Cast ye the unprofitable
servant into outer darkness, there shall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and gnashing of teeth.</hi> You see they are no
light <hi>dangers</hi> that attend this neglect of
grace, and therefore if we have any love, nay
any common pity to our Souls, we must set
our selves to this industry. I have now done
with those vertues, which respect our Souls.
I come now to those which concern our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>17. The first of which is <hi>chastity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chastity.</note> or <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
which may well be set in the front of the
duties we owe to our bodies, since the Apostle
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. sets the contrary as the especial sin
against them, <hi>He that committeth fornication
sinneth against his own body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18 Now this vertue of <hi>chastity</hi> consists in
a perfect abstaining from all kinds of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
not onely that of adultery, and forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
but all other more unnatural sorts of
it, committed either upon our selves, or with
any other. In a word, all acts of that kind
are utterly against chastity, save onely in
<hi>lawful marriage.</hi> And even there men are
not to think themselves let loose to please
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96830:98"/>
their brutish appetites, but are to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
within such rules of moderation, as
ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ee to the end of marriage, which being
these two, the begetting of children, and the
avoiding of fornication, nothing must be done,
which may hinder the first of these ends; and
the second aiming onely at the subduing of
lust, the keeping men from any sinful effects
of it, it is very contrary to that end, to make
marriage an occasion of heightning, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming
it.</p>
                  <p>19. But this vertue of <hi>chastity</hi> reacheth not
only to the restraining of the grosser act,<note place="margin">Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the very lowest degrees.</note> but to
all lower degrees; it sets a guard upon our eyes,
according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 5. 28.
He that looketh on a woman to lust after her,
hath committed adultery with her already in
his heart;</hi> and upon our <hi>hand</hi> as appears by
what Christ adds in that place, <hi>If thy hand
offend thee, cut it off;</hi> so also upon our <hi>tongues,</hi>
that they speak no immodest or filthy words,
<hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of
your mouth. Eph.</hi> 4. 29 Nay upon our
very thoughts, and fancies, we must not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
any foul or filthy desires, nor so m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch
as the imagination of any such thing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he that forbears the grosser act, and yet
allowes himself in any of these, it is to be
suspected that it is rather some outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
that keeps him from it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of the sin. For if it were that, it
would keep him from these too, these being
sins also, and very great ones in Gods sight.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96830:99"/>
Besides, he that lets himself loose to these
puts himself in very great danger of the
other, it being much more easy to abstain
from all, then to secure against the one,
when the other is allowed. But above all,
it is to be considered, that even these lower
degrees are such, as make men very odious in
Gods eyes who seeth the heart, and loves
none that are not pure there.</p>
                  <p>20. The loveliness of this vertue of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
needs no other way of describing,<note place="margin">The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of it.</note> then
by considering the loathsomness, and <hi>mischiefs</hi>
of the contrary sin; which is first very brutish;
those desires are but the same, that the beasts
have, and then how far are they sunk below
the nature of man, that can boast of their
sins of that kind, as of their special excellency?
When if that be the measure, a <hi>goat</hi> is the
more excellent creature.<note place="margin">To the Soul.</note> But indeed they that
eagerly pursue this part of bestiality do often
leave themselves little, besides their humane
shape, to difference them from beasts; this
sin so clouds the understanding, and defaceth
the reasonable Soul. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi>
very well describes the young man, that was
going to the harlots house, <hi>Pro. 7. 22. He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
after her, as an Ox goeth to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>21 Nor <hi>secondly</hi> are the effects of it better
to the <hi>body</hi> then to the mind.<note place="margin">To the Body.</note> The many foul

how mischievous it is to the <hi>body.</hi> And alas,
how many are there that have thus made
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96830:99"/>
themselves the Devils martyrs? Suffered such
torments in the pursuit of this sin, as would
exceed the invention of the greatest tyrant?
Surely they that pay thus dear for damnation,
very well deserve to enjoy the purchase.</p>
                  <p>22. But <hi>thirdly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</note> Besides the natural fruits
of this sin, it is attended with very great and
heavy Judgments from God; the most extra
ordinary and miraculous Judgment that ever
befel any place, <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimstone from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
upon <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> was for this
sin of <hi>uncleanness.</hi> And many examples like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of Gods vengeance may be observed on
particular persons, for this sin. The incest
of <hi>Amnon</hi> cost him his life, as you may read,
2 <hi>Sam. 13. Zimrie</hi> and <hi>Cozhi</hi> were slain in
the very act, <hi>Num.</hi> 25. 8. And no person
that commits the like, hath any assurance it
shall not be his own case. For how secretly
soever it be committed, it cannot be hid from
God, who is the sure avenger of all such wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.
Nay, God hath very particularly
threatned this sin, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 17. If any man
defile the Temple of God, him shall God destroy.</hi>
This sin of <hi>uncleanness</hi> is a kind of <hi>sacriledge,</hi>
a polluting those bodies, which God hath
chosen for his <hi>Temples,</hi> and therefore no
wonder, if it be thus heavily punished.</p>
                  <p>23. <hi>Lastly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">It shuts out from Heaven.</note> This sin shuts us out from the
Kingdom of Heaven, wherein no impure
thing can enter. And we never find any list
of those sins, which bar men thence, but this
of <hi>uncleanness</hi> hath a special place in it. Thus
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96830:100"/>
it is <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19. and so again 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. If
we will thus pollute our selves, we are fit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
onely for those black spirits, the Devil
and his Angels, and therefore with them we
must expect our portion, where our flames of
<hi>lust</hi> shall end in flames of <hi>fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. All this layed together,<note place="margin">Helps to chastity.</note> may surely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the vertue of <hi>chastity</hi> to us, for the
preserving of which, we must be very careful;
<hi>first,</hi> to check the beginnings of the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to cast away the very first fancy of lust,
with indignation, for if you once fall to parley,
&amp; talk with it, it gains still more upon you, and
then it will be harder to resist, therefore your
way in this temptation is, to flye rather then
fight with it. This is very necessary, not
onely that we may avoid the danger of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
to act the sin, but also in respect of
the present fault of entertaining such fancies,
which of it self, though it should never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
further is, as hath been shewed, a great
abomination before God; <hi>Secondly,</hi> have a
special care to flye idleness, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
soil for these filthy weeds to grow in; And
keep thy self alwayes busied in some innocent,
or vertuous employment, for then these fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
will be less apt to offer themselves.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> never suffer thy self to recall any
unclean passages of thy former life with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
for that is to act over the sin again;
and will be so reckoned by God, nay perhaps
thus deliberately to think of it, may be a
greater guilt, then a rash acting of it. For
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96830:100"/>
this both shews thy heart to be set upon fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness,
and is also a preparation to more
acts of it. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> forbear the company
of such light, and wanton persons, as either
by the filthiness of their discourse, or any
other means, may be a snare to thee. <hi>Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
pray earnestly that God would give thee
the spirit of <hi>purity,</hi> especially at the time of
any present temptation. Bring the unclean

in the Gospel; And if it will not be cast out
with <hi>prayer</hi> alone, add <hi>fasting</hi> to it, but be
sure thou do not keep up the flame by any
high or immoderate feeding. The last remedy,
when the former prove vain, is marriage,
which becomes a duty to him, that cannot live
innocently without it. But even here there
must be care taken, lest this which should be for
his good, become not to him an occasion of
falling, for want of sobriety in the use of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
But this I have toucht on already, and
therefore need add no more, but an earnest
intreaty, that men would consider seriously of
the foulness, and danger of this sin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,
and not let the commonness of it
lessen their hatred of it, but rather make
them abhor that shamelesse impudence of the

25. The <hi>second</hi> vertue,<note place="margin">Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> that concerns our

are divers; As first <hi>temperance</hi> in <hi>eating,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly

in <hi>recreation,</hi> fifthly in <hi>apparel.</hi> I shall speak
of them severally; and <hi>first</hi> of <hi>temperance</hi> in
<hi>eating.</hi> This <hi>temperance</hi> is observed,<note place="margin">In Eating.</note> when
our eating is agreeable to those <hi>ends,</hi> to which
eating are by God and nature designed; those
are <hi>first</hi> the being,<note place="margin">Ends of eating.</note> 
                     <hi>secondly</hi> the well being of
our bodies</p>
                  <p>26. Man is of such a frame,<note place="margin">Preserving of life.</note> that <hi>eating</hi>
becomes necessary to him for the preserving
his life, hunger being a natural disease which
will prove deadly, if not prevented, and
the onely Physick for it is <hi>eating</hi> which is
therefore become a necessary means of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us alive. And that is the first end of eating;
and as men use not to take Physick for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but remedy, so neither should they
eat.</p>
                  <p>27. But <hi>secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of Health.</note> God hath been so boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
as to provide not onely for the being,
but the <hi>well being</hi> of our bodies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are not tyed to such strictness, that
we may eat no more then will just keep us
from starving, but we may also eat whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
either for kind or quantity most tends to
the <hi>health,</hi> and welfare of them; Now that
eating which is agreeable to these ends, is
within the bounds of <hi>temperance,</hi> as on the
contrary whatsoever is contrary to them, is a
transgression against it; He therefore that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96830:101"/>
sets up to himself other ends of eating, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the pleasing of his taste, or (what is yet
worse) the pampering of his body, that he may
the better serve his lust, he directly thwarts
and crosses these ends of Gods; for he that
hath those aimes, doth that which is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to health, yea and to life it self; as appears
by the many diseases, and untimely deaths,
which surfetting and uncleanness daily bring
on men.</p>
                  <p>28. He therefore that will practice this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>temperance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ru'es of Temperance in eating.</note> must neither eat so much,

can have other) as may be hurtful to his health:
what the sorts or quantities shall be, is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to set down, for that differs according to
the several constitutions of men; some men
may with temperance eat a great deal, because
their stomacks require it, when another may
be guilty of intemperance in <hi>eating</hi> but half
so much, because it is more then is useful to
him. And so also for the sort of meat, it
may be niceness and luxury for some to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in them, when yet some degree of it
may be necessary to the infirmities of a weak
stomack, which not out of wantonness, but
disease cannot eate the courser meats But I
think it may in general be said, that to health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
bodies the plainest meats are generally
the most wholsome, but every man must in
this be left to judg for himself; and that he
may do it aright, he must be careful, that he

                  <p>29. To secure him the better,<note place="margin">Means of it.</note> let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
<hi>First,</hi> How unreasonable a thing it is,
that the whole body should be subjected to
this one sense of tasting, that it must run all
hazards only to please that. But it is yet much
more so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the diviner part, the soul should
also be thus enslaved; and yet thus it is in an
intemperate person, his very soul must be
sacrificed to this brutish appetite, for the sin
of intemperance, though it be acted by the
body, yet the soul must share in the eternal
punishment of it, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
short and vanishing this pleasure is, it
is gone in a moment, but the pains that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the excess of it, are much more durable,
and then surely it agrees not with that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reason, wherewith as men we are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to set our hearts upon it. But then in the
<hi>third</hi> place it agrees yet worse with the
temper of a Christian, who should have his
heart so purified, and refined with the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of those higher and spiritual joyes
he looks for in another world, that he should
very much despise these gross and <hi>brutish plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi>
which beasts are as capable of, as we,
and to them we may well be content to leave
them, it being the highest their natures can
reach to; but for us, who have so much more
<hi>excellent hopes,</hi> it is an intolerable shame,
that we should account them as any part of
our happiness. <hi>Lastly,</hi> the sin of Gluttony
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96830:102"/>
is so great and <hi>dangerous,</hi> that Christ thought

And you know what was the end of the <hi>rich

and <hi>drinking</hi> being much
the same, I can give no other
direct rules in this, then what were given in
the former, to wit, that we drink neither of
such sorts of liquor, nor in such quantities as
may not agree with the <hi>right ends of drinking,</hi>
the preserving of our lives and healths: Only
in this there will be need of putting in <hi>one cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
for our understandings being in more
danger to be hurt by drink then meat, we must
take care to keep that safe, and rather not
<hi>drink</hi> what we might safely in respect of our
healths, if it be in danger to distemper our
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96830:103"/>
reason. This I say because it is possible some
mens brains may be so weak, that their heads
cannot bear that ordinary quantity of <hi>drink</hi>
which would do the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whoever is of this temper must strictly absta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n
from that degree of <hi>drink</hi> or that sort of it,
which he finds hath that effect, yea though it
do in other respects appear not only safe, but
useful to his health. For though we are to
preserve our healths, yet we are not to do it
by a sin, as drunkenness most certainly is.</p>
                  <p>2. But alas, of those multitudes of <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards</hi>
we have in the world,<note place="margin">False ends of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> this is the case
but of very few, most of them going farr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
what their health requires, yea or can
bear even to the utter destruction thereof. And
therefore it is plain men have set up to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
some <hi>other ends of drinking,</hi> then those
allowable ones forementioned, it may not be
amisse a little to examine what they are, and
withal to shew the unreasonableness of them.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>first,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship.</note> and most owned is that, which
they call <hi>good fellowship:</hi> One man drinks to
keep another company at it. But I would ask
such a one whether if that man were <hi>drinking</hi>
rank poison, he would pledg him for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?
If he say he would not, I must tell him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that by the very same, nay, far <hi>greater reason,</hi>
he is not to do this. For <hi>immoderate drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
is that very poison, perhaps it doth not
always work death immediately (yet there
want not many instances of its having done
even that, very many having died in their <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:96830:103"/>
fit) but that the custome of it does usually
bring men to their ends, is past doubt, and
therefore though the poison work slowly, yet
it is still poison. But however it doth at the
present work that which a wise man would
more abhor then death; it works madness, and
frenzy turns the man into a beast, by drowning
that reason which should difference him from
one. Certainly the effects of drink are such,
that had being drunk been <hi>first</hi> enjoyned, as a
punishment, we should have thought him a
more then ordinary Tyrant, that had invented
it.</p>
                  <p>4. A <hi>second</hi> end of drinking is said to be
the maintaining of friendship and <hi>kindness</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men.<note place="margin">Preserving of kindness</note> But this is strangely unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
that men should do that towards the
maintaining of friendship, which is really the
greatest mischief that can be done to any man.
Did ever any think to befriend a man by help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to destroy his estate, his credit, his life?
Yet he that thus drinks with a man does this,
and much more, he ruines his reason, yea his
soul; and yet this must be called the way of
preserving of friendship; this is so ridiculous
that one would think none could own it, but
when he were actually drunk. But besides,
Alas, experience shews us, that this is fitter
to beget quarrels then preserve kindness, as the
many <hi>drunken brawles</hi> we every day see, with
the wounds, and sometimes <hi>murders,</hi> that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
them, do witness.</p>
                  <p>5. A <hi>third</hi> end is said to be the <hi>cheering of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cheering the spirits.</note>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:96830:104"/>
                     <hi>their spirits,</hi> making them merry and jolly. But
sure if the mirth be such that reason must be
turned out of doors before it begin, it wil be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little worth; one may say with <hi>Solomon, Ecc.
2. 2. The laughter of such fools is madness.</hi> And
sure they that will be drunk to put themselves
in this temper, must by the same reason be glad
of a frenzy, if they could but be sure it would
be of the merry sort. But little do these merry
folks think what sadness they are all this while
heaping up to them selves, often in this world,
when by some <hi>mad pranks,</hi> they play in their
jollity, they bring mischief upon themselves,
but however certainly in another, where this
mirth will be most sadly reckoned for.</p>
                  <p>6. A <hi>fourth</hi> end is said to be the <hi>putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of cares;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way cares.</note> but I shall ask what those <hi>cares</hi>
are? be they such as should be put away?
perhaps they are some checks and remorses of
conscience, which must be thus charmed. And I
doubt this hath proved too effectual with many
to the laying them asleep: But this is the
wickedst folly in the world; for if thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not these checks to have somthing conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in them, why do they trouble thee But
if thou do, it is impossible thou canst hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
this can long secure thee from them. Thou
maist thus stop their mouths for a wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le,
but they will one day cry the louder for it.
Suppose a thief or a murderer knew he were
pursued to be brought to justice, would he
think you to put away the fear of being hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
fall to drinking, and in the mean time take
no care for his escape, or would you not think
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96830:104"/>
him desperately mad if he did? Yet this is the
very case here, thy conscience tells thee of
thy danger, that thou must ere long be
brought before <hi>Gods judgment-seat;</hi> and is
it not madness for thee, in stead of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to get thy pardon, to drink away the
thought of thy danger. But in the <hi>second</hi>
place, suppose these cares be some worldly
ones, and such as are fit to be put away; then
for shame do not so disgrace thy reason, thy
Christianity, as not to let them be as forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to that end, as a little drink. Thy reason
wil tell thee it is in vain to care, where care wil
bring no advantage; and thy Christianity
will direct thee to one, on whom thou must
<hi>safely cast all thy cares, for he careth for thee,
1 Pet.</hi> 5. 7. And therefore unless thou mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to renounce being both a man and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
never betake thee to this pitiful shift,
to rid thee of thy cares. But besides, this
will not do the deed neither; for though it
may at present, whilst thou art in the height
of the drunken fit, keep thee from the sense
of thy cares, yet when that is over, they will
return again with greater violence, and if thou
have any conscience, bring a <hi>new care</hi> with
them, even that which ariseth from the guilt
of so foul a sin.</p>
                  <p>7. A <hi>fifth</hi> end is said to be the <hi>passing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of time.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Passing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way time.</note> This though it be as unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ployment</hi> is preferred before it. But
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96830:105"/>
this is in many a very false plea. For they
often spend time at the pot, not only when
they have nothing else to do, but even to the
neglect of their most necessary business. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is in all a most unreasonable one, for
there is no man, but he may find somewhat, or
other to imploy himself in. If he have little
worldly business of his own, he may yet do
somewhat to the benefit of others; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
there is no man but hath a soul, and if
he will look carefully to that, he need not
complain for want of business; where there
are so many corruptions to mortifie so many
inclinations to watch over, so many tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(whereof this of drunkenness is not the
least) to resist the graces of God, to improve
and stir up, and former neglects of all these
to lament, sure there can never want sufficient
imployment; for all these require time, and
so men at their deaths find; for then those
that have all their lives made it their business
to drive away their t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me, would then give all
the world to redeem it. And sure where there
is much leisure from <hi>worldly affairs,</hi> God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
to have the more time thus imployed
in spiritual exercises. But it is not likely
those meaner sort of persons, to whom this
book is intended, will be of the number of
those that have much leisure; and therefore I
shall no farther insist on it; only I shal say this,
that what degree of leisure they at any time
have, it concerns them to imploy to the benefit
of their souls, and not to bestow it to the ruine
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96830:105"/>
of them, as they do, who spend it in drinking.</p>
                  <p>8. A <hi>sixth</hi> end is said to be the <hi>preventing</hi>
of that <hi>reproach,</hi> which is by the world cast
on those that will in this be stricter then their
neighbours;<note place="margin">Preventing reproach.</note> but in answer to this, I shall <hi>first</hi>
ask, what is the harm of such reproach? sure
it cannot equal the least of those mischiefs,
drunkenness betrayes us to. Nay, if we will
take our Saviours word, it is a happiness,
<hi>Blessed,</hi> saith he, <hi>are yee when men shall revile
you, &amp; say all manner of evil against you for my
sake, Mat.</hi> 5. 11. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Pet.
4 14. If ye be reproached for the name of Christ,
happy are ye,</hi> and sure to be <hi>reproached for obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
to any command of Christs, is to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
for his name. Secondly,</hi> Let it be
remembred, that at our <hi>Baptism</hi> we solemnly
<hi>renounced the world;</hi> and shall we now so farr
consider it, as for a few scoffs of it to run
our selves on all the temporal evils before
mentioned, and which is much worse, the
wrath of God and eternal destruction? But
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> if you fear reproach, why do you do
that, which will bring reproach upon you
from all wise and good men; whose opinion
alone is to be regarded? And it is certain,
drinking is the way to bring it on you from
all such. And to comfort thy self against
that, by thinking thou art still applauded by
the foolish and worst sort of men, is as if all
the <hi>mad men</hi> in the world should agree to
count themselves the only sober persons, and
all others mad, which yet sure will never make
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96830:106"/>
them the less mad, nor others the lesse sober.
<hi>Lastly,</hi> consider the heavy doome Christ hath
pronounc'd on those that are ashamed of him,
and so are all those that for fear of reproach
shall shrink from their obedience to him, <hi>Mat.
8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 38. Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and
of my words in this adulterous and sinful gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
of him shall the Son of man be ashamed
when he cometh in the glory of the father with
the holy Angels.</hi> There is none but will at that
day desire to be owned by Christ: But whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
will not here own him; that is, cleave fast
to his commands, notwithstanding all the
scornes, nay, persecutions of the world, shall
then certainly be cast off by him. And he that
will adventure thus to maintain his credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
a company of fools and madmen, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
well to have it befal him: But after all
this is it not sure that even these will despise
thee for thy sob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iety, it is possible they may
seem to do so, to fright thee out of it; but
if their hearts were searched, it would be
found, they do even against their wills, bear a
<hi>secret reverence</hi> to sober persons, and none
fall more often under their scorn, and despising
then those that <hi>run with them to the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of riot,</hi> for even he that sticks not to be
drunk himself, will yet laugh at another that
he sees so.</p>
                  <p>9 There is a <hi>seventh</hi> end,<note place="margin">Pleasure of the drink.</note> which though
every man think too base to own, yet it is

is the bare <hi>pleasure</hi> of the <hi>drink;</hi> but to these

I confesse it will not be fit to say much, for
he that is come to this lamentable degree of
sottishness, is not like to receive benefit by
any thing can be said. Yet let me tell even
this man, that he of all others hath the most
means of discerning his fault, for this being
such a ground of drinking as no body wil own,
he is condemned of himself, yea, and all his
<hi>fellow drunkards</hi> too, for their denying it is
a plain sign, they acknowledg it a most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
thing. And if <hi>Esau</hi> were called a

                     </hi> and that too,
when he had the necessity of hunger upon
him, what name of reproach can be bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for him, who sells his health, his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
his God, his soul for a <hi>cup of drink,</hi> &amp; that
when he is so far from needing it, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he hath already more then he can keep?
I shall say no more to this sort of persons, but
let me warne all those that go on in the sin,
on any of the former grounds, that a little time
will bring them even to this, which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to loath, it being daily seen, that those
which <hi>first</hi> were drawn into the sin for the
love of the company, at last continue in it for
love of the drink.</p>
                  <p>10 I can think but of one end more:<note place="margin">Bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> That
is, that of <hi>bargaining.</hi> Men say it is necessary
for them to drink, in this one respect, of
trading with their neighbours, bargains being
most conveniently to be struck up at such
meetings. But this is yet a worse end, then
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:96830:107"/>
all the rest, for the bottome of it is an aime of
cheating &amp; defrauding others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We think when
men are in drink, we shall the better be able to
over-reach them: And so this adds the sin
of cousenage and defrauding to that of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness.
Now that this is indeed the intent, is
manifest, for if it were onely the dispatch of
<hi>bargains</hi> were aimed at, we should choose to
take men with their w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s about them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the taking them, when drink hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered
them, can be for nothing, but to
make advantage of them. Yet this often
proves a great folly, as well as a sin; for he
that drinks with another in hope to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach
him, doth many times prove the weaker
brain'd, &amp; becomes drunk first, &amp; then he gives
the other that opportunity of cheating him,
which he designed for the cheating of the
other. Now this end of drinking is so far
from becoming an excuse, that it is a huge
heightning of the sin; For if we may not
drink intemperately upon any occasion, much
less upon so wicked a one, as is the cousening
and defrauding of our brethren.</p>
                  <p>11. I suppose I have now shewed you the
unreasonableness of those motives,<note place="margin">Degrees of this sin.</note> which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e
ordinarily brought in excuse of this sin.
I am yet further to tell you, that it is not only
that huge degree of drunkenness, which makes
men able neither to go nor speak, which is to
be lookt on as a sin, but all lower degrees, which
do at all work upon the understanding, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by dulling it, and making it less fit for
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:96830:107"/>
any imployment, or by making it too light
and airy, apt to apish, and ridiculous mirth,
or, what is worse, by inflaming men into rage
and fury. These, or whatever else make any
change in the man, are to be reckoned into
this sin of drunkenness; Nay further, the
drinking beyond the natural ends of drinking;
that is, beyond moderate refreshment,
is a sin, though by the strength of a mans
brain it makes not least change in him, and
therefore those that are not actually drunk,
yet can spend whole dayes, or any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part of them, in drinking, are so far from
being innocent, that that greater woe belongs
to them, which is pronounced <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 22.
against those that <hi>are mighty to drink.</hi> For
though such a man may make a shift to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his wits, yet that wit serves him to very
little purpose, when his imployment is still
but the same with him, that is the most sottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drunk; that is, to powre down drink.</p>
                  <p>12. Nay,<note place="margin">The great guilt of the strong drinkers.</note> this man is <hi>guilty</hi> of the greater
waste; <hi>First,</hi> of the good creatures of God;
That <hi>drink,</hi> which is by Gods providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for the refreshing and relieving of us,
is abused and mispent, when it is drunk beyond
that measure, which those ends require, and
sure there is not the meanest of these creatures
we enjoy, but the abuse of them shall one
day be accounted for, and he that drinks
longest, hath the most of that <hi>gnilt.</hi> But in the
<hi>second</hi> place, this is a waste of that which is
much more precious, our time, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:96830:108"/>
us by God to <hi>work out our Salvation</hi>
in, and must be strictly reckoned for, and
therefore ought every minute of it to be most
thriftily husbanded to that end in actions of
good life, but when it is thus laid out, it tends
to the direct contrary, even the working out
our damnation. Besides, he that thus drinks,
though he escape being drunk himself, he is
yet guilty of all the drunkenness, that any of
his company fall under, for he gives them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragemennt
to drink on by his example,
especially if he be one of any authority, but
if he be one whose company the rest are fond
of, his drinking is then a certain ensnaring
of them, for then they will drink too, rather
then lose him. There is yet a greater fault,
that many of these stronger brained drinkers
are guilty of; That is, the setting themselves
purposely to make others drunk, playing, as it
were, a prize at it, and counting it matter of
triumph, and victory to see others fall before
them; This is a most horrible wickedness, it
is the making our selves the <hi>Devils factors,</hi>
endeavouring all we can to draw our poor
brethren into eternal misery, by betraying
them to so grievous a sin; and therefore it
may well be reckoned as the highest step of
this vice of drinking, as having in it the sin of
mischieving others, added to the excess in our
selves. And though it be lookt upon in the
world as a matter onely of jest and merriment
to make others drunk, that we may sport
our selves with their ridiculons behaviour, yet
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:96830:108"/>
that mirth will have a sad conclusion, there
being a woe expresly threatned by God to
this very sin. <hi>Hab. 2 15. Woe unto him that

because it is a sin so strangely reigning

any pleasure in this sin, which can be any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable

brings with it; I am confident no man in his

be ashamed to be any longer that fool, which

For there is no man that hath tryed both

off the custome,<note place="margin">The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of doing so considered.</note> and that arises partly

nothing bnt a little patience to overcome. Do
but refrain some few daies, and it will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
grow easy; for the hardness arising
onely from custome, the breaking of that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:96830:109"/>
does the business. If thou say, it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy
to do so, consider whether thou hadst

forbear, then dye; If thou wouldst not,
thou art so brutish a sot, that it is in vain to
perswade thee; but if thou hadst, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how unreasonable it is for thee not to do
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it in this case also; the habit of drinking may
well pass for a mortal disease, it proves so
very often to the body, but will most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to the Soul, and therefore it is madness
to stick at that uneasiness in the cure of this,
which thou wouldst submit to in a less danger.
Set therefore but a resolute purpose to endure
that little trouble for a small time, and this
first difficulty is conquered, for after thou hast
a while refrained, it will be perfectly easy to
do so still.</p>
                  <p>16 The <hi>second</hi> difficulty is that of spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the time,<note place="margin">Want of imployment</note> which those that have made

how to dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ose of. But the very naming of
this difficulty directs to the cure, get thee
some business, somewhat to imploy thy self
in, which, as I have already shewed, will be
easily found by all sorts of persons, but those
meaner to whom I now write, can sure never
want it ready at hand; they being generally
such as are to be maintained by their labour,
and therefore to them I need only give this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
to be diligent in that business they have,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96830:110"/>
to follow that close as they ought; and they
will have little occasion to seek out this way
of spending their time.</p>
                  <p>17. There is another sort of difficulty,<note place="margin">Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of men.</note>
which I told you arises from others, and that
is either from their perswasions, or reproaches.

of thine own conscience at the present,
and that eternal confusion of face that shall
befal all those, that go on in this sin, at the
last day; Weigh all these, I say, I need not
say, in the balance of the Sanctuary, but even in
the scales of common reason, and sure thou
wilt be forced to pronounce, that the motives
to temperance infinitely out-weigh those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; When thou hast thus advisedly
judged, then fix thy resolution accordingly,
and when ever any of these temptations come
to stagger thee, remember thou hast formerly
weighed them, knowest the just value of
them, and that they are a most unworthy
price for those precious advantages thou must
give in exchange for them. And therefore hold
fast thy resolution, and with indignation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
all motions to the contrary.</p>

to hope that either this is no sin, or at most
but a frailty, such as will not bar thee out of
Heaven; But deceive not thy self, for thou
mayest as well say there is no Heaven, as that
drunkenness shall not keep thee thence; I am
sure the same word of God which tels us there
is such a place of happiness, tels us also that
drunkards are of the number of those, that
shall not inherit it. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. and again,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 21. Drunkenness is reckoned among
those works of the flesh, which they that do,
shall not <hi>inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> And
indeed had not these plain texts, yet meer
reason would tell us the same; That is, a
place of infinite purity, such that flesh and
blood, till it be refined, and purified, is not
capable of, as the Apostle tels us, 1 <hi>Cor. 15.
53.</hi> and if as we are meer men, we are too
gross, and impure for it, we must sure be
more so, when we are changed our selves into

onely some one or two, but a Legion, a troop

and multitude of them. And of this we daily
see examples, for where this sin of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
hath taken possession, it usually comes as
an harbinger to abundance of others; each act
of drunkenness prepares a man not onely for
another of the same sin, but of others; lust
and rage, and all brutish appetites are then
let loose, and so a man brings himself under
that curse, which was the sadest <hi>David</hi> knew

that the sluggard lives; <hi>sleep,</hi> you know, is
a kind of death, and he that gives himself up
to it, what doth he but dye before his time.
Therefore if untimely death be to be lookt
upon, as a curse, it must needs be a strange
folly to choose that from our own sloth,
which we dread so much from Gods hand.</p>
                  <p>5. The <hi>fourth</hi> part of <hi>temperance</hi> concerns <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Recreation</note>
which are sometimes necessary both
to the body and the mind of a man, neither
of them being able to endure a constant toil
without somewhat of refreshment between;
and therefore there is a very lawful use of
them, but to make it so, it will be necessary
to observe these <hi>cautions;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. <hi>First,</hi> We must take care, that the kind
of them be lawful,<note place="margin">Cautions t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in them.</note> that they be such as have
nothing of sin in them; we must not, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create</hi>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:96830:114"/>
our selves, do any thing which is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
to God, or injurious to our
neighbour, as they do, who make profane
or filthy backbiting discourse their <hi>recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Secondly,</hi> we must take care that we
use it with moderation; And to do so we
must <hi>first</hi> be sure not to spend too much time
upon it, but remember that the end of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation</hi>
is to fit us for business, not to be it self
a business to us; <hi>Secondly,</hi> we must not be too
vehement, and earnest in it, nor set our hearts
too much upon it, for that will both ensnare
us to the using too much of it, and it will
divert, and take off our minds from our more
necessary imployments, like school-boyes,
who after a play-time know not how to set
themselves to their books again. <hi>Lastly,</hi> we
must not set up to our selves any other end of
<hi>recreations,</hi> but that one lawful, of giving
us moderate refreshment.</p>
                  <p>7. As <hi>first,</hi> we are not to use sports onely
to pass away our time,<note place="margin">Undue end of sports.</note> which we ought to
study how to redeem, not fling away; and
when it is remembred how great a work we
have here to do, the <hi>making our calling and
election sure,</hi> the securing our title to Heaver
hereafter, and how uncertain we are what tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
shall be allowed us for that purpose, it will
appear our time is that, which of all other
things we ought most industriously to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.
And therefore sure we have little need
to contrive waies of driving that away, which
flyes so fast of it self, and is so impossible to
recover. Let them that can spend whole
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96830:114"/>
dayes and nights at <hi>cards,</hi> and <hi>dice,</hi> and idle
pastimes, consider this, and withal, whether
they ever bestowed a quarter of that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me
towards that great business of their lives, for
which all their time was given them, and
there think what a woful reckoning they are
like to make, when they come at last to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for that precious treasure of their time.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> we must not let our covetousness
have any thing to do in our <hi>recreations,</hi> if we
play at any game, let the end of our doing
it be meerly to <hi>recreate</hi> our selves, not to
win money; and to that purpose be sure
never to play for any considerable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for if thou do, thou wilt bring thy
self into two dangers, the one of covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and a greedy desire of winning, the
other of rage and anger at thy ill fortune,
if thou happen to loose; both which will be
apt to draw thee into other sins besides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
Covetousuess will tempt thee to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eat,
and cousen in gaming, and anger to swearing
and cursing, as common experience shews us
too often. If thou find thy self apt to fall
into either of these in thy gaming, thou must
either take some course to secure thy self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, or thou must not permit thy self
to play at all; for though moderate play be
in it self not unlawful, yet if be the occasion
of sin, it is so to thee, and therefore must
not be ventured on. For if Christ commands
us so strictly to avoid temptations, that if our
very eyes or hands offend us (that is, prove
snares to us) we must rather part with them,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:96830:115"/>
then be drawn to sin by them: How much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must we part with any of these unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
sports, then run the hazard of offending
God by them? He that so playes layes his
Soul to stake, which is too great a prize to be
played away. Besides, he loses all the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,</hi>
and sport he pretends to aime at; and
instead of that sets himself to a greater toil,
then any of those labours are he was to ease
by it. For sure the desires and fears of the
covetous, the impatience and rage of the angry
man, are more reall pains, then any the most
laborious work can be.</p>
                  <p>8. The last part of <hi>Temperance</hi> is that of
<hi>apparel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Apparel.</note> which we are again to measure by
the agreeableness to the ends for which cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
should be used. Those are especially these
three; <hi>First,</hi> the hiding of nakedness. This
was the first occasion of <hi>apparel,</hi> as you may

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ginal clothes, we have so little reason to be
proud of them, that on the contrary we have
cause to be humbled and ashamed, as having
lost that innocency which was a much greater
ornament, then any the most glorious <hi>apparel</hi>
can be. From this end of clothing we are
likewise e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

such as may answer this end of covering our

of the wearer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

9 A <hi>second</hi> end of <hi>apparel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fencing from cold.</note> is the <hi>fencing</hi>

sort of clothing, which agrees to their <hi>Sex</hi>

equal that of a higher rank, nor yet making it
matter of envy among those of their own

man cloth himself in such sober atire, as befits
his place and calling, and not think himself
disparaged, if another of his neighbours have
better then he.</p>
                  <p>11. And let all remember that <hi>cloths</hi> are
things, which add no true worth to any, and
therefore it is an intolerable vanity to spend
any considerable part either of their thoughts,
time or wealth upon them, or to value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

poor brethren that want them. But if they
desire to adorn themselves, let it be as St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Too much sparing a fault as well as excess.</note> I shall now in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
add this general caution, that though
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:96830:116"/>
in all these particulars I have taken notice only
of the one fault of excess, yet it is possible
there may be one on the other hand; men
may deny theirbodies that which they neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
require to their support, and well
being. This is, I believe, a fault not so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
as the other, yet we sometimes see some
very niggardly persons, that are guilty of it,
that cannot find in their hearts to borrow so
much from their chests, as may feed their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
or cloth their backs, and that are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon the world, so moiling, and drudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it, that they cannot afford themselves
that competent time of sleep, or recreation,
that is necessary. If any that hath read the
former part of this discourse be of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
let him not comfort himself, that he is
not guilty of those excesses there complained
of, and therefore conclude himself a good
Christian, because he is not intemperate, for
whoever is this covetous creature, his abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shall not be counted to him as the vertue
of temperance, for it is not the love of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,

which is by the Apostle summed

by which is meant not onely bare

our <hi>neighbour,</hi> &amp; it is a piece of unrigteousness
to defraud him of it. I shall therefore build
all the particular duties we owe to our <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi>
on those two general ones, <hi>Justice</hi> and
<hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. I begin with <hi>Justice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iustice.</note> whereof there are
two parts, the one <hi>negative,</hi> the other <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:96830:117"/>
the <hi>negative justice</hi> is to do no wrong,
or injury to any. The <hi>positive justice</hi> is to do
right to all; that is, to yeeld them w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>at so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
appertains or is due unto them. I shall

                     </gap>r wronging any.<note place="margin">Negative.</note> Now because a man
is capable of receiving wrong in several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects;
this <hi>first</hi> part of <hi>justice</hi> extends its self
into several branches, answerable to those ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
of injury. A man may be injured ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his Soul, his body, his possessions, or
credit; and therefore this duty of <hi>negative
justice</hi> layes a restraint on us in every of these.
That we do no wrong to any man in respect
either of his Soul, his body, his possessions,
or credit.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>First,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To the Soul.</note> This <hi>justice</hi> tyes us to do no hurt
to his Soul; and here my first work must be
to examine what harm it is that the <hi>soul</hi> can
receive; it is, we know an invisible substance
which we cannot reach with our eye, much
less with our swords and weapons, yet for all
that it is capable of being hurt and wounded;
and that even to death.</p>
                  <p>4. Now the soul may be considered either
in a natural or spiritual sence;<note place="margin">In the natural sence.</note> in the natural
it signifies that which we usually call the mind
of a man, and this we all know may be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with grief or sadness as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith
<hi>Pro.</hi> 15. 13. By sorrow of heart the spirit is
broken. Therefore whoever does causlesly
afflict or grieve his neighbour; he transgresses
this part of justice, &amp; hurts, &amp; wrong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his soul.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:96830:118"/>
This sort of injury malicious and spiteful men
are very often guilty of, they will do things,
by which themselves reap no good, nay, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
much harm, onely that they may vex and
gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eve another; This is a most savage, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
humour, thus to take pleasure in the
sadness, and afflictions of others; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
harbours it in his heart, may truly be said
to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> possest with a Devil, for it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
onely of those accursed spirits to delight
in the miseries of men; and till that be cast
out, they are fit onely to dwell as the possest
person did, <hi>Mar. 5. 2. Among graves and
tombs,</hi> where there are none capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
affliction by them.</p>
                  <p>5. But the Soul may be considered also in the
<hi>spiritual</hi> sense,<note place="margin">In the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</note> and so it signifies that immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
part of us, which must live eternally, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in bliss, or woe in another world. And
the Soul thus understood is capable of two
sorts of harm; <hi>first,</hi> that of sin; <hi>secondly,</hi>
that of punishment, the latter whereof is
certainly the consequent of the former; and
therefore though God be the inflicter of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
yet since it is but the effect of sin,
we may justly reckon, that he that dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>wes
a man to sin, is likewise the betrayer of him
to punishment, as he that gives a man a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
wound, is the cause of his death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
under the evil of sin both are contained,
so that I need speak onely of that</p>
                  <p>6. And sure there cannot be a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gher sort
of wrong,<note place="margin">Drawing to sin the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</note> then the bringing this great evil
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96830:118"/>
upon the Soul; sin is the disease and wound
of the Soul, as being the direct contrary to
grace, which is the health, and soundness of
it; Now this wound we give to every Soul,
whom we do by any means whatsoever draw
into sin.</p>
                  <p>7. The ways of doing that are divers,<note place="margin">Direct means of</note>
I shall mention some of them, whereof though
some are more direct then others, yet all tend
to the same end. Of the more direct ones
there is first, the commanding of sin;
that is when a person that hath power over
another, shall require him to do something
which is unlawful; An example of this we
have in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> commanding the
worship of the <hi>golden Image,</hi> Dan. 3 4 and his
copy is imitated by any parent or master,
who shall require of his child or servant to do
any unlawful act. <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selling
of sin, when men advise and perswade
others to any wickedness: Thus <hi>Jobs</hi> wife
counselled her husband to curse God, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 7.
And <hi>Achitophel</hi> advised <hi>Absolom</hi> to go into his
<hi>Fathers concubines, 2 Sam. 16. 21. Thirdly,</hi>
there is enticing and alluring to sin, by setting
before men the pleasures or profits they shall
reap by it. Of this sort of enticement <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
gives warning, <hi>Prov. 1. 10. My son, if
sinners entice thee, consent thou not, if they
say come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let
us l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rke privily for the innocent without cause,</hi>
&amp;c. and <hi>verse</hi> the 13. you may see what is
the bait, by which they seek to alure them;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96830:119"/>
                     <hi>we shall find all precious substance, we shall fill
our souls with spoile, cast in thy lot among us,</hi>
let us all have one purse. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> there is
assistance in sin; that is, when men aid and
help others either in contriving or acting a sin.
Thus <hi>Jonadab</hi> helpt <hi>Amnon</hi> in plotting the
ravishing of his sister, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. all these are
direct means of bringing this great evil of sin
upon our brethren</p>
                  <p>8. There are also others,<note place="margin">Indirect.</note> which though
they seem more <hi>indirect,</hi> may yet be as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
towards that ill end: As <hi>first,</hi> example
in sin; he that sets others an ill pattern does
his part to make them imitate it, and too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it hath that effect; there being generally
nothing more forcible to bring men into any
sinful practice, then the seeing it used by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as might be instanced in many sins, to
which there is no other temptation, but their
being in fashion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
in sin, when either by approving,
or else at least by not shewing a dislike, we
give others confidence to go on in their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.
A <hi>third</hi> means is by justifying and
defending any sinful act of anothers, for by
that we do not only confirm him in his evi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
but endanger the drawing others to the like,
who may be the more inclinable to it, when
they shall hear it so pleaded for. <hi>Lastly,</hi> the
bringing up any reproach upon strict and
Christian living, as those do who have the
ways of God in derision; this is a means to
affright men from the practice of duty, when
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:96830:119"/>
they see it will bring them to be scorned and
despised, this is worse then all the former,
not only in respect of the man who is guilty of
it (as it is an evidence of the great profaneness
of his own heart) but also in regard of others;
it having a more general ill effect then any of
the former can have, it being the betraying
men not only to some single acts of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Christ, but even to the casting off all
subjection to him: By all these means we
may draw on our selves this great guilt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring
and wounding the souls of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p>9. It would be too long for me to instance
in all the several sins,<note place="margin">Men sadly to consider whom they have thus injured.</note> in which it is usual for
men to ensnare others, as drunkenness, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,
rebellion, and a multitude more.
But it will concern every man for his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
to consider sadly what mischiefs of this
kind he hath done to any, by all, or any of
these means, and to weigh well the greatness
of the injury: Men are apt to boast of their
innocency towards their neighbours, that they
have done wrong to no man, but God knows
many that thus brag, are of all others the
most injurious persons: perhaps they have
not maimed his body, nor stolen his goods;
but alas! the body is but the case and cover
of the man, and the goods some appurtenances
to that, 'tis the soul is the man, and that they
can wound and pierce without all remorse, and
yet with the adulteress, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 20. say,
<hi>they have done no wickedness;</hi> but glory of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:96830:120"/>
their friendly behaviour to those whom they
thus betray to eternal ruine, for whomsoever
thou hast drawn to any sin, thou hast done thy
part to ascertain to those endless flames. And
then think with thy self how base a treachery
this is, thou wouldst call him a treacherous
villain, that should while he pretends to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
a man, secretly stab him; but this of
thine is as far beyond that, as the soul is of
more value then the body, and hell worse then
death. And remember yet farther, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the cruelty of it to thy poor brother, it
is also most dangerous to thy self, it being that
against which Christ hath pronounced a woe,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 7. &amp; ver. 6. he tells us that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
shall offend (that is, draw into sin) <hi>any of
those little ones, it were bettter for him that a
milstone were hanged about his neck, and that
he were drowned in the depth of the Sea.</hi> Thou
maist plunge thy poor brother into perdition,
but as it is with wrestlers, he that gives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a fall, commonly falls with him, so thou
art like to bear him company to that place of
torment.</p>
                  <p>10. Let therefore thy own and his danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
in thee a sense of the greatness of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">Heartily to bewail it.</note>
this horrid peece of injustice to the precious
soul of thy neighbour. Bethink thy self seriously
to whom thou past bin thus cruel, whom thou
hast enticed to drinking, advised to rebellion,
alured to lust, stirred up to rage whom thou
hast assisted or encouraged in any ill course, or

then draw up a bill of indictmtnt, accuse and

in all sins of injustice, restitution is a necessary

thou must now endeavour to restore all this

self: <hi>First,</hi> in respect of him, because there
is in mans nature so much a greater prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and readiness to evil, then to good, that
there will need much more pains and diligence
to instil the one into him, then the other: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,

to the difficulty of the work, then in respect
of thy self; if thou be a true penitent, thou
wilt think thy self obliged, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did,
<hi>to labour more abundantly,</hi> and wilt be asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that when thou art trading for God,
bringing back a soul to him, thou shouldst
not pursue it with more earnestness, then
while thou wert an agent of <hi>Satans;</hi> besides
the remembrance, that thou wert a means of
bringing this poor soul into this snare, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily

of it: So much for the first part of negative

                  <p>12. The <hi>second</hi> concerns the bodies,<note place="margin">Negative justice to the body.</note> and
to those also this justice binds thee to do no

of them is killing,<note place="margin">In respect of the life.</note> taking away the life,

have committed this sin of murder by poison,
false witness, or some such concealed ways.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:96830:121"/>
The former is commonly the effect of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
rage, the latter hath several originals,
sometimes it proceeds from some old malice
fixt in the heart towards the person, sometimes
from some covetous or ambitious desires; such a
one stands in a mans way to his profit or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
and therefore he must be removed;
and somtimes again it is to cover shame, as
in the case of strumpets, that murder their
infants, that they may not betray their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
But besides these more direct ways of
killing, there is another, and that is, when by
our perswasions and enticements, we draw a
man to do that which tends to the shortning
of his life, and is apparent to do so; he that
makes his neighbour drunk, if by that drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness

which he would have escaped if he had been
sober, he that made him drunk, is not clear
of his death, or if he die not by any such sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

and that disease kill him, I know not
how he that drew him to that excess, can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
himself of his murder in the eys of God,
though humane Laws touch him not. I wish
those who make it their business, to draw in
customers to that trade of debauchery, would
consider it: There is yet another way of
bringing this guilt upon our selves, and that
is by inciting, and stirring up others to it, or
to that degree of anger, and revenge which
produces it: As that sets two persons at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
or seeing them already so, blowes the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:96830:122"/>
coales, if <hi>murder</hi> ensue, he certainly hath
his share in the guilt, which is a consideration
that ought to affright all from having any
thing to do in the kindling, or encreasing of
contention.</p>
                  <p>14. Now for the <hi>hainousness</hi> of this sin of
<hi>murder,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness of the sin.</note> I suppose none can be ignorant, that
it is of the deepest dye, a most <hi>loud crying sin;</hi>
This we may see in the first act of this kind,
that ever was committed, <hi>Abels blood cryed
from the earth,</hi> as God tels <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4. 10.
Yea, the guilt of this sin is such, that it
leaves a stain even upon the land, where it is
committed, such as is not to be washt out,
but by the blood of the <hi>murderer,</hi> as appears,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 12, 13. The land cannot be purged
of blood, but by the blood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>f him that shed
it, and therefore though in other cases the
flying to the <hi>Altar</hi> secured a man, yet in this
of wilful <hi>murder</hi> no such refuge was allowed,
but such a one was to be taken even thence,
and delivered up to justice, <hi>Exod. 21. 14.
Thou shalt take him from my Altar, that he
may dye.</hi> And it is yet farther observable,
that the onely two precepts which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
mentions, as given to <hi>Noah</hi> after the
floud, were both in relation to this sin, that
of not <hi>eating blood, Gen.</hi> 9. 4. being a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to beget in men a greater horror of this
sin of <hi>murder,</hi> and so intended for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
of it. The other was for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, <hi>Gen. 9. 6. He that sheddeth mans
blood, by man shall his blood be shed,</hi> and the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:96830:122"/>
reason of this strickness is added in the next
words, <hi>For in the Image of God made be man;</hi>
where you see that this sin is not onely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to our brother, but even the highest
contempt, and despight towards God himself,
for it is the defacing of his Image, which he
hath stamped upon man. Nay yet further,
it is the usurping of Gods proper right, and
authority. For it is God alone, that hath
right to dispose of the life of man; 'twas he
alone that gave it, and it is he alone that hath
power to take it away, but he that <hi>murders</hi> a
man, does, as it were, wrest this power out
of Gods hand, which is the highest pitch of
rebellious presumption.</p>
                  <p>15. And as the sin is great,<note place="margin">The great punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it.</note> so likewise is the
<hi>punishment;</hi> we see it frequently very great,
and remarkable, even in this world, (besides
those most fearful effects of it in the next)
blood not onely cryes, but it cryes for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
and the great God of recompences,
as he stiles himself, will not fail to hear it:
very many examples the Scripture gives us of
this: <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabeel,</hi> that murdered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<hi>Naboth,</hi> for greediness of his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
were themselves slain, and the dogs
licked their blood in the place, where they
had shed his, as you may read in that Story;
so <hi>Absalom,</hi> that slew his brother <hi>Amnon,</hi>
after he had committed that sin, fell into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that of rebellion against his King and
Father, and in it miserably perished. <hi>Rechab,</hi>
and <hi>Baanah,</hi> that slew <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96830:123"/>
put to death, and that by the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they thought to endear by it; many more
instances might be given of this out of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

man may furnish himself out of the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his own time.</p>
                  <p>16. And it is worth our notice,<note place="margin">The strange discoveries of it.</note> what
<hi>strange</hi> and even <hi>miraculous</hi> means it hath

the extreme horrour of a mans own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

is not any closeness a man uses in the acting of
this sin, that can secure him from the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance

privy to the fact, and that very often proves
the means of discovering it to the world, or
if it should not do that, yet it will sure act
revenge on him, it will be such a hell within
him, as will be worse then death: this we
have seen in many, who after the commission
of this sin have never been able to enjoy a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes

of mind, that they have chosen to be
their own <hi>murderers,</hi> rather then live in it.
These are the usual effects of this sin even in
this world, but those in another are yet more

of this sin, and to make us extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
watchful of our selves, that we never fall
into it, and to that end to prevent all those
occasions which may insensibly draw us into
this pit. I mentioned at first severall things,
which are wont to be originals of it, and at
those we must begin, if we will surely guard
our selves. If therefore thou wilt be sure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to kill a man in thy rage, be sure never to
be in that rage, for if thou permittest thy self
to that, thou canst have no security against
the other, anger being a madness that suffers
us not to consider, or know what we do, when
it has once possest us. Therefore when thou
findest thy self begin to be inflamed, think be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
whether this may lead thee, if thou
lettest loose to it, and immediately put the
bridle upon this head-strong passion; so again,
if thou wilt be sure thy malice shall not draw
thee to it, be sure never to harbour one mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
thought in thy heart, for if it once settle
there, it will gather such strength, that within
a while thou wilt be perfectly under the power
of it, so that it may lead thee even to this
horrible sin at its pleasure; be therefore care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
at the very first approach of this treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96830:124"/>
gift, to shut the doors against it, never
to let it enter thy mind; so also if thou wilt
be sure thy covetousness, thy ambition, thy
lust, or any other sinful desire shall not betray
thee to it, be sure thou never permit any of
them to bear any sway with thee, for if they
get the dominion, as they will soon do, if they
be once entertained in the heart, they will be
past thy controul, and hurry thee to this or
any other sin, that may serve their ends. In
like manner if thou wouldst not be guilty of
any of the mortal effects of thy neighbours
drunkenness, be sure not to entice him to it,
nor accompany him at it, and to that purpose
do not allow thy self in the same practice, for
if thou do, thou wilt be labouring to get
company at it. <hi>Lastly,</hi> if thou wilt not be
guilty of the <hi>murder</hi> committed by another,
take heed thou never give any incouragement
to it, or contribute any thing to that hatred,
or contention, that may be the cause of it.
For when thou hast either kindled or blowed
the fire, what knowest thou whom it may
consume; bring alwayes as much water, as
thou canst, to quench, but never bring one
drop of oil, to increase the flame. The like
may be said of all other occasions of this sin,
not here mentioned; and this careful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
our selves from these, is the only sure
way to keep us, from this sin; therefore as
ever thou wouldst keep thy self innocent from
the great offence, guard thee warily from all
such inlets, those steps and approaches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it.</p>

him of the means of getting his bread by
disabling him from labour, is surely no less
guilty. In the law it was permitted that to

is so impossible for them to repair) but yet he
may satisfie for some of the ill effects of that

him, yea, though it be by his own extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

by <hi>possessions,</hi> I cannot better
explain, then by referring you to the <hi>tenth
Commandment,</hi> the end of which is to bridle
all covetous appetites and desires towards the
<hi>possessions</hi> of our Neighbour. There we find
reckoned up not only his house, servants, and
cattel, which may all pass under the one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
name of his goods or riches, but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
his wife, as a principal part of his <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions,</hi>
and therefore when we consider this
duty of negative justice, in respect of the <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions</hi>
of our Neighbour, we must apply i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s wife.</note> that
every man hath in his wife, is so well known
that it were vain to say any thing in proof of it;
the great impatience that every husband hath
to have this right of his invaded, shews that it
is sufficiently understood in the world, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:96830:127"/>
therefore none that does this injury to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
can be ignorant of the greatness of it.
The corrupting of a mans wife, enticing her
to a strange bed, is by all acknowledged to be
the worst sort of theft, infinitely beyond that
of the goods.</p>
                  <p>3. Indeed there is in this one a heap of the
<hi>greatest injustices</hi> together;<note place="margin">The enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a mans wife, the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.</note> some towards
the woman, and some towards the man: To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the woman, there are the greatest ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable;
it is that <hi>injustice</hi> to her soul, which
was before mentioned as the highest of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
'tis the robbing her of her innocency,<note place="margin">To the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note>
and setting her in a course of the horredst wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
(no less then lust and perjury together)
from which it is probable she may never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and then it proves the damning of her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally.
Next it is in respect of this world, the
robbing her of her credit, making her abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and despised, and her very name a reproach
among all men; and besides it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is the depriving
her of all that happiness of life, which arises
from the mutual kindness and affection that
is between man and wife, in stead whereof
this brings in a loathing, and abhorring of each
other; from whence flow multitudes of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
too many to rehearse, in all which man
hath his share also.</p>
                  <p>4. But besides those,<note place="margin">To the man.</note> there are to him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and high injustice; for it is first the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
him of that, which of all other things he
accounts most precious, the love and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his wife, and that also wherein he hath
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:96830:128"/>
such an incommunicable right, that himself
cannot, if he would, make it over to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and therefore sure it cannot without the
utmost in justice be torn from him by any:
Nor is this all, but it is farther the ingulfing
him (if ever he come to discern it) in that most
tormenting passion of jealousie, which is of all
others the most painful, and which oft puts
men upon the most desperate attempts, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as <hi>Soloman</hi> says, <hi>Prov. 6. 34. The rage
of a man.</hi> It is yet farther, the bringing upon
him all that scorn, and contempt, which by
the unjust measures of the world falls on them,
which are so abused, and which is by many
esteemed the most unsufferable part of the
wrong; and though it be true that it is very
unjust, he should fall under reproach, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is injured, yet unless the world could
be new moulded, it will certainly be his lot,
and therefore it adds much to the injury: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
this may indeed be a robbery in the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
sense of the word, for perhaps it may be
the thrusting in the child of the adulterer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his family, to share both in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and portions of his own children; and
this is an arrand theft; <hi>first,</hi> in respect of the
man, who surely intends not the providing
for another mans child; and then in respect
of the children, who are by that means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded
by so much as that goes away with.
And therefore whoever hath this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the sin to repent of, cannot do it
effectually, without restoring to the family,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:96830:128"/>
as much as he hath by this means rob'd it
of.</p>
                  <p>5. All this put together will sure make this
the greatest and most provoking injury that
can be done to a man,<note place="margin">The most irrepaira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> and (which heightens
it yet more) it is that, for which a man can
never make reparations; for unless it be in
the circumstance before mentioned, there is
no part of this sin, wherein that can be done;
to this purpose it is observable in the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Law, that the thief was appointed to <hi>restore
fourfold,</hi> and that freed him; but the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
having no possibility of making any resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
any satisfaction, he must pay his life
for his offence. <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. 10. And though now
a days adulterers speed better, live many
days to renew their guilt, and perhaps to
laugh at those, whom they have thus injured,
yet let them be assured, there must one day be
a sad reckoning, and that whether they repent
or not: If by Gods grace they do come
to repentance, they will then find this to be
no cheap sin, many anguishes of soul, terrors,
and perplexities of conscience, groanes, and
tears it must cost them, and indeed were a
mans whole life spent in these penitential ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
'twere little enough to wipe off the
guilt of any one single act of this kind; what
overwhelming sorrows then are requisite for
such a trade of this sin, as too many drive?
Certainly it is so great a task, that it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary for all that are so concerned, to
set to it immediately, lest they want time to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96830:129"/>
go through with it; for let no man flatter
himself, that the guilt of a course and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of such a sin can be washt away with a
single act of repentance; no he must propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the repentance to the fault, and as one
hath been a habit and course, so must the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
also. And then how strange a madness
is it for men to run into this sin (and that with
such painful pursuits, as many do) which he
knows must at the best hand, that is, supposing
he do repent of it, cost him thus dear; but
then, if he do not repent, infinitely dearer;
it looses him all his title to heaven, that place
of purity, and gives him his portion in the
lake of fire, where the burnings of his lust
shall end in those everlasting burnings: For
how closely soever he have acted this sin, be
it so that he may have said with the adulterer
in <hi>Job 25. 15. No eye seeth me,</hi> yet 'tis
sure he could not in the greatest obscurity
shelter himself from Gods sight, with whom
<hi>the darkness is no darkness, Psal.</hi> 139. 12.
And he it is, who hath expresly th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eatned to
judg this sort of offender, <hi>Heb. 13 4. Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
God will judg.</hi> God grant that all that
live in this foul guilt may so seasonably, and
so throughly judg themselves, that they may
prevent that severe and dreadful judgment of
his.</p>
                  <p>6. The <hi>second</hi> thing,<note place="margin">His goods.</note> to which this nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
justice to our neighbours possessions
reacheth, is <hi>his Goods,</hi> under which general
word is contained all those several sorts of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96830:129"/>
things, as <hi>House, Land, Cattel, Money,</hi> and
the like, in which he hath a right and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
these we are by the rule of this justice to
suffer him to enjoy, without seeking either
to work him damage in any of them, or to
get any of them to <hi>our selves:</hi> I make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between these two, because there may
be two several grounds, or motives of this inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;
the one malice, the other covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>7. The <hi>malicious</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Malicious injustice.</note> man desires to work his
neighbour mischief, though he get nothing by
it himself; 'tis frequently seen, that men will
make havock, and spoile of the goods of one,
to whom they bear a grudg, though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
designe to get any thing to themselves by
it, but only the pleasure of doing a spight to
the other: This is a most hellish humour,
directly answerable to that of the Divel, who
bestows all his pains and industry, not to
bring in any good to himself but only to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and undoe others: and how contrary it
is to all rules of justice, you may see by the
Precept given by God to the Jews concerning
the goods of an enemy, where they were so far
from being allowed a liberty of spoile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
that they are expresly bound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it, <hi>Exod. 23. 45. If thou meet thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
oxe, or his asse going a stray, thou shalt
surely bring it back to him again: If thou
see the asse of him that hateth thee lying under
his burden, and wouldst forbear to help him, thou
shalt surely help with him:</hi> Where you see
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:96830:130"/>
it is a debt we owe to our very enemies, to
prevent that loss and damage, which by any
accident he is in danger of: and that even
with some labour, and pains to our selves. How
horrible an injustice is it then, purposely to
bring that loss, and damage on him? Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is guilty of this let him never excuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by saying, he hath not inricht himself by
the spoil of his neighbour, that he hath nothing
of it cleave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to his finger; for sure this malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
injustice is no less a fault then the covetous
one; nay I suppose in respect of the principle &amp;
cause, from which it flowes, it may be greater,
this hatred of another being worse then the
immoderate love of our selves; whoever hath
thus mischieft his neighbour, he is as much
bound to repair the injury, to make satisfaction
for the loss, as if he had inriched himself by
it.</p>
                  <p>8 But on the other side,<note place="margin">Covetous injustice.</note> let not the covetous
defrauder therefore judg his sin light because
there is another, that in some one respect out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighs
it, for perhaps in others his may cast
the scales; certainly it does in this one, that he
that is unjust for greediness of gain is like to
multiply more acts of this sin, then he that is
so out of malice; for tis impossible any man
should have so many objects of his malice, as
he may have of his covetousness; there is no
man at so general a defiance with all mankind
that he hates every body; but the covetous man
hath as many objects of his vice, as there be
things in the world he counts valuable: But I
shall not longer stand about this comparison,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96830:130"/>
'tis sure they are both great and crying sins,
and that is ground enough of abhorring each;
let us descend now to the several branches of
this sort of <hi>covetous injustice;</hi> 'tis true they
may all bear the name of robbery, or theft for
in effect they are all so, yet for methods sake
it will not be amiss to distinguish them into
these three <hi>Oppression,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Oppression.</note> 
                     <hi>Theft,</hi> and <hi>Deceit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. By <hi>oppression</hi> I mean that open and <hi>bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
robbery,</hi> of seizing upon the possessions
of others, and owning, and avowing the doing
so. For the doing of this there are several instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
as first that of power, by which many
Nations and Princes have been turned out of
their rights, and many private men out of
their estates; sometimes again. Law is made
the instrument of it; he that covets his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
lands or goods, pretends a claim to them,
and then by corrupting of justice by bribes
and gifts, or else over-ruling it by greatness and
authority gets judgment on his side: This is
a high oppression, and of the worst sort, thus to
make the Law, which was intended for the
protection, and defence of mens rights,
to be the means of overthrowing them;
and it is a very heavy guilt, that lyes
both on him that procures, and on him that
pronounces such a sentence, yea and on the
lawyer too, that pleads such a cause, for by so
doing he assists in the oppression; sometimes
again, the very necessities of the oppressed are
the means of his oppression; thus it is in the
case of extortion, and griping usury; a man
is in extreme want of money, and this gives
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96830:131"/>
opportunity to the extortioner two rest uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionably
from him, to which the poor man
is forced to yeild, to supply his present wants.
And thus also it is often with <hi>exacting Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords,</hi>
who when their poor tenants know
not how to provide themselves elsewhere, rack
and skrew them beyond the worth of the thing.
All these and many the like are but several
wayes of acting this one sin of oppression
which becomes yet the more hainous, by how
much the more helpless the person is, that is
thus oppressed, therefore the oppression of
the widow, and fatherless, is in Scripture
mentioned, as the height of this sin.</p>
                  <p>10. It is indeed a most crying guilt,<note place="margin">Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</note> and
that against which God hath threatned his
heavy vengeance, as we read in divers texts of
Sriptures: Thus it is, <hi>Ezek. 18. 12. He that
hath oppressed the poor,</hi> and hath spoiled by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
he shall <hi>surely die, his blood shall be upon
him:</hi> and the same sentence is repeated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. Indeed God hath so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
taken upon him the protection of the
poor, &amp; oppressed, that he is engaged as it were
in honour to be their avenger, and accordingly,
<hi>Psal</hi> 12. We see God solemnly declare his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of appearing for them, <hi>ver. 5. For the
oppression of the poor for the sighing of the needy,
now will I arise, saith the Lord, I will set him
in safety from him;</hi> the advice therefore of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
is excellent, <hi>Prov. 22. 22. Rob not the poor,
because he is poor, neither oppresse the afflicted in
the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>te, for the Lord will plead their cause, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:96830:131"/>
will spoil the soul of those that spoiled them;</hi>
they are like in the end to have little joy of the
booty it brings them in, when it thus enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
God against them.</p>
                  <p>11. The <hi>second</hi> sort of this injustice is <hi>theft,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Theft.</note>
and of that also there are two kinds, the one
the withholding what we should pay, and the
other taking from our neighbour what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in his possession.</p>
                  <p>12. Of the <hi>first</hi> sort is the not paying of
debts,<note place="margin">Not paying what we borrow.</note> whether such as we have <hi>borrowed,</hi> or
such as by our own voluntary promise are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
our debts, for there are equally due to
him, that can lay either of these claims to
them; and therefore the withholding of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them is a theft, a keeping from my
neighbour that which is his; yet the former
of them is rather the more injurious, for by
that I take from him that which he once actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
had (be it money, or whatsoever else)
and so make him worse then I found him:
This is a very great, and very common inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;
men can now a days with as great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
deny him that asks a debt, as they do
him, that asks an alms, nay many times 'tis made
matter of quarrel for a man to demand his
own, besides the many attendances the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
is put to in pursuit of it, are a yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
injury to him, by wasting his time, and
taking him off from other business, and so
he is made a looser that way too. This is so
great injustice, that I see not how a man can
look upon any thing he possesses as his own
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96830:132"/>
right, whilst he thus denyes another his. It is
the duty of every man in debt, rather to strip
himself of all, &amp; cast himself again naked upon
Gods providence, then thus to feather his nest
with the spoiles of his neighbours. And surely it
would prove the more thriving course, not only
in respect of the blessing, which may be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
upon justice, compared with the curse, that
attends the contrary, but even in worldly pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
also; for he that defers paying of debts,
will at last be forst to it by Law, and that upon
much worse terms, then he might have done it
voluntarily, with a greater charge, &amp; with such
a loss of his credit, that afterwards in his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
necessities he will not know where to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
But the sure way for a man to secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from the guilt of this unjustice, is never to
borrow more then he knows he hath means to
repay, unless it be one, who knowing his disabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
is willing to run the hazard. Otherwise he
commits this sin at the very time of borrowing
for he takes that from his neighbour upon
promise of paying, which he knows he is never
likely to restore to him, which is a flat robbery.</p>
                  <p>The same justice which tyes men to pay their
own debts tyes also every surety to pay those
debts of others, for which he stands <hi>bound,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What we are b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
case the principal either cannot or will not: for
by being <hi>bound,</hi> he hath made it his own debt,
and must in all justice answer it to the creditor,
who, its presumed was drawn to lend, on confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his security, and therefore is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cheated and betrayed by him, if he see him
not satisfied. If it be thought hard, that a man
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96830:132"/>
should pay for that, which he never received
benefit by, I shall yeild it, so far as to be
just matter of wariness to every man how he
enter into such engagements, but it can never
be made an excuse for the breaking them.</p>
                  <p>As for the other sort of debt, that which is
brought upon a man by his own <hi>voluntary
promise,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</note> that also cannot without great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
be withholden; for it is now the mans
right, and then 'tis no matter, by what means it
came to be so. Therefore we see <hi>David</hi> makes it
part of the description of a just man, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 4.
that he <hi>keeps his promise, yea, though they were
made to his own disadvantage;</hi> and surely he is
utterly unfit to <hi>ascend to that Holy Hill,</hi> there
spoken of, either as that signifies the Church
here, or Heaven hereafter, that does not punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
observe this part of justice. To this sort of
debt may be reduced the wages of the servant,
the hire of the labourer, and the withholding of
these is a great sin, and the complaints of those
that are thus injured, ascend up to God. <hi>Behold</hi>
(saith St. <hi>James) the hire of the labourers which
have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept

that have reaped, are entred into the ears of

we find a strict command in this matter. <hi>Thou
shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor
and needy, at his day thou shalt give him his
hire, neither shall the Sun go down upon it,
for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it, lest
he cry against thee to the Lord, and it be sin
unto thee.</hi> This is one of those loud clamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96830:133"/>

                     <p>Of THEFT; Stealing the Goods of our Neighbour.

                  </argument>
                  <p>§. 1. THE <hi>second</hi> part of <hi>theft</hi> is the
taking from our neighbour
that which is already in his
possession;<note place="margin">Stealing the goods of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> and this may be
done either more violently, and openly, or
else more closely, and slyly; The first is the
manner of those that rob on the way, or plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
houses, where by force they take the goods
of their neighbour; The other is the way of
the pilfering thief, that takes away a mans
goods unknown to him; I shall not dispute,
which of these is the worst, 'tis enough that
they are both such acts of injustice, as make
men odious to God, unfit for humane society,
and betray the actors to the greatest mischiefs
even in this world, death it self being by Law
appointed the reward of it; and there are few
that follow this Trade long, but at last meet
with that fruit of it. I am sure 'tis madness
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96830:133"/>
for any to believe he shall alwayes steal secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for he is to contend with the industry of
all those, whom he shall thus injure, whose
losses will quicken their wits for the finding
him out, and which is infinitely more, he is to
struggle with the justice of God, which doth
usually pursue such men to destruction, even
in this world; witness the many strange disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
that have been made of the craftiest
theeves. But however, if he were secure from
the vengeance here, I am sure nothing but
repentance and reformation can secure him
from the vengeance of it hereafter. And
now when these dangers are weighed, 'twill
surely appear, that the thief makes a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
bargain, he steals his neighbours money,
or cattel, and in exchange for it he must
pay his life, or his Soul, perhaps both, and if
the whole world be too mean a price for
a Soul, as he tels us, <hi>Mar.</hi> 18. 36. who
best knew the value of them, having himself
bought them, what a strange madness is it, to
barter them away for every petty trifle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
do, who have got such a habit of stealing,
that not the meanest worthless thing can es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
their fingers? Under this head of theft
may be ranked the receivers of stoln goods,
whether those that take them, as partners in
the theft, or those that buy them, when they
know or believe they are stoln. This many
(that pretend much to abhor theft,) are guilty
of, when they can by it, buy the thing a little
cheaper then the common rate. And here
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:96830:134"/>
also comes in the concealing of any goods a
man finds of his neighbours, which whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
restores not, if he know, or can learn out
the owner, is no better then a thief, for he
withholds from his neighbour that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belongs to him: and sure 'twill not be
uncharitable to say, that he that will do this,
would likewise commit the grosser theft, were
he by that no more in danger of Law then in
this he is.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> part of injustice is <hi>deceit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deceit.</note> and in
that there may be as many acts as there are
occasions of entercourse and dealing between
man and man.</p>
                  <p>2. It will be impossible to name them all,
but I think they will be contained under these
two general <hi>deceits</hi> in matters of Trust, and
in matters of Traffick, or bargaining; unless
it be that of Gaming, which therefore here
by the way, I must tell you, is as much a <hi>fraud</hi>
and <hi>deceit</hi> as any of the rest.</p>
                  <p>3. He that deceives a man in any <hi>trust,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Trust.</note>
that is committed to him, is guilty of a great
injustice, and that the most treacherous sort
of one, it is the joyning of two great sins in
one, <hi>defrauding,</hi> and <hi>promise-breaking;</hi> for
in all trusts there is a promise implyed, if not
exprest, for the very accepting of the <hi>trust</hi>
contains under it a promise of fidelity; these
trusts are broken sometimes to the living,
sometimes to the dead; to the living there
are many wayes of doing it, according to the
several kinds of the <hi>trust;</hi> sometimes a trust
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96830:134"/>
is more general, like that of <hi>Potiphar</hi> to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
Gen. 39. 4. a man commits to another
all that he hath, and thus guardians of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and sometimes stewards are intrusted;
sometimes again it is more limited, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to some one special thing: A man
intrusts another to bargain, or deal for him in
such a particular, or he puts some one thing
into his hands, to manage, and dispose: Thus
among servants it is usual for one to be intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
with one part of the Masters goods, and
another with another part of them. Now in
all these, and the like cases, whosoever acts
not for him that intrusts him, with the same
faithfulness, that he would for himself but
shall either carelesly loose, or prodigally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezel
the things committed to him, or else
convert them to his own use, he is guilty of
this great sin of betraying a trust to the living.
In like manner he that being intrusted with
the execution of a dead mans Testament, acts
not according to the known intention of the
dead man, but enriches himself by what is
assigned to others, he is guilty of this sin, in
respect of the dead; which is so much the
greater, by how much the dead hath no means
of remedy, and redress, as the living may
have. It is a kind of robbing of graves,
which is a theft of which men naturally have
such a horrour, that he must be a very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thief, that can attempt it. But either of
these frauds are made yet more hainous, when
either God, or the poor are immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96830:135"/>
in it; that is, when any thing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to a man, for the uses either of piety,
or charity: this adds sacriledge to both the
fraud, and the treachery, and so gives him
title to all those curses, that attend those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
sins, which are so heavy, that he that
for the present gain will adventure on them,
makes as ill, nay, a much worse bargain, then
<hi>Geh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>4. The <hi>second</hi> sort of <hi>fraud</hi> is in matters of
<hi>traffick</hi> and <hi>bargain,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Traffick</note> wherein there may be
deceit both in the seller, and buyer; That of
the seller is commonly either in concealing the
faults of the commodity, or else in over-rate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
                  <p>5. The wayes of <hi>concealing</hi> its faults are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
these,<note place="margin">The sellers concealing the faults of his ware.</note> either first by denying that it
hath any such fault, nay, perhaps commending
it for the direct contrary quality, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d this is
down-right lying, and so adds that sin to the
other, and if that lye be confirmed by an oath,
as it is too usually, then the yet greater guilt
of perjury comes in also; and then what a
heap of sins is here gathered together? abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
enough to sink any poor Soul to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and all this onely to skrew a little more
money out of his neighbours pocket, and that
sometimes so very little, that 'tis a miracle
that any man that thinks he has a Soul, can
set it at so miserable a contemptible price.
A <hi>second</hi> means of <hi>concealing</hi> is by using some
Art to the thing, to make it look fair, and to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:96830:135"/>
hide the faults of it, and this is acting a lye,
though it be not speaking one, which amounts
to the same thing, and has surely in this case
as much of the intention of cheating, and
defrauding as the most impudent forswearing
can have. A <hi>third</hi> means, is the picking
out ignorant chapmen; This is, I believe,
an Art too well known among tradesmen,
who will not bring out their faulty wares to
men of skill, but keep them to put off to
such, whose unskilfulness may make them
passable with them; and this is still the same
deceit with the former, for it all tends to the
same end, the cozening and defrauding of
the chapman, and then it is not much odds,
whether I make use of my own Art, or his
weakness for the purpose. This is certain, he
that will do justly, must let his chapman know
what he buyes, and if his own skill enable
him not to judge (nay, if he do not actually
find out the fault) thou art bound to tell it
him, otherwise thou makest him pay for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
which is not there, he presum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng there is
that good quality in it, which thou knowest is
not, &amp; therefore thou mayest as honestly take
his money for some goods of another mans,
which thou knowest thou canst never put into
his possession, which I suppose no man will
deny to be an arrant cheat. To this head of
<hi>concealment</hi> may be referred, that deceit of false
weights and measures, for that is the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the buyer a defect in the quantity,
as the other was in the quality of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:96830:136"/>
and is again the making him pay for what
he hath not. This sort of fraud is pointed at
particularly by <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 11. 1. with this
note upon it, that it is an <hi>abomination to the
Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. The <hi>second</hi> part of fraud in the seller,
lyes in <hi>over-rating</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His over-rating it.</note> the commodity; though
he have not disguised, or concealed the faults
of it, and so have dealt fairly in that respect,
yet if he set an unreasonable price upon it, he
defrauds the buyer: I call that an unreasonable
price, which exceeds the true worth of the
thing, considered with those moderate gains,
which all tradesmen are presumed to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Sale; Whatever is beyond this must
in all likelyhood be fetcht in by some of these
wayes: As <hi>first,</hi> by taking advantage of the
buyers ignorance in the value of the thing,
which is the same with doing it in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which hath already been shewed to be a
deceit: or <hi>secondly,</hi> by taking advantage of
his necessity; thou findest a man hath present
and urgent need of such a thing, and therefore
takest this opportunity to set the dice upon
him, but this is that very sin of extortion,
and oppression spoken of before; for it is sure,
nothing can justly raise the price of any thing,
but either its becoming dearer to thee, or its
being some way better in its self, but the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of thy brother causes neither of these;
his nakedness doth not make the clothes thou
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llest him stand thee in ever the more, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth it make them any way better, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:96830:136"/>
therefore to rate them ever the higher, is to
change thy way of trading, and sell even the
wants and necessities of thy neighbour, which
sure is a very unlawful vocation. Or <hi>thirdly,</hi>
it may be by taking advantage of the indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the chapman; A man perhaps ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
fancies such a thing, and then suffers
that fancy so to over-rule his reason, that he
resolves to have it upon any termes; If thou
findest this in him, and thereupon raisest thy
rate, this is to make him buy his folly, which
is of all others the dearest purchase, 'tis sure
his fancy adds nothing to the reall value, no
more then his necessity did in the former case,
and therefore should not add to the price.
He therefore that will deal justly in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of selling, must not catch at all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
which the temper of his chapman may
give, but consider soberly, what the things is
worth, and what he would afford it for to
another, of whom he had no such advantage,
and accordingly rate it to him at no higher a
price.</p>
                  <p>7. On the <hi>buyers</hi> part there are not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
so many opportunities of <hi>fraud,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fraud in the Buyer.</note> yet
it is possible a man may sometimes happen to
sell somewhat, the worth whereof he is not
acquainted with, and then it will be as unjust
for the buyer to make gain by his ignorance,
as in the other case it was for the seller; but
that which oftner fals out, is the case of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
which may as probably fall on the sellers
side, as the buyers; A mans wants compell
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96830:137"/>
him to sell, and permit him not to stay to
make the best bargain, but forces him to take
the first offer; and here for the buyer to grate
upon him, because he sees him in that strait, is
the same fault, which I before shewed it to be
in the seller.</p>
                  <p>8. In this whole business of <hi>traffick</hi> there are so
many opportunities of deceit that a man had<note place="margin">Many Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in Traffick.</note>
need fence himself with a very firm resolution,
nay, love of justice, or he will be in danger to
fall under temptation, for as the wise man
speaks <hi>Eccles. 27. 2. As a nail sticks fast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the joinings of the stones,</hi> so doth sin
stick close between <hi>buying</hi> and <hi>selling;</hi> it is
so interwoven with all trades, so mixt with
the very first principles, and grounds of them,
that it is taught together with them, and so
becomes part of the Art, so that he is now a
dayes scarce thought fit to manage a Trade,
that wants it, while he that has most of this
black Art of defrauding, applauds and huggs
himself, nay, perhaps boasts to others, how
he hath over-reacht his neighbour.</p>
                  <p>What an intolerable shame is this,<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monness of injustiee a reproach to Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> that we
<hi>Christians,</hi> who are by the precepts of our
Master set to those higher duties of Charity,
should in stead of practising them, quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn
those common rules of justice, which
meer nature teaches? For, I think, I may
say, there are none of those several branches
of injustice towards the possessions of our
neighbour, which would not be adjudged to
be so by any sober Heathen, so that, as Saint
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96830:137"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> tels those of the Circumcision, that the
name of God <hi>was Blasphemed among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
by that unagreeableness that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
their practice, and their Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 24.
So may it now be said of us, that the <hi>Name
of Christ is Blasphemed among the Turks and
Heathens,</hi> by the vile and scandalous lives of
us, who call our selves Christians, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in this sin of injustice; For shame let
us at last endeavour to wipe off this reproach
from our profession, by leaving these practices,
to which me thinks this one single considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should be enough to perswade us.</p>
                  <p>9. Yet besides this,<note place="margin">It is not the way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich a man.</note> there want not other;
Among which, one there is of such a nature, as
may prevail with the arrantest worldling, and
that is, that this course doth not really tend
to the enriching of him; there is a secret
curse goes along with it, which like a canker
eats out all the benefit was expected from it.
This no man can doubt that believes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where there are multitudes of Texts to
this purpose: thus <hi>Prov. 22. 16. He that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
the poor to encrease his riches, shall
surely come to want.</hi> So <hi>Hab. 2. 6. Woe to
him that encreaseth that which is not his, how
long? And he that ladeth himself with thick
clay: shall they not rise up suddenly that shall
bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee? and
thou shalt be for booties to them.</hi> This is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the fortune of those that spoil and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
others, they at last meet with some that
do the like to them. But the place in <hi>Zachary</hi>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:96830:138"/>
is most full to this purpose, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. where
under the sign of a flying roll is signified the
curse, that goes forth against this sin, ver. 4.
<hi>I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of Hosti,
and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and
into the house of him that sweareth falsly by my
Name, and it shall consume it with the timber
thereof, and with the stones thereof.</hi> Where
you see theft, and perjury are the two sins,
against which this curse is aimed (and they too
often go together in the matter of defrauding)
and the nature of this curse is, to <hi>consume the
house,</hi> to make an utter destruction of all that
belongs to him that is guilty of either of
these sins. Thus whilest thou art ravening
after thy neighbours goods, or house, thou
are but gathering fuel to burn thine own. And
the effect of these threatnings of God we daily
see in the strange improsperousness of ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
estates, which every man is apt enough to
observe in other mens cases; he that sees his
neighbour decline in his estate, can presently
call to mind, this was gotten by oppression or
deceit, yet so sottish are we, so bewitcht with
the love of gain, that he that makes this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
can seldome turn it to his own use,
is never the lesse greedy, or unjust himself for
that vengeance he discerns upon others.</p>
                  <p>10. But alas, if thou couldst be sure that thy
unjust possession,<note place="margin">It ruines the Soul Eternally.</note> should not be torn from
thee, yet when thou remembrest, how dear
thou must pay for them in another world, thou
hast little reason to brag of thy prize. Thou
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:96830:138"/>
thinkest thou hast been very cunning, when
thou hast over-reacht thy brother, but God
knowes all the while, there is another over-reaching
thee, and cheating thee of what is
infinitely more precious, even thy Soul; the
Devil herein deals with thee as fishers use to
do; those that will catch a great fish, will
bait the hook with a less, and so the great
one coming with greediness to devour that, is
himself taken; So thou that art gaping to
swallow up thy poor brother, art thy self
made a prey to that great devourer. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!
what will it ease thee in Hell, that thou
hast left wealth behind thee upon earth, when
thou shalt there want that, which the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
beggar here enjoyes, even a drop of water
to cool thy tongue. Consider this, and from
henceforth resolve to imploy all that pains and
diligence thou hast used to deceive others, in
rescuing thy self from the frauds of the grand
deceiver.</p>
                  <p>11. To this purpose it is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sary,<note place="margin">The neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</note>
that thou make <hi>Restitution</hi> to all whom
thou hast wronged; For as long as thou
keepest any thing of the unjust gain, 'tis as it
were an earnest penny from the Devil, which
gives him full right to thy Soul. But perhaps
it may be said, it will not in all cases be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to make Restitution to the wronged par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
peradventure he may be dead; in that
case then make it to his heirs, to whom his
right descends. But it may further be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
that he that hath long gone on in a
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:96830:139"/>
course of fraud, may have injured many, that
he cannot now remember, and many that he
has no means of finding out; In this case all
I can advise is this: <hi>First,</hi> to be as diligent
as is possible, both in recalling to mind who
they were, and endeavouring to find them
out; and when, after all thy care, that
proves impossible, let thy Restitutions be
made to the poor, and that they may not be
made by halves, be as careful as thou canst to
reckon every the least mite of unjust gain, but
when that cannot exactly be done, as 'tis sure
it cannot by those who have multiplied the acts
of fraud, yet even there let them make some
general measures, whereby to proportion
their restitution: as for example, a tradesman
that cannot remember how much he has
cheated in every single parcel, yet may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
guess in the gross whether he have usually
over-reacht to the value of a third, or a fourth
part of the wares, and then what proportion
soever he think he has so defrauded, the same
proportion let him now give out of that estate
he hath raised by his Trade; but herein it
concerns every man to deal uprightly, as in
the presence of God, and not to make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of his own forgetfulness, to the cutting
short to the Restitution, but rather go on the
other hand, and be sure rather to give too
much, then too little. If if he do happen to
give somewhat over, he need not grudge the
charge of such a sin offering, and 'tis sure he
will not, if he do heartily desire an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:96830:139"/>
Many other difficulties there may be
in this business of restitution, which will not
be foreseen, and so cannot now be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spoke to; but the more of those there are,
the greater horrour ought men to have of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into the sin of injustice, which it will be
so difficult, if not impossible for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
and the more careful ought they to be
to mortify that, which is the root of all inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
to wit Covetousness.</p>

two sorts, the one is when a man sayes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his neighbour, which he directly
knows to be false, the other when possibly
he has some slight surmize, or jealousy of the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:96830:140"/>
thing; but that upon such weak grounds, that
'tis as likely to be false as true. In either of
these cases, there is a great guilt lies upon the
reporter; that there doth so in the <hi>first</hi> of
them, no body will doubt, every one acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
that it is the greatest baseness to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
a lie of another; but there is as little
reason to question the other, for he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
a thing as a truth, which is but uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
is a lyar also, or if he do not report it
as a certainty, but only as a probability, yet
then though he be not guilty of the lye, yet he
is of the injustice, of robbing his neighbour of
his credit; for there is such an aptness in men
to believe ill of others, that any the lightest
jealousy will, if once it be spread abroad,
serve for that purpose; and sure it is a most
horrible injustice upon every slight surmize,
and fancy, to hazard the bringing so great
an evil upon another; especially when it is
considered, that those surmizes commonly
spring rather from some censoriousness, pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishness,
or malice in the surmizer, then
from any reall fault in the person so suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                  <p>2. The manner of spreading these false r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of both kinds,<note place="margin">False wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> is not alwayes the same;
sometimes it is more open and avowed, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more close and private: the open is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times by false witness before the Court of
Justice; and this not only hurts a man in his
credit, but in other respects also; 'tis the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
him up to the punishment of the Law,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:96830:140"/>
and according to the nature of the crime pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
does him more or less mischief; but if
it be of the highest kind, it may concern his
life, as we see it did in <hi>Naboths</hi> case, 1 <hi>Kin.
21.</hi> How great and crying a sin it is in this
respect, as also in that of the perjury, you
may learn from what hath been said of both
those sins. I am now to consider it only, as
it touches the credit; and to that it is a most
grievous wound, thus to have a crime pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
witnessed against one, and such as is
scarce curable by any thing that can afterwards
be done to clear him, and therefore whoever
is guilty of this, doth a most outragious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
to his neighbour; this is that which
is expresly forbidden in the <hi>ninth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and was by God appointed to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
by the inflicting of the very same suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon him, which his false testimony aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to bring upon the other. <hi>Deut. 19.
16.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>second</hi> open way of spreading these
reports,<note place="margin">Publick slanders.</note> is by a publick and common declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them; though not before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
as in the other case, yet in all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and before such as are likely to carry it
farther, and this is usually done with bitter
railings, and reproaches, it being an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
act of slanderers, to revile those whom they
slander, that so by the sharpness of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
they may have the greater impression
in the minds of the hearers; this both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the slander, and the railing, is a high
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:96830:141"/>
injury, and both of them such, as debarre the
committers from heaven; thus <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.
where the upright man is discribed, that shall
have his part there, this is one special thing,
vers. 3. <hi>That he slendereth not his neighbour;</hi>
And for railing, the Apostle in several places
reckons it amongst those works of the flesh,
which are to shut men out both from the
Church here by excommunication, as you
may see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. and from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God hereafter, as it is, 1 <hi>Cor. 6.
10.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. The other more close and private way of
spreading such reports, is that of the <hi>Whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>
he that goes about from one to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and privately vents his slanders, not
out of an intent by that means to make them
less publick, but rather more; this trick of
delivering them by way of secret, being the
way to make them both more believed, and
more spoken of too; for he that receives such
a tale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a secret from one, thinks to please
some body else, by delivering it as a secret
to him also; and so it passes from one hand to
another, till at last it spread over a whole
Town: This sort of slanderer is of all other;
the most dangerous, for he works in the dark,
tyes all he speaks to, not to own him as the
author, so that whereas in the more publick
accusations, the party may have some means
of clearing himself, and detecting his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
here he shall have no possibil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty of that,
the slander, like a secret poison, works incure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:96830:141"/>
effects, before ever the man discern it.
This sin of whispering is by St. <hi>Paul</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
among those great crimes, which are
the effects of a reprobate mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 29.
It is indeed one of the most injurable wounds
of this sword of the tongue; the very bane
and pest of humane society; and that which
not only robs single persons of their good
names, but oftentimes whole families, nay,
publick societies of men of their peace, what
ruines, what confusions has this one sin
wrought in the world? 'Tis <hi>Solomons</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 18 28. That a <hi>whisperer sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
chief friends,</hi> and sure one may truly
say of tongues thus imployed, that they are
<hi>set on fire of Hell,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> saith, Chap.
3. 6.</p>
                  <p>5. This is such a guilt that we are to beware
of all degrees of approach to it,<note place="margin">Several steps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this sin.</note> of which there
are several steps; the <hi>first</hi> is the giving ear
to, and ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rishing of those that come with
slanders, for they that entertain and receive
them, incourage them in the practice; for
as our common proverb sayes, if there were
no receivers, there would be no thief; so if
there were none, that would give an ear to
tales, there would be no tale bearers. A <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
step is, the giving too easy credit to them,
for this helps them to attain part of their end,
they desire to beget a general ill opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of such a man, but the way of doing it
must be by causing it, <hi>first,</hi> in particular m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n:
and if thou suffer them to do it in thee, they
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:96830:142"/>
have so farr prospered in their aime. And for
thy own part thou dost a great injustice to thy
neighbour, to believe ill of him without a just
ground, which the accusation of such a person
certainly is not. A <hi>third</hi> step, is the reporting
to others, what is thus told thee; by which
thou makest thy self directly a party in the
slander, and after thou hast unjustly withdrawn
from thy neighbour, thy own good opinion,
endeavourest to rob him also of that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
This is very little below the guilt of
the <hi>first whisperer,</hi> and tends as much to the
ruine of our neighbours credit. And these
several degrees have so close a dependance one
upon another, that it will be very hard for
him that allowes himself the <hi>first,</hi> to escape
the other; and indeed he that can take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to hear his neighbour defamed, may well
be presumed of so malicious a humour, that
'tis not likely he should stick at spreading the
slander. He therefore that will preserve his
innocence in this matter, must never in the
least degree cheris or countenance any that
brings these false reports. And it is not less
necessary to his peace, then to his innocency;
for he that once entertains them, must never
expect quiet, but shall be continually incited
and stirred up even against his neerest, and
deerest relations; so that this whisperer, and
slanderer is to be look't on by all, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
enemy, he being so as well to those to
whom, as of whom he speaks.</p>
                  <p>6. But be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ides this grosser way of slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:96830:142"/>
there is another, whereby we may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,<note place="margin">Despising and scoffing.</note>
and lessen the credit of our neighbour, and
that is by contempt, and despising; one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
effect whereof is <hi>scoffing,</hi> and deriding
him. This is very injurous to a mans reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for the generallity of men do rather
take up opinions upon trust, then judgment;
and therefore if they see a man despised, and
scorned, they will be apt to do the like. But
besides this effect of it, there is a present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
in the very act of despising, and scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others. There are ordinarily but three
things, which are made the occasions of
it (unless it be with such, with whom virtue
and godliness are made the most reproachful
things, and such despising is not only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to our neighbour, but even to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
for whose sake it is, that he is so despised)
those three are <hi>first</hi> the infirmities, <hi>secondly</hi>
the calamities, <hi>thirdly</hi> the sins of a man, and
each of these are very farr from being ground
of our triumphing over him.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>First,</hi> for <hi>infirmities,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">For infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</note> be they either of
body or mind, the deformity and unhandsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the one, or the weakness, and folly of
the other, they are things out of his power
to help, they are not his faults, but the wise
dispensations of the great Creator, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows
the excellencies of body and mind, as
he pleases, and therefore to scorn a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath them not, is in effect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
God who gave them not to him.</p>
                  <p>8. So also for the <hi>calamities,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">For calami<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties.</note> and miseries,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:96830:143"/>
that befall a man, be it want, or sickness, or
what ever else, these also come by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, who raiseth up, and pulleth
down, as seems good to him, and it belongs
not to us to judg, what are the motives to him
to do so, as many do, who upon any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that befals another, are presently conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that sure it is some extraordinary guilt,
which pulls this upon him, though they have
no particular to lay to his charge. This rash
judgment our Saviour reproves in the <hi>Jews,
Lu.</hi> 13. where on occasion of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
sufferings of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> he asks
them, ver. 2. <hi>suppose ye that these Galileans
were sinners above all the Galileans, because
they suffered such things? I tell you nay, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you repent, ye shall all likewise perish:</hi> when
we see Gods hand heavy upon others, it is no
part of our business to judg them, but our
selves, and by repentance to prevent, what
our own sins have deserved. But to reproach,
and revile any, that are in affliction, is that
barbarous cruelty, taken notice of by the
<hi>Psalmist,</hi> as the heighth of wickedness, <hi>Psal.
69. 26. They persecute him whom thou hast
smitten, and they talk to the grief of them whom
thou hast wounded:</hi> In all the miseries of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
compassion becomes a debt to them;
how unjust are they then, that in stead of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them that debt, afflict them with scorn
and reproach?</p>
                  <p>9. Nay the very <hi>sins</hi> of men,<note place="margin">Forsi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

they have more of their wills in them, they
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:96830:143"/>
may seem more to deserve reproach, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they also oblige us to the former duty
of compassion, and that in the highest degree,
as being the things, which of all others make
a man the most miserable; in all these cases,
if we consider how subject we are to the like
our selves; and that is not only Gods mercy
to us, by which we are preserved from the
worst that any man else is under, it will surely
better become us to look up to him with
thankfulness, then down on them with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and despising. Thus you see the direct
injustice of scorning and contemning our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
to which when that other is added,
which naturally followes, as a consequent of
this, to wit, the begetting the like contempt
in others, there can sure be no doubt of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great, and <hi>horrible injustice</hi> to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
in respect of his credit.</p>
                  <p>10. Now how great the injury of destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a mans credit is,<note place="margin">Destroying the credit; a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</note> may be measured by these
two things, <hi>first</hi> the value of the thing he is
rob'd of, and <hi>secondly</hi> the difficulty of mak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
reparations. For the <hi>first,</hi> 'tis commonly
known, that a mans good name is a thing he
holds most precious, oftentimes dearer then
his life, as we see by the hazards men some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
run to preserve even a mistaken reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but 'tis sure it is that, which hath even by
sober men been esteemed one of the greatest
happiness of life: And to some sorts of men,
such especially as subsist by dealings in the
world, tis so necessary, that it may well be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:96830:144"/>
as the means of their livelyhood, and then
sure 'tis no slight matter to rob a man of what
is thus valuable to him.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">And irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairable.</note> the difficulty of making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
increaseth the injury, and that is such
in this case of defamation, that I may rather cal
it an impossibility, then a difficulty: For when
men are possest with an ill opinion of a person,
'tis no easy matter to work it out; so that the
slanderer is herein like a <hi>young Conjurer,</hi> that
raises a Divel he knows not how to lay again.
Nay suppose men were generally as willing to
lay down ill conceits of their neighbours, as
they are to take them up, yet how is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for him that makes even the most <hi>publick
recantation</hi> of his slander, to be sure that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man that hath come to the hearing of the
one, shall do so of the other also? And if
there be but one person, that doth not (as
probably there will be many) then is the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
still short of the injury.</p>
                  <p>12. This consideration is very fit to make
men afraid of doing this wrong to their
neighbour;<note place="margin">Yet every guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must do all he can to repaire the injury.</note> but let it not be made use of to
excuse those, that have already done the
wrong, from endeavouring to make the best
reparations they can; for though 'tis odd,
it will not equal the injury, yet let them how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
do what they are able towards it: And
this is so necessary towards the obtaining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of the sin that none must expect the one,
that do not perform the other. Whosoever
therefore sets himself to repent of his faults
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96830:144"/>
of this kind, must by all prudent means endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to restore his neighbour to that degree
of credit he hath deprived him of; and if that
be not to be done without bringing the shame
upon himself, of confessing publickly the slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
he must rather submit to that, then be
wanting to this necessary part of justice, which
he owes to the wronged party.</p>
                  <p>13. Thus have I gone through these four
branches of <hi>Negative Iustice</hi> to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,<note place="margin">Iustice in the thoughts.</note>
wherein we must yet farther observe,
that this justice binds us not only in respect
of our words, and actions, but of our very
<hi>thoughts,</hi> and affections also; we are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forbid to hurt, but to hate, not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
from bringing any of these evils fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
upon him, but we must not so
much as wish them before, nor delight in them
after they are befallen him: We must take
no pleasure either in the sin of his Soul, or
hurt of his body; we must not envy him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good thing he injoys, nor so much as wish
to possess our selves of it: Neither will it
suffice us, that we so bridle our tongue, that
we neither slander, or revile, if we have that
malice in our hearts, which makes us wish his
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>scredit or rejoyce, when we find it procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
though we have no hand in the procuring
it. This is the peculiar property of Gods
Lawes, that they reach to the heart, whereas
mens can extend only to the words, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and the reason is clear, because he is the
only Law-giver, that can see what is in the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:96830:145"/>
heart, therefore if there were the perfectest
innocence in our tongue, and hands, yet if
there be not this purity of heart, it will never
serve to acquit us before him. The counsel
therefore of <hi>Solomon</hi> is excellent, <hi>Prov. 4. 23.
Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it
are the issues of life.</hi> Let us strictly guard
that, so that no malicious unjust thought en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there, and that not only, as it may be the
means of betraying us to the grosser act, but
also as it is in it self such a pollution in Gods
sight, as will unfit us for the blessed vision of
God, whom none but the pure in heart have
promise of seeing, <hi>Mat. 5. 8. Blessed are the
pure in heart, for they shall see God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. I come now to speak of the <hi>Positive</hi>
part of <hi>Justice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Positive Iustice.</note> which is the yielding to every
man that which by any kind of right he may
challenge from us. Of these dues there are
some, that are general to all mankind, others
that are restrained within some certain condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and qualities of men, and become due
onely by vertue of those qualifications.</p>
                  <p>15. Of the first sort,<note place="margin">Speaking Truth a due to all men.</note> that is those, that
are due to all men, we may reckon first the
speaking truth, which is a common debt we
owe to all mankind; speech is given us as the
instrument of intercourse and society, one
with another, the means of discovering the
mind, which otherwise lyes hid, and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
so that were it not for this, our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
would be but the same as of beasts;
Now this being intended for the good and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:96830:145"/>
of mankind, 'tis a due to it, that it
be used to that purpose. But he that lyes, is
so far from paying that debt, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
he makes his speech the means of injury
and deceiving him he speaks to.</p>
                  <p>16. There might much be said to shew the
several sorts of Obligations we lye under,<note place="margin">Lying ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biden in Scripture.</note> to

to Christians, I need not insist on any other,

that <hi>putting away lying, they speak every

<hi>Col. 3. 9. Lye not one to another:</hi> and <hi>Pro. 6 17.
a lying tongue is mentioned as one</hi> of those
things that are <hi>abominations to the Lord.</hi> Yea,
so much doth he hate a lye, that it is not the
most pious and Religious end, that can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
him to it, the man that lyes, though in
a zeal to Gods glory, shall yet be judged as a
sinner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 7. what shall then become of
those multitudes of men that lye on quite
other ends? some out of malice, to mischief
others, out of covetousness to defraud their
neighbours, some out of pride, to set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out, and some out of fear, to avoid a
danger, or hide a fault. But of a yet stranger
sort, then all these, are those, that do it
without any discernable temptation, that will
tell lyes by way of story, take pleasure in tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
incredible things, from which themselves
reap nothing, but the reputation of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

a title of the greatest infamy, and shame.
But as for God, 'tis madness to hope that all
their Arts can disguise them from him, who
needs none of those casual wayes of discovery,
which men do, but sees the heart, and so
knowes at the very instant of speaking, the
falshood of what is said; and then by his
title of <hi>the God of Truth,</hi> is tyed not onely
to hate, but punish it, and accordingly you
see <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. that the lyars are in the number

sure so much of respect due to the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of mankind, that no accidental advantage
of wealth or honour, which one man hath
above another, can acquit him from that debt
to it, even in the person of the meanest; and
therefore that crabbed and harsh behaviour to
any that bears but the form of a man, is an
injustice to that nature he partakes of. And
when we consider how much that nature is
dignified by the Son of God his taking it
upon him, the obligation to reverence it is yet
greater, and consequently the sin of thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
it.</p>
                  <p>19 This is the common guilt of all <hi>proud</hi>
and <hi>haughty</hi> persons,<note place="margin">Not payed by the proud man.</note> who are so busie in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
themselves, that they over look all that
is valuable in others, and so think they owe
not so much as common civility to other
men, whilest they set up themselves as <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>
did his Image to be worshipped
of all. This is sure very contrary to what the

the sentence of our blessed Saviour.
<hi>Luk. 14. 11. He that exalteth himself shall be
abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be
exalted,</hi> which we often find made good to
us, in the strange down-fals of proud men.
And it is no wonder, for this sin makes both
God and men our enemies, God, as the
Scripture every where testifies, abhorres it,
and all that are guilty of it, and men are by
means of it used so contemptuously &amp; unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by us, that they are by nothing more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
against us, and then whom God and
man thus resist, who shall secure and uphold?</p>
                  <p>20. A <hi>third</hi> thing we owe to all is <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
that is,<note place="margin">Meekness a due to all men.</note> such a patience, and gentleness
towards all, as may bridle that mad passion
of anger, which is not onely very uneasy to
our selves, as hath already been shewed, but
also very mischievous to our neighbours, as
the many outrages, that are oft committed in
it, do abundantly testify. That this duty of
<hi>meekness</hi> is to be extended to all men, there is
no doubt, for the Apostle in express words
commands it, 1 <hi>Thes. 5. 14. Be patient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all men,</hi> and that it should seem in
spite of all provocation to the contrary, for
the very next words are, <hi>See that none ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

<hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded to exercise this <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
even towards them who oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against the Doctrine of the Gospel,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. which was a case, wherein some

to the preserving the peace of the world,<note place="margin">Brauling very in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is no wonder, that Christ, who came to

to all. I am sure the contrary effects of
rage and anger are every where discernable, it
breeds disquiets in Kingdomes, in Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,
in Families, and even between the
neerest relations; 'tis such a humour, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
warnes us never to enter a friendship
with a man that is of it, <hi>Prov. 22. 24. Make
no friendship with an angry man, and with a

unfit to be either friend or companion, and
indeed makes one insufferable to all that have
to do with one, as we are again taught by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
Prov. 21. 19. where he preferres the
<hi>dwelling</hi> in a <hi>wilderness, rather then with a

tongue to offend with. Indeed to any that have
not the same unquietness of humor, there can
scarce be a greater uneasiness, then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with those, that have it, though it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
proceed farther, then words. How great
this sin is, we may judge by what our Saviour
sayes of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. where there are several
degrees of punishment allotted to several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of it; but alas! we daily out go that,
which he there sets as the highest step of this
sin; the calling <hi>thou fool,</hi> is a modest sort of
reviling, compared with those multitudes of
bitter reproaches we use in our rages.</p>

22. Nay,<note place="margin">It leads to that great sin of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</note> we often go yet higher; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
serve not our turn, but we must
<hi>curse</hi> too; How common is it to hear men
use the horridst execrations, and <hi>cursings</hi> upon
every the slightest cause of displeasure? nay,

Christ bids us pray for those, who do us all
injury, and we are often <hi>cursing</hi> those, who
do us none. This is a kind of saying our
prayers backward indeed, which is said to be
part of the ceremony the Devil uses, at the
making of a witch, and we have in this case
also reason to look on it, as a means of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us into acquaintance, and league with that
accursed spirit here, and to a perpetual abide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </p>
                  <p>23. Having spoken thus farr of those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
dues,<note place="margin">Particular dues.</note> wherein all men are concerned,
and have a right, I am now to proceed
to those other sorts of dues, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to particular persons, by vertue of
some especial qualification. These qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:96830:148"/>
may be of three kinds, that of <hi>excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
that of <hi>want,</hi> and that of <hi>relation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. By that of <hi>excellency</hi> I mean any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
gifts,<note place="margin">A respect due to men of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts.</note> or endowments of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
such as wisdom, learning, and the like,
but especially grace: these being the singular
gifts of God, have a great value and respect
due to them, wheresoever they are to be
found; and this we must readily pay by a
willing, and glad acknowledgment of those
his gifts in any he has bestowed them on, and
bearing them a reverence, and respect, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
thereunto, and not out of an overween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our own excellencies, despise and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue
those of others, as they do, who will
yeild nothing to be reason, but what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
speak, nor any thing piety, but what
agrees with their own practice.</p>
                  <p>25. Also we must not envy,<note place="margin">We are not to envy them.</note> or grudg
that they have those gifts, for that is not only
an injustice to them, but injurious also to God,
who gave them, as it is as large set forth in the
parable of the labourers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. where he
asks them, who grumbled at the Masters
bounty to others, <hi>Is it not lawful for me to
do what I will with my own, is thine eye evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
mine is good?</hi> This envying at Gods
goodness to others, is in effect a murmuring
against God, who thus disposes it, neither
can there be a greater, and more direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
against him, then for me to hate
and wish ill to a man, for no other reason, but
because God has loved and done well to him
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:96830:149"/>
and then in respect of the man, 'tis the most
unreasonable thing in the world, to love him
the less, meerly because he has those good
qualities, for which I ought to love him
more.</p>
                  <p>26. Neither must we detract from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
of others,<note place="margin">Nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from them.</note> we must not see to eclipse
or darken them by denying either the kinds,
or degrees of them; by that means to take
off that esteem, which is due to them. This
sin of detraction is generally the effect of the
former of envy, he that envies a mans worth,
will be apt to do all he can to lessen it in the
opinions of others, and to that purpose will
either speak slightly of his excellencies; or if
they be so apparent, that he knows not how
to cloud them, he will trye if he can by report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some either reall, or feigned infirmity of
his, take off from the value of the other, and
so by casting in some dead flies, as the wise
man speaks, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. 1. Strive to corrupt
the savour of the ointment; this is a great
injustice, and directly contrary to that duty
we owe, of acknowledging, and reverencing
the gifts of God in our brethren.</p>
                  <p>27. And both these sins of envy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
do usually prove as great follies,<note place="margin">The folly of both those sins.</note> as
wickedness; the envy constantly brings pain,
and torment to a mans self, whereas if he could
but cheerfully, and gladly look on those good
things of anothers, he could never fail to be
the better for them himself; the very pleasure
of seeing them would be some advantage to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:96830:149"/>
him; but besides that, those gifts of his brother
may be many ways helpful to him, his wisdom
and learning may give him instruction; his
piety, and vertue, example, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all this
the envious man loseth, and hath nothing in
exchange for it, but a continual fretting, and
gnawing of heart.</p>
                  <p>28. And then for detraction, that can
hardly be so managed, but it will be found
out; he that is still putting in Caveats against
mens good thoughts of others, will quickly
discover himself to do it out of envy, and then
that will be sure to lessen their esteem of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but not of those he envies, it being a sort
of bearing testimony to those excellencies,
that he thinks them worth the envying.</p>
                  <p>29 What hath been said of the value,<note place="margin">A respect due to men in regard of their r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nks and qualities.</note> and
respect due to those excellencies of the mind,
may in a lower degree be applyed to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
advantages of honour, greatness, and the
like. These though they are not of equal
value with the former (and such for which
no man is to prize himself) yet in regard, that
these degrees, and distinctions of men are by
Gods wise providence disposed, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ordering of the world, there is such a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
respect due to those, to whom God hath
dispenc'd them, as may best preserve that order,
for which they were intended. Therefore all
inferiours are to behave themselves to their
superious with modesty, and respect, and not
by a rude boldness confound that order, which
it hath pleased God to set in the world, but
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:96830:150"/>
according as our Church-Catechism teaches,
<hi>order themselves lowly and reverently to all
their betters.</hi> And here the former caution
against envy comes in most seasonably; these
outward advantages being things, of which
generally men have more taste, then of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and therefore will be more apt to envy,
and repine to see others exceed them therein,
to this therefore all the former considerations
against envy will be very proper, and the
more necessary to be made use of, by how
much the tempt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion is in this case to most
minds t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e greater.</p>
                  <p>30. The <hi>second</hi> qualication is that of want;<note place="margin">Dues to those that are in any sort <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>f want</note>
whoever is in distress for any thing, wherewith
I can supply him, that distress of his makes it
a duty in me so to supply him, and this in all
kinds of wants. Now the ground of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a duty is, that God hath given men abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
not only for their own use, but for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
and benefit of others, and therefore
what is thus given for their use becomes a debt
to them, whenever their need requires it.
Thus he that is ignorant and wants knowledg
is to be instructed by him, that hath it, and
this is one special end, why that knowledg is
given him: <hi>The tongue of the learned is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to speak a word in season, Esay.</hi> 50. 4. He
that is in sadness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and affliction, is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
by him that is himself in cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
This we see St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it the end
of Gods comforting him, that he <hi>might be
able to comfort them that are in any trouble,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:96830:150"/>
2 Cor.</hi> 1. 4. He that is in any course of sin, and
wants reprehension and counsel, must have
that want supplyed to him by those, who have
such abilities, and opportunities, as may
make it likely to do good. That this is a
justice we owe to our neighbour, appears
plainly by that text, <hi>Levit. 19. 17. Thou shalt
not hate thy brother in thy heart, thou shalt in
any wise reprove him, and not suffer sin upon
him;</hi> where we are under the same obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to reprove him, that we are not to hate
him. He that lies under any slander, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
defamation, is to be defended, and cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, that knows his innocence, or else he
makes himself guilty of the slander, because he
neglects to do that which may remove it; and
how great an injustice, that of slandering our
neighbour is, I have already shewed.</p>
                  <p>31. <hi>Lastly,</hi> he that is in poverty and need,<note place="margin">To the poor</note>
must be relieved by him that is in plently; and
he is bound to it, not only in charity, but
even in justice. <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it a due, <hi>Pro. 3. 27.
Withhold not good from him to whom it is due,
when it is in the power of thine hand to do it:</hi>
and what that good is, he explains in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
next verse: Say <hi>not to thy neighbour, go and
come again, and tomorrow I will give, when thou
hast it by thee:</hi> It seems, 'tis the withholding
a due, so much as to defer giving to our poor
neighbour. And we find God did among the
<hi>Jews</hi> seperate a certain portion of every mans
increase for the use of the poor, a tenth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
third year (which is all one with a thirtieth
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:96830:151"/>
part ever year, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 28, 29. And this
was to be paid not as a charity, or liberality,
but as a debt, they were unjust, if they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
it. And surely we have no reason to think,
that Christian justice is sunk so much below the
<hi>Jewish,</hi> that either nothing at all, or a less
proportion is now required of us. I wish our
practice were but at all answerable to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
in this point, and then surely we
should not see so many <hi>Lazaruses</hi> lye unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
at our doors, they having a better right
to our superfluities, then we our selves have, and
then what is it, but arrant robbery to bestow
that upon our vanities, nay our sins, which
should be their portion?</p>
                  <p>32. In all the foregoing cases,<note place="margin">God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws those abilities which are not thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</note> he that hath
ability is to look upon himself, as Gods stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
who hath put it into his hands to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to them, that want, and therefore not
to do it, is the same injustice and fraud, that
it would be in any steward to purse up that
money for his private benefit, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
to him, for the maintenance of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and he that shall do thus, hath just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to expect the doom of the unjust steward,
<hi>Luke</hi> 16. to be put out of the stewardship, to
have those abilitie, taken from him, which he
hath so unfaithfully imployed. And as for all
the rest, so particularly for that of wealth,
'tis very commonly to be observed, that it
is withdrawn from those that thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud
the poor of their parts, the griping
miser coming often by strange undiscernable
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:96830:151"/>
wayes to poverty; and no wonder, he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no title to Gods blessing on his heap, who
does not consecrate a part to him in his poor
members. And therefore we see the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
before they could make that challenge of
Gods promise to bless them, <hi>Deut. 26. 15.
Look down from thy holy habitation and bless
thy people Israel,</hi> &amp;c. they were first to pay
the poor mans tithes, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. without which
they could lay no claim to it. This withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more then is meet, as <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes, <hi>Pro.
11. 24. tends to poverty;</hi> and therefore as thou
wouldst play the <hi>good husband</hi> for thy self, be
careful to perform this justice according to thy
ability to all that are in want.</p>
                  <p>33. The <hi>third qualification</hi> is that of <hi>relation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dues in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</note>
and of that there may be divers sorts, arising
from divers grounds, and duties, answerable
to each of them. There is first a <hi>relation</hi> of
a debter to a creditor, and he that stands in
that relation to any whether by vertue of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
loan, or promise, 'tis his duty to pay
justly what he owes, if he be able (as on the
other side if he be not, 'tis the creditors, to
deal charitably and Christianly with him, and
not to exact of him beyond his ability.) But I
need not insist on this, having already by
shewing you the sin of with holding debts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
you of this duty.</p>
                  <p>34. There is also a relation of an obliged
person to his benefactor,<note place="margin">Gratitude to Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.</note> that is one that hath
done him <hi>good,</hi> of what kind soever, whether
<hi>spiritual,</hi> or <hi>corporal;</hi> and the duty of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:96830:152"/>
is, <hi>first thankfulness,,</hi> that is a ready and
hearty acknowledgment of the courtesie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
<hi>secondly, prayer</hi> for Gods blessings and
rewards upon him; and <hi>thirdly</hi> an endeavour,
as opportunity and ability serves, to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of kindness, by doing good turnes back
again. This duty of <hi>gratitude</hi> to <hi>benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
is so generally acknowledged by all, even
the most barbarous, and savagest of men, that
he must have put off much of his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that refuses to perform it. The very
<hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>sinners,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> sayes,
<hi>do good to those that do good to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>35. Yet how many of us fail even in this,<note place="margin">The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> how
frequent is it to see men, not only neglect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
courtesies, but return injuries in stead of
them? It is too observable in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
but in none more, then in the case of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and admonition, which is of all others,
the most precious part of kindness, the real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
good turn that can be done from one
man to another. And therefore those that do
this to us, should be look't on, as our prime
and <hi>greatest benefactors.</hi> But alas! how few
are there that can find gratitude, shall I say?
nay patience for such a courtesie? Go about
to admonish a man of a fault, or tell him of
an error, he presently looks on you, as his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
you are, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Galatians,
Chap. 4. 16. become his enemy because you tell
him the truth;</hi> such a pride there is in mens
hearts, that they must not be told of any
thing amiss, though it be with no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:96830:152"/>
but that they may amend it. A strange
madness this is, the same that it would be in a
sick man, to flie in the face of him that comes to
cure him, on a fancy that he disparaged him in
supposing him sick; so that we may well say
with the wise man, <hi>Pro. 12. 1. He that hateth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
is brutish.</hi> There cannot be in the
world a more happy temper, for it fortifies a
man in his sins, raises such mounts, and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks
about them, that no man can come to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
them, and if we may believe <hi>Solomon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
will not fail to attend it, Pro. 29. 1. He
that being of ten reproved hardneth his neck, shall
suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</hi>
But then again in respect of the admonisher,
'tis the greatest injustice, I may say, cruelty
that can be, he comes in tenderness, and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to rescue thee from a danger, and to that
purpose puts himself upon a very uneasy task;
for such the general impatience men have to
admonition, hath now made it; and what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,
what a grief is it to him, to find that in
stead of reforming the <hi>first</hi> fault, thou art run
into a <hi>second,</hi> to wit that of causeless displeasure
against him? This is one of the worst, and yet
I doubt, the commonest sort of unthankfulness
to benefactors, and so a great failing in that
duty we owe to that sort of relation. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
these will be look't on as remote relations
(yet 'tis sure they are such as challenge all that
duty I have assigned to them) I shall in the next
place proceed to those relations, which are by
all acknowledged to be of the greatest neerness.</p>

Of the DUTY of PARENTS to Children, &amp;c.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>§. 1. THE <hi>first</hi> of those neerer sorts
of relations, is that of a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Duty to Parents.</note>
And here it will be
necessary to consider the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
sorts of <hi>Parents,</hi> according to which the
duty to them is to be measured. Those are
these three, the <hi>Civil,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual,</hi> the
<hi>Natural.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Civil Parent</hi> is he,<note place="margin">Dues to the Supreme Magistrate</note> whom God
hath establisht the <hi>Supreme Magistrate,</hi>
who by a just right possesses the throne in a
Nation. This is the common Father of all
those that are under his authority. The du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
we owe to this <hi>Parent</hi> is,<note place="margin">Honour.</note> 
                     <hi>first, Honour</hi> and
<hi>Reverence,</hi> looking on him, as upon one, on
whom God hath stamped much of his own
power and authority, and therefore paying
him all honour and esteem, never daring, upon
any pretence whatsoever, to <hi>speak evil of the
ruler of our people,</hi> Acts 23. 5.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tribute.</note> Paying <hi>Tribute;</hi> This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
commanded by the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 13. 6.
Pay ye tribute also, for they are Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:96830:153"/>
attending continually upon this very
thing.</hi> God has set them apart as Ministers
for the common good of the people, and
therefore 'tis all justice, they should be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and supported by them. And indeed
when it is considered, what are the cares,
and troubles of that high calling, how many
thorns are plated in every Crown, we have
very little reason to envy them these dues, and
it may truly be said, there is none of their
poor labouring subjects, that earns their living
so hardly.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We are to pray for them:<note place="margin">Prayers for them.</note> this
is also expresly commanded by the Apostle,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. to be done for Kings, <hi>and for all
that are in authority.</hi> The businesses of that
calling are so weighty, the dangers and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of it so great, that they of all others
need prayers for Gods direction, assistance,
and blessing, and the prayers that are thus
poured out for them, will return into our own
bosomes, for the blessings they receive from
God tend to the good of the people, to their
<hi>living a quiet and peaceable life,</hi> as it is in the
close of the verse forementioned.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Obedience.</note> We are to pay them <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
This is likewise strictly charged by
the Apostle, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 13. Submit your selves
to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake,
whether it be to the King as Supreme, or unto Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
as those that are sent by him;</hi> We owe
such an <hi>obedience</hi> to the Supreme power, that
whoever is authorised by him, we are to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:96830:154"/>
to, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> likewise is most full to
this purpose, <hi>Rom. 13. 1. Let every Soul be
subject to the higher powers;</hi> and again,
ver. 2. <hi>Whosoever resisteth the pouers, resisteth
the Ordinance of God.</hi> And 'tis observable
that these precepts were given at a time, when
those powers were Heathens, and cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors
of Christianity, to shew us, that no
pretence of the wickedness of our rulers can
free us of this duty. An <hi>obedience</hi> we must
pay either active, or passive: the active in the
case of all lawful commands; That is, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Magistrate commands something,
which is not contrary to some Command of
God, we are then bound to act according to
that command of the Magistrate, to do the
thing he requires. But when he injoins any
thing contrary to what God hath Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we are not then to pay him this active
<hi>obedience,</hi> we may, nay we must refuse thus
to act, (yet here we must be very well assured
that the thing is so contrary, and not pretend
conscience for a cloak of stubborness) we are
in that case to <hi>obey God rather then man.</hi>
But even this is a season for the passive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
we must patiently suffer, what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
on us, for such refusal, and not, to secure
our selves, rise up against him. For <hi>who can
stretch his hand against the Lords anointed, and
be guilt less?</hi> sayes <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abishai,</hi> 1 Sam.
26 9. and that at a time when <hi>David</hi> was
under a great persecution from <hi>Saul,</hi> nay,
had also the assurance of the Kingdom after
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:96830:154"/>
him; and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> sentence in this case is
most heavy, <hi>Rom. 13. 2. They that resist shall
receive to themselves damnation.</hi> Here is very
small incouragement to any to rise up against
the lawful Magistrate, for though they should
so far prosper here, as to secure themselves
from him by this means, yet there is a King
of kings, from whom no power can shelter
them, and this damnation in the close will
prove a sad prize of their victories. What is
on the other side the duty of the Magistrate to
the people will be vain to mention here, none
of that rank being like to read this treatise,
and it being very useless for the people to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
what is the duty of their Supreme,
wherein the most are already much better
read, then in their own, it may suffice them
to know that whatsoever his duty is, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
performed, he is accountable to none
but God and no failing of his pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
them to fail of theirs.</p>
                  <p>6 The second sort of <hi>Parents</hi> are the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual;<note place="margin">Duties to our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</note>
That is, the Ministers of the Word,
whether such, as be Governours in the
Church, or others under them, who are to
perform the same Offices to our Souls, that
our natural Parents do to our bodies. Thus
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tels the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that in <hi>Christ
Iesus he had begotten them through the Gospel,</hi>
1 Cor 4. 15. and the <hi>Galatians,</hi> chap. 4. 19.
that he <hi>travels in birth of them, till Christ he
formed in them;</hi> and again, 1 Cor. 3. 2. <hi>He
had fed them with milk;</hi> that is, such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:96830:155"/>
as were agreeable to that infant state of
Christianity they were then in, but he had
stronger meat for them of <hi>full age,</hi> Heb. 5. 14.
All these are the Offices of a Parent, and
therefore they that perform them to us, may
well be accounted as such.</p>
                  <p>7. Our duty to these is <hi>first</hi> to <hi>love</hi> them,<note place="margin">Love.</note>
to bear them that kindness, which belongs to
those who do us the greatest benefits. This
is required by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Thes 5. 13. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you, brethren, mark them which labour
among you and are over you in the Lord,
and admonish you, and esteem them very highly
in love for their works sake.</hi> The work is such
as ought in all reason to procure them <hi>love,</hi> it
being of the highest advantage to us.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esteem.</note> 'Tis our duty to <hi>value</hi> and
<hi>esteem</hi> them, as we see in the text now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
and surely this is most reasonable, if we
consider either the nature of their work, or
who it is that imployes them. The nature of
their work is of all others the most excellent;
we use to value other professions proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to the dignity and worth of the things
they deal in. Now surely there is no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
of equal worth with a Soul, and this
is their Traffick, rescuing precious Souls from
perdition. And if we consider further, who
it is that imployes them, it yet adds to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
due to them. They are <hi>Ambassadours
for Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ist,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20. and Ambassadours
are by the Lawes of all Nations to be used
with a respect, answerable to the quality of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:96830:155"/>
those that send them. Therefore Christ tels
his disciples, when he sends them out to
preach, <hi>He that despiseth you despiseth me,
and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent
me.</hi> Luk. 10. 16. It seems there is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on the despising of Ministers, then men
ordinarily consider, 'tis the despising of God
and Christ both. Let those think of this,
who make it their pastime, and sport to
affront, and deride this calling. And let
those also, who dare presume to exercise the
Offices of it, without being lawfully called to
it, which is a most high presumption; 'Tis
as if a man on his own head should go, as an
Ambassadour from his Prince; the Apostle
sayes of the Priests of the Law, which yet
are inferiour to those of the Gospel, <hi>That
no man taketh this honour to himself, but he
which was called of God,</hi> Heb. 5 4. How
shall then any man dare to assume this greater
honour to himself, that is not called to it;
Neither will it suffice to say, they have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
call of the spirit; for since God hath
establisht an order in the Church, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
men to this Office, they that shall
take it upon them without that authority, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
that ordinance, and are but of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those theeves and robbers, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
speaks, <hi>Jo. 10. which c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>me not in by the
door.</hi> Besides the sad experience of these
times shew, that many who pretend most to
this inward call of the Spirit, are called by
some other spirit, then that of God, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:96830:156"/>
they v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt being usually directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that word of his, on which all true
Doctrines must be founded. Such are to be
lookt on as those seducers, those false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
whereof we are so often warned in the
Epistles of the Apostles. And whosoever
countenances them, or followes them, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
with them in their guilt. It is recorded
of <hi>Jereboam,</hi> as a crying sin, that he made
of the meanest of the people Priests; that is,
such as had by Gods institution no right to it,
and whoever hearkens to these uncalled
preachers, run into that very sin, for without
the incouragement of being followed, they
would not long continue in the course, and
therefore they that give them that incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
have much to answer for, and are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
guilty of the sin of despising their true
Pastors, when they shall thus set up these false
apostles against them. This is a guilt this age
is too much concerned in, God in his mercy
so timely convince us of it, as may put a stop
to that confusion and impiety, which breaks
in so fast upon us by it.</p>
                  <p>9 <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> We owe to them <hi>maintenance:</hi>
but of this I have spoken already in the first
part of this Book, and shall not here repeat.
<hi>Fourthly,</hi> We owe them <hi>obedience, Obey them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Obedience.</note>
saith the Apostle, <hi>that have the rule over you
and submit your selves, for they watch for
your Souls,</hi> Heb. 13. 17. This <hi>obedience</hi> is to
be paid them in spiritual things; that is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they out of Gods word shall declare
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:96830:156"/>
to us, to be Gods Commands, these we are
diligently to obey, remembring that it is not
they, but God requires it, according to that
of Christ, <hi>he that heareth you heareth me,</hi>
Luk. 10. 16. And this whether it be delivered
by the way of publick preaching, or private
exhortation, for in both, so long as they keep
them to the rule, which is Gods Word, they
are the Messengers of the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> Mal.
2. 7. This <hi>obedience</hi> the Apostle inforceth
from a double motive, one taken from their
Ministry, another from themselves. <hi>They
watch,</hi> sayes he, <hi>for your Souls, as they that
must give account that they may do it with
joy, andt no with grief;</hi> The people are by
their <hi>obedience</hi> to enable their Pastors to give
a comfortable account of their Souls, and it is
a most unkind return of all their care and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
to be put to grieve for the ill success of
them. But then in the <hi>second</hi> place, 'tis their
own concernment also; they may put their
Ministers to the discomfort of seeing all their
pains cast away, but themselves are like to get
little by it, that (sayes the Apostle, <hi>Heb. 13.
17.) will be unprofitable for you;</hi> 'tis your
selves, that will finally prove the loosers by it,
you loose all those glorious rewards, which
are offered, as the crown of this obedience,
you get nothing but an addition to your sin, &amp;
punishment, for as our Saviour tels the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,
<hi>If he had not come and spoken to them they
had not had sin,</hi> Jo. 15. 24 that is in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with what they then had; so certainly they
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:96830:157"/>
that never had the Gospel preached to them,
are much more innocent then they that have
heard and resisted it. And for the punishment,
what Christ told those to whom he had
preached, <hi>That it should be more tolerable for
Tyre and Sydon,</hi> which were Heathen Cities,
<hi>then for them,</hi> the same undoubtedly we may
conclude of our selves.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Lastly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prayer for them.</note> We are to pray for them; This
St. <hi>Paul</hi> every where requires of his Spiritual
children; thus <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 7, 8. having commanded
prayer for all Saints, he adds, <hi>And for me,
that utterance may be given unto me, that I
may open my mouth boldly, to make known the
mystery of the Gospel;</hi> and so again, <hi>Col</hi> 4. 3.
And this remains still a duty to these Spiritual
Fathers, to pray for such assistances of Gods
Spirit to them, as may enable them rightly to
discharge that Holy Calling. I shall omit to
set down here, what is the duty of Ministers
to the people, upon the same consideration,
on which I forbare to mention the duty of
Magistrates.</p>
                  <p>11. The <hi>third</hi> sort of parent is the <hi>natural,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Duties to our natural Parents.</note>
the fathers of our flesh, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls
them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. And to these we owe seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
duties, as <hi>first</hi> we owe them reverence,<note place="margin">Reverence.</note> and
respect; we must behave our selves towards
them with all humility, and observance, and
must not upon any pretence of infirmity in
them, despise or contemn them, either in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
behaviour, or so much as inwardly in
our hearts. If indeed they have infirmities,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:96830:157"/>
it must be our business to cover, and conceal
them; like <hi>Shem,</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> who while cursed
<hi>Cham</hi> publisht and disclosed the nakedness of
their father, covered it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 23. and that
in such a manner too, as even themselves might
not behold it. We are as much as may be to
keep our selves from looking on those naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our parents, which may tempt us to
think irreverently of them. This is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the practice of too many children,
who do not only publish and deride the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of their parents, but pretend they have
those infirmities they have not; there is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
such a pride, and headiness in youth,
that they cannot abide to submit to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
and directions of their Elders, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to shake them off, are willing to have
them pass for the effects of dotage, when they
are indeed the fruits of sobriety, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
To such the exhortation of <hi>Solomon</hi> is
very necessary, <hi>Pro. 23. 22. Hearken to thy
father that begat thee, and despise not thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when shee is old.</hi> A multitude of texts more
there are in that book, to this purpose, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch
shews that the wisest of men thought it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for children to attend to the counsel of
their parents. But the youth of our age set
up for wisdom, the quite contrary way, and
think they then become wits, when they are
advanced to the dispising the counsel, yea
mocking the persons of their parents. Let such
if they will not practice the exhortations, yet
remember the threatning of the wise man, <hi>Pro.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:96830:158"/>
30. 17. The eye that mocketh his father and
despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the
valley shall pick it out, and the young Eagles
shall eat it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>second</hi> duty to them is <hi>love;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Love.</note> we are to
bear them a reall kindness, such as may make
us heartily desirous of all manner of good to
them, and abhor to do any thing that may
grieve or disquiet them. This will appear but
common gratitude; when 'tis remembred,
what our parents have done for us, how they
were not only the instruments of first bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us into the world, but also of susteining
and supporting us after; and certainly they
that rightly weigh the cares and fears, that go
to the bringing up of a child, will judg the love
of that child to be but a moderate return for
them. This <hi>love</hi> is to be exprest several ways,
<hi>first,</hi> in all kindness of behaviour, carrying our
selves not only with an awe, and respect, but
with kindness and affection, and therefore most
gladly and readily doing those things, which
may bring joy and comfort to them, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
avoiding whatever may grieve, and afflict
them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> this love is to be exprest in
praying for them. The debt a child owe to
a parent is so great, that he can never hope
himself to discharge it; he is therefore to call
in Gods aid, to beg of him, that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
all the good his parents have done for
him, by multiplying his blessings upon them;
what shall we then say to those children, that
in stead of calling to heaven for blessings on
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:96830:158"/>
their parents, ransack hell for curses on them,
and powre out the blackest execrations against
them? This is a thing so horrid, that one
would think there needed no perswasion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, because none could be so vile, as to
fall into it, but we see God himself, who best
knows mens hearts, saw it possible; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
laid the heaviest punishment upon it: <hi>He
that curseth father or mother, let him die the
death, Exod.</hi> 21. 17. And alas! our daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
tels us, 'tis not onely possible, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
even this of uttering curses. But 'tis to be
feared, there is another, yet more common,
that is the wishing curses, though fear or
shame keep them from speaking out. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
children are there, that either through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
of the Government, or greediness of
the possessions of the Parents, have wisht their
deaths? But whoever doth so, let him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that how stylie and fairly soever he carry
it before men, there is one that sees those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretest
wishes of his heart, and in his sight he
assuredly passes for this hainous offender, a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
of his Parents. And then let it be considered,
that God hath as well the power of punishing,
as of seeing, and therefore since he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
death to be the reward of that sin,
'tis not unreasonable to expect he may himself
inflict it; that they who watch for the death
of their Parents, may untimely meet with
their own. The fifth Commandment promiseth
long life as the reward of honouring the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
to which 'tis very agreeable that untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
death be the punishment of the contrary,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:96830:159"/>
and sure there is nothing more highly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to that duty, then this we are now speaking
of, the cursing our Parents.</p>
                  <p>14. The third duty we owe to them is <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Obedience.</note>
This is not onely contained in the
fifth Commandment, but expresly injoined in
other places of Scripture. <hi>Eph. 6. 1. Children
obey your Parents in the Lord, for this is right;</hi>
and again, <hi>Col. 3. 20. Children obey your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in all things, for this is well pleasing to the
Lord.</hi> We owe them an <hi>obedience</hi> in all things,
unless where their commands are contrary to
the commands of God, for in that case our duty
to God must be preferred, and therefore if
any Parent shall be so wicked, as to require
his child to steal, to lye, or to do any unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing, the child then offends not against
his duty, though he disobey that command,
nay, he must disobey, or else he offend against
a higher duty, even that he owes to God, his
Heavenly Father. Yet when 'tis thus necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to refuse obedience, he should take care to
do it in such a modest, and respectful manner,
that it may appear 'tis conscience onely, and
not stubborness moves him to it. But in case
of all lawful commands; that is, when the
thing commanded is either good, or not evil,
when it hath nothing in it contrary to our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to God, there the child is bound to obey,
be the command in a weightier or lighter
matter; How little this duty is regarded is
too manifest every where in the world, where
Parents generally have their children no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:96830:159"/>
under command, then they are under the
rod; when they are once grown up, they
think themselves free from all obedience to
them, or if some do continue to pay it, yet
let the motive of it be examined, and 'twill in
too many be found onely worldly prudence;
They fear to displease their Parents, lest they
should shorten their hand toward them, and
so they shall loose somewhat by it; but how
few are there that obey purely upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of duty? This sin of disobedience to
Parents was by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> punishable
with death, as you may read <hi>Deut</hi> 21. 18.
but if Parents now a dayes should proceed so
with their children, many might soon make
themselves chidless.</p>
                  <p>15. But of all acts of <hi>disobedience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Especially in their Marriage.</note> that of
<hi>marrying</hi> against the consent of the Parent, is
one of the highest. Children are so much the
goods, the possessions of the Parent, that
they cannot without a kind of theft, give away
themselves without the allowance of those,
that have the right in them, and therefore we
see under the Law, the Maid that had made
any vow, was not suffered to perform it,
without the consent of the Parent. <hi>Num. 30.
5.</hi> the right of the Parent was thought of
force enough to cancel, and make void the
Obligation, even of a vow, and therefore
surely it ought to be so much considered by us
as to keep us from making any such, whereby
that right is infringed.</p>
                  <p>16. A <hi>fourth</hi> duty to the Parent is to <hi>assist,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ministring to their wants.</note>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:96830:160"/>
and minister to them in all their wants of
what kind soever, whether weakness, and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of body, decayedness of understanding,
or poverty, and lowness of estate, in all these
the child is bound according to his ability, to
relieve and assist them: for the two former,
weakness of body, and infirmity of mind,
none can doubt of the duty, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how every child did in his infancy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the very same benefit from the Parent,
the child had then no strength to support, no
understanding to guide it self; the care of
the Parents was fain to supply both these to it,
and therefore in common gratitude, whenever
either of these becomes the Parents case, as
sometimes by great age, or some accident
both do, the child is to perform the same offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
back again to them. As for that of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
their poverty, there is the very same
Obligation to that with the former, it being
but just to sustain thy Parent who has former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sustained thee; but besides this Christ
himself teaches us, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s is contained
within their precept of honouring the Parents,
for when <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 13. he accuses the Pharisees
of <hi>rejecting the Commandment of God, to
cleave to their own traditions,</hi> he instances in
this particular, concerning the relieving of
Parents, whereby 'tis manifest that this is a
part of that duty which is injoined in the
fifth Commandment, as you may see at large
in the Text, and such a duty it is that no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
can absolve, or acquit us of it. How
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:96830:160"/>
then shall those answer it, that deny relief
to their poor Parents, that cannot part with
their own excesses, and superfluities, which
are indeed their sins, to satisfie the necessities
of those to whom they owe their being?
Nay, some there are, yet worse, who out of
pride scorn to own their Parents in ther po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty;
Thus it often happens, when the
child is advanced to dignity or wealth, they
think it a disparagement to them to look on
their Parents that remain in a low condition,
it being the betraying, as they think, to the
world the meanness of their birth, and so the
poor Parent fares the worse for the prosperity
of his child. This is such a pride and unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
together, as will surely find a sharp ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
from God, for if <hi>Solomon</hi> observe of
pride alone, that it is the fore-runner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 18. we may much rather
conclude so of it, when it is thus accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</p>
                  <p>17. To this that hath been said of the duty
of children to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r Parents,<note place="margin">Duty to be paid even to the worst Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> I shall add onely
this: That no unkindness, no fault of the
Parent can acquit the child of this duty, but
as St. <hi>Peter</hi> tels servants, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. that
they <hi>must be subject not onely to the good and
gentle masters, but also to the froward,</hi> so
certainly it belongs to children to perform du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
not onely to the kind and vertuous, but
even to the harshest, and wicked'st Parent.
For though the gratitude due to a kind Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
be a very forcible motive to make the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:96830:161"/>
child pay his duty, yet that is not the onely,
nor chiefest ground of it; That is laid in the
Command of God, who requires us thus to
honour our Parents, and therefore though we
should suppose a Parent so unnatural, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to have done any thing to oblige the
child, (which can hardly be imagined) yet
still the Command of God continues in force,
and we are in conscience of that, to perform
that duty to our Parents, though none of the
other tye of gratitude should lye on us.</p>
                  <p>But as this is due from the child to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,<note place="margin">Duty of Parents to children.</note>
so on the other side there are other
things also due from the Parents to the child,
and that throughout the several states, and ages
of it.</p>
                  <p>18. <hi>First,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To Nourish them.</note> There is the care of <hi>nourishing</hi>
and <hi>sustaining</hi> it, which begins from the very
birth, and continues a duty from the Parent,
till the child be able to perform it to himself;
This is a duty, which nature teaches, even
the savages beasts, have a great care and
tenderness in nourishing their young, and
therefore may serve to reproach and condemn
all Parents, who shall be so unnatural as to
neglect this. I shall not here enter into the
question whether the mother be obliged to
give the child its first nourishment, by giving
it suck her self, because 'twill not be possible
to affirm universally in the case, there being
many circumstances, which may alter it, and
make it not onely lawful, but best not to do
it; all I shall say, is, that where no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:96830:161"/>
of sickness, weakness, or the like does
happen, 'tis surely best for the mother her self
to perform this office, there being many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to the child by it, which a good
Mother ought so far to consider, as not to
sell them to her own sloth, or niceness, or
any such unworthy motive, for where such
onely are the grounds of forbearing it, they
will never be able to justifie the omission, they
being themselves unjustifiable.</p>
                  <p>But besides this first care,<note place="margin">Bring them to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</note> which belongs to
the body of the child, there is another, which
should begin neer as early, which belongs to
their Souls, and that is the bringing them to
the Sacrament of <hi>Baptism,</hi> thereby to procure
them an early right to all those precious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
which that Sacrament conveyes to
them. This is a duty the Parents ought not
to delay, it being most reasonable, that they
who have been instruments to convey the stain
and pollution of sin to the poor Infant, should
be very earnest and industrious to have it
washt off, as soon as may be: Besides the
life of so tender a creature is but a blast, and
many times gone in a moment, and though
we are not to despair of Gods mercy to
those poor children, who dye without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
yet surely those Parents commit a great
fault, by whose neglect it is, that they want
it.</p>
                  <p>19. Secondly,<note place="margin">Educate them.</note> The Parents must provide
for the education of the child; they must, as
<hi>Solomon</hi> speaks, <hi>Prov. 22. 6. Train up the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:96830:162"/>
child in the way he should go.</hi> As soon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as children come to the use of reason,
they are to be instructed, and that first in those
things, which concern their eternal well-being,
they are by little and little to be taught
all those things, which God hath Commanded
them, as their duty to perform; as also what
glorious rewards he hath provided for them,
if they do it, and what grievous and eternal
punishments, if they do it not. These things
ought as early, as is possible, to be instilled
into the minds of children, which (like new
vessels) do usually keep the savour of that,
which is first put into them, and therefore it
neerly concerns all parents to look they be at
first thus seasoned with Vertue and Religion.
'Tis sure if this be neglected, there is one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at hand to fill them with the contrary, the
devil wil be diligent enough to instil into them
all wickedness and vice, even from their
cradles, and there being also in all our natures
so much the greater aptness to evil, then to
good, there is need of great care and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
to prevent those endeavours of that
enemy of Souls, which can no way be, but
by possessing them at first with good things,
breeding in them a love to vertue, &amp; a hatred
of vice, that so when the temptations come,
they may be armed against them. This surely
is above all things the duty of Parents to look
after, and the neglect of it is a horrible cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
We justly look upon those Parents, as
most unnatural wretches, that take away the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:96830:162"/>
life of their child; but alas! that his mercy
and tenderness, compared to this of negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
his education, for by that he ruines his
Soul, makes him miserable eternally; and
God knowes, multitudes of such cruel Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
there are in the world, that thus give
up their children to be possest by the Devil,
for want of an early acquainting them with
the wayes of God; nay, indeed how few
there are, that do conscionable perform this
duty, is too apparent by the strange rudeness,
and ignorance, that is generally among youth:
the children of those who call themselves
Christians, being frequently as ignorant of
God and Christ, as the meerest Heathens.
But whoever they are, that thus neglect this
great duty, let them know that it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a fearful misery they bring upon their poor
children, but also a horrible guilt upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
For as God sayes to the careless watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<hi>Ezeck. 3. 18. That if any soul perish</hi>
by his negligence, <hi>that soul shall be required
at his hands,</hi> so surely will it fare with all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
who have this office of watch-men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
to them by God over their own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
A <hi>second</hi> part of education is the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them up to some imployment, busying
them in some honest exercise, whereby they
may avoid that great <hi>snare of the Divel, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and also be taught some useful art or
trade, whereby when they come to age, they
may become profitable to the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi>
and able to get an honest living to themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:96830:163"/>
20. To this great duty of <hi>educating</hi> of
<hi>children,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Meane to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the educating of children.</note> there is required as means, <hi>first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
secondly, correction: incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is <hi>first</hi> to be tryed, we should endeavour
to make children in love with duty, by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them rewards and invitations, and whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they do well take notice of it, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them to go on. It is an ill course some
parents hold, who think they must never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to their children, but with a face of sowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and austerity; this seems to be that, which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> forwarnes parents of, when he bids
<hi>fathers</hi> not to <hi>provoke their children to wrath,
Col.</hi> 3. 21. To be as harsh and unkind to them,
when they do well, as if they do ill, is the way
to provoke them; and then the Apostle tels
us in the same verse, what will be the issue of
it, they will be discouraged, they will have
no heart to go on in any good course, when
the parent affords them no countenance. The
<hi>second</hi> means is correction, and this becomes
seasonable, when the former will do no good,
when all faire means, perswasions, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
prevail not, then there is a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of using sharper; and let that be first tryed
in words, I mean not by railing and foul lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
but in sober, yet sharp reproof; but
if that fail too, then proceed to blowes, and
in this case as <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes, <hi>he that spareth
his rod, hateth his son, Prov.</hi> 13. 24. 'Tis a
cruel fondness, that to spare a few stripes at
present, will adventure him to those sad mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
which commonly befall the child, that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:96830:163"/>
is left to himself. But then this correction
must be given in such a manner, as may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to do good; to which purpose it must first
be given timely; the child must not be suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to run on in any ill, till it have got a habit,
and a stubborness too. This is a great error
in many parents, they will let their children
alone for divers years, to do what they list,
permit them to lye, to steal, without ever so
much as rebuking them, nay, perhaps please
themselves to see the witty shifts of the child,
and think it matters not what they do while
they are little: But alas! all that while the
vice gets root, and that many times so deep a
one, that all they can do afterwards, whether
by words or blowes, can never pluck it up.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> correction must be moderate, not
exceeding the quality of the fault, nor the
tenderness of the child. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it must not
be given in rage, if it be, it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll not only be
in danger of being immoderate, but it will lose
its effect upon the child, who will think he is
corrected, not because he has done a fault, but
because his parent is angry, and so will rather
blame the parent then himself, whereas on
the contrary, care should be taken to make the
child as sensible of the fault, as of the smart,
without which he will never be throughly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.<note place="margin">The parent to watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their souls even when they are grown up.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> after children are grown up,
&amp; are past the age of education, there are yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
offices for the parent to perform to them:
the parent is still to watch over them in respect
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:96830:164"/>
of their souls, to observe how they practice
those precepts, which were given them in their
education, and accordingly to exhort, incou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rage,
or reprove, as they find occasion.</p>
                  <p>22. So also for their outward estate,<note place="margin">To provide for their subsistence.</note> they
are to put them into some course of living in
the world; if God have blest the parents with
wealth, according to what he hath, he must
distribute to his children, remembring that
since he was the instrument of bringing them
into the world, he is according to his ability
to provide for their comfortably living in it,
they are therefore to be look't on very unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
parents, who, so they may have enough
to spend in their own riots, and excess, care
not what becomes of their children, never think
of providing for them. Another fault is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
among parents in this business; they defer
all the provisions for them, till themselves be
dead, heap up perhaps great matters for them
against that time, but in the mean time afford
them not such a competency, as may enable
them to live in the world There are several
mischiefs come from this: first it lessens the
childs action to his parent, nay, sometimes it
proceeds so far, as to make him wish his death,
which though it be such a fault, as no tempt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
it puts the child upon shifts, and tricks;
many times dishonest ones, to supply his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities;
this is, I doubt not, a common ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of it, the hardness of parents has often
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:96830:164"/>
put men upon very unlawful courses, which
when they are once acquainted with, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they never leave, though the <hi>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>st</hi> occasion
cease; and therefore parents ought to beware,
how they run them upon those hazards. Besides
the parent loses that contentment, which he
might have in seeing his children live prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
and comfortably, which none but an
arrant earth-worm would exchange for the
vain imaginary pleasure of having money in
his chest. But in this business of providing
for children, there is yet another thing to be
heeded, and that is, that the parent get that
wealth honestly, which he makes their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
else 'tis very far from being a provision,
there is such a curse goes along with an ill-got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
estate, that he that leaves such a one to his
child, do but cheat, and deceive him, makes
him believe he has left him wealth, but has
withall put such a canker in the bowels of it,
that is sure to eat it out. This is so common
an observation that I need say nothing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the truth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of it; would God it were as
generally laid to heart, as it seems to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
taken notice of: Then surely parents
would not account it a reasonable motive to
unjust dealing, that they may thereby provide
for their children, for this is not a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
for them; n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

being of the nature of leaven, which <hi>sowres

satisfie themselves with such provisions for their

to make, assuring themselves how little soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it be, 'tis a better portion then the greatest

                     </gap>ly where the person is
one, to whom we bear a reverence, or with
whom we have a continual conversation;
both which usually meet in a Parent. It is
therefore a most necessary care in all Parents
to behave themselves so before their children,
that their example may be a means of winning
them to vertue; But alas! this age affords
little of this care, nay, so far 'tis from it, that
there are none more frequently the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of corrupting children, then their own
Parents. And indeed how can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
while men give themselves liberty to all
wickedness, 'tis not to be hoped, but that the
children which observe it, will imitate it;
the child that sees his father drunk, will sure
think, he may be so too, as well as his father.
So he that bears him swear, will do the like,
and so for all other vices, and if any Parent
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:96830:165"/>
that is thus wicked himself, should happen to
have so much more care of his childs Soul,
then his own; as to forbid him the things
which himself practices, or correct him for
the doing them; 'tis certain the child will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
this a great injustice in his father, to
punish him for that, which himself freely does,
and so he is never likely to be wrought upon
by it. This consideration layes a most strict
tye upon all Parents, to live Christianly, for
otherwise they do not onely hazard their own
Souls, but those of their children also, and
as it were purchase an estate of inheritance in
Hell.</p>
                  <p>24. A <hi>fifth</hi> duty of Parents is <hi>blessing their
children;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To bless them.</note> the way of doing that is double, <hi>first,</hi>
by their prayer; they are by daily and earnest
prayers to commend them to Gods protection
and blessing, both for their spiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
estate, and <hi>secondly</hi> by their piety they
are to be such persons themselves as that a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
may descend from them upon their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
This is often promised in Scipture to
godly men, that their <hi>seed shall be blessed.</hi> Thus
in the <hi>second commandment,</hi> God promises to
<hi>shew mercy to the thousand generation of them
that love him and keep his commandments.</hi> And
it is very observable in the <hi>Jews,</hi> that though
they were a <hi>stiffe necked generation,</hi> and had
very grievously provoked God, yet the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of their <hi>forefathers, Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and
<hi>Jacob,</hi> did many times move God to save them
from destruction: on the other side, we see that
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:96830:166"/>
even good men have fared the worse for the
iniquities of their fathers. Thus when <hi>Josiah</hi>
had destroyed idolatry restored Gods service,
and done good beyond all the Kings that were
before him, yet there was an old arreare of
<hi>Manasseh</hi> his <hi>grandfather,</hi> which all this pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his would not blot out, but he resolves
to cast <hi>Judah</hi> also out of his sight, as you may
read at large, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. If therefore parents
have any bowels, any kindness towards their
children, any real desire of their prosperity,
let them take care by their own godly life to
entaile a blessing upon them.</p>
                  <p>25 <hi>Sixthly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To give no unreasona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> parents must take heed, that
they use their power over their children with
equity, and moderation, not to oppress them
with <hi>unreasonable commands,</hi> only to exercise
their own author<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty, but in all things of weight
to consider the real good of their children, and
to presse them to nothing, which may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with that. This is a rule whereof parents
may often have use, but in none greater, then
in the business of marrying their children,
wherein many that otherwise are good parents
have been to blame, when out of an eagerness
of bestowing them wealthily, they force them
to marry utterly against their own inclinations,
which is a great tyranny, and that which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
betrayes them to a multitude of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
such as all the wealth in the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
repaire. There are two things, which
parents ought especially to consider in the
matching of their children; the <hi>first,</hi> how they
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:96830:166"/>
may live Christianly, and to that purpose to
chuse a vertuous and pious person, to link them
with: the second is, how they may live cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and comfortably in this world; and to
that end though a competency of estate may be
necessary to be regarded, yet surely abundance
is no way requisite, and therefore that should
not be too vehemently sought after; that which
much more tends to the happiness of that state,
is the mutual kindness, and liking of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
without which marriage is of all other
the most uncomfortable condition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no parent ought to thrust a child into it.
I have now done with the <hi>first</hi> sort of relation,
that of a parent.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>§. 1: THE <hi>second</hi> sort of relation is
that of a <hi>brother;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dues to brethren,</note> now bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood
may be two fold,
either <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>spiritual,</hi>
the <hi>natural</hi> may in the largest extent contain
under it all mankind, all that partake of the
same nature; but I shall not consider it so in
this place, having already mentioned those ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:96830:167"/>
duties,<note place="margin">Natural<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> which belong to all as such:
I now speak of that natural brother-hood, that
is between those that are the children of the
same immediate parent; and the duty of these
is to have united hearts, and affections: This
nature points out to them, they partaking in
a more especial manner, of each others sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and therefore ought to have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
tenderness and kindness, each to other;
thus we see <hi>Abraham</hi> make it an argument,
why there should be no contention between
him and <hi>Let,</hi> because they were brethren, <hi>Gen.
13.</hi> 8. And though by brethren there is meant
only cousins, yet that helps the more strongly
to conclude, that this neerer relation is in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be a greater barr to strife, as also that
this kindness is in some degree to be extended
to all that have any neerness of blood to us.</p>
                  <p>2. This kindness and love between brethren
and sisters ought to be very firmly grounded in
their hearts,<note place="margin">The necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</note> if it be not, they will be of all
others in most danger of disagreeing; for the
continual conversation that is among them,
whilst they are at home in the fathers house,
will be apt to minister some occasion of jar.
Besides the equality that is among them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of birth, often makes them inclinable to
envy each other, when one is in any respect
advanced above the other. Thus we see <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi>
brethren envyed him, because he had
most of his fathers love, and <hi>Rachel</hi> envyed
her sister <hi>Leah,</hi> because she was fruitful; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for the preventing of such temptations,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:96830:167"/>
let all who have brethren and sisters, possesse
their mind with a great and real kindness to
them, look on them as parts of themselves,
and then they wil never think fit either to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with them, or to envy them any advantage,
any more then one part of the body does ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the same body, but will strive to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and help forward the good of each other.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>second</hi> kind of <hi>brotherhood</hi> is <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Spiritual brotherhood</note>
that contains all those who profess the
same faith with us: the Church in our baptism
becomes a mother to each baptized person, and
then surely they that have the relation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to her, must have also the relation of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to each other; and to this sort of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
also we owe a great deal of tenderness
and affection; the spiritual bond of Religion,
should of all others the most closely unite our
hearts. This is the brotherhood which St.
<hi>Peter</hi> exhorts us to love. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17. And to
it we are in an especial manner bound to do all
good offices, <hi>Do good,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>to
all, but especially to them that are of the houshold
of faith, Gal.</hi> 6. 10. Our compassions are to
be most melting towards them of all others,
in all their needs; Christ tels us, that <hi>whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gives but a cup of cold water to any in the
name of a disciple shall not lose his reward,
Mat.</hi> 10. 42. From whence we may assure
our selves that this peculiar love to Christians,
as Christians, is very acceptable in his sight.</p>
                  <p>4. Several duties there are required of us to
these <hi>brethren;</hi> one principal, is the holding
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:96830:168"/>
communion with them,<note place="margin">Our duty to hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with these brethren.</note> and that first in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
we are constantly to continue in the
belief and profession of all those necessary
truths, by which we may be markt out as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
and disciples of Christ; this is that
faith, which St. <hi>Jude</hi> speaks of, which was
<hi>once delivered to the Saints, Iude</hi> 3. by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof we continue still united to this
spiritual brotherhood, in respect of profession,
which we must constantly do, what storms
and persecutions soever attend it, according
to the exhortation of the Apostle, <hi>Heb. 10. 22.
Let us hold fast the profession of our faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wavering. Secondly,</hi> we are also as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
serves, to communicate with them in all
holy offices; we must be diligent in frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the assemblies of the Saints, which is as
it were the badg of our profession; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he that willingly withdraws himself from
these, gives ground to suspect, he will be apt
to renounce the other also. But these parts
of communion we find strictly maintained by
the first Christians, <hi>Acts 2. 42. They conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine and
fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi>
they continued, and that stedfastly, they
were not frighted from it by any persecutions,
though that were a time wherein they were tryed
with the sharpest sufferings; which may
teach us, that it is not the danger, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
this duty can acquit us of it.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To bear with their infirmities.</note> we are to bear with the <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi>
of our Christian brethren, according
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:96830:168"/>
to the advice of St. <hi>Paul, Rom. 15. 1. We
that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of
the weak.</hi> If one that holds all necessary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
truth, happen yet to be in some error,
we are not for this either to forsake his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
or despise his person. This St. <hi>Paul</hi>
teaches us in the case of that weak brother,
who by error made a causlesse scruple about
meats, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. where he bids the stronger
Christians, that is, those who being better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
discerned him to be in an error, yet
to receive him neverthelesse, and not to despise
him, as on the other side, he bids that weak
one not to judge the stronger; the lesser dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
in opinion must be born with on both
sides, and must not in the least abate our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
charity towards each other.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To restore them after falls.</note> we are to endeavour the <hi>restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of any fallen brother, that is, to bring him
to repentance, after he hath fallen into any
sin. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
that they should <hi>retore him that was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken
in a fault, considering themselves
least they also were tempted.</hi> We are not to
look on him as a cast-away to give him over
as utterly desperate, neither are we to triumph
over him, in respect of our own innocence,
like the proud Pharisee, over the poor Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,
<hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. but we are meekly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour
his recovery, remembring that our
own frailty is such, that we are not secure from
the like falls.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To sympathy with them.</note> We are to have a <hi>Sympathy,</hi>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:96830:169"/>
and fellow feeling-with these brethren, to be
neerly toucht with whatsoever befals them,
either as they are considered in society, or in
single persons. In <hi>society</hi> first, and so they make
up a Church, &amp; that either the universal, which
is made up of all Beleevers throughout the
world, or any particular Church, which is made
up of all the Beleevers in that particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and whatever happens to either of these,
either the whole Church in general, or
any such single part of it, especially that
whereof our selves are members, we are to be
much affected and moved with, to rejoice in
all the prosperities, and to mourn and bewail
all the breaches, and desolations thereof, and
daily and earnestly to pray with <hi>David,</hi> Psal.
51. 18. <hi>O be favourable and gracious unto
Sion, build thou the wals of Ierusalem;</hi> and
that especially when we see her in d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>stress, and
persecution. Whosoever is not thus toucht
with the condition of the Church, is not to
be lookt on, as a living member of it, for as
in the natural body every member is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the prosperity of the whole, so certainly
'tis here: it was the observation of the Psalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist,
that <hi>Gods Servants think upon the stones of
Sin, and pity to see her in the dust.</hi> Psal. 102.
14. and surely all his servants are still of the
same temper, cannot look on the ruins, and
desolations of the Church, without the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
sorrow, and lamentation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we
are to have this fellow-feeling with our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
considered as single persons; We are
to account our selves concerned in very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:96830:169"/>
Christian, so as to partake with him in
all his occasions either of joy or sorrow.
Thus the Apostle exhorts, <hi>Rom. 12. 14. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
with them that rejoice, weep with
them that weep;</hi> and again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the similitude of the natural body he urges
this duty, <hi>Whether one member suffer, all the
members suffer with it, or one member be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
all the members rejoice with it.</hi> All
these several effects of love we owe to these
spiritual brethren. And this love is that,
which Christ has made the badge of his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>Jo. 13. 35. By this shall all men know
that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one
to another;</hi> so that if we mean not to cast
off discipleship to Christ, we must not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
this love of the brethren.</p>
                  <p>8. The <hi>third</hi> relation is that between <hi>Husband</hi>
and <hi>Wife.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The wife owes to the husband obedience.</note> This is yet much neerer then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the former, as appears by that Text
<hi>Eph. 5. 31. A man shall leave Father and
Mother and cleave to his wife, and they two
shall be one flesh.</hi> Several duties there are owe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from one of these persons to the other;
and <hi>first</hi> for the wife, she owes obedience.
This is commanded by the Apostle, <hi>Col. 3. 18.
Wives submit your selves to your own hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
as it is fit in the Lord.</hi> They are to
render obedience to their Husbands in the
Lord, that is in all lawful commands, for
otherwise 'tis here as in the case of all other
superiors, God must be obeyed rather then
man, and the wife must not upon her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:96830:170"/>
command do any thing which is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by God. But in all things, which doth
not cross some command of Gods, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
is of force, and will serve to condemn
the peevish stubborness of many wives, who
resist the lawful commands of their husbands,
onely because they are impatient of this duty
of subjection, which God himself requires of
them. But it may here be asked, what if the
husband command something which though it
be not unlawful, is yet very inconvenient, and
imprudent, must the wife submit to such a
command? To this I answer, that it will be
no disobedience in her, but duty, calmly and
mildly to shew him the inconveniences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and to perswade him to retract that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
but in case she cannot win him to it by
fair intreaties, she must neither try sharp lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
nor yet finally refuse to obey, nothing
but the unlawfulness of the command being
sufficient warrant for that</p>
                  <p>9 <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fidelity.</note> The wife owes <hi>Fidelity</hi> to the
husband, and that of two sorts; <hi>first</hi> that of
the bed, she must keep her self pure and chast
from all strange embraces, and therefore must
not so much as give an ear to any that wou'd
allure her, but with the greatest abhorrence
eject all motions of that sort, &amp; never give any
man that has once made such a mot on to her,
the least opportunity to make a second. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
She owes him likewise Fidelity, in the
managing of those worldly affairs, he commits
to her; she must order them so, as may be most
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:96830:170"/>
to her husbands advantage, and not by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
and cozening of him imploy his
good to such uses as he allowes not of.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Love.</note> She owes him <hi>Love,</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with that all friendliness and kindness
of conversation; she is to endeavour to bring
him as much assistance, and comfort of life,
as is possible, that so she may answer that
special end of the womans creation, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a help to her husband, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 13. and this
in all conditions, whether health, or sickness,
wealth, or poverty, whatsoever estate God
by his providence shall cast him into, she must
be as much of comfort and support to him,
as she can. To this all sullenness, and harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
all brawling, and unquietness is directly
contrary, for that makes the wife the burden,
and plague of the man, in stead of a help and
comfort; And sure if it be a fault to behave
ones self so to any person, as hath already
been shewed, how great must it be to do so to
him, to whom the greatest kindness and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is owing?</p>
                  <p>11. Nor let such wives think that any faults,<note place="margin">The faults of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits not from these duties.</note>
or provocations of the husband can justifie
their frowardness, for they will not, either
in respect of Religion or discretion. Not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
for where God has absolutely Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a duty to be paid, 'tis not any unworthiness
of the person can excuse from it; Nor in
Discretion, for the worse a husband is, the
more need there is for the wife to carry her
self with that gentleness and sweetness, that
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:96830:171"/>
may be most likely to win him. This is the
advice St. <hi>Peter</hi> gave the wives of his time,
1 <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t. 3. 1. Likewise ye wives be in subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to your own husbands, that if any obey
not the word, they may without the word be
won by the conversation of the wives.</hi> It seems
the good behaviour of the wives was thought
a powerful means even to win men from
<hi>Heathenism</hi> to <hi>Christianity,</hi> and sure it might
now a dayes have some good effects, if wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
would have but the patience to try it:
At the least, 'twould have this, that it would
keep some tolerable quiet in Families, whereas
on the other side the ill fruits of the wives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietness
are so notorious, that there are few
neighbourhoods, but can give some instance of
it. How many men are there, that to avoid the
noise of a froward wife, have fallen to compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
keeping, &amp; by that to drunkenness, poverty,
and a multitude of mischiefs? Let all wives
therefore beware of administring that tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But whenever there happens any thing,
which in kindness to her husband, she is to
admonish him of, let it be with that softness,
and mildness, that it may appear 'tis love, and
not anger, that makes her speak.</p>

it.</hi> The other the love that Christ
bears to his Church, which is far greater,
ver. 26. both which he sets as patterns for
this love of husbands towards their wives. This
utterly forbids all harshness, and roughness to
them; Men are to use them as parts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to love them as their own bodies, and
therefore to do nothing, that may be hurtful,
and grievous to them, no more then they
would cut, and gash their own flesh. Let
those husbands that tyrannize over their
wives, that scarce use them like humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
consider, whether that be to love them,
as their own bodies</p>
                  <p>13. A <hi>second</hi> duty of the <hi>Husband,</hi> is
<hi>Faithfulness</hi> to the Bed.<note place="margin">Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> This is by God as
well required of the husband, as the wife,
and though the world do seem to look on the
breach of this duty, with less abhorrence in
the husband, yet sure before that Just Judge,
the offence will appear no less on the mans
side, then the womans. This is certain, 'tis
in both a breach of the vow, made to each
other, at their Marriage, and so besides the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,
a down-right perjury, and those
differences in the case, which seem to cast the
scale, are rather in respect of civil and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consideration, then meerly of the sin.</p>
                  <p>14. A <hi>third</hi> duty of the husband is to
<hi>maintain,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> and <hi>provide</hi> for the wife. He is to
let her partake with him in those outward
good things, wherewith God hath blest him,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:96830:172"/>
and neither by niggardliness debar her of
what is fit for her, nor yet by unthriftiness so
waste his goods, that he shall become unable to
support her. This is certainly the duty of the
husband, who being, as hath been said, to
account his wife as a part of his own body,
must have the very same care to sustain her,
that he hath for himself. Yet this is not so to
be understood, as to excuse the wife from her
part of labour and industry, when that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
it being unreasonable the husband
should toil to maintain the wife in idleness.</p>
                  <p>15. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Instruction</note> The husband is to <hi>instruct</hi> the
wife in the things which concern her eternal
welfare, if she be ignorant of them. Thus
St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids the <hi>wives learn of their husbands
at home, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 36 which supposes, that
the husband is to teach her. Indeed it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to every Master of a Family to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that all under his charge be taught all
necessary things of this kind, and then sure
more especially his wife, who is so much nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to him, then all the rest. This should
make men careful to get knowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that so they may be able to perform
this duty they owe to others.</p>
                  <p>16. <hi>Lastly, Husbands</hi> and <hi>Wives,</hi>

to pray for each other, to beg all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings

&amp; to endeavour all they can to do all good to

Souls, by stirring up to the performance of
duty and disswading, and drawing back from
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:96830:172"/>
all sin, and by being like true yoke-fellowes,
helpful and assistant to each other in the doing
of all sorts of good, both to their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and all others within their reach. This
is of all other the truest, and most valuable
love. Nay, indeed how can it be said they do
love at all, who can contentedly let each other
run on in a course that will bring them to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
misery? And if the love of husbands
and wives were thus grounded in Vertue and
Religion, 'twould make their lives a kind of
Heaven on earth, 'twould prevent all those
contentions, and brawlings, so common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, which are the great plagues of
Families, and a lesser Hell, in passage to the
greater, and truly where it is not thus founded,
there is little comfort to be expected in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                  <p>17. It should therefore be the care of every
one that means to enter upon that state,<note place="margin">The vertue of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the chief consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in Marriage.</note> to
consider advisedly before hand, and to choose
such a person, with whom they may have this
spiritual friendship, that is such a one, as truly
feares God. There are many false ends of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
lookt upon in the world: some Marry for
Wealth, others for Beauty, and generally
they are onely worldly respects, that are at
all considered; but certainly he that would
Marry as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ought, should contrive to
make his Marriage useful to those better ends,
of serving God, and saving his own Soul;
at least he must be sure it be no hinderance to
them, and to that purpose the vertue of the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:96830:173"/>
person chosen in more conducing then all the
wealth in the world, though I deny not, but
that a competency of that may likewise be
considered</p>
                  <p>18. But above all things, let all take heed,<note place="margin">Unlawful Marriages.</note>
that they make not such marriages, as may
not only be ill in their effects, but are actual
sins at the time; such are the marriages of
those that were formerly promised to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in which case 'tis sure they rightly belong
to those, to whom they past the first promise,
and then for any other to marry them, during
the life of that person, is to take the husband or
wife of that other, which is direct adultery,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 3. The like unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
there is also in the marriage of those,
who are within those degrees of kindred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by God, the particulars whereof are
set down in the 18. and 20 of <hi>Lev.</hi> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
marries any that is within any of those
degrees of neerness, either to himself, or to
his deceased wife, which is as bad, commits
that great sin of incest, and so long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
to live with such his unlawful wife, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in that fearful guilt. This wariness
in the choice of the person to be married,
would prevent many sad effects, which we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see follow such rash or unlawful matches;
it were well therefore if people would look
on marriage, as our Church advises, as a thing
not to be <hi>undertaken lightly, unadvisealy or
wantenly, to satisfie mens carnal lusts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:96830:173"/>
and in the fear of God;</hi> and in so doing
no doubt a blessing would follow, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
there is little ground to expect. I have
now done with this relation between husband
and wise.</p>
                  <p>19. The next is that between friends;<note place="margin">Friendship.</note> and this
relation if it be rightly founded, it is of great
neerness, and usefulness, but there is none more
generally mistaken in the world; men usually
call them their friends, with whom they have
an intimacy, and frequency of conversation,
though that intimacy be indeed nothing but an
agreement and combination in sin. The drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
thinks him his friend that will keep him
company, the deceitful person, him that will
aid him in his cheats, the proud man, him that
will flatter him: And so generally in all vices,
they are look't on as friends, that advance and
farther us in them. But God knows this is
far from friendship, such a friend as this
the Divel himself is in the highest degree, who
is never backward in such offices. The true
friendship is that of a direct contrary making,
'tis a concurrence and agreement in vertue, not
in vice: in short, a true friend loves h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s friend
so, that he is very zealous of his good, and
certainly he that is really so, will never be the
instrument of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inging him to the greatest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
The general duty of a friend then must
be resolved to be the industrious pursuit of his
friends reall advantages,<note place="margin">Its duti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>,</note> in which there are
several particulars contained.</p>
                  <p>20. As <hi>first,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> 
                     <hi>faithfulness</hi> in all trusts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:96830:174"/>
to him by his friend, whether that of
goods or secrets; he that betrays the trust of
a friend in either, is by all men look't upon
with abhorrence, it being one of the highest
falsnesses and treacheries, and for such treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
wounds the wise man tels us, <hi>every friend
will depart, Eclesiasticus</hi> 22. 22.</p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Assistance.</note> 'tis the duty of a friend to
be assisting to his friend in all his outward
needs; to counsel him, when he wants advice; to
cheere him, when he needs comfort; to give
him, when he wants relief, and to endeavour
his rescue out of any trouble or danger. An
admirable example we have of this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David, he loved him as his
own soul,</hi> and we see he not only contrives for
his safety when he was in danger, but runs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
himself to rescue and deliver his friend,
draws his fathers anger upon him, to turn it
from <hi>David,</hi> as you may read at large, 1 <hi>Sam.
20.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. The <hi>third</hi> and highest duty of a friend
is to be aiding and assisting to the soul of his
friend,<note place="margin">Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> to endeavour to advance that in piety
and vertue, by all means within his power, by
exhortations and encouragements to all vertue,
by earnest and vehement disswasions from all
sin, and not only thus in general, but by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
to his particular wants, especially by
plain and friendly reproofs, where he knows
or reasonably believes there is any fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
This is of all others the most pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
duty of a friend, it being indeed that which
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:96830:174"/>
none else is qualified for such an unwillingness
there is in most men to hear of their faults,
that those that undertake that work, had need
have a great prepossession of their hearts, to
make them patient of it: Nay, it is so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
acknowledged to be the proper work of
a friend, that if he omit it, he betrays the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
into security, his not reproving will be
apt to make the other think he does nothing
worthy of reproof, and so he tacitely acts that
basest part of a flatterer, sooths, and cherishes
him in his sin; when yet farther it is consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
how great need all men have at some time
or other, of being admonished, 'twill appear
a most unfriendly, yea cruel thing to omit it;
we have that natural partialities to our selves,
that we cannot so readily discern our own mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,
as we do other mens, and therefore
'tis very necessary they should sometimes be
shewed us by those, who see them more cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and the doing this at the first may prevent
the multiplying of more: whereas if we be suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to go on unreproved, it often comes to such
a habit that reproves will do no good And then
how shall that person be able to answer it either
to God or himself, that has by his silence betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his friend to this greatest mischief. 'Tis the
expression of God himself speaking of a friend,
<hi>thy friend which is as thine own soul, Deut.</hi> 13. 6.
And sure we should in this respect account our
friends as our own souls, by haveing the same
jealous tendernesse and watchfulnesse over their
souls, which we ought to have of our own.
It will therefore be very fit for all that have
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:96830:175"/>
enter'd any strict friendship, to make this one
special article in the agreement, that they shall
mutually admonish and reprove each other;
by which means it will become such an avowed
part of their friendship, that it can never be
mistaken by the reproved party for censorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or unkindness.</p>
                  <p>23. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> To these several parts of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
must be added that of <hi>Prayer,</hi> we must
not only assist our friends, our selves, in what
we can, but we must call in the Almighty aid
to them, recommending them earnestly to God
for all his blessings, both spiritual, &amp; temporal.</p>
                  <p>24. <hi>Lastly,</hi> We must be constant in our
friendships,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> and not out of a slightness of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
grow weary of a friend, only because
we have had him long. This is great injustice
to him, who if he have behaved himself well,
ought the more to be valued, by how much the
longer he has continued to do so: And it is
great folly in our selves, for it is the casting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the greatest treasure of humane life, for
such certainly is a tryed friend. The wisest of
men gives warning of it, <hi>Prov. 27. 16. Thine
own friend and thy fathers friend forsake not.</hi>
Nay farther, 'tis not every light offence of a
friend, that should make thee renounce his
friendship, there must be some allowance made
to the infirmities of men, and if thou hast oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to pardon him somewhat to day, perhaps
thou maist give him opportunity to requite thee
to morrow; therefore nothing but unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or incorrigible vice should break this band.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:96830:175"/>
25. The last relation is that between <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
and <hi>Servants,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Servant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bedience.</note> both which owe a duty to
each other: That of the <hi>servant</hi> is first <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
to all lawful commands; this is expresly
required by the <hi>Apostle, Eph. 6. 6. Servants
obey in all things your Masters,</hi> &amp;c. and this
<hi>obedience</hi> must not be a grumbling and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
one, but ready and cheerful as he there
proceeds to exhort, ver. 7. <hi>with good will do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
service,</hi> and to help them herein, they are
to consider that it is to the Lord, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men; God has commanded servants thus
to obey their Masters, and therefore the <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
they pay is to God, which may well
make them do it cheerfully, how harsh, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
soever the Master be, especially if what
the Apostle farther urgeth, ver. 8. be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<hi>that there is a reward to be expected from
God for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>26. The <hi>second duty</hi> of the servant is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,<note place="margin">Fidelity.</note>
and that may be of two sorts, one as
supposed to eye service, the other to purloyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or defrauding. The first part of faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is the doing of all true service to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
not only when his eye is over him, and
he expect punishment for the omission, but at
all times, even when his Master is not likely to
discern his failing, and that servant that doth
not make conscience of this, is far from being
a faithful servant; this eye-service being by
the Apostle set opposite to that singleness of
heart, which he requires of servants, <hi>Eph 6.
5.</hi> 6. The second sort of faithfulness consists in
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:96830:176"/>
the honest managery of all things intrusted to
him by his Master, the not wasting his goods
(as the unjust steward was accused to have done
<hi>Lu.</hi> 16.) whether by careless embezelling of
them, or by converting any of them to his
own use without the allowance of his Master.
This latter is that purloyning of which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
warnes servants, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10. And is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no better then arrant theft, of this kind
are all those ways, that the servant hath of
gaining to himself by the loss and damage of his
Master, as the being bribed to make ill bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains
for him, and many the like: Nay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this sort of unfaithfulness is worse then
common theft, by how much there is a greater
trust reposed, the betraying whereof adds to the
crime. As for the other sort of unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that of wasting though without gain to
themselves, it differs not much in effect from
this, the Master may lose as much by the one
as by the other, and then what odds is it to
him, whether he be robb'd by the covetousness
or negligence of his servant, and it is still the
same breach of trust with the former, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Master is supposed to intrust his affairs as
well to the care as the honesty of his servant
for t'would be little advantage to the Master
to be secured, that his servant would not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
cheat him, whilst in the mean time he would
by his carelesness give opportunity to others
to do it; therefore he that does not carefully
look to his Masters prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, dece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ves his trust, as
well as he that justly provides for his own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:96830:176"/>
A <hi>third</hi> duty of a servant is patience
and meekness under the reproofs of his Master;<note place="margin">Submission to rebuke.</note>
                     <hi>not answering again,</hi> as the Apostle exhorts,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 9, That is not making such surely and
rude replies, as may encrease the Masters dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure:
A thing too frequent among ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
even in the justest reprehensions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
St. <hi>Peter</hi> directs them patiently to suffer,
even the most undeserved correction, even
when they <hi>do well and suffer for it, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 20.
But the patient suffering of rebuke is not all
that is required of servants in this matter, they
must also mend the fault they are rebuked for,
and not think they have done enough, when
they have (though never so dutifully) given the
Master the hearing.</p>
                  <p>28. A <hi>fourth</hi> duty of a servant is <hi>diligence;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Diligence.</note> he
must constantly attend to all those things;
which are the duties of his place, and not; give
himself to idleness, and sloth, nor yet to compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
keeping, gameing, or any other disorderly
course, which may take him off from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
business. All these are necessary duties of
a servant, which they are carefully and conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
to perform, not so much to escape the
Masters anger as Gods, who will certainly call
every one of them to an account, how they
have behaved themselves towards their earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Masters.</p>
                  <p>29. Now on the other side,<note place="margin">Masters owe to their Servants Iustice.</note> there are some
things also owing from the <hi>Masters</hi> to their
<hi>servants:</hi> As <hi>first</hi> the <hi>Master</hi> is bound to be
<hi>just</hi> to them, in performing those conditions,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:96830:177"/>
on which they were hired, such are commonly
the giving them food and wages, and that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
that withholds these, is an oppressor.</p>
                  <p>30. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Master is to admonish
and reprove the servant in case of fault,<note place="margin">Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and
that not only in faults against them, wherein few
Masters are backward, but also and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in faults against God, whereat every
Master ought to be more troubled then at
those which tend only to his own loss, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience;
the dishonour of God and the
hazard of the meanest mans soul, being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more worthy our disquiet, then any thing
of the other kind can be. And therefore when
Masters are presently on fire for any little neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
or fault of a servant towards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and yet can without trouble see them
run into the greatest sins against God, 'tis a sign
they consider their own concernments too
much, and Gods glory and their servants souls
too little. This is too commonly the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of Masters, they are generally careless
how their servants behave themselves towards
God, how disorder'd and profane their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
are, and therefore never bestow any
exhortation, or admonition, to perswade
them to vertue, or draw them from vice; such
Masters forget that they must one day give an
account how they have governed their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
It is certainly the duty of every Ruler to
endeavour to advance piety and godliness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all those that are under his charge, and
that as well in this lesser dominion of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:96830:177"/>
as in the greater of a Realm or Nation.
Of this <hi>David</hi> was so careful, that we see he
professes, <hi>Psal. 101. 7. That no deceitful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
should dwell in his house, that he that told
lies should not tarry in his sight,</hi> so much he
thought himself bound to provide that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
might be a kind of Church, an assembly
of Godly upright persons: And if all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
would endeavour to have theirs so, they
would besides the eternal reward of it, hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
find a present benefit by it, there worldly
business would thrive much the better; for if
their servants were brought to make conscience
of their wayes, they would then not dare ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be negligent or false.</p>
                  <p>31. But as it is the duty of Masters to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
and reprove their servants, so they must
also look to do it in a due manner, that is so,
as may be most likely to do good, not in passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and rage, which can never work the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to any thing but the despising or hating
him, but with such sober and grave speeches,
as may convince him of his fault, and may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
assure him, that it is a kind desire of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
(and not a willingness to wreck his
own rage) which makes the Master thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
him.</p>
                  <p>32. A <hi>third</hi> duty of the Master is to set
<hi>good example</hi> of honesty and godliness to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,<note place="margin">Good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note>
without which 'tis not all the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or reproofs he can use, will ever do
good; for else he puls down more with his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi>
then tis possible for him to build with
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:96830:178"/>
the other, and 'tis madness for a drunken, or
profane Master, to expect a sober and godly
family.</p>
                  <p>33. <hi>Fourthly.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Means of Instruction.</note> the Master is to provide that
his servants may not want means of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in their duty, as also that they may
daily have constant times of worshipping God,
publickly by having prayers in the family; but
of this I have spoken before under the head
of Prayer, and therefore shall here say no more
of it.</p>
                  <p>34. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The master in all affairs of his
own,<note place="margin">Moderation in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> is to give reasonable and moderate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
not saying greater burdens on his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
then they are able to bear, particularly
not requiring so much work, that they shall
have no time to bestow on their souls, as on
the other side he is not to permit them to live
so idely as may make them either uselesse to
him, or may betray themselves to any ill.</p>
                  <p>35. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Master is to give his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<hi>encouragement</hi> in well doing,<note place="margin">Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in well-doing.</note> by using
them with that bounty and kindness which
their faithfulness aud diligence and piety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves:
And finally in all his dealing with

the Apostle saith, <hi>Eph. 6. 9. A Master in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
to whom he must give account of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage

have I briefly run through those several relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to which we owe a particular duty, and
so have done with that first branch of duty to
our neighbours; that of Justice.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Charity.</note> This
is the great Gospel-duty, so often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
us by Christ, the <hi>New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi>
as himself calls it, <hi>Jo. 13 34. That ye
love one another,</hi> &amp; this is again repeated twice
in one Chapter, <hi>John</hi> 15 12. 17. and the first
Epistle of St. <hi>John</hi> is almost wholly spent in the
perswasion to this one duty, by which we may
see 'tis no matter of indifference, but most
strictly required of all that profess Christ.
Indeed himself has given it as the badge and
livery of his Disciples, <hi>John 13. 35. By this
shall all men know that ye are my Disciples if
ye have love one to another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Charity</hi> may be considered two waies;<note place="margin">In the Affections.</note>
                     <hi>first,</hi> in respect of the <hi>affections; secondly,</hi>
of the <hi>actions.</hi> Charity in the <hi>affections</hi>
is a sincere kindness, which disposes us to wish
all good to others, and that in all their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
in the same manner that justice obliged
us to wish no hurt to any man, in respect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Soul, his Body, his Goods, or his
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:96830:179"/>
Credit, so this first part of Charity binds us
to wish all good to them in all these.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>first,</hi> for the <hi>Soul.</hi> If we have any
the least spark of Charity,<note place="margin">To mens Souls.</note> we cannot but wish
all good to mens Souls; Those precious
things which Christ thought worth the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soming
with his own blood, may surely well
challenge our kindness, and good wishes;
and therefore if we do not thus love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we are far from obeying that Command
of loving, as he hath loved, for 'twas the
Souls of men which he loved so tenderly, and
both did, and suffered so much for. Of this
love of his to Souls there are two great and
special effects; the <hi>first,</hi> the purifying them
here by his grace, the <hi>second,</hi> the making them
everlastingly happy, in his glory; and both
these we are so far to copy out in our kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as to be earnestly desirous that all men
should arrive to that purity, and holiness here,
which may make them capable of eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
hereafter. It were to be hoped, that
none that himself carried a Soul about him,
could be so cruel to that of another mans, as
not sincerely to wish this, did not experience
shew us there are some persons, whose malice
is so divelish, as to reach even to the dire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
contrary, the wishing not onely the sin, but
the damnation of others. Thus may you
have some, who in any injury, or oppression
they suffer, make it their onely comfort, that
their enemies will damn themselves by it;
when alas! that should to a Christian be much
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:96830:179"/>
more terrible, then any suffering they could
bring upon him. He that is of this temper,
is a disciple of Satans, not of Christ, it being
directly contrary to the whole scope of that
grand Christian precept, of <hi>loving our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
as our selves.</hi> For 'tis sure, no man
that beleeves there is such a thing as dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
wishes it to himself; Be he never so
fond of the wayes that lead to it, yet he
wishes that may not be his journeys end, and
therefore by that rule of Charity should as
much dread it for his Neighbour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to wish all good to the
<hi>Bodies</hi> of men,<note place="margin">To their Bodies, Goods and Credit.</note> all health and welfare, we
are generally tender enough of our own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
dread the least pain or ill, that can befal
them; Now Charity, by vertue of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
precept, extends this tenderness to
all others, and whatever we apprehend as
grievous to our selves, we must be unwilling
should befal another. The like is to be said of
the other two, goods and credit, that as we
wish our own thriving and reputation, so we
should likewise that of others, or else we can
never be said to <hi>love our neighbour as our
selves.</hi>

will certainly have these several effects,
which are so inseparable from it, that they
are often in Scripture accounted as parts of the
duty, and so most strictly required of us;
<hi>First,</hi> it will keep the mind in a peaceable and
meek temper towards others, so far f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:96830:180"/>
seeking occasions of contentions, that no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
shall draw us to it; for where we
have kindness we shall be unapt to quarrel, it
being one of the especial properties of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that it is <hi>not easily provoked, 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 5.
and therefore whoever is unpeaceable, shewes
his heart is destitute of this Charity. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
it will breed comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ssion towards all the
miseries of others every mishap that befals,
where we wish well, is a kind of defeat and
disaster to our selves and therefore if we wish
well to all, we shall be thus concerned in the
calamities of all, have a reall grief, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
to see any in misery, and that according
to the proportion of the suffering. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
it will give us joy in the prosperities of others;

whoever has this real desire of his neighbours
welfare, his desire is accomplished in their
prosperity, and therefore he cannot but have
contentment and satisfaction in it. Both these
are together commanded by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom.

with them that weep. Fourthly,</hi> it will excite
and stir up our prayers for others; We are of
our selves impotent, feeble creatures, un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to bestow blessings, where we most wish them,
therefore if we do indeed desire the good of
others we must se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, whence every <hi>good and perfect gift com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>
Ja. 1. 17. This is so necessary a part of
Charity, that without it our kindness is but an
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:96830:180"/>
unsignificant thing, a kind of empty comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For how can he be believed to wish
well in earnest, who will not thus put life and
efficacy into his wishes by forming them into
prayers which will otherwise be vain and
fruitless. The Apostle thought not fit to
leave men to their bare wishes, but exhorts
that supplications, prayers, and giving of
thanks <hi>be made for all men, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 1. which
precept all that have this true Charity of the
heart, will readily conform to. These seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
are so naturally the fruits of this Charity
that it is a deceit for any man to perswade
himself he hath it, who cannot produce these
fruits to evidence it by.</p>
                  <p>But there is yet a farther excellency of this
grace,<note place="margin">It casts out Envy.</note> it guards the mind, and secures it from
several great and dangerous vices; as <hi>first</hi>
from <hi>Envy;</hi> This is by the Apostle taught
us to be the property of Charity, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 4.
Charity envieth not;</hi> And indeed common
reason may confirm this to us, for <hi>envy</hi> is a
sorrow at the prosperity of another, and
therefore must needs be directly contrary to
that desire of it, which we shewed before was
the effect of love; so that if love bear sway
in the heart, 'twill certainly chace out Envy.
How vainly then do those pretend to this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
that are still grudging, and rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ning at
every good hap of others?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It keeps down <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>iness.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pride.</note>
This is also taught us by the Apostle
in the forementioned place, <hi>Charity vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:96830:181"/>
not it self, is not puffed up;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
we find, that where this vertue
of love is commanded, their humility is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it. Thus it is, <hi>Col. 3. 12. Put on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bowels of Mercies, Kindness, Humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of mind,</hi> and <hi>Rom. 12. 10. Be kindly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned
on towards another with brotherly love
in honour preferring one another,</hi> where you see
how close an attendant humility is of love.
Indeed it naturally flowes from it, for love al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
sets a price and value upon the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
makes us esteem and prize it; thus we too
constantly find it in self love, it makes us think
highly of our selves, that we are much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
then other men. Now if love thus plac'd
on our selves, beget pride, let us but divert
the course, and turn this love on our brethren,
and it will as surely beget humility, for then
we should see and value those gifts and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of theirs, which now our pride, or our
hatreds make us to overlook and neglect, and
not think it reasonable either to despise them,
or vaunt and magnifie our selves upon such a
comparison; we should certainly find cause to
put the Apostles exhortation in practice, <hi>Phil.</hi>
2 4 That we should <hi>esteem others better then
our selves.</hi> Whoever therefore is of so h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a temper, as to vilify and disdain others, may
conclude he hath not this charity rooted in his
heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it casts out <hi>censoriousness</hi> and rash
judging charity,<note place="margin">Censorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.
13. 5. Thinketh no evil,</hi> is not apt to entertain
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:96830:181"/>
ill conceits of others, but on the contrary as it
follows, ver. 7. <hi>believeth all thing, hopeth all
things;</hi> that is, it is forward to believe and
hope the best of all men, and surely our own
experience tels us the same, for where we love
we are usually unapt to discern faults, be they
never so gross (witness the great blindness we
generally have towards our own) and therefore
shall certainly not be likely to create them,
where they are not, or to aggravate them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their true size and degree: And then
to what shall we impute those unmerciful cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and rash judgments of others, so frequent
among men, but to the want of this chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It casts out <hi>dissembling</hi> and feigned
kindness;<note place="margin">Dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</note> where this true and reall love is,
that false and counterfeit one flyes from before
it, and this is the love we are commanded to
have, such as is without dissimulation, <hi>Rom.
12.</hi> 9. Indeed where this is rooted in the heart,
there can be no possible use of dissimulation,
because this is in truth all that the false one
would seem to be, and so is as far beyond it,
as nature is beyond art, nay indeed as a devine
vertue is beyond a foul sin, for such is that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical
kindness, and yet tis to be feared that
does too generally usurp the place of this reall
charity, the effects of it are too visible among
us, there being nothing more common then to
see men make large professions to those who as
soon as their back are turned, they either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
or mischief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:96830:182"/>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> it casts out all mercenariness, and
self-seeking,<note place="margin">Self-seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> 'tis of so noble and generous a
temper, that it dispises all projectings for gain
or advantage, love seeketh not her own,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. And therefore that huckstering
kind of love so much used in the world, which
places it self only there, where it may fetch
in benefit, is very far from this charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> It turns out of the heart all malice
and desire of revenge which is so utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it,<note place="margin">Revenge.</note> that it is impossible they should
both dwell in the same brest; 'tis the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of love to <hi>bear all things, 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 7. To
endure the greatest injuries, without thought
of making any other return to them then
prayers and blessings, and therefore the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
revengeful person, is of all others the
greatest stranger to this charity.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true if this vertue were to be exercised
but towards some sort of persons,<note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended even to enemies.</note> it might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with malice to others, it being possible for
a man that bitterly hates one to love another;
but we are to take notice that this charity must
not be so confined, but must extend and stretch
it self to all men in the world, particularly to
enemies, or else it is not that divine charity
commended to us by Christ. The <hi>loving of
friends,</hi> and <hi>benefactors</hi> is so low a pitch that
the very Publicans and sinners, the worst of
men were able to attain to it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 46 And
therefore 'tis not counted rewardable in a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Christ; No, he expects we should
soar higher, and therefore hath set us this more
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:96830:182"/>
spiritual, and excellent precept of loving of
enemies, <hi>Mat. 5. 44. I say unto you, love
your enemies, bless them that curse you, and
pray for them which despitefully use you, and
persecute you,</hi> and whoever does not thus,
will never be owned by him for a disciple. We
are therefore to conclude, that all which hath
been said concerning this Charity of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
must be understood to belong as well to
our spitefullest enemy, as our most obliging
friend. But because this is a duty, to which
the froward nature of man is apt to object
much, 'twill not be amiss to insist a little on
some considerations, which may inforce it on
us.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>first</hi> consider,<note place="margin">Motives thereunto.</note> what hath been already
toucht on, that it is the <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
both in the Text above mentioned,<note place="margin">Command of Christ.</note> and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of others, there being scarce any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
so often repeated in the New Testament,
as this of loving and forgiving of enemies.
Thus <hi>Eph. 4. 32. Be ye kind one to another,
tender hearted, forgiving one another;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>Col. 3. 13. Forbearing one another and
forgiving one another, if any man have a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
against any, even as Christ forgave you,
so also do ye.</hi> So also, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 9. Not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but
contrariwise Blessing.</hi> A whole volume of
Texts might be brought to this purpose, but
these are certainly enough, to convince any
man, that this is strictly required of us by
Christ, and indeed I think, there are few that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:96830:183"/>
ever heard of the Gospel, but know it is so.
The more prodigiously strange is it, that
men that call themselves Christians, should
give no degree of obedience to it, nay, not
onely so, but even publickly avow, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the contrary, as we daily see they do, it
being ordinary to have men resolve, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that they will not forgive such, or such
a man, and no consideration of Christs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
can at all move them from their purpose.
Certainly these men understand not what is
meant by the very word <hi>Christian,</hi> which
signifies a Servant, and Disciple of Christ, and
this Charity is the very badg of the one, the
lesson of the other; and therefore 'tis the
greatest absurdity, and contradiction, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
themselves Christians, and yet at the same
time to resist this so express Command of that
Christ, whom they own as their Master. <hi>If
I be a Master,</hi> saith God, <hi>where is my fear?</hi>
Mal. 1. 6. Obedience and reverence are so
much the duties of Servants, that no man is
thought to look on him as a Master, to whom
he payes them not. <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord,
and do not the things that I say?</hi> saith Christ,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 46. The whole world is divided into
two great Families. <hi>Christs,</hi> and <hi>Satans,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
the obedience each man payes, signifies to
which of these Masters he belongs, if he obey
<hi>Christ,</hi> to <hi>Christ;</hi> if <hi>Satan,</hi> to <hi>Satan.</hi> Now
this sin of malice, and revenge is so much the
dictate of that wicked spirit, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be a more direct obeying of him,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:96830:183"/>
'tis the taking his livery on our backs, the
proclaiming whose servants we are; What
ridiculous impudence is it then, for men that
have thus entred themselves of Satans Family,
to pretend to be the Servants of Christ? Let
such know assuredly, they shall not be owned
by him, but at the great day of accompt, be
turned over to their proper Master, to receive
their wages, in fire and brimstone.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>second</hi> consideration is the example of
God:<note place="margin">Example of God.</note> this is an argument Christ himself
thought fit to use, to impress this duty on us,
as you may see <hi>Luk</hi> 6. 35, 36. where after
having given the Command of <hi>Loving ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
he incourages to the practice of it, by
telling, that it is that which will make us
the <hi>Children of the Highest</hi> (that is, 'twill
give us a likeness and resemblance to him, as
children have to their Parents) <hi>for he is kind
to the unthankful and the evil; And to the
same purpose,</hi> you may read <hi>Mat. 5. 45. He
maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the
good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the
unjust;</hi> And sure this is a most forcible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
to excite us to this duty. God, we
know, is the fountain of perfection, and the
being like to him, is the summe of all we can
wish for; and though it was Lucifers fall, his
ambition to be like the most high, yet had the
likeness he affected been onely that of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Goodness, he might still have been
an Angel of light; This desire of imitating
our Heavenly Father is the especial mark of a
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:96830:184"/>
child of his. Now this kindness and goodness
to enemies is most eminently remarkable in
God, and that not onely in respect of the
temporal mercies, which he indifferently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes
on all, his <hi>sun and rain on the unjust,</hi>
as in the Text forementioned, but chiefly in
his spiritual mercies; We are all by our
wicked works <hi>Col. 1. 21. Enemies to him,</hi>
and the mischief of that enmity would have
fallen wholly upon our selves, God had no
motive besides that of his pity to us, to wish
a reconciliation, yet so farr was he from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
our enmity, when he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
himself to our eternal ruine, that he
designes, and contrives how he may bring us
to be at peace with him. This is a huge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of mercy and kindness, but the means he
used for effecting this, is yet far beyond it;
He <hi>sent his own Son</hi> from Heaven, to work it,
and that not onely by perswasions, but suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
also; So much did he prize us miserable
creatures, that he thought us not too dear
bought with the blood of his Son. The like
example of mercy and patience we have in
Christ both laying down his life for us ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and also in that meek manner of doing
it, which we find excellently set forth by the
Apostle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. 23. 24. and commended
to our imitation. Now surely when all this
is considered, we may well make St. <hi>Johns</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<hi>Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought
also to love one another, 1 Iohn</hi> 4. 11. how
shameful a thing is it for us to retain displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:96830:184"/>
against our brethren, when God thus
layes by his towards us, and that when we have
so highly provoked him?</p>
                  <p>This directs to a third consideration,<note place="margin">The dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God and mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us.</note> the
comparing our sins against God, with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
of our brethren against us, which we no
sooner shall come to do, but there will appear
a vast difference between them, and that in
several respects; For first, there is the majesty
of the person, against whom we sin, which
exceedingly encreases the gilt, whereas between
man and man, there cannot be so great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
for though some men are by God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to such eminency of dignity, as may
make an injury offered to them the greater yet
still they are but men of the same nature with
us, whereas he is <hi>God blessed for ever; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
there is his <hi>soveraignity</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> which
is original in God, for we are his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
we have received our whole being from
him, and therefore are in the deepest manner
bound to perfect obedience, whereas all the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity
that one man can possibly have over
another, is but imparted to them by God, and
for the most part there is none of this neither
in the case, quarrels being most usual among e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> there is his infinite bounty
and goodness to us, all that ever we enjoy,
whether in relation to this life, or a better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wholly his free gift, and so there is the
foulest ingratitude added to our other crimes;
in which respect also 'tis impossible for one
man to offend against another in such a degree,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:96830:185"/>
for though one may be (&amp; too many are) guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of unthankfulness towards men, yet because
the greatest benefits that man can bestow, are
infinitely short of those which God doth, the
ingratitude cannot be neer so great as towards
God it is. <hi>Lastly,</hi> there is the greatness and
multitude of our sins against God, which
do infinitely exceed all that the most injurous
man can do against us, for we all sin much oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and more hainously against him then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man, be he never so malicious, can find op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
is of injuring his brethren This ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
and disproportion our Saviour inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
in the parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. where our
offences against God are noted by the ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
talents, whereas our brethrens against us
are described by the hundred pence, a talent
hugely out-weighs a penny, and ten thousand
out numbers a hundred, yet so and much more
does the weight and number of our sins exceed
all the offences of others against us: Much
more might be said to shew the vast inequality
between the faults which God forgives us, and
those we can possibly have to forgive our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
But this I suppose may suffice to silence
all the objections of cruel and revengeful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
against this kindness to enemies. They
are apt to look upon it as an absur'd and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
thing, but since God himself acts it in
so much a higher degree, who can without blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
say 'tis unreasonable? If this, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
spiritual duty appear so to us, we may
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>earn the reason from the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 14.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:96830:185"/>
The carnal man receiveth not the things of the
Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him;</hi>
'tis the carnality and fleshliness of our hearts,
that makes it seem so, and therefore in stead
of disputing against the duty, let us purge our
hearts of that, and then we shall find that true
which the spiritual Wisdom affirms of her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
<hi>Pro. 8. 9. They are all plain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to him
that understandeth, and right to them that find
knowledg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, this loving of enemies is not only a
reasonable,<note place="margin">Pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Duty.</note> but a pleasant duty, and that I pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose
as a fourth consideration; there is a great
deal of sweetness and delight to be found in
it; of this I confess none can so well judge as
those that have practised it, the nature even of
earthly pleasures being such, that 'tis the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
only that can make a man truly know
them: No man can so describe the taste of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
delicious thing to another, as that by it he
shall know the relish of it, he must first actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
taste of it, and sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 'tis more so in spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
pleasures, and therefore he that would ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know the sweetness and pleasantness of this
duty, let him set to the practice and then his
own experience will be the best informer: But
in the mean time, how very unjust, yea, and
foolish is it, to pronounce ill of it before tryal:
for men to say this is irksome, and intolerable,
who never so much as once offered to trie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed it were so or no? Yet by this very
means an ill opinion is brought up of this most
delightful duty, and passes currant among men,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:96830:186"/>
whereas in all justice the testimony of it should
be taken only from those who have tryed it,
and they would certainly give another account
of it.</p>
                  <p>But though the full knowledg hereof be to
be had onely by his neerer acquaintance,<note place="margin">Compared with the painfulness of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</note> yet
methinks even those who look at it but at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
may discern somewhat of amiableness
in it, if no other way, yet at least by compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with the uneasiness of its contrary, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and revenge are the most wrestlesse, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
passions that can possesse the mind of
a man, they keep men in perpetual study and
care how to effect their mischievous purposes,
it disturbs their very sleep, as <hi>Solomon</hi> observes
<hi>Pro. 4. 16. They sleep not except they have
done mischief, and their sleep is taken away,
except they cause some to fall:</hi> Yea, it imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
all the good things they enjoy, so that they
have no taste or relish of them; a remarkable
example of this we have in <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>man,</hi> who
though he abounded in all the greatnesse and
felicity of the world, yet the malice he had to
a poor despisable man <hi>Mordecai,</hi> kept him
from tasting contentment in all this, as you may
see, <hi>Esther</hi> 5. where after he had related to
his friends all his prosperities, ver. 11 he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
thus, ver. 12. <hi>Yet all this availeth me
nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Iew sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the Kings gate.</hi> On the other side, the
peaceable spir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, that can quietly passe by all
injuries and affronts, enjoyes a continual calm,
and is above the malice of his enemies, for let
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:96830:186"/>
them do what they can, they cannot rob him
of his quiet, he is firm as a rock, which no
stormes or windes can move, when the furious
and revengeful man is like a wave which the
least blast tosses and tumbles from its place.
But besides this inward disquiet of revengeful
men, they often bring many outward calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
upon themselves, they exasperate their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
and provoke them to do them greater
mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>chiefs, nay oftentimes they willingly run
themselvs upon the greatest miseries in pursuit
of their revenge, to which 'tis ordinary to see
men sacrifice <hi>Goods, Ease, Credit, Life,</hi> nay
<hi>soul</hi> it self, not caring what they suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so they may spite their enemy; so
strangly does this wretched humour besott and
blind men. On the contrary, the meek per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he often melts his adversary, pacifies his
anger; A <hi>soft answer turns away wrath,</hi> saith
<hi>Solomon, Pro.</hi> 15. 1. And sure there is nothing
can tend more to that end: but if it do hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
that his enemy be so inhumane, that he
misse of doing that, yet he is still a gainer by
all he can suffer. For first, he gains an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of exercising that most Christian grace
of charity and forgivenesse; and so at once of
obeying the command and imitating the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of his Saviour, which is to a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
spirit a most valuable advantage; and
then secondly, he gains an accession and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
to his reward hereafter. And if it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that that is not to be reckoned in to the
present pleasure of the duty: I answer, that the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:96830:187"/>
expectation and belief of it is, and that alone
is a delight infinitely more ravishing then the
present enjoyment of all sensual pleasures can
be.</p>
                  <p>The fourth consideration is,<note place="margin">If we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give not. God will not forgive us.</note> the danger of
not performing this duty; of which I might
reckon up divers, but I shall insist only on
that great one, which contains in it all the rest,
and that is the forfeiting of our own pardons
from God, the having our sins against him
kept still on his score, and not forgiven. This
is a consideration, that methinks should afright
us into good nature; if it do not, our malice
is greater to our selves then to our enemies.
For alas! what hurt is it possible for thee to
do to another, which can bear any compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with that thou doest thy self, in loosing
the pardon of thy sins? which is so unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a mischief, that the Divel himself with all
his malice cannot wish a greater, 'tis all he
aimes at, <hi>first,</hi> that we may sin, and then that
those sins may never be pardoned, for then he
knows he has us sure enough, Hell, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
being certainly the portion of every
unpardoned sinner, besides all other effects
of Gods wrath in this life; consider this, and
then tell me what thou hast got by the highest
revenge, thou ever actedst upon another.
'Tis a devilish phrase in the mouth of men,
that revenge is sweet: But is it possible there
can be (even to the most distemper'd palate)
any such sweetnesse in it, as may recompence
that everlasting bitternesse that attends it?
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:96830:187"/>
'Tis certain, no man in his wits can upon sober
judging, imagine there is. But alas! we give
not our selves time to weigh things, but suffer
our selves to be hurryed away with the heat
of an angry humour, never considering how
dear we must pay for it; like the silly Bee, that
in anger leaves at once her sting and her life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
her, the sting may perhaps give some
short pain to the flesh it sticks in, but yet there
is none but discerns the Bee has the worst of it,
that payes her life for so poor a revenge; so
it is in the greatest acts of our malice, we may
perhaps leave our stings in others, put them to
some present trouble, but that compared with
the hurt redounds to our selves by it, is no
more then that inconsiderable pain is to death.
Nay not so much, because the mischiefs, that
we bring upon our selves are eternal, to which
no finite thing can bear any proportion. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
then, whensoever thou art contriving,
and plotting a revenge, that thou quite mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakest
the mark thou thinkest to hit thy enemy,
and las! thou woundest thy self to death. And
let no man speak peace to himself, or think
that these are vain terrors, and that he may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
pardon from God, though he give none
to his brethren. For he that is truth it self
has assured us the contrary, <hi>Mat. 6. 15. If
ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will
your father forgive your trespasses.</hi> And
least we should forget the necessity of this
duty, he has inserted it into our daily Prayers,
where we make it the condition, on which we
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:96830:188"/>
beg pardon from God; <hi>Forgive us our tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
as we forgive them that trespass against
us.</hi> What a heavy curse then does every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful
person lay upon himself, when he
sayes this Prayer, he does in effect beg God
not to forgive him; and 'tis too sure that part
of his Prayer will be heard, he shall be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
just as he forgives, that is not at all. This
is yet farther set out to us in the parable of
the Lord, and the servant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
had obtained of his Lord the forgivenesse
of a vast debt, ten thousand talents, yet was
so cruel to his fellow servant, as to exact a
poor triflng summ of an hundred pence, upon
which his Lord recals his former forgiveness,
and charges him again with the whole debt, and
this Christ applies to our present purpose, ver.
35. <hi>So likewise shall my heavenly father do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, if ye from your hearts forgive not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man his brother their trespasses.</hi> One such act
of uncharitablenesse is able to forfeit us the
pardon God hath granted us, and then all our
sins return again upon us, and sink us to utter
ruine. I suppose it needlesse to heap up more
Testimonies of Scripture, for the truth of this,
these are so cleere, as may surely serve to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
any man, that acknowledg Scripture, of
the great and fearful danger of this sin of uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness.
The <hi>Lord possess all our hearts with
such a just sense of it as may make us avoid it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Last consideration I shall mention, is
that of gratitude,<note place="margin">Gratitude to God.</note> God has shewed wonderful
mercies to us, Christ has suffered heavy things
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:96830:188"/>
to bring us into a capacity of that mercy and
pardon from God: And shall we not then think
our selvs obliged to some returns of thanfulness?
If we will take the Apostles judgment he tels
us, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 15. That since Christ dyed for us
all, 'tis but reasonable that we should not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
live unto our selves, but unto him that dyed
for us.</hi> Indeed were every moment of our life <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated</hi>
to his immediate service, 'twere no
more then common gratitude requires, and far
less, then such inestimable benefits deserve; what
a shameful unthankfulnesse is it then, to deny
him so poor a satisfaction as this, the forgiving
our brethren? suppose a man that were ransom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
either from death or slavery, by the bounty
&amp; sufferings of another, should upon his release
be charged by him, that so freed him in return
of that kindnesse of his, to forgive some slight
debt, which was owing him by some third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
would you not think him the unthankfullest
wretch in the world, that should refuse this to
so great a benefactor? yet such a wretch, &amp; much
worse is every revengeful person: Christ hath
bought us out of eternal slavery, and that not
with <hi>corruptible things, as silver and gold,
1 Pet. 1. 8. But with his own most precious blood,</hi>
and hath earnestly recommended to us the love
of our brethren, and that with the most moving
arguments drawn from the greatnesse of his
love to us; and if we shall obstinately refuse
him in so just, so moderate a demand, how
unspeakable a vilenesse is it? and yet this we do
downright, if we keep any malice or grudg
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:96830:189"/>
to any person whatsoever. Nay, farther this
is not barely an unthanfulness, but there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
joyned with it a horrible contempt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising
of him. This Peace and unity of brethren
was a thing so much prized and valued by him,
that when he was to leave the world, he
thought it the most precious thing he could
bequeath, and therefore left it by way of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy
to his Disciples, <hi>Jo. 14. 27. Peace I leave
with you;</hi> we use to set a great value on the
slightest bequests of our dead friends, to be
exceeding careful not to lose them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we wilfully bangle away this so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Legacy of Christ, 'tis a plain sign we want
that love and esteem of him, which we have
of our earthly friends, and that we despise
him as well as his Legacy. The great prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this sin of uncharitablenesse has made

                        </gap>ing of ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to be supprest.</note> 'Tis oftentimes the frustrating of

and 'tis much oftner so in spiritual, therefore
if it be possible, let these and the like conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
be so constantly and habitually fixt in
thy heart, that they may frame it to such meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as may prevent all risings of rancour or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
in thee, for it is much better they should
serve as armour to prevent, then as balsome to

cure the wound. But if this passion be not
yet so subdued in thee, but that there will be
some stirrings of it, yet then be sure to take

this is a time, and season of tryal to thee,
wherein thou mayest shew how thou hast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
in Christs School, there now being an
opportunity offered thee either of obeying
and pleasing God, by passing by this offence
of thy brother, or else of obeying and please<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Satan, that lover of discord, by nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hatred against him. Remember this, I
say, betimes, before thou be inflamed, for
if this fire be throughly kindled, it will cast
such a smoak, as will blind thy reason, and
make thee unfit to judge even in this so very
plain case, whether it be bettet by obeying
God, to purchase to thy self eternally bliss,
or by obeying Satan, eternal torments.
Whereas as if thou put the question to thy self
before this commotion, and disturbance of
mind, 'tis impossible but thy understanding
must pronounce for God; And then unless
thy will be so perverse that thou wilt delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
choose death, thou wilt surely practice
according to that sentence of thy understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
I shall add no more on this first part of
Charity, that of the Affections.</p>
                  <p>I prooceed now to that of the <hi>Actions;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Charity in the Actions</note>
And this indeed is it, whereby the former
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:96830:190"/>
must be approved, we may pretend great cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
within, but if none break forth in the
Actions, we may say of that love, as Saint
<hi>James</hi> does of the Faith he speaks of, that it
is <hi>dead,</hi> Jam. 2. 20. It is the loving indeed,
that must <hi>approve our hearts before God,</hi> 1 Jo.
3. 18. Now this love in the Actions may
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>kewise fitly be distributed, as the former
was, in relation to the four distinct capacities
of our brethren, their <hi>Souls,</hi> their <hi>Bodies,</hi>
their <hi>Goods,</hi> and <hi>Credit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Soul I formerly told you may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
either in a natural or spiritual sense,<note place="margin">Towards the mind of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> and
in both of them Charity binds us to do all the
good we can. As the Soul signifies the mind
of a man, so we are to endeavour the comfort
and refreshment of our brethren, desire to
give them all true cause of joy, &amp; cheerfulness,
especially when we see any under any sadness
or heaviness, then to bring out all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials
we can procure, that is, to labour by all
Christian and fit means to chear the troubled
spirits of our brethren, to <hi>comfort them that
are in any heaviness,</hi> as the Apostle speaks,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Soul</hi> in the spiritual sense is y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t of
greater concernment,<note place="margin">His Soul.</note> and the securing of
that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a matter of much greater moment,
then the refreshing of the mind onely, in as
much as the eternal sorrwes and sadnesses of
Hell exceed the deepest sorrowes of this life;
and therefore though we must not omit the
former, yet on this we are to imploy our most
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:96830:190"/>
zealous charities; Wherein we are not to
content our selves with a bare wishing well to
the Souls of our brethren, this alone is a slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish
sort of kindness, unworthy of those who
are to imitate the great Redeemer of Souls,
who did and suffered so much in that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase:
No, we must add also our endeavour
to make them what we wish them. To this
purpose 'twere very reasonable to propound
to our selves in all our conversings with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that one great design of doing some
good to their Souls. If this purpose were fixt
in our minds, we should then discern perhaps
many opportunities, which now we overlook,
of doing something towards it. The brutish
ignorance of one would call upon thee to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
his instruction; the open vile of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to reprehend &amp; admonish him; the faint
and weak vertue of another, to confirme and
incourage him. Every spiritual want of thy
brother may give thee some occasion of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
some part of this Charity, or if the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
be such, that upon sober judging,
thou think it vain to attempt any thing thy
self, as if either thy meanness, or thy unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedness,
or any the like impediment, be
like to render thy exhortations fruitless, yet
if thou art industrious in thy Charity, thou
mayest probably find out some other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
by whom to do it more success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
There cannot be a nobler study, then
how to benefit mens Souls, and therefore
where the direct means are improper, 'tis fit
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:96830:191"/>
we should whet our wits for attaining of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Indeed 'tis a shame, we should not
as industriously contrive for this great spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
concernment of others, as we do for
every worldly trifling interests of our own;
yet in them we are unwearied, and trye one
means after another, till we compass our end.
But if after all our serious endeavours, the
obstinacy of men do not suffer us, or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
rather, to reap any fruit from them, if
all our wooings and intreatings of men to
have mercy on their own Souls, will not work
on them, yet be sure to continue still to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
by thy example; Let thy great care
and tenderness of thy own Soul preach to them
the value of theirs, and give not over thy
compassions to them, but with the Prophet
<hi>Jer. 13. 17. Let thy Soul weep in secret for
them;</hi> and with the Psalmist, <hi>Let rivers of
waters run down thy eyes, because they keep not
Gods Law,</hi> Psal. 119. 136. Yea, with Christ
himself, weep over them, who will <hi>not know
the things that belong to their peace,</hi> Luk. 19. 42.
And when no importunities with them will
work, yet even then cease not to importune
God for them, that he will draw them to
himself. Thus we see <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he could
not disswade the people from that sinful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
they were upon, yet he professes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
that he will not cease praying
for them; nay, he lookt on it as so much a
duty, that it would be sin in him to omit it,
<hi>God forbid,</hi> sayes he, <hi>that I should sin against
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:96830:191"/>
the Lord in ceasing to pray for you, 1 Sam. 12.
23.</hi> Nor shall we need to fear that our
prayers shall be quite lost, for if they prevail
not for those for whom we pour them out,
yet however they will return into our <hi>own
bosomes,</hi> Psal. 35. 13. we shall be sure not to
miss of the reward of that Charity.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>second</hi> place,<note place="margin">Charity in respect of the Body.</note> we are to exercise this
Active Charity towards the bodies of our
Neighbours; we are not onely to compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
their pains, and miseries, but also to do
what we can for their ease and relief. The
good Samaritan <hi>Luke</hi> 10. had never been
proposed as our pattern, had he not as well
helped as pitied the wounded man. 'Tis not
good wishes, no nor good words neither that
avail in such cases, as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>If a
brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily
food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in
peace, be ye warmed and filled, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ye give him not those things that are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the body, what doth it profit?</hi> Jam. 2.
15. 16. No sure, it profits them nothing,
in respect of their bodies, and it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
thee as little in respect of thy Soul, it
will never be reckoned to thee as a Charity.
This releeving of the bodily wants of our
brethren, is a thing so strictly required of us,
that we find it set down <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special
thing we shall be tried by at the Last
Day, on the omission whereof is grounded
that dreadful sentence, ver. 41. <hi>Depart from
me ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:96830:192"/>
for the Divel and his Angels.</hi> And if it shall
now be asked, what are the particular acts of
this kind which we are to perform? I think we
cannot better inform our selves for the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and ordinary ones, then from this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
where are set down these severals, <hi>the
giving meat to the hungry, and drink to the
thirsty, harbouring the stranger, clothing the
naked, and visiting the sick, and imprisoned:</hi>
By which visiting is meant, not a bare coming
to see them, but so coming as to comfort and
relieve them; for otherwise 'twill be but like the
Levite in the Gospel, <hi>Lu.</hi> 10. who came and
looked on the wounded man, but did no more,
which will never be accepted by God. These
are common and ordinary exercises of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
for which we cannot want frequent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities.
But besides these, there may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by Gods especial providence fall into our
hands, occasions of doing other good offices
to the bodies of our neighbours; we may
sometimes find a wounded man, with the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan.</hi>
and then 'tis our duty to do as he did; we
may sometimes find an innocent person con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to death, as <hi>Susanna</hi> was, and then
are with <hi>Daniel</hi> to use all possible endeavour
for their deliverances: This case <hi>Solomon</hi>
seems to refer to, <hi>Prov. 24. 10. If thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to deliver him that it drawn unto death,
and them that are ready to be slain, if thou sayst
behold we know it not; doth not he that ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the heart, consider? and he that keepeth thy
soul, doth not he know it? shall not he render
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:96830:192"/>
to every man according to his deeds;</hi> we are
not lightly to put off the matter with vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses,
but to remember that God, who knows
our most secret thoughts, will severely examine,
whether we have willingly omitted the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of such a charity: sometimes again (nay
God knowes, often now a dayes) we may see
a man that by a course of intemperance is in
danger to destroy his health, to shorten his
dayes, and then it is a due charity not only to
the soul, but to the body also, to endeavour to
draw him from it. It is impossible to set down
all the possible acts of this corporal charity,
because there may sometimes happen such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
as none can foresee; we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alwayes to carry about us a serious resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of doing whatever good of this kind we
shall at any time discern occasion for, and then
whenever that occasion is offered, we are to
look on it as a call, as it were from heaven, to
put that resolution in practice. This part of
charity seems to be so much implanted in our
natures, as we are men, that we generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
them not only unchristian, but inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
that are void of it, and therefore I
hope there will not need much perswasion to it,
since our very nature inclines us; but certainly
that very consideration will serve hugely to
encrease the guilt of those that are wanting in
it. For since this command is so agreeable even
to flesh and blood, our disobedience to it can
proceed of nothing, but a stubbornesse and
resistance against God who gives it.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>§ 1: THE <hi>third</hi> way of expressing
this <hi>Charity</hi> is towards the<note place="margin">Charity in respect of the Goods.</note>
                     <hi>goods</hi> or estate of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
we are to endeavour
his thriving and prosperity in these outward
good things; and to that end, be willing to
assist and farther him in all honest wayes of
improving or preserving them, by any neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly
and friendly office. Opportunities of
this do many times fall out: A man may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by his power or perswasion deliver his
neighbours goods out of the hands of a thief,
or oppressor; sometimes again by his advice
and counsel, he may set him in a way of thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or turn him from some ruinous course;
and many other occasions there may be of
doing good turns to another, without any loss
or damage to our selves,<note place="margin">Towards the rich.</note> and then we are to
do them, even to our rich neighbours, those
that are as wealthy (perhaps much more so)
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:96830:193"/>
as our selves; for though <hi>Charity</hi> do not bind
us to give to those that want it lesse then our
selves, yet whenever we can further their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
without lessning our own store, it requires
it of us: Nay, if the damage be but light to
us, in comparison of the advantage to him,
it will become us rather to hazard that light
damage, then lose him that greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p>2. But towards our <hi>poor</hi> brother,<note place="margin">Towards the poor.</note> Charity
tyes us to much more; we are there only to
consider the supplying of his wants, and not
to stick at parting with what is our own, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him, but as far as we are able give freely
what is necessary to him. This duty of Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
is perfectly necessary for the approving
our love not only to men, but even to God
himself, as St <hi>John</hi> tels us, 1 <hi>Jo. 3. 17. Who
so hath this worlds goods, and seeth his brother
have need, and shutteth up his bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
from him, how dwelleth the love of God
in him?</hi> 'Tis vain for him to pretend to love
either God or man, who loves his money so
much better, that he will see his poor brother
(who is man, and bears the image of God)
suffer all extremities, rather then part with any
thing to relieve him: On the other side, the
performance of this duty is highly acceptable
with God, as well as with men.</p>
                  <p>3. 'Tis called, <hi>Heb 13. 16. A sacrifice
wherewith God is well pleased;</hi> and again, <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.
4.</hi> 18. St <hi>Paul</hi> cals their almes to him, <hi>a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
acceptable, wel-pleasing to God,</hi> and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:96830:194"/>
the Church hath alwayes look't on it as such;
and therefore joyned it with the solemnest
part of worship, the holy Sacrament. But
because even sacrifices themselves under the
Law, were often made unacceptable by being
maimed and blemished, it will here be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to enquire, what are the due qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>4. Of these there are some that respect the
motive,<note place="margin">Motives of Alms-giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> some the manner of our giving. The
motive may be three fold, respecting God,
our neighbour, and our selves. That which
respects God is obedience, and thankfulnesse
to him: He has commanded we should give
alms, and therefore one special end of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so, must be the obeying that precept of
his. And it is from his bounty alone that we
receive all our plenty, and this is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
way of expressing our thankfulnesse for it;
for as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith. <hi>our goods extend not
unto God, Psal.</hi> 16. 2. That tribute which we
desire to pay out of our estates, we cannot
pay to his person. 'Tis the poor, that are
as it were his Proxey and receivers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatever we should by way of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
give back again unto God, our alms is
the way of doing it: <hi>Secondly,</hi> in respect of
our neighbour, the motive must be a true love,
and compassion to him, a tender fellow-feeling
of his wants, and desire of his comfort and
relief: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in respect of our selves,
the motive is to be the hope of that eternal
reward, promised to this performance. This
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:96830:194"/>
Christ points out to us, when he bid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> us <hi>lay
up our treasure in heaven, Mat</hi> 6. 20. And
<hi>to make us friends of the Mammon of unright<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
that they may receive us into everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
habitations, Lu.</hi> 16. 9. That is by a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
dispencing of our temporal goods to
the poor, to lay up a stock in heaven, to gain
a title to those endlesse felicities, which God
hath promised to the charitable That is the
harvest we must expect of what we sow in these
works of mercy, which will be so rich as would
abundantly recompence us, though we should,
as the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 3. Bestow all
our goods to feed the poor:</hi> But then we must
be sure that we make this our sole aim, and
not in stead of this propose to our selves the
praise of men, as the motive of our charity,
for that will rob us of the other; this is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told us by Christ, <hi>Mat. 6. They that set
their hearts on the credit,</hi> they shall gain with
men, must take that as their portion, ver. 3.
<hi>verily I say unto you, they have their reward;</hi>
they chose, it seemes rather to have men their
Pay-masters, then God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to them they are
turn'd off, that little ayery praise they get
from them, is all the reward they must expect:
<hi>Ye have no reward of my father which is in

                        </gap>en,</hi> ver. 1. we have therefore need to
watch our hearts narrowly, that this desire of
vain-glory steal not in and befoole us into that
miserable exchange of a vain blast of mens
breath for those substantial and eternal joyes
of heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="362" facs="tcp:96830:195"/>
5. In the <hi>second</hi> place we must take care of
our <hi>alms-giving,</hi> in respect of the manner;<note place="margin">Manner of Alms giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>
and in that, <hi>first,</hi> we must give cheerfully; men
usually value a small thing,<note place="margin">Cheerfully.</note> that is given cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and with a good heart, more then a
much greater, that is wrung from a man with
grudging and unwillingnesse; and God is of the
same mind, he <hi>loves a cheerful giver, 2 Cor.
9.</hi> 7. Which the Apostle makes the reason of
the foregoing exhortation, of not <hi>giving
grudgingly, or as of necessity,</hi> ver. 6. And
sure 'tis no unreasonable thing, that is herein
required of us, there being no duty that has
to humane nature, more of pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
unlesse it be where covetousnesse or
cruelty have quite work't out the man, and put
a ravenous beast in his stead. Is it not a most
ravishing pleasure to him that hath any bowels
to see the joy, that a seasonable alms brings to
a poor wretch? how it revives and puts new
spirits in him, that was even sinking? certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the most sensual creature alive knows not
how to bestow his money on any thing, that
shall bring him in so great a delight, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me thinks it should be no hard matter to
give not only without grudging, but even with
a great deal of alacrity and cheerfulnesse, it
being the fetching in of pleasure to our
selves.</p>
                  <p>6. There is but one objection can be made
against this,<note place="margin">The fear of impoverish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves by it vain and impious.</note> and that is, that the danger of
impove ishing ones self by what one gives, may
take off that pleasure, and make men either
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:96830:195"/>
not give at all, or not so cheerfully. To this
I answer: That <hi>first</hi> were this hazard never so
apparent, yet it being the comma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d of God,
that we shall thus give, we are yet to obey
cheerfully, and be as well content to part with
our goods in pursuance of this duty, as we
are many times called to do upon some other.
In which case <hi>Christ tels us, he that forsakes
not all that he hath, cannot be his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. But <hi>secondly,</hi> this is sure a vain suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
God having particularly promised,
the contrary to the charitable, that it shall
bring blessings on them, even in these outward
things. <hi>The liberal soul shall be made fat, and
he that watereth shall be watered also himself,</hi>
Prov. 11. 25. <hi>He that giveth to the poor shall
not lack, Prov.</hi> 28. 27. And many the like
texts there are, so that one may truly say,
this objection is grounded in direct unbelief.
The short of it is, we dare not trust God for
this: giving to the poor is directly the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our wealth into his hands <hi>He that giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the poor lendeth unto the Lord, Pro. 19.
17.</hi> And that too on solemn promise of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment,
as it followes in that verse, <hi>that
which he hath given will he pay him again.</hi> It is
amongst men thought a great disparagement,
when we refuse to trust them; it shews we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
think them not sufficient, or not honest:
How vile an affront is it then to God thus
to distrust him? nay indeed how horrid blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
to doubt the security of that, for which
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:96830:196"/>
he has thus expresly past his word, who is Lord
of all, and therefore cannot be insufficient, and
who is the God of truth, and therefore will
not fail to make good his promise? Let not
then that infidel fear of future want, contract
and shut up thy bowels from thy poor bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for though he be never likely to pay
thee, yet God becomes his surety and enters
bond with him, and will most assuredly pay
thee with encrease. Therefore 'tis so far from
being damage to thee, thus to give, that it is
thy great advantage: Any man would rather
chuse to put his money into some sure hand,
where he may both improve, and be certain of
it at his need, then to let it lye unprofitably by

or other accident, by which he may probably
loose it: Now alas! all that we possesse is in
minutely <hi>danger of loosing;</hi> innumerable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
there are, which may in an instant bring
a rich man to beggery; he that doubts this,
let him but read the story of <hi>Job,</hi> and he will
there find an example of it: And therefore
what so prudent course can we take for our
wealth as to put it out of the reach of those
accidents, by thus lending it to God, where we
may be sure to find it ready at our greatest
need, and that too with improvement and
encrease; in which respect it is that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
compares alms to seed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 10. We
know 'tis the nature of seed that is sown, to
multiply and encrease and so does all our acts
of mercy, they return not single and naked to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:96830:196"/>
us, but bring in their sheaves with them, a most
plenteous and bountiful harvest. God deals not
with our alms, as we too often do with his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
wrap them <hi>up in a napkin,</hi> so that they shall
never bring in any advantage to us, but makes
us most rich returns: and therefore we have all
reason most cheerfully, yea, joyfully to set to
this duty, which we have such invitations to,
as well in respect of our own interests, as our
neighbours needs.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Give seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably.</note> We must <hi>give seasonably:</hi> 'tis
true indeed there are some so poor, that an
Almes can never come unseasonably, because
they alwayes want, yet even to them there
may be some special seasons of doing it, to
their greater advantage; for sometimes an
Almes may not onely deliver a poor man from
some present extremity, but by the right time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, may set him in some way of a more
comfortable subsistance afterward. And for the
most, I presume 'tis a good Rule, to dispense
what we intend to any, as soon as may be, for
delays are hurtful oftentimes both to them and
our selves; <hi>first,</hi> as to them, 'tis sure, the longer
we delay, the longer they groan under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
want,<note place="margin">Of cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y.</note> and after we have designed them a
relief, 'tis in some degree to defer injoying of it,
for so long we prolong their sufferings; you wil
think him a hard hearted Phisician, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a certain cure for a man in pain, should
when he might presently apply it, make unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
delayes, and so keep the poor man still
in torture: and the same it is here; we want
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:96830:197"/>
of the due compassion, if we can be content
our poor brother should have one hour of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
suffering, when we have present op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of relieving him, or if he be in such
an extremity of want, yet whatever we intend
him for his greater comfort, he loses so much
of it, as the time of the delay amounts to:
<hi>Secondly,</hi> in respect of our selves; tis ill to
defer, for thereby we give advantage to the
temptations either of <hi>Satan</hi> or our own co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
humour, to disswade us from it. Thus
it fares too often with many Christian duties;
for want of a speedy execution, our purposes
coole, and never come to act; so many resolve
they will repent, but because they set not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
upon it one delay succeeds another,
and keeps them from ever doing it at all: and
so 'tis very apt to fall out in this case, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with men, who are of a covetous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and therefore they of all others should
not trust themselves thus to delay.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>

                     </gap>e
give at all adventures to all that seem to want,
we may sometimes give more to those, whose
sloth and lewdnesse is the cause of their wan
then to those who best deserve it, and so both
encourage the one in their idlenesse, and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our selves from giving to the other. Yet
I doubt not such may be the present wants e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:96830:197"/>
of the most unworthy, that we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, but where no such pressing need
is, we shall do best to chuse out the fitter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of charity, such are those who either
are not able to labour, or else have a greater
charge then their labour can maintain, and to
those our alms should be given also in such a
manner as may be most likely to do them good,
the manner of which may differ according to
the circumstances of their condition; it may
to some be best perhaps, to give them by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little, to others the giving it all at once,
may tend more to their benefit; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time;
a seasonable loan may do as well as a
gift, and that may be in the power sometimes
of those who are not able to give but little:
But when we thus lend on charity, we must
lend freely without use, and also with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that if he should prove unable to pay,
we will forgive so much of the principal, as
his needs require, and our abilities will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
They want much of this charity, who
clap up poor debtors in prison, when they
know they have nothing to answer the debt,
which is a great cruelty to make another mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
when nothing is gained to our selves
by it.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Liberally.</note> We should give <hi>liberally,</hi> we
must not be strait handed in our alms, and give
by such pitiful scantlings, as will bring almost
no relief to the receiver, for that is a kind of
mockery; 'tis as if one should pretend to feed
one that is almost famisht by giving him a
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:96830:198"/>
crumb of bread, such doles as that would be
most ridiculous, yet I fear 'tis too neer the
proportion of some mens almes; such men
are below those Disciples we read of, who
knew only the Baptism of <hi>John,</hi> for 'tis to be
observed, that <hi>John Baptist,</hi> who was but the
fore-runner of Christ, makes it a special part
of his Doctrine, that he <hi>that hath two coats
should impart to him that hath none, Luk.</hi> 3. 11.
He sayes not he that hath some great Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe,
but even he that hath <hi>but two coats</hi> must
part with one of them; from whence we may
gather that whatsoever is above (not our vanity
but) our need should thus be disposed of, when
our brethrens necessity requires it. But if we
look into the first time of the Gospel, we shall
find Christianity far exceeded this proportion
of <hi>Johns,</hi> the converts assigned not a part
only, but frankly gave all to the use of the
brethren, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. and though that being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an extraordinary occasion, will be no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
for our constant practice yet it may shew
us how prime and fundamental part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

this of charity is, that at the very

of it were practised; and if we farther co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what precepts of love are given us in the
Gospel, even to the <hi>laying down our lives for

precious then our l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ves that he would command
us to be prodigal of the one, and yet allow us
to be sparing of the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="369" facs="tcp:96830:198"/>
11. A multitude of Arguments might be
brought to recommend this bounty to all
that profess Christ; I shall mention onely
two, which I find used by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> on this occasion. The <hi>first</hi> is the
example of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 9. For ye know
the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, who though
he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor,
that ye through his poverty might be rich.</hi>
Christ emptyed himself of all that glory and
greatness, he injoied in Heaven with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and submitted himself to a life of much
meanness, and poverty, onely to enrich us.
And therefore for shame, let us not grudge to
empty our Coffers, to lessen somewhat of our
heaps, to relieve his poor members. The <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
is, the expectation of reward, which will
be more or less, according to the degrees of
our Almes, 2 <hi>Cor. 9. 6. He that soweth spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly
shall reap sparingly, and he that soweth
bountifully shall reap bountifully.</hi> We think
him a very improvident husband-man, that
to save a little seed at present, sowes so thin,
as to spoil his crop; and the same folly 'twill
be in us, if by the sparingness of our Almes,
we make our selves a lank harvest hereafter,
lose either all, or a great part of those rewards,
which God hath provided for the liberal Alms-Giver.
What is the proportion which may be
called a liberal giving, I shall not undertake to
set down, there being degrees even in liberality,
one may give liberally, and yet another give
more liberally then he; besides, liberality is to
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:96830:199"/>
be measured, not so much by what is given,
as by the ability of the giver; A man of a
mean estate may give less then one of a great,
and yet be the more liberal person, because
that little may be more out of his, then the
greater is out of the others. Thus we see
Christ pronounces the poor widow to <hi>have
given more to the Treasury, then all the
rich men,</hi> Luk. 21. 3. not that her <hi>two mites</hi>
were more then their <hi>rich</hi> gifts, but that it
was more for her, she having left nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
whereas they gave out of their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
what they might easily spare. Every
man must herein judge for himself; we see
the Apostle, though he earnestly press the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> to bounty, yet prescribes not to
them how much they shall give, but leaves
that to their own brests, 2 <hi>Cor. 9. 7. Every
man according as he purposeth in his heart, so
let him give.</hi> But let us still remember, that
the more we give (provided we do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
fail in the support of those, that most
immediately depend on us) the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it will be to God, and the more reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by him. And to secure the performance
of the duty of Almes-giving (whatever the
proportion be) we may do very well to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the advice St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
in this matter, 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 2. Vpon the first
day of the week let every one of you lay by him
in store as God hath prospered him;</hi> If men
would do thus, lay by somewhat weekly in
store for this works of Charity, it were the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:96830:199"/>
surest way not to be unprovided of somewhat
to give, when an occasion offered it self, and
by giving so by little and little, the expence
would become less sensible, and so be a means
to prevent those grudgings, and repinings,
which are apt to attend men in greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursments;
And sure this were in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
also a very proper course, for when a
trades-man casts up his weekly account, and
sees what his gains have been, 'tis of all others
the most seasonable time to offer this tribute
to God out of what he hath by his blessing
gained; If any will say they cannot so well
weekly reckon their gains, as by longer spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of time, I shall not contend with them for
that precise time, let it be done monthly, or
quarterly, so it be done; But that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
should still be laid by in bank for these
uses, rather then left loose to our sudden Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
is sure very expedient, and I doubt not,
whoever will make trial of it, will upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
acknowledge it to be so.</p>
                  <p>12. The <hi>fourth</hi> exercise of our <hi>Charity</hi> is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the credit of our Neighbour:<note place="margin">Charity in respect of the Credit.</note> and of
this we may have many occasions; sometimes
towards the innocent, and sometimes also
towards the guilty. If one whom we know
to be an innocent person be slandered, and
traduced, Charity binds us to do what we
may for the declaring his innocency, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
him from that false imputation, and
that not onely by witnessing when we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to it, but by a voluntary offering our te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:96830:200"/>
on his behalf, or if the accusation be
not before a Court of Justice, and so there
be no place for that our more solemn testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but that it be onely a slander tost from
one to another, yet even there we are to do
what we can to cleer him, by taking all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
publickly to declare, what we know of
his innocency. But even to the guilty there
is some Charity of this kind to be performed,
sometimes by concealing the fault, if it be
such that no other part of Charity to others
make it necessary to discover, or it be not so
notorious, as that it will be sure to betray it
self; The wounds of reputation are of all
others the most incureable, and therefore
it may well become Christian Charity to
prevent them, even where they have been
diserved, and perhaps such a tenderness in
hiding the fault may sooner bring the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to repentance, if it be seconded (as it
ought to be) with all earnestness of private
admonition; But if the fault be such, that
it be not to be concealed, yet still there may
be place for this Charity, in extenuating, and
lessning it, as far as the circumstances will
bear; As if it were done suddenly, and rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Charity will allow some abatement of the
censure, which would belong to a designed,
and deliberate act; and so proportionably in
other circumstances. But the most frequent
exercises of this Charity happen towards
those of whose either innocency or guilt we
have no knowledg, but are by some doubtful
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:96830:200"/>
actions brought under suspicion; And here
we must remember, that it is the property of
love, <hi>not to think evil,</hi> to judge the best; and
therefore we are both to abstain from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
conclusions of them our selves, and
as much as lyes in us, to keep others from
them also, and so endeavour to preserve the
credit of our neighbour, which is oftentimes as
much shaken by unjust suspicions, as it would
be by the truest accusation. To these cases I
suppose belongs that precept of Christ, <hi>Mat.
7. 1. Iudge not;</hi> and when we consider,
how that is backt in the following words,
<hi>That ye be not Iudged,</hi> we shall have cause
to beleeve it no such light matter, as the
world seems to account it; Our unmerciful
judging of others will be paid home to us in
the strict, and severe Judgment of God.</p>
                  <p>13. I have now gone through this <hi>Active
Charity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The acts of Charity in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects acts of Iustice also.</note> as it relates to the four several capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
of our brethren, many of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
whereof were before briefly mentioned,
when we spake of Justice. If any think it
improper, that the same acts should be made
part of Justice, and Charity too, I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
them to consider, that Charity being by
Christs Command become a debt to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
all the parts of it may in that respect
be ranked under the head of Justice, since 'tis
sure paying of debts is a part of that; Yet
because in our common use we do distinguish
between the Offices of Justice, and Charity,
I have chose to inlarge on them in particular
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:96830:201"/>
reference to Charity. But I desire it may still
be remembred, that whatsoever is under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
is so much a due from us, that we sin not
onely against Charity, but Justice too, if we
neglect it; Which deserves to be considered,
the more to stir up our care to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
and the rather, because there seems
to be a common errour in this point; Men
look upon their acts of mercy, as things
purely voluntary, that they have no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to; and the effect of it is this, that they
are apt to think very highly of themselves,
when they have performed any, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so mean, but never blame themselves,
though they omit all: which is a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
but withall a very natural fruit of the
former perswasion. If there be any Charities,
wherein Justice is not concerned, they are
those, which for the height, and degrees of
them are not made matter of strict duty, that
is, are not in those degrees Commanded by
God, and even after these 'twill be very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
for us to labour; but that cannot be
done without taking the lower and necessary
degrees in our way; and therefore let our
first care be for them.</p>
                  <p>14. To help us wherein,<note place="margin">The great rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>le duty to our Neighbours,</hi> Rom. 13.
9. let this therefore be the standard, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to measure all thy actions, which relate to
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:96830:201"/>
others; Whenever any necessity of thy
Neighbours persents it self to thee, ask thy
self, whether if thou wert in the like case, thy
love to thy self would not make thee indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
for relief, and then resolve thy love to
thy Neighbour must have the same effect for
him. This is that Royal Law, as St. <hi>James</hi>
calls it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 8. which all that profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
subjects to Christ, must be ruled by;
and whoever is so, will not fail of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Charities to others, because 'tis sure
he would upon the like occasions have all such
performed to himself. There is none, but
wishes to have his good name defended, his
poverty relieved, his bodily suffering suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured;
Onely it may be said, that in the
spiritual wants there are some so careless of
themselves, that they wish no supply, they
desire no reproofs, no instructions, nay, are
angry when they are given them; It may
therefore seem, that such men are not by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of this rule tied to those sorts of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
To this I answer, that the <hi>love of our
selves,</hi> which is here set as the measure of
that to our Neighbour, is to be understood to
be that reasonable love, which men ought to
have, and therefore though a man fail of that
due love he owes himself, yet his Neighbour
hath not thereby forfeited his right, he has
still a claim to such a degree of our love, as
is answerable to that, which in right we
should bear to our selves, and such I am sure
is this care of our spiritual estate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:96830:202"/>
'tis not our despising our own Souls, that
will absolve us from Charity to other mens,
yet I shall not much press this duty in such
men, it being neither likely that they will
be perswaded to it, or do any good by it,
their ill example will overwhelm all their
good exhortations, and make them unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>15. There is yet one act of Charity behind,<note place="margin">Peace Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</note>
which does not properly fall under any one of
the former heads, and yet may relate to them
all, and that is the <hi>Making Peace,</hi> and amity
among others; By doing whereof we may
much benefit both the Souls, Bodies, Goods,
and Credit of our brethren; for all these
are in danger to strife and contention. The
reconciling of enemies is a most blessed work,
and brings a blessing on the actors: We have
Christs word for it, <hi>Blessed are the Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
Mat. 5. 9. and therefore we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
diligently to lay hold of all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of doing this Office of Charity, to use
all our Art, and endeavour to take up all
grudges and quarrels we discern among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
Neither must we onely labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
peace, where it is lost, but to preserve it,
where it is: <hi>First,</hi> generally, by striving to
beget in the heart of all we converse with a
true value of that most precious Jewel, Peace;
<hi>Secondly,</hi> particularly, by a timely preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those jarres, and unkindnesses, we see
likely to fall out. It may many times be in
the power of a discreet friend or neighbour,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:96830:202"/>
to cure those mistakes, and misapprehensions,
which are the first beginning of quarrels and
contentions; and it will be both more easy
and more profitable, thus to prevent, then
pacify strifes. 'Tis sure 'tis more easy, for
when a quarrel is once broken out, 'tis like a
violent flame, which cannot so soon be
quencht, as it might have been, whilst it was
but a smothering fire. And then 'tis also more
profitable, for it prevents many sins, which in
the progress of an open contention, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
sure to be committed. <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes,
<hi>In the multitude of words there wanteth not
sin,</hi> Prov. 10. 19. which cannot more truly
be said of any sorts of words, then those
that pass in anger, and then though the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
be afterwards composed, yet those sins
will still remain on their account; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis a great Charity to prevent them.</p>
                  <p>16. But to fit a man for this so excellent an
Office of <hi>Peace Making,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He that undertakes it must be Peaceable himself.</note> 'Tis necessary that
he be first remarkably peaceable himself; for
with what face canst thou perswade others to
that, which thou wilt not practice thy self?
or how canst thou expect thy perswasions
should work? 'twill be a ready reply in every
mans mouth, <hi>Thou Hypocrite cast out first the
beam out of thine own eye,</hi> Mat. 7. 5. and
therefore be sure thou qualify thy self for thy
work. There is one point of Peaceableness
which seems to be little regarded among men,
and that is in the case of <hi>Legal trespasses;</hi>
Men thingk it nothin to go to <hi>Law</hi> about<note place="margin">Of going to Law.</note>
                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:96830:203"/>
every pity trifle, and as long as they have but
Law on their side, never think they are to
blame: but sure had we that true Peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of spirit, which we ought, we should be
unwilling for such slight mattets to trouble,
and disquiet our Neighbours. Not that all
going to Law is utterly unchristian, but such
kind of suits especially, as are upon conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness,
and stoutness of humour, to defend
such an inconsiderable right, as the parting
with will do us little or no harm, or which is
yet worse, to avenge such a trespass. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in greater matters, he that shall part with
somewhat of his Right, for love of Peace, does
surely the most Christianly, and most agreeably
to the advice of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 7. rather
to take <hi>wrong,</hi> and <hi>suffer our selves to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded.</hi>
But if the damage be so unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
that it is necessary for us to go to
Law, yet even then we must take care of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Peace; <hi>first,</hi> by carrying still a
friendly, and Christian temper towards the
party, not suffering our hearts to be at all
estranged from him; <hi>secondly,</hi> by being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to yield to any reasonable terms of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whenever they shall be offered; and
truly if we carry not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s temper of mind in
our suits, I see not how they can be reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with that peaceableness so strictly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of all Christians. Let those consider th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their Neighbour, or their Trade to stir
up others to do it. This tender regard of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:96830:203"/>
Peace both in our selves, and others, is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to be entertained of all those,

whose title it is to be the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi>
Isa. 9. 6.</p>
                  <p>17. All that remains to be toucht on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this <hi>Charity</hi> of the Actions is the
extent of it,<note place="margin">This Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y of the Actions must reach to Enemies</note> which must be as large as the
former of the Affections, even to the taking
in not onely strangers, and those of no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to us, but even of our bitterest enemies.
I have already spoken so much of the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we are under to forgive them, that I
shall not here say any thing of that, but that
being supposed a duty, 'twill sure then appear
no unreasonable thing to proceed one step
further, by doing them good turns; for
when we have once forgiven them, we can
then no longer account them enemies, and so
'twill be no hard matter even to flesh and
blood to do all kind things to them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this is the way, by which we must trye
the sincerity of our forgiveness: 'Tis easy
to say, I forgive such a man, but if when an
opportunity of doing him good is offered,
thou declinest it, 'tis apparent there yet lurks
the old malice in thy heart; Where there is
a thorough forgiveness, there will be as great
a readiness to benefit an enemy, as a friend:
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay, perhaps in some respects a greater, a
true charitable person looking upon it as an
especial prize, when he has an opportunity of
evidencing the truth of his reconciliation,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:96830:204"/>
and obeying the precept of his Saviour, by
<hi>doing good to them that hate him,</hi> Mat 5. 44.
Let us therefore resolve that all acts of reall
kindness are to be performed to our enemies,
for which we have not onely the command,
but also the example of Christ, who had not
only some inward relentings toward us his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate,
and most provoking enemies, but
shewed it in acts, and those no cheap, or easy
ones, but such as cost him his dearest blood.
And surely we can never pretend to be either
obeyers of his Command, or followers of his
example, if we grudge to testify our love to
our enemies by those so much cheaper wayes
of feeding them in hunger, and the like, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to us by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 20.
But if we could perform these acts of kindness
to enemies in such a manner, as might draw
them from their enmity, and win them to
Peace, the Charity would be doubled; And
this we should aim at, for that we see the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
sets as the end of the forementioned
acts of feeding, &amp;c. that we may <hi>heap coals

us; and this were indeed the most
complete way of <hi>imitating Christs example,</hi>
who in all he did, and suffered for us, designed
the reconciling of us to himself.</p>
                  <p>18. I have now shewed you the several
parts of our duty to our Neighbour,<note place="margin">Self love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

more necessary, then the turning out of our

hearts that self love, which so often possesses
them, and that so wholly, that it leaves no
room for Charity, nay, nor justice neither
to our Neighbour. By this <hi>self-love</hi> I mean
not that <hi>true love</hi> of our selves, which is the
love and cure of our Souls (for that would
certainly help, not hinder us in this duty) but I
mean that immoderate love of our own
worldly interests, and advantages, which is
apparently the root of all, both injustice and
uncharitableness towards others. We find
this sin of <hi>self-love</hi> set by the Apostle in the
head of a whole troop of sins, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2.
as if it were some principal officer in Satans
camp, and certainly not without reason, for
it never goes without an accursed train of
many other sins, which like the <hi>Dragons tail
Rev.</hi> 12. 4. sweeps away all care of duty to
others. We are by it made so vehement, and
intent upon the pleasing our selves, that we
have no regard to any body else, contrary to
the direction of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 15. 2. Which is
<hi>not to please our selves, but every man to please
his neighbour for his good to edification;</hi> which
he backs with the example of Christ, ver. 3.
<hi>For even Christ pleased not himself:</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we have any sincere desire to have this
vertue of charity rooted in our hearts, we must
be careful to weed out this sin of self-love, for
'tis impossible they can prosper together.</p>
                  <p>19. But when we have removed this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance,
we must remember that this,<note place="margin">Prayer a means to procure is.</note> as all other
graces proceeds not from our selves, it is the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:96830:205"/>
                     <hi>gift of God,</hi> and therefore we must earnestly
pray to him to work it in us, to send his holy
Spirit, which once appeared in the form of a
dove, a <hi>meek</hi> and a <hi>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our hearts to the same temper, and enable us
rightly to perform this duty.</p>
                  <p>20. I have now past through those several
branches I at first proposed,<note place="margin">Christian duties both possible and pleasant.</note> and shewed you,
what is our <hi>duty to God, our selves, and our
neighbour:</hi> Of which I may say as it is, <hi>Luk.
10 28. This do and thou shalt live.</hi> And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is no impossible task to perform this, in
such a measure, as God will graciously accept,
that is in sincerity, though not in perfection,
for God is not that austere Master, <hi>Lu. 19. 21.
That reap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> where he has not sowed,</hi> he requires
nothing of us, which he is not ready by his
grace to enable us to perform; if we be not
wanting to our selves, either in asking it by
prayer, or in using it by diligence. And as it
is not an impossible, so neither is it such a sad
melancholly task, as men are apt to think it.
'Tis a special policy of <hi>Satans,</hi> to do as the
spies did, <hi>Num</hi> 23. 28. bring up an ill report
upon this good land, this <hi>state of Christian</hi>

men of any true joy, but helps them to
a great deal: <hi>Christs yoke is an easy,</hi> nay a
<hi>pleasant yoke,</hi> his <hi>burden a light, yea a gracious
burde.</hi> There is in the practice of Christian
duties a great deal of present pleasure, and if
we feel it not, it is because of the resistance our
vicious and sinful customes make, which by the
contention raises an uneasinesse. But then first
that is to be charged only on our selves, for
having got those ill customes, and thereby
made that hard to us, which in it self is most
pleasant, the duties are not to be accused for
it. And then secondly, even there the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of subduing those ill habits, overcoming
those corrupt customes is such, as hugely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigheth
all the trouble of the combate.</p>
                  <p>21. But it will perhaps be said, that some
parts of piety are of such a nature,<note place="margin">Even when they expose us to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</note> as will be
very apt to expose us to persecutions, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
in the world, and that those <hi>are not
joyous but grievous;</hi> I answer, that even in
those there is matter of joy: we see the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
thought it so, <hi>they rejoyced that they were
counted worthy to suffer for Christs name, Acts
4.</hi> 41. and St. <hi>Peter</hi> tels us, <hi>that if any suffer
as a Christian, he is to glorifie God for it,
1 Pet.</hi> 4. 16. There is such a force, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in the testimony of a good conscience, as
is able to change the greatest suffering into the
joyfullest triumph, and that testimony we can
never have more clear, and lively, then when
we suffer for righteousnesse sake; so that you
see Christianity is very amiable even in its sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:96830:206"/>
dresse, the inward comforts of it do fat
surpasse all the outward tribulations, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it, and that even in the instant, while
we are in the state of warfare upon earth. But
then if we look forward to the crown of our
victories, those eternal rewards in heaven, we
can never think those tasks sad, though we had
nothing at present to sweeten them, that have
such recompences await them at the end; were
our labours never so heavy, we could have no
cause to faint under them: Let us therefore
whenever we meet with any discouragements
in our course, fix our eye on this rich prize,
and then <hi>run with patience the race which is
set before us, Heb.</hi> 12. 2 Follow <hi>the Captain
of our salvation</hi> through the greatest sufferings,
yea even through the same red Sea of blood
which he hath waded, whenever our obedience
to him shall require it; for though our fidelity
to him should bring us to death it self, we are
sure to be no losers by it, for to such he hath
promised a <hi>Crown of life,</hi> the very expectation
whereof is able to keep a Christian more
cheerful in his fetters and dungeon, then a
worldling can be in the midst of his greatest
prosperities.</p>
                  <p>22. All that remains for me farther to
add,<note place="margin">The danger of del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ying our turning to God.</note> is earnestly to intreat and beseech the
Reader, that without delay, he puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into this so pleasant, so gainful a course,
by setting sincerely to the practice of all
those things, which either by this book, or
by any other means he discerns to be his
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:96830:206"/>
and the further he hath formerly gone out of
his way, the more haste it concerns him to make
to get into it, and to use the more diligence in
walking in it. He that hath a long journey to
go, and finds he hath lost a great part of his
day in a wrong way, will not need much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty
either to turn into the right, or to
quicken his pace in it. And this is the case of
all those that have lived in any course of sin,
they are in a wrong road, which will never
bring them to the place they aim at; Nay,
which will certainly bring them to the place
they most fear and abhor; much of their day
is spent, how much will be left to finish their
journey in, none knowes, perhaps the next
hour, the next minute the night of death
may overtake them; what a madness is it
then for them to defer one moment to turn
out of that path, which leads to certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and to put themselves in that, which
will bring them to bliss and glory? Yet so
are men bewitched, and enchanted with the
deceitfulness of sin, that no intreaty, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
can prevail with them, to make this
so reasonable, so necessary a change, not but
that they acknowledge it needful to be done,
but they are unwilling to do it yet, they
would enjoy all the pleasures of sin, as long
as they live, and then they hope at their death,
or some little time before it, to do all the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of their Souls; But, alas! Heaven is
too high to be thus jumped into, the way to it
is a long and leasurely ascent, which requires
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:96830:207"/>
time to walk. The hazards of such deferring
are more largely spoken of, in the discourse of
Repentance, I shall not here repeat them, but
desire the Reader seriously to lay them to
heart, and then surely he will think it season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
counsel that is given by the wise man,
<hi>Ecclus: 5. 7. Make no tarrying to turn to the
Lord, and put not off from day to day.</hi>

thou sentest thy Son out of thy bosome to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
me from the power of my sins, by his
grace, and from the punishment of them, by
his blood, and by both to bring me to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Thou hast by thy mercy caused me to be
born within thy peculiar fold, the Christian
Church, where I was early consecrated to thee
in Baptism, and have been partaker of all
those spiritual helps, which might aid me to
perform that Vow I there made to thee, and
when by my own willfulnesse or negligence,
I have failed to do it, yet thou in thy mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
mercies hast not forsaken me, but hast
graciously invited me to repentance, afforded
me all means both outward and inward for it,
and with much patience hast attended, and not
cut me off in the acts of those many damning

deserved. It is O Lord thy restraining grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,

                     <p>O Righteous Lord, who hatest iniquity, I
thy sinful creature cast my self at thy
feet, acknowledging that I most justly deserve
to be utterly abhorred and forsaken by thee,
for I have drunk iniquity like water, gone on
in a continued course of sin and rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee, daily committing those things thou
forbiddest, and leaving undone those things
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:96830:210"/>
thou commandest, mine heart which should
be an habitation for thy Spirit, is become a
cage of unclean birds, of foul and disordered
affections, and out of this abundance of the
heart my mouth speaketh, my hands act, so that
in thought, word and deed I continually trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
against thee. <hi>[Here mention the greatest
of thy sins]</hi> Nay, O Lord, I have despised
that goodness of thine, which should lead me
to Repentance, hardning my heart against all
those means thou hast used for my amendment.
And now, O Lord, what can I expect from
thee but judgment and fiery indignation, that
is indeed the due reward of my sins. But, O
Lord, there is mercy with thee, that thou
mayest be feared, O fit me for that mercy, by
giving me a deep and hearty Repentance, and
then according to thy goodness let thy anger
and thy wrath be turned away from me, look
upon me in thy Son, my blessed Saviour, and
for the merit of his sufferings, pardon all my
sins; And, Lord, I beseech thee, by the
power of thy grace so to renew, and purify
my heart, that I may become a new creature,
utterly forsaking every evil way, and living in
constant, sincere, universal obedience to thee all
the rest of my dayes, that behaving my self as a
good and faithful servant, I may by thy mercy
at last be received into the joy of my Lord;

habitual and customary to me? And to this
frequency, I have added both a greediness, and
obstinacy in sinning, turning into my course
as the horse rusheth into the battel, doing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
with both hands, earnestly, yea hating to
be reformed, and casting thy words behind
me, quenching thy Spirit within me, which
testified against me, to turn me from my evil
wayes, and frustrating all those outward
means, whether of judgment or mercy, which
thou hast used to draw me to thy self. Nay,
O Lord, even my repentances may be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
amongst my greatest sins, they have
sometimes been feigned and hypocritical, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
so slight and ineffectual, that they have
brought forth no fruit in amendment of life,
but I have still returned with the dog to his
vomit, and the sow to the mire again, and
have added the breach of resolutions and
vowes, to all my former guilts. Thus, O
Lord. I am become out of measure sinful, and
since I have thus chosen death, I am most
worthy to take part in it, even in the second
death, the lake of fire and brimstone. This
this, O Lord, is in justice to be the portion
of my cup, to me belongs nothing but shame
and confusion of face eternally. But to thee,
O Lord God, belongeth mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
though I have rebelled against thee. O
remember not my sins and offences, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thy mercy think thou upon me O
Lord for thy goodness. Thou sentest thy Son
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:96830:233"/>
to seek and to save that which was lost, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
O Lord, I have gone astray like a sheep
that is lost, O seek thy servant, and bring me
back to the Shepherd and Bishop of my Soul;
let thy Spirit work in me a hearty sense and
detestation of all my abominations, that true
contrition of heart, which thou hast promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not to despise. And then be thou pleased
to look on me, to take away all iniquity, and
receive me graciously, and for his sake who
hath done nothing amiss, be reconciled to me,
who have done nothing well, wash away the
guilt of my sins in his blood, and subdue the
power of them by his grace, and grant, O
Lord, that I may from this hour bid a final
adieu to all ungodliness, and worldly lusts,
that I may never once more cast a look toward
Sodom, or long after the flesh pots of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
but consecrate my self intirely to thee,
to serve thee in Righteousness and true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
reckoning my self to be dead indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
sin, but alive unto God, through Jesus
Christ our Lord and blessed Saviour.</p>

my own lusts have bound me, and draw me
that I may run after thee. Lord, thou seest
daily how eagerly I pursue the paths that lead
to death, but when thou invitest me to life
and glory, I turn my back and forsake my
own mercy. How often hath this feast been

shed it, but to save sinners, neither can the
merit of it be overwhelmed either by the
greatness or number of sins. I am a sinner,
a great one, O let me find its saving efficacy.
Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful to me
for my soul trusteth in thee, and in the clefts
of thy wound, shall be my refuge until thy
fathers indignation be overpast. O thou, who
hast as my high Priest sacrificed for me, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
for me also, and plead thy meritorious
sufferings on my behalfe, and suffer not, O my
Redeemer, the price of thy blood to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
lost: And grant, O Lord, that as the
sins I have to be forgiven are many, so I may
love much: Lord thou seest what faint, what
cold affections I have towards thee, O warm
and enliven them; and as in this Sacrament,
that transcendent love of thine in dying for
me is shewed forth; so I beseech thee, let it
convey such grace into me, as may enable
me to make some returns of love: O let this
divine fire descend from heaven into my soul,
and let my sins be the burnt offering for it to
consume, that there may not any corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
any accursed thing be shelterd in my
heart, that I may never again defile that
place, which thou hast chosen for thy temple.
Thou dyedst, O dear Jesu to redeem me from
all iniquity, O let me not again sell my self
to work wickedness, but grant that I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
thee at this time with most sincere and

thine constrain me to obedience, that since

I know there is no concord between Christ

pleased to enter my heart, O let me never

And Lord let my Saviours sufferings for my
sins, and the vowes I have now made against
them, never depart from my mind, but let
the remembrance of the one enable me to
perform the other, that I may never make
truce with those lusts, which nailed his hands,
pierced his side, and made his Soul heavy to

preserve me so by thy grace that I never suffer
as an evil doer, and then, O Lord, if it be my
lot to suffer as a Christian, let me not be asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

suffer for thy name: O thou who for my

to shake my constancy, but that how long soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

thy Spirit alone, that can uphold me, O stablish

striving against sin: O dear Jesus, hear me, and
though Satan desire to have me, that he may
winnow me as wheat, yet do thou, O blessed
Mediator, pray for me that my faith fail not,
but that though it be tryed with fire, it may be
found unto praise and glory and honour at thy
appearing. And O Lord, I beseech thee, grant
that I may preserve not only constancy towards
God, but charity also towards men, even those
whom thou shalt permit to be the instruments
of my sufferings, Lord, let me not fail to imitate
that admirable meekness of thine, in loving

me: Lord one day is with thee as a thousand

Give me a perfect and entire ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred

with that sacrifice of a broken and contrite
heart, which thou hast promised not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise;
that by this I may be made capable of
that atonement, which thy dear Son hath by
the more excellent oblation of himself made
for all repenting sinners. He is the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

I desire humbly to confesse before
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:96830:250"/>
thee, both on my own behalf, and that of this
nation, that these many years of calamity we
have groaned under, are but the just (yea mild)
returns of those many more years of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
against thee, and that thy present
wrath is but the due punishment of thy abused
mercy. O Lord, thou hast formerly aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to us in blessings above all people of the
earth. Thy candle shined upon our heads, and
we delighted our selves in thy great goodness,
peace was within our walls, and plenteousness
within our palaces, there was no decay, no lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into captivity, and no complaining in our
streets: But we turned this grace into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness,
we abused our peace to security, our
plenty to riot and Luxury, and made those
good things, which should have endeared our
hearts to thee, the occasions of estranging
them from thee; Nay, O Lord, thou gavest
us yet more precious mercies, thou wert pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thy self to pitch thy Tabernacle with us, to
establish a pure and glorious Church among
us, and give us thy word to be a lamp unto our
feet, and a light unto our paths; But O Lord
we have made no other use of that light, then
to conduct us to the chambers of death, we
have dealt proudly, and not hearkned to thy
commandments, and by rebelling against the
light, have purchased to our selves so much
the heavier portion in the outer darkness. And
now, O Lord, had the overflowings of thy ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
been answerable to that of our sins, we
had long since been swept away with a swift
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:96830:251"/>
destruction, and there had been none of us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
at this day to implore thy mercy. But thou
art a gracious God, slow to anger, and hast
proceeded with us with much patience and
long suffering, thou hast sent thy judgments to
awake us to repentance, and hast also al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
us space for it: But alas! we have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
this mercy of thine beyond all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
we return not to him that smiteth us, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do we seek the Lord, we are slidden back
by a perpetual backsliding, no man repenteth
him of his wickedness, or saith what have I
done? 'Tis true indeed we fear the rod (we
dread every suffering, so that we are ready to
buy it off with the foulest sin) but we fear not
him that hath appointed it, but by a wretched
obstinacy harden our necks against thee, and
refuse to return. And now, O God, what balm
is there in Gilead that can cure us; who, when
thou wouldst heal us, will not be healed, we
know thou hast pronounced that there is no
peace to the wicked, and how shall we then
pray for peace, that still retain our wickedness?

land. Lord, thou hast long spoken by thy word
to our ears, by thy judgments even to all our
senses, but unless thou speak by thy Spirit to
our hearts, all other cals will still be uneffectual,
O send out this voice, and that a mighty voice,
such as may awake us out of this Lethargy:
thou that didst call Lazarus out of the grave, O

be pleased to call us, who are dead, yea putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in trespasses and sins, and make us to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
to righteousness. And though, O Lord,
our frequent resistances even of these inward
calls have justly provoked thee to give us up
to the lusts of our own heart; yet O thou
boundless ocean of mercy, who art good not
only beyond what we can deserve, but what
we can wish, do not withdraw the influence
of thy grace, and take not thy holy Spirit from
us. Thou wert found of those that sought
thee not, O let that act of mercy be repeated
to us, who are so desperately, yet so insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
sick, that we cannot so much as look after
the Physician, and by how much our case is the
more dangerous, so much the more soveraign
remedies do thou apply; Lord help us, and
consider not so much our unworthiness of thy
aid, as our irremediable ruine, if we want it;
save Lord, or we perish eternally. To this end
dispense to us in our temporal interest, what
thou seest may best secure our spiritual; if a
greater degree of outward misery will tend to
the cureing our inward, Lord, spare not thy
rod, but strike yet more sharply, Cast out this
Devil, though with never so much foaming and
tearing. But if thou seest that some return of
mercy may be most likely to melt us, O be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
so far to condescend to our wretchedness, as
to afford us that, and whether by thy sharper, or
thy gentler methods, bring us home to thy self.
And then, O Lord, we know thy hand is not
shortned, that it cannot save, when thou hast
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:96830:252"/>
delivered us from our sins, thou canst and wilt deliver us
from our troubles, O shew us thy mercy, and grant us
thy salvation, that being redeemed both in our bodies and
spirits, we may glorifie thee in both, in a cheerful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and praise the name of our God, that hath dealt
wonderfully with us, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

heaven, in earth, and whatsoever is above heaven and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

himself, &amp; repented, with which eyes thou once
didst view the scattered multitude, and wert moved with

(O good <hi>Shepherd</hi>) what sundry sorts of Wolvs have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

with what winds, with what waves, with what storms thy

may thank our own wickedness and sinful living; we espy

which (according to the Psalm of thy Prophet) <hi>surmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

we beseech thee, that thou wilt not consider not weigh
what is due for our deservings, but rather what becometh
thy mercy, without which neither the Angels in heaven
can stand sure before thee, much less we filly vessels of

one Baptisme, one God, one Hope, one Spirit; so they may also have
one voice, one note, and song, professing one Catholick truth. When
thou didst mount up to heaven triumphantly, thou threwest out from

awe of thee, that they so may guide the Common-weal, as they
should shortly render accompt unto thee that art the King of kings.
Give wisdome to be alwayes assistant unto them, that whatsoever is
best to be done, they may espy it in their mind, and pursue the same
in their doings. Give to the <hi>Bishops</hi> the gift of prophecy, that they
