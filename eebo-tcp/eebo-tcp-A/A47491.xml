            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Don't we know, when the <hi>Great Jehovah</hi> had finiſhed that Great and Admirable Stupendious Work of the Creation, he made Laws and Bands to every Part thereof, and in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal providence hath placed, againſt the uſurpiug Blaſphemy, Miſuſe, and Stealth of the Wicked, and great Enemy, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, four Mighty Angelical Princes (who are as Watchmen and Overſeers, over this tereſtial Fabrick, and the Sons of Men dwelling thereon) to the Intent, that he being put out to the Earth, his envious will might be bridled, the determinations of our heavenly God fulfiled, and his Creatures kept and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, within the Compaſs and Meaſure of Order; he made the <hi>Sun</hi> to rule by day, and the <hi>Moon</hi> by night, and all the Hoſts of Heaven, he made for Signs, for Seaſons, for Days, and for Years, and in them did (briefly but fully) ſhew an Epitomy of the choyceſt Part of the Creation, and from which was learned Man by Divine Permiſſion inſtructed in the most ſublime Knowledg, next to Salvation, that ever was taught; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Ignorat Detractors, are ſubject to velify it; yet the
<pb facs="tcp:50079:4"/>
more profound Philoſophers, as I ſaid once before, who made it their buſineſs Wholy to ſtudy God and Nature, were led by thoſe Heavenly Beings, to the moſt occult Secrets, yea a great deal more than our common Aſtrologers doth know, or can give any Reaſons for; but only Study by Tradition, not at all regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Reaſon or Experience; let them alone in their common Road, and they have Arguments enough, (tho' ſenſeleſs ones,) to confound a Nation, if that could do any good? but deny their ſenſeleſs Arguments, and demand their Reaſons, and you'l lay them as flat as the ground, and like <hi>Bats</hi> ſtruck dead by Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as I may Inſtance in this one Propoſition; ſuppoſe a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould have her Womb poſſeſt with three Children at one time, and it ſhould pleaſe God our great Creator to order it ſo, that they ſhould all be born, or receive the Vital Air upon their tender Bodies, within the ſpace of an hour, I would fain know, whether there be ever a one amongſt our common Pretenders, can tell which of theſe Children will dye firſt, when, and of what diſtemper; Now if there be any Truth in Art, as we are ſure there is, then all Ingenious Men will allow this to be rational, as we often ſee, one Child lives, and two dyes, two lives and one dyes, and ſometimes they all live, and ſometimes they all dye now this is quite out of the common Aſtrologers way, neither can they give the leaſt Reaſon for it in the World (and why) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they trace over a wrong path, as we can eaſily prove in any Nativity of theirs, and ſhew demonſtrable reaſons for the ſame, that there is not one in a hundred of them as to Art, but are like the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> which did nothing but grope in the dark; or like the rude Multitude in <hi>Nineveh,</hi> which did not know their Right Hands from their Left; and yet theſe Gentlemen, can Boaſt with <hi>Hermes</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy;</hi> as their Leaders (nay ſome have the Impudence to Condemn them, and all their Wayes) when in Truth they underſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their ſayings, but Cleave to the Cuſtomes of the World
<pb facs="tcp:50079:5"/>
and forſake the Truth, as ſhall be Demonſtrated here after by ſeveral Examples (If we find this Kindly Received and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Entertained) and that according to the unerring <hi>Cannons</hi> of this moſt Heavenly Science <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome who pretends themſelves to be Great Maſters of Art, will be apt to Claſh and Write againſt theſe moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Rules, which we have here layd down for the good of <hi>Tyros;</hi> but we ſhall adviſe them to Reſt in a ſecure Harbour, and not to be like the unadvized and indeſcreet Marriner, who runs his Ship againſt a Rock, and thereby not only Indangers the loſs of his Veſſel, but hazzards alſo his own Life, and the Sailors too; therefore he that offers to write againſt this Piece. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring to vindicate what hath been all Ready wrote by any of our Modern Authors (who are like <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntempred Mortar, which is not as yet fit for uſe) will Run into Error and Confuſion. And ſo we leave you to the Protection of him which made us all, for we muſt haſten (away) about our Great Work, leaſt Time in his Swift Pace mocketh us for our ſlowneſs, therefore take Notice of this, that the fore-locks of Time, are the Deciders of many Doubts, and Time is ſo ſwift of foot, that being once paſt he can never be overtaken.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Although the Stars by their Motions in the Heaven, do change their Places, and have the determinate Degree
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50079:46"/>
of intention, and the definite quantity of the Extention of their Light, they doe not act upon inferiours, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true and real Intention, and Extention of the Light, which they have in themſelves; but onely accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their appearing, when they come to thoſe Bodies that are ſubject unto them, wherefore the Stars Govern Sublunary things, according to that degree of Intention only, and the quality of Extention of Light, by which they touch thoſe paſſable Bodies, but the leſſer Intention and Extention are; from whence there is the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Stars, from ſubject things; alſo they act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Extention which they caſt forth; as we may moſt Evidently ſee in the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>; for they act according to their Scituation and Parallax, upon the Bodies by which they paſs; the Eclipſes which are not beheld have no Influence, and new Appearances only act in thoſe Places where they are ſeen; their Effects are only there manifeſt, and in what places the Stars riſe not, they have no Power.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly.</hi> The Stars are certain, indeterminate, and univerſal cauſes to ſpecificks, and individual effects, but they are determinated for the truth, to whome they are Viſible and of neareſt cauſe; as the ☉ makes wax ſoft, clay hard, a Worm white, the Skin of Man black, with a Man, he begets a Man, with a Lyon, a Lyon.</p>

                        <head>Fourthly. Of the <hi>Part of Fortune,</hi> and how to take it.</head>
                        <p>ANd in this we ſhall digreſs from the Vulgar way of our Modern Authors, who have admoniſhed us <note place="margin">Of the ♁</note> to obſerve the diſtance of ☉ from <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, and that ſhall be the diſtance of the ♁ from the Aſcend. all this we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but then it muſt be in the Sphere of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, and there it will have the true diſtance from the Aſcend. with the ſame <hi>lat.</hi> and decli. of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> north or ſouth, although the ſame happen in Signs of contrary denomination; for ♁ is not always in the Ecliptick, but moves continually in the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> s Orbit, and this is to be noted, that ſo far as the ☉ in his circular Parallel is diſtant from the <hi>dg.</hi> aſcending, ſo far ſhall <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> be diſtant from the ♁ in her Parallel or Sphere, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now our Method in taking it is twofold; firſt if the Nativity be diurnal, the true diſtance of the ☉ from the Aſcend. being added to the R. A. of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> (with reſpect to her <hi>lat.)</hi> will give the true R. A of the ♁, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if the Nativity be Nocturnal, let ☉ diſtance from
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50079:64"/>
the Aſcend. be ſub. from the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> R. A. and there will remain the true R. A. of the ♁ as before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly.</hi> Let the Nativity be either diur. or noct. add the diſtance of ☉ from the Aſcend. to the R. A. of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, and the ſum ſhall be the R. A. of the ♁, where note, that in taking the diſtance of ☉ from the Aſcend. it muſt be done in ob. A. and under the <hi>lat.</hi> of Birth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now this way is much different from that which is uſed by our modern Authors, for if it be well noted, a mans own reaſon will tell him, that their way cannot be true, but very erronious, becauſe they never regard the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> 
                           <hi>lat.</hi> a thing which ought ſeriouſly to be conſidered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And if the ♁ be not true taken, it will cauſe a great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, becauſe many times in noct. Nativities the ♁ hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be Giver of Life; when it ſhall chance to be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in an Aphetical Place, and <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> not, for we prefer the ♁ before the Aſcend. beſides it is alſo directed for the Riches of the Native, and his gain in all affairs, therefore ought warily to be taken.</p>
                        <p>Now if theſe things be kindly accepted of by the Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sons of <hi>

                     <p>A Nativity is the true Time, or the very Moment of any ones Birth, in which the Child comes into the World, begining then to be a viſible Member of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the Stars begining then to Act and Operate, by the Power of the Angel, or Angels ruling thoſe Conſtellations, <note place="margin">Of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</note> ariſing, or then being in Greateſt Power at the time of the Birth, according to the Saying of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> when he cometh to Comment upon the 18 of St. <hi>Mathew</hi> and the <hi>10th</hi> verſe, ſaith thus; <hi>Great. is the Dignity of Souls, for every one at their firſt appearance into the world, have an Angel appoynted for their Cuſtody, and ſafety;</hi> But ſeing the true Time is hard to come at, by Reaſon of the difference and uncertainty of all Clocks, Watches, and Dyals, the Antients have left ſeveral wayes to Rectify it by, as the Truetine of <hi>Hermes</hi> the <hi>Animoder</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and alſo by the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents

of the Native, as for the Truetine of <hi>Hermes,</hi> or <hi>Animodar,</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> I ſhall ſay little in this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſufficiently handled by almoſt all Authors, and what I have here to ſay is to Rectify a Nativity by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; which breifly is thus. Firſt ſet your figure by the following Table of Houſes for the Eſtimate Time, then obſerve the Accidents, whether Sickneſs, Honour, Loſs, or what more you can get, but eſpecially ſickneſs, or croſes, and if it be ſickneſs, take the true pole of the giver of Life, with his Parallels if the ☉, or <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, or ♁, or elſe if it be the Aſcendant the ob. Aſc. under the pole of Birth, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the nature of the Promittor, and his Parallels, with the other Planets, whether he may give ſuch a diſtemper or no, ſo that if you find your arch of direction to long, or to ſhort, you are to raiſe or depreſs the pole of poſhtion of your Significator, and by that means you will find the true time; always obſerveing, that you muſt only direct the giver of Life, to the bad aſpect of the Infortunes, for ſickneſs, and no other, as thus, if the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> be giver of Life, the ☉ nor Aſendant being directed to any bad aſpects can not kill, or cauſe Diſeaſes as ſhall be ſhewed in their proper places, for that hath been the ſenſeleſs opinion of moſt of our Artiſts, to think that one may give Life, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be directed to kill, which is the moſt irational thing in the World.</p>

he went about to Infatuate the Genius of all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, but to the purpoſe; If the <g ref="char:trine">△</g> of ♄ had power to Kill, why ſhould it be a Dropſy, ſeeing the Aſpect was made in ♊. an airy Sign, and near the <hi>Bulls Eye,</hi> a Star of a hot fiery Nature? and why do not ſuch Aſpects all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Kill, which I can produce ſeveral ſuch directions, from ſeveral Nativities, and yet they have not been Mortal? but in this, as I ſaid before, the ☉ is moſt certainly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Life, who at the time of Death, is directed to a <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> of ♂, in the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> which fell in the beginning of ♋, a watery Sign, and the Sign upon the <hi>8th.</hi> being watery alſo, and the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is upon the Cuſp of the <hi>6th.</hi> and ♃ is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe afflicted; all which conſidered according to <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Doctrine, denotes weakneſs of the Lungs, and watery Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, and that the cauſe of the Death ſhould be ſo, for the aforeſaid Reaſons, the manner of the direction which kil'd was thus, the ob. aſc. of ☉ is <hi>8dg. 28m.</hi> from which I ſub. the ob: aſc. of the Aſcendant, and there reſts <hi>18dg: 43m:</hi> for ☉s primary diſtance, the ob: aſc: of ♋ <hi>0dg:</hi> is <hi>65dg: 10m:</hi> from which I ſub: the ob: aſc: of ☉ <hi>8dg: 28m:</hi> and there remains <hi>56dg: 42m:</hi> for the Arch of direction, now I enter the Tables of Twilight for <hi>44dg: lat:</hi> where I look for <hi>16dg:</hi> of ♈, and in that place to find ☉ primary diſtance, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>10dg:</hi> of ♈ I find 18dg: <hi>32m:</hi> and that anſwers to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel of 13dg: and under 20dg: of ♈ I find 19dg: <hi>1m:</hi> in the ſame parallel of 13dg: now becauſe ☉ is in 16dg: I make proportion between 10dg: and 20dg: and I find the difference to be <hi>29m:</hi> which for 6dg: give <hi>17m:</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added to 18dg. <hi>32m.</hi> makes 18dg. <hi>49m.</hi> but the true diſtance is 18dg. <hi>43m.</hi> which is to be rejected, and 18dg. <hi>49m.</hi> to be taken. then in the ſame parallel of Twilight, I look for ♋ odg. and I find 24dg. <hi>45m.</hi> which is ☉s ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſtance; from which I ſub. the primary diſtance, and there reſts 5dg. <hi>56m.</hi> which is the eaſt diſtance; now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                     <p>THis Native dyed at 19 years and 6 months of Age, of a Conſumption, this Nativity was given me by the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Coley,</hi> but he gave it me but <hi>22dg.</hi> of ♋ aſcending, but by rectification I find it to be as I have here incerted it, the Nativity according to our modern Authors, is one of the beſt that ever I ſee, but according to our method it is a very evil one, and yet I do beleive there is not one Artiſt in 40 can give any reaſon for his death at that time, or why he ſhould dye of a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing the Aſcend. is no ways afflicted, but befriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <g ref="char:trine">△</g> of ♃, and by the ⚹ of both ☿ and <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is in <g ref="char:trine">△</g> to ☿ and ⚹ to ♃ and ☉ in ⚹ to ♂, and neither of them any way afflicted, ſo that ſome of our Artiſts would
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50079:107"/>
have inſured this Natives Life for a ſmall matter; now I ſay if the Nativity had been but <hi>22dg:</hi> of ♋ Aſcending, he could not without a Miracle have lived a month, the Reaſon is this, the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is giver of Life, which then would juſt have come to the parallel of ♂, which in this was but juſt <hi>3m.</hi> paſt, it was a bad Nativity for theſe reaſons, the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is in parallel of ♂, and in ſeſquiquadrate of ♄, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord of the <hi>8th:</hi> in the <hi>6th:</hi> which did exactly ſhew the nature of his death, he heing in an earthy Sign, with the ☋  there alſo, ſo that had he lived longer, he would have alwayes been afflicted with martial and ſaturnine Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, for the afore-ſaid reaſons, and ſo alwayes ſickly, and but of a ſhort Life; that ♂ ſhould be anaretta is plain, for divers reaſons, <hi>1ſt.</hi> he is falling into the <hi>4th.</hi> Houſe, and is in ⚹ of ♄, but the moſt material Argument, is his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in exact parallel of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> at Birth; the direction which kil'd, was the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> giver of Life, as <hi>I</hi> ſaid before to the ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiquadrat of ♂ in the world, <hi>I</hi> find the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>s Pole is about <hi>30dg:</hi> under which Pole you may find according to our former rules, that the direction came up juſt at the time of death, <hi>I</hi> would have incerted the manner of the Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Directions at large, but that <hi>I</hi> have laid it down in other Examples, that it were tautology to repeat it here; <hi>I</hi> think no <hi>Argolian</hi> whatſoever can Cavil at this, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a more demonſtrable Direction, if he do, <hi>I</hi> will liſten to him, but otherwiſe, if he cannot let him hold his tongue? for <hi>I</hi> know it is more eaſie to Carp than Copy, but for Carpers I do not direct my Diſcourſe unto, but for thoſe Ingenious Artiſts that are not only willing to Learn, but alſo willing to promote Learning, without railing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious Terms: This direction is wrought, by the ſame method with <hi>Saffold Lee</hi>'s that kil'd him, and note that theſe directions are all mundane, and ſo the more powerful, for thoſe aſpects that are made in the world, are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50079:108"/>
more powerful than thoſe in the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> which hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been obſerved all along, ſo that we have never had half the directions that belong to a Nativity, and ſo by that means they were forc't to make any thing to kill, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it did not belong to that place, which hath brought a great ſcandal, not only upon Artiſts, but the Art it ſelf, which I ſuppoſe is as demonſtrable as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Science whatſoever; for the Art it ſelf is true, if true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed, and I hope what is here done may be a means to ſtir up ſome more noble Pen, to perform what is here begun; 'tis true the Ingenious Author that gave me this Nativity, was ſomthing deſirous to promote theſe things, or elſe I had ſcarce done it ſo ſoon, but as this find acceptance in the World, I ſhall be further incouraged to imploy my Studies, for their further ſatisfaction.</p>

of ♂ Lord of the <hi>4th.</hi> Houſe, he being in ♓ a watery Sign, muſt needs give a flux of Humors, with a Feaver, I ſuppoſe I need not incert the manner of the Direction, becauſe I have ſaid ſomthing of it elſewhere, and beſides, I hope by this time, the Reader will be able to do the like upon any other of the like occaſion, and ſo by a little Practiſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our Ingenious Profeſſors, this moſt ſublime Art of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> will be practiſed in its true Method; which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinative Art is, and hath, been the moſt abuſed of any Art under the Celeſtial Canopy, by a parcel of bare pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who perhaps may form a Scheam, but when they have done, know no more how to give Judgement, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Twenty one Years Experience) then thoſe who ask the Queſtion, only they have got ſome of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Terms of Art, with which they tell a fair Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the whole time ſtareing the Querent in the Face Auſterely, and ſo deceive the World; neither ſhould it be expoſed to ſuch common Uſes, as our <hi>Non-Artiſts</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this City put it to; and as I ſaid before, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their 21 Years Experience, in all that time have not learned 21 Grains of Sence, which may properly be referred to this ingenious Art, the underſtanding of which they ſo much pretend to; yet this we muſt acknowledge, we are extraordinarily beholding to 3 or 4 of our Famous Country Men, who by their learned Volumns, have made known to the World, that which before they knew not, as that moſt Ingenious Piece of Art, entituled Mr. <hi>Coley</hi>'s. <hi>Clavis,</hi> and that Laborious and incomparable, Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s <hi>Doctrine of Nativities;</hi> thus I conclude my twenty Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with ſome Cautions worthy of Obſervation, by the Ingenious Aſtrologer, as well for the Judging of Horary Figures, as Nativities, which are as followeth.</p>

                     <p>For if this Globe of Earth, in regard of the immence Greatneſs, be accounted a World? what ſhall we ſay of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50079:114"/>
ſo many thouſand Stars, which are for the moſt part ſo much bigger than the Earth? how then I ſay can we but admire ſo many thouſand Worlds of rouling Light, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually over our heads, made by the Omnipotent Power, and all regularly guided by the Infinite Providence of the great God, how ſlenderly muſt that Man think of the workmanſhip of the Almighty, that looks upon all theſe but as ſo many Torches ſet up in the Firmament, only ſo bigg as they ſeem; and contrarily with what awful reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects muſt he needs be carried to his Creator, that knows the vaſtneſs and perpetual motions of thoſe Glorious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ruled and upheld by the mighty Word that made them.</p>
                     <p>Brute Creatures may behold theſe viſſible things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with ſharper Eyes than us, but Spiritual Objects are ſo farr out of their reach, as if they had no being; near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt therefore to Beaſts, are thoſe men, who ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be led wholly by their Sences, as to beleive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is ſuggeſted by the purblind and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Informer; let ſuch men doubt whither they have a Soul in their Body or no, becauſe their Eyes never ſaw it, or that there are any Stars in the Firmament at noon day, becauſe they appear not, or that there is any Air where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they breath, becauſe nothing appears to them, but an Inſenſible Vacuity; ſurely all that know they have Souls muſt of neceſſity beleive the rule and government of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which they ſee not: If from no other grounds, yet out of that Anology, which they cannot but find between this leſſer and the greater World, for as this little World Man, conſiſts of an outward viſſible Body, and an inward Spiritual Soul, which gives Life and Motion to that orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Frame, ſo poſſeſſing all parts, that it is wholly in all, and in each part wholly; ſo muſt it be alſo in the great Univerſe, the ſenſible and material part whereof hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50079:115"/>
and moving from thoſe Spiritual Powers, both Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and Subordinate, which dwell in it, and alſo fill and actuate it, therefore every rational Man looks about with no other Eyes than St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>in</hi> 2. Cor. 4. 18. <hi>We look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen: for the things which are ſeen are temporal, but the things which are not ſeen are Eternal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is multiplicity enough of wonders in the viſible World, but the ſpiritual and intelligable World, is that which is more worthy to take up our Hearts, both as we are Men indued with Reaſon, and alſo that the Infinite Goodneſs hath been pleaſed to enlighten our Eyes, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template on things above: So I ſhall conclude this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the words of St. <hi>Paul Rom. 1. 20.
