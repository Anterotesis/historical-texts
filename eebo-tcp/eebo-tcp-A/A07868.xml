         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

faith, and the olde Roman religion: And therefore, when

For, the doctrine this day taught and defended by
the Pope, his Iesuites, and Iesuited Papists, is indeed the
new Religion, and farre different from the true, catholick,
and olde Roman religion. Would to God all simply se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

but withall, I vtterly abhorre and detest, that Doctrine,
which the late Popes and Byshops of Rome deliuer for the

                  <p>What a Masked, lying, and Trayterous Iesuite is this?

heere the ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

blushing, (for his face is of brasse) that King <hi>Iames</hi> hath
no superiour on earth. It is true indeede, but not in his

Kingdomes and Dominions, Temporall matters? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

King <hi>Iames</hi> hath? His Maiesty will not denie it.
But so it is, that your Pope deposing them, (as you haue

your Pope by your profession, is superiour

                  <p>Here we haue freely granted once againe, that the pope
by Popish doctrine, may depose Princes for heresie: only
this is denied, that he deposeth them at his pleasure. To
which, I thus reply; First, that euery heresie is voluntary,
and consequently, seeing many popes haue been heretiks,
(as Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> himselfe, <hi>Alphonsus de Castro, Melchior
Canus, Vignerius, Nicolaus de Lyra,</hi> and many others freely
grant) it followeth of necessity, that heresie is the Popes
pleasure. Secondly, that when I say, the pope taketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him to depose Princes at his pleasure; I meane nothing
else, but that the pope will depose Princes, whensoeuer
they refuse to embrace and beleeue, his late start vp Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
religion; that is to say, that doctrine, which is added
to the olde Roman religion at his pleasure. For all that
which the <hi>Church of England</hi> this day reiecteth of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
religion, is added, to the old Romish religion at the
Popes pleasure. This subiect is proued at large in my <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues</hi>
and <hi>Suruey.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 8</note> But our Iesuite vrgeth further, that <hi>Bell</hi>
disproueth himselfe in these wordes: Secular Priests (saith

power to depriue Kings of their royall sceptars and rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
nor to giue away their kingdomes to another: in
which opinion likewise the French Papists concurre and

yet doe they disclaime from it in <hi>Temporalibus,</hi> when he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vpon him to depose Kinges from their Empires, and
to translate their kingdomes. And least we should thinke
these few priests who write so, were no Papists, <hi>Bell</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
testifieth, that they are the Popes deare vassals, and

words, our masked Iesuit, (as we see) wold gladly impose
vpon me, that I haue slandered them and their Pope. First,
because the secular priests deny the Popes power in depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Kings. Secondly, because I graunt those seculars to
be papists, but this slander is easily returned to the Iesuite
himselfe. For first, our Iesuites holde, that the Pope may
depose Kinges from their Dominions and regalities. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
the secular priests are of a contrary opinion. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for all that doth it follow, that they are not papistes:
For it is very vsuall and common to Papists, to dissent one
from another in matters of Religion. This is prooued in
my Motiues. Our masked Iesuit spendeth the whole chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

                  <p>My reply standeth thus. First, that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> or <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
then Byshop of Rome, spake of that obedience which
a subiect oweth to his prince. I proue it; first, because hee
saith, he rendred his obedience to the Emperor, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
not what he thought on Gods behalfe. Secondly,
because a few lines afore, hee telleth the Emperour vvhat
preferment Christ had bestovved on him, and what honor
he had done vnto him; among which this was one, that he
had committed his priestes to his charge, <hi>Sacerdotes meos

Christ will say vnto you, saith <hi>Gregory;</hi> I haue committed
my priests vnto your hands, and do you vvithdrawe your
souldiors from my seruice? By vvhich words it is apparant,
that <hi>Gregory</hi> yeelded his obedience, as he vvas a Byshop or
priest; and it skilleth not, that he saith in the beginning of
the Epistle, I speake not as Byshoppe, but in mine ovvne
priuate right: the reason is euident, because the publishing
of a vvicked Lavv, did not pertaine to him as hee vvas a


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1601:12"/>
Byshop (whose office is to preach Gods word, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
his Sacraments) but as a priuate man subiect vnto
his prince: And therefore he answered in his ovvn priuate
right, that it was not agreeable to Gods vvill, yet did hee
publish the same, to shevv his allegeance to his soueraign.</p>

                     <hi>Bell</hi> writeth that <hi>Barbarians</hi> possessed all <hi>Italy</hi>

                  <p>First, our Popes liue not alwaies at Rome, for they haue
many times beene driuen from thence, &amp; liued els where:
and shall we thereupon conclude, that therefore they cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be Popes? no papist will admit it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though the <hi>Aliens</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> did a long
time possesse all <hi>Italy,</hi> yet did the Byshops of Rome euer
acknowledge their duety and allegeance vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when the Pope is deade, in the <hi>Interim</hi> while
another is chosen, doe not the papistes acknowledge the
Popes supremacy? I weene they do. If <hi>S. R.</hi> shall denie
it, I vvill vse another argument against him. Euen so, when
the Emperors were not at Rome; yea, when there was no
Christian Emperour at all, the Byshops acknowledged the
right of his soueraignty.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, vvhen I say, that Popes or Byshops of Rome
liued in duetifull subiection, to the Emperours of Rome,
more then six hundred yeares after Christs sacred incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
euery childe knovveth the meaning; viz. that no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
during that time, denyed the Emperours superemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
power ouer him.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the Iesuite to further his lying, hath falsifyed
both my words and my meaning. Now, where I cited S.

though impudently and vnclerkly, that all the said writers
speake of superiority in Temporall matters; but hee can
bring for himselfe, neither Scripture, Counsell, Father,

word: For to the Pope and his Iesuites, no man may say,
<hi>Curitafacis?</hi> Why dost thou so? The Popes owne decrees
tell vs plainly, that though the Pope be neuer so vvicked,
though he carry thousands of soules with himselfe head-long
into hell; yet for all that may no man take vpon him
to iudge the Pope, vnlesse he be an Hereticke: the reason
is yeelded by their own deare Doctor <hi>Gerson,</hi>

there is not any aboue mee, but thy selfe alone, that

thee (O God) there is none aboue me. Al the aforenamed

or Byshop of Rome, is so farre from hauing power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Kings and Emperors, that hee himselfe ought to bee
subiect to them, &amp; hath no authority at al to punish them.</p>
                  <p>What can be more plainely spoken? What Testimonies
can be more manifest? What Doctrine can be clearer? for

                  <p>AFter I had proued at large by many authorities, that
Kinges haue supereminent power ouer Byshops, not

that the good Kinges, <hi>Iosue, Dauid, Salomon, Iehosophat,

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight well, that they had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
aboue all the priestes; and therefore they tooke vpon
them, not only to command and controll the priestes, but
also to depose them from theyr places and functions: yea,
euen the High-priests themselues, when their desertes did
so require. Which point I auouched to be proued at large,
in my <hi>Golden ballance of tryall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this discourse <hi>S. R.</hi> answereth foure thinges.</p>
                  <p>First, that <hi>Iosue</hi> was no king.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that no High-priest was deposed by any of
the saide Kinges.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that <hi>Abiathar</hi> the High-priest, was not depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by king <hi>Salomon,</hi> but onely confined to his house.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that if king <hi>Salomon</hi> had deposed <hi>Abiathar,</hi>
yet had he not done it as king, but as Prophet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My reply is this.</hi> First, that to deny <hi>Iosue</hi> to be king, is
a vaine cauill, and argueth lacke of matter in our <hi>Iesuites</hi>


                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1601:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
answere: for <hi>Iosue</hi> had the thing, though not the name: he
was the Ciuil independent Magistrate, and had the chiefe
and supereminent power ouer the Isralites his Subiects; as
<hi>Moses</hi> whom he succeeded had,<note place="margin">Num. 27, 17</note> and the other Kings, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
Salomon, Iosaphat, Ezekias,</hi> and <hi>Iosias.</hi> In regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he was and may bee truely reckoned, with and among
the other kings. But when good reasons cannot bee had,
such Beggerly cauils must supply the want.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it is a most notorious slander against the
holy Scripture, and consequently á notable blasphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God himselfe; to say, and desperately to avouch in
a printed Booke, that no High-priest was deposed by any
of the said Kinges. These are the expresse wordes of holie
writ. <hi>Eiecit ergo Salomon Abiathar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Reg. 2, 27</note> 
                     <hi>vt non esset sacerdos domini.</hi>
Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> cast out or deposed <hi>Abiathar</hi> (the high
Priest) that he should not be the Priest of the Lord. Again
holy writ hath these expresse wordes. <hi>Et Sadoc sacerdote po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
pro Abiathar,</hi> and the King put <hi>Sadoc</hi> the Priest,<note place="margin">vbi supra. verse 35.</note> in the
roome of <hi>Abiathar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Loe the holy scripture telleth vs two things most plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and expressely; and that is done euen in that Latin <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a
editio,</hi> to which the Pope hath tyed all his Iesuites and
Iesuited Popelings. The one, that King <hi>Salomon</hi> deposed
<hi>Abiathar</hi> the High-priest. The other, that hee placed <hi>Sadoc</hi>
the priest in <hi>Abiathars</hi> roome.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that it is most absurdly auouched of our Iesuit,
that <hi>Salomon</hi> onely confined <hi>Abiathar</hi> to his house for a
time. Concerning this deposition and casting out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biathar</hi>
from his place, and putting <hi>Sadoc</hi> the priest in his
roome, our Iesuite is at his wits end what to say: and why
I pray you? For this end doubtles, because hence it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
euidently, and by a necessary consecution, that Kings
both haue and may depose priests, euen the hie priests, and
greatest priests of all. But it can neuer be proued out of the
holy scriptures, that any Priest deposed any King; no, not
the meanest king in all the world. The Iesuite contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1601:14"/>
himselfe mightily. For first hee saith, that none of the
Kings deposed any priest, Secondly, that <hi>Salomon</hi> depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Abiathar.</hi> Thirdly, that <hi>Abiathar</hi> was not deposed, but
onely for a time confined to his owne house. What hors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e
would not breake his necke, to heare this sweet melodie?
The scripture telleth vs,<note place="margin">3 Reg. 2, v. 27. &amp; v. 35.</note> that king <hi>Salomon</hi> deposed <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar,</hi>
and for confirmation heereof, the same scripture ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
that <hi>Sadoc</hi> the priest, was set in his roome.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to say as the Iesuite doeth, that Salomon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<hi>Abiathar</hi> not as King, but as prophet, is to speake at
randon, and to make of scripture a nose of wax, for no one
Text from the first of <hi>Genesis</hi> to the last of the <hi>Apocalipse,</hi>
doth iustifie this fond and sottish answer of the masked Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite;
albeit, I know this to bee true, that he wanted not
the aduise and counsell of his best learned Brethren. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
desireth further in sight into this subiect, and of the

their subiects; if he peruse my Golden ballance of tryall, I

to the glory of God? Alas, alas, euery childe that hath but
learned the rudiments of Christianity, can roundly tel our
Iesuite, that we must not so much respect what is done, as
what ought of right to be done. We may not reason as our
Iesuite <hi>Parsons</hi> doth (for he is the man) the thing was don,
therefore lawfully done. Kings yeelded supreame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the Pope, therefore they did it lawfuly. By that kind
of Logicke or rather Legierdemain, all theftes, all robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
all Rebellions, all mischiefes vnder heauen, may bee
iustifyed and defended. You Iesuites, and your Iesuited
pope-lings, do take part with the Pope against your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
Soueraigne; and so by this new (no Diuinity) the
pope is our King and Superiour. For thus you reason, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Kings haue so done, the Pope is their Superiour. For
the question is not, vpon whose grounde they did so, but


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1601:15"/>
whether they did so or no. For by your Theology, if the
thing be done, it is lawfully done, but what? <hi>Bell</hi> perhaps
thinkes, that blinde zeale dissanulleth euery fact, and so
neither the Iewes persecuted the Church, nor our papistes
gaue any liuing to the Church, because they did it (as <hi>Bell</hi>
must thinke) vpon blind zeale. O monster of al Monsters?
ô Child of perdition? ô sonne of the Deuill? <hi>Bell</hi> saith not,
that blind zeale disanulleth any act. <hi>Bell</hi> saith not, that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
gaue no liuings to the Church. <hi>Bell</hi> saith not, that the
Iewes did not persecute the Church. No, no, it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
in our Iesuite, that mooues him thus falsly to slaunder
<hi>Bell.</hi> It is one thing to say, the papists gaue liuinges to the
Church vpon a blinde zeale; another thing to say, they
gaue nothing at all. The former I say, the latter I denie: &amp;
therefore, when you papists labour to proue the popes so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty
ouer Kings, because some Kings, haue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
it, vpon a blind zeale; I answer, that your proofe is
of no force, not for that such thinges haue not bin done;
but because they were not done, as they should, &amp; ought
to haue bin done. You papists haue submitted your selues
to be the Popes, and the King of Spaines subiects, as <hi>Story</hi>

beleeue in your harts, and practise in your liues. Your late
Treason of Gunne-powder, to say nothing of all the rest,

                  <p>This is my reply. First,<note place="margin">See the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d chapt. for this point.</note> that one may yeeld vp some part
of his Soueraignty to another, and for all that remaine &amp;
still continue that others Superior. The case is cleere, it
needeth no proofe. If the Iesuite will not yeeld to this, he
must perforce yeeld to that, which will confound both him
and the Pope, viz: that the pope is superior to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
euen in <hi>Temporalibus.</hi> The reason is euident, because
the Pope challengeth the Temporall soueraigne right of
Italy, and the free donation of the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if euery one that humbleth himselfe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becommeth by and by that others inferiour; then
doubtles, the priest that is confessary to the Pope, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the popes superiour: For to answere, that the Pope
doth not humble himselfe to his ghostly father, is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
absurd, but flat against the Popes religion: And yet our
Iesuite disputeth thus. Catholiques argue, that Kinges and
Emperors haue acknowledged Popes their superiors.<note place="margin">Page 37</note> This
<hi>Bell</hi> graunteth, in confessing their humiliation to Popes,
which is neuer done but to superiors. Alas, alas, I pittie
the Iesuites folly. For first, in Popery, euery king hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
himselfe to a silly priest: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the priest is the kings
superiour.</p>
                  <p>Againe, euerie papist humbleth himselfe, to Images<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
dead bones, and especially to the wood of the crosse; yea,
sometimes to the bones of an Heretique, as I haue proued
in the Article of traditions. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Images, dead bones,
wood, &amp;c. are superiors to the Papists. Thirdly, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
are commanded to humble themselues to that, which
the Priest holdeth ouer his head at Masse; which by their
Doctrine, if it lacke consecration, (as it may many waies
fall out,) is but a bare piece of bread. <hi>Ergo</hi> a piece of Bakers


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1601:16"/>
bread, is their superior. Fourthly, Pope <hi>Siluester</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
sometime a Monke, a Frenchman borne, <hi>Gilbertus</hi> by
name, humbled himselfe to the deuill, &amp; yeelded homage
to him, so long as the deuill accomplished his desire. This
story is set downe at large in my Suruey of Poperie. Now,
that the deuill of hell was and is his superior, both to this
Pope and to many others, I admit your argument with all
applause.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, kings do often humble themselues to their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> their subiects are their superiors. Sixtly, the
Emperor humbleth himselfe many times, euen vnto those
that owe duety to him: <hi>Ergo</hi> his inferiors,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15, 5. 6</note> become his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors.
Lastly, <hi>Absalom</hi> when any man came neere vnto
him and did him obeysance, put forth his hand, and tooke
him, and kissed him, and on this manner did <hi>Absalom</hi> to al
Israel, that came to the King for Iudgement. <hi>Ergo,</hi> euerie
man in Israel, was <hi>Absaloms</hi> superiour. But the contrarie is
the truth, and our Iesuite a most notorious lyar.</p>

the eares, legges, nose, and all, and so fast bound with
linkes and chaines of yron, as the Pope and all his Iesuited
Vassals, are neuer able to deliuer him out of my handes.
For albeit <hi>Constantine</hi> that most Noble Emperor, gaue not
the Pope his whole power and Dominion ouer <hi>Rome, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and all the West, nor any part thereof; yet doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
consequently, that his departure from Rome to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
was the first step to Popish falsly supposed Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.
The reason is euident, because the Emperor being
farre off at <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the East, the false pretended
donation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Constantine</hi> was holden &amp; beleeued for a tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
The multitude in the western parts, being too too cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,
gaue credit to false reports, and rashly and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderately
beleeued, that the Emperor had made a decree,
that the Pope and his successors should weare the crowne
of pure gold and precious stones which he had giuen him
from off his owne head. So that lying, and cogging, was
the first step of the Popes exalting. For, who woulde not
giue honour to him, who was so honoured of the King?
Although in truth the Popes rising, was nothing else but
a meere leasing.</p>
                  <p>I haue proued soundly out of famous Popish Writers,
that <hi>Constantines</hi> pretended donation was a meere fable, &amp;
that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe, standeth in doubt thereof, and

will not serue the turne. Howsoeuer this be, <hi>Constantines</hi>

Rome; the Emperor remaining in the East, was not able
to defend his imperiall right in the West, but by little and
little was dispossessed thereof. Then the Popes frends pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
the Empire by his good helpe and furtherance, and
willing to requite one good turne with another, sought
by all meanes possible to aduance and exalt the Pope. And
so the fall of the Empire, was a step for the Pope to climb
vp to his Lordly primacy. This may be made manifest, by
the daily practise of the Pope and his Iesuites. For the

my words, which is his vsuall manner. For my wordes are
not (vnder Emperors) but (to the Emperors.) Againe, I
saide not (in duetifull obedience,) but (in subiection.)
Now, euery child knoweth, that there is great difference


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1601:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
betweene vnder and to. As also, betweene obedience and
subiection. For our English Iesuites, are our Kinges sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
against their will, and yet they liue not in obedience
to him. Secondly, many liue in externall obedience to
the King, as doe our English Iesuites, in acknowledging
the Kings superiority ouer them; who for all that seeke to
climbe vp on high, by poysoning and murdering his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty,
if God would permit. Thirdly, to liue in obedience
or subiection to Emperors, is nothing else in my sence &amp;
true meaning; but to confesse and freely graunt, that of
right they ought to be subiect to Christian Emperours, as
to their lawfull Soueraignes. Which subiection our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
can neuer prooue any Pope to haue denied, for the
space of 600. yeares and odde. Heere I cannot but tell
our Iesuite of his arrogant sawcinesse, ioyned with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious

Forsooth, that he was so made for necessity sake, and (as
all men know) necessity hath no law. But what necessitie
was it? We haue heard already out of <hi>Platina;</hi> because the
Citty was besieged of the enemy, so as none coulde haue
passage to the Emperor. The Iesuite therefore is a fonde
disputer, bringing that for him, which maketh wholy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and confoundeth both himselfe, and his pope
euerlastingly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, where foolish and Traiterous Iesuite <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
laboureth to defend the Pope by the creation of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerius,</hi>
because he was created at the commaund of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date</hi>
a <hi>Gothish</hi> King; it maketh as much against him,<note place="margin">Platini in vita Siluerii.</note> as his
former sottish, and sencelesse affirmation. For after that
<hi>Platina</hi> hath tolde vs that <hi>Siluerius</hi> was made Byshoppe or
Pope, at the commaund of <hi>Theodate</hi> a <hi>Gothish</hi> King, hee by
and by addeth these words. <hi>Cum antea non regum, sed impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorum
autoritas, interveniret,</hi> whereas in former times,
not the Authority of Kings, but of Emperors was requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Marke these wordes, Gentle Reader, and detest the
deceitfull dealing of all Trayterous and cozening Iesuits.
The Iesuite <hi>Parsons</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Pag 53</note> that <hi>Platina</hi> speaketh of the
time since Pope <hi>Virgillius:</hi> But we see, that <hi>Platina</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of the time before <hi>Siluerius;</hi> which <hi>Siluerius</hi> was before
<hi>Vigiius.</hi> Yea, <hi>Pelagius</hi> the second was also after <hi>Vigilius:</hi> &amp;
so our Iesuite is turned vpside-downe, and beaten with
his owne rod. To the fourth step, which was the depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Childericke</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi>

                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:1601:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
First, that 800. years after Christs sacred byrth the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of Rome were subiect to the Emperor, as their own
deare Monke <hi>Sigebert</hi> telleth them; and as we haue heard
already, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> acknowledged his fealty to <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius</hi>
the Emperor, in the yeare 603.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the Pope and people of Rome endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a long time, to shake off the yoake of obedience vnto
the Emperour, and in the yeare 801. put the same in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that the Translation of the Empire implyed
flat Treason, both in the Pope and all his Romish Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.

                  <speaker>T. B.</speaker>
                  <p>I answere; first, that many thinges are holden for good
generally, which for all that are indeede counterfeite and
false. Two most notable markes wee haue heereof. The
one in Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the woman, as is prooued at large in my
<hi>Suruey.</hi> The other in the Actes of Pope <hi>Stephanus</hi> &amp; Pope
<hi>Romanus,</hi> as I haue prooued in my Booke of <hi>Motiues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the Emperor hath not his authority from
the Pope but from God. <hi>Per me reges regnant.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prou. 8, 15 16. Rom. 13, 1</note> By me kings
raigne, and princes decree Iustice. By me princes rule, and
the Nobles, and all the Iudges of the earth. Let euery one
be subiect vnto higher powers; for there is no power but
of God, and the powers that be, are ordained of GOD.
Therefore the Emperour cannot haue his power from the
Pope, vnlesse he bee (as some impudently haue written)
both God and man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the constitution for the electors of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
was not established so much by the Pope, as by the
authority of the Emperour, the Popes neere kinsman, as
is already proued.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, from the time of <hi>Otho</hi> the third, when <hi>Henri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
had stirred vp a great contention about his successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and all Germany was diuided into parts; it was proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by publick authority, that there should be seuen elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

selfe into the death of any man. Loe Gentle Reader, for
the space of 600. yeares and odde, the Byshops of Rome
durst not deale in absoluing subiects from their alegeance,
nor in murdering of Kings and Emperors. And why I pray
you? This their owne deare Saint, <hi>Gregory</hi> (surnamed the
great) telleth vs, because he feared God, &amp; consequently,
the late Bishops of Rome dare embrue their harts &amp; hands
in the bloud of Gods anointed, because they haue not the
feare of GOD before their eyes. Yea, the Popes owne
Monke (as wee haue heard out of <hi>Sigebert</hi> already) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
it flat Heresie,<note place="margin">Sigebert. An. 1088. fol. 117. K</note> to absolue subiects from the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
due vnto their Soueraigne. And what saith theyr
<hi>Pontaus Burdegalensis?</hi> these are his words; <hi>Hic primus cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
francos iuramento fidlitatis absoeluere.</hi> This Pope (<hi>Zachary</hi>)
was the first, that absolued the Frenchmen from the oath
of their fealty and allegeance.</p>
                  <p>This Pope liued about the yeare of our Lord God 752.
so that it was neuer heard of among the French-men for
the space of 750.<note place="margin">Chron. An: 1088</note> yeares, that the Byshop of Rome tooke
vpon him to absolue subiects from their oth &amp; allegeance
to their Soueraigne. And <hi>Sigebertus</hi> proceedeth further, &amp;
reproueth it as a Nouelty, or rather Heresie, lately crept
into the Church. And who I pray you can doe this, but
Christ Iesus, as true God, so true man? Doth not he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the right, at the least of the spirituall sword, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vpon him to absolue subiects from the oth of their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance?
Nay, doth hee not take vnto him the right of
both swords? For absolution I am well assured, is euen by
popish Doctrine, an act of spirituall iurisdiction; and to
serue the prince, is a secular and meere ciuil act? <hi>Antoninus</hi>
sometime Arch-byshop of Florence,<note place="margin">Anton: 3: par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tit. 22: cap: 5 §. 8.</note> and a Popish canno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
Saint, telleth vs without blushing, that the Pope is
Christs Vicar on earth, &amp; hath equal power with God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.
These are his expresse words; <hi>Cum aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Vicarius
Christi si papa, &amp;c.</hi> For seeing the Po. is the Vicar of Christ,
none can lawfully withdraw himselfe from his obedience,


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1601:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as none can lawfully withdraw himselfe from Gods obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
And as Christ receiued of his father, the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and scepter of the Gentiles arising of Israel, ouer all
principality and power, and aboue euery thing that hath
being, that to him euery knee may bend; euen so Christe
hath committed most full power, to Peter and his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.
Thus writeth our holy Arch-byshop <hi>Antoninus.</hi>
Out of whose wordes I obserue first, that as Christ is the
the head ouer his Church, so is the Pope or Byshoppe of
Rome head of the same.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that as Christ receiued of God the Dukedom
ouer all power, so hath the Pope receiued the same power
of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that as Christ hath power aboue and ouer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
thing, whatsoeuer hath any being; so hath the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that as to Christ euery knee must be bowed,
so also to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Now, if this be not to challenge the royall right of both
swords, let the indifferent Reader iudge. Neither is it to
the purpose, to say that hee challengeth not Royall right.
For I weene, our Iesuite will not deny Royall right vnto
Christ, who is Lord of heauen and earth, true God, true
priest, and true King. And yet doth <hi>Antoninus</hi> ascribe and
yeeld vnto the pope, all power ouer all that hath any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in as ample and large manner as Christ himselfe hath
it. Yea, that <hi>Omnia genna,</hi> al knees must bow to the pope,
And the vsuall practise of papists do confirme the same, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the popes good liking. For he must be carried vpon
mens shoulders, and men kneeling, must kisse the shoo of
his foot, or else not be thought to loue Christ or S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
This my selfe being an eye-witnesse thereof, am able to
testifie. When <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth of that name, came
to the English Colledge in Rome, all the Students vvere
appointed by the Iesuite then maister of the Colledge, to
come two after two before him, sitting in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

kneele downe on both knees in a great chamber, three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1601:26"/>
times, before they offred to kisse his foot. And while
they kissed his foot (or the shoo of his foot) one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the rest followed as it wer in procession, falling down
three times as is already said. But let vs heare the Verdict
of Fryer <hi>Austen de Ancona.</hi> The Pope (saith he) as he that is
the Vicar of the sonne of the heauenly Emperor,<note place="margin">In summam, pag. 152</note> hath V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersal
iurisdiction ouer al kingdomes and Empires. And
is not this power ouer both swordes? Is not this to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
power proper to God alone? I weene it is, let others
iudge.</p>

can make something of nothing, he must perforce be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Who could euer thinke that the Papists would bee so
impudent, as to deny the expresse words of the text. Nay,
I will proue it by the circumstances, to the Iesuites euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
shame and confusion.</p>
                  <p>For first, if the assertion were borrowed from
the ciuill law, and meant of ciuill contracts, pacts, or sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations,
as our Iesuite impudently auoucheth, (but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his owne conscience, if he haue any left) then shuld
it not be <hi>aliquid,</hi> but <hi>aliquod;</hi> as euery meane <hi>Gramarian,</hi> can
and will testifie with me.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the glosse saith, the Pope can change the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of thinges, by applying the substance of one thing to
another. But doubtlesse, when the Emperor maketh that
to be a ciuill contract, which afore was none; hee doeth
not apply the substance of one thing to another, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commandeth his subiects to accept that for a law, which
before was none.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, no mortall man can apply the substance of one
thing to another, and so change the nature thereof. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Pope take vppon him, to chaunge bread into
Christs body. And therefore, when the glosse addeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately;
(and of nothing he can make something,) hee
meaneth of that diuine power, which is propper to GOD
alone. Like as <hi>Antoninus</hi> affirmed, (as is already proued)
that the Pope doth challenge power, <hi>super omne quodcunque
est,</hi> ouer euery thing whatsoeuer is and hath any being;
and consequently, ouer God himselfe. And so, whether
he be Antichrist or no, I referre it to the iudgement of the
Reader; for if the Pope be aboue God,<note place="margin">Anton. 3. pag. tit. 22: cap: 5 §. 8.</note> I dare not take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my selfe to bee his iudge. Neither will it serue to say,
that Saint <hi>Antoninus</hi> doth not affirm the Pope to be aboue
God. For though he say not so expressely, yet doth hee
affirme so much virtually; when he telleth vs, that hee is
aboue euery thing that hath being. For God hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a being, but such a supereminent being, as surpasseth all
intelligence, and is the cause of the being of all creatures.</p>

These are my wordes in my Booke;<note place="margin">In the downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of popery. Page 16</note> and yet the truth is,
that as man can in some cases at some time make one thing
of another; so in all cases, at all times, to make something
of nothing, is proper to God alone. Yet the lying and
impudent Iesuite, not able to encounter me, nor to gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
my proofes and reasons, laboreth with might &amp; maine
to disgrace me with the Reader, &amp; to get the victory with
flat lying. Our slanderous and rayling Iesuite, reporteth
my wordes in this manner; for saith <hi>Bell</hi>) it is a thinge
proper to God, to make something of nothing in al ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and at al times. So then, all that I said was this; (viz)
That though man can at sometime in some cases, make one

                  <p>Our Iesuite flyeth quite from my argument (because it
striketh him dead) and laboureth to proue that Christes
body is in the Sacrament. But all in vaine: For first, that
is not now in question. Againe, he is to answere me, and
not to wander about impertinent matters. Thirdly, I haue
answered all that he obiecteth here, as also all that can be
obiected on their behalfe, in my <hi>Suruey of Popery</hi> many
yeares ago: to which no Papist durst euer frame an answer
vnto this day. Fourthly, I willingly grant, the holy bread
in the blessed <hi>Eucharist</hi> to be Christes body, and the holy
wine to be his bloud; yet not really and substantially, as
the Papists hold; but mystically and sacramentally, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the truth of Gods word. And I retort the Iesuites
reason out of Christes wordes, against himselfe. For, if
Christ had not meant, that his body was then giuen sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,
and not really; he would haue said (which shall
be giuen) not which is giuen, in the <hi>Present tense.</hi> I proue
it; because, if Christs body had then beene giuen really,
and his bloud then shed really for the sinnes of the world;
no other Sacrifice, attonement, satisfaction, or reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
had beene needfull on our behalfe: which how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1601:29"/>
it is, euery childe can discerne. Christs meaning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is this; This is my body sacramentally, Or this is the

                  <p>But to come to Bels reason:<note place="margin">Pag 95</note> How proueth he it to bee

                  <p>Heere our Iesuite bestirreth himselfe to proue if it wold
be, that Christs body is not both contained and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in their Sacrament; but all in vaine. For his proofes
(if they were true, as they be falfe) would onely conclude
this, and nothing else; viz. that God is able to do it.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>S. R.</speaker>
                  <p>For albeit it be contradiction for a greater body occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying
a place proportionate to it greatnes, to be contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in a lesse, (for so it should both be contained and not
contained in the lesse,) yet no contradiction at all it is, for
a greater body retayning it greatnes, to be so coarcted by
Gods omnipotency, that it fill a place farre lesse, then is
naturally due or proportionate to it greatnes. For in this
case it followeth not, that it should both be contained, &amp;
not contained in the lesser bodie, (as in the former case,)
but contained onely. And thus we say, hath Christ dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of his bodie in the Sacrament. Wee proue it by manie
waies.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T. B.</speaker>
                  <p>I aunswere, with all subiection and due reuerence vnto
Gods omnipotent power, that God cannot doe any thing
which eyther implyeth contradiction in it selfe, or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in God. Not because there is any defect in GOD
himselfe, (God forbid wee should so thinke) but because
there is defect in the thing that should so be done. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the former, God cannot make a dead man remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1601:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dead to be liuing; albeit he can raise a dead man to
life againe. So neyther can God make a blinde man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
blinde to see, nor a deafe man remaining deafe
to heare; nor a dumbe man remaining dumbe to speake;
albeit he can restore seeing to the blinde, hearing to the
deafe, and speech to the dumbe. By reason of the latter,
God can neyther make another God, nor any creature e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to himselfe, nor commit any sinne, nor faile in his
promise, nor repent of any thing that he hath done. Now,
to coarct a great body so, retaining it greatnes still, that
it may be conteined in a lesse body, implyeth flat contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
not for the reason which our Iesuite bringeth,
but because it is against the intrinsecall reason and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Essence of quantity, which is to haue <hi>parte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> extra partem,</hi>
one part without another. And consequently, our Iesuits
supposed coarctation, implyeth flat contradiction. For it
is impossible to conceiue or vnderstand, how a body eight
cubits long, and eight cubits broad, remaining so long &amp;
so broad, hauing euery part without other, to be contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of another body, being but seuen cubits long, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
cubits broad. It implyeth as flat contradiction, as to
make a deafe man remaining deafe to heare. It is therefore
impossible to all power, both create and vncreate; to
make Christs body to be contained in a little round cake,
in the Popish Masse.</p>

                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Page 96.</note> because Christs body in his natiuity, opened not his
Virgin-mothers wombe. <hi>Ergo,</hi> then it occupyed not a
roome, naturally proportionate to the greatnesse. The
consequence is euident, and the antecedent is proued by
many fathers.</p>

                  <speaker>T. B.</speaker>
                  <p>I deny both the consequence, and the antecedent. The
consequence, because if it were as the Iesuite supposeth,
(which I deny) yet should Christes body haue occupied a
roome, naturally proportionate to the greatnes thereof.


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1601:30"/>
And our Iesuite denying it, vnawares affirmeth all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to be vnnaturally in their mothers wombes. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent,
because Christ opened his mothers wombe as
other children do.</p>
                  <p>For first,<note place="margin">Luk. 2, 23 Exod. 13, 2 Num. 8, 15 Heb. 2, 17 &amp; 4, 15. Suruey page 474.</note> Christ was presented to the Lord according to
the Law, as the Holy-ghost dooth record; yet the Lawe
required such presentation, onely of them, which opened
their mother wombe. Secondly, Christ was made like
vnto his Brethren in all things, sin onely excepted. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the auncient Fathers, <hi>Tertullian, Origen, Ambrose,</hi> and
<hi>Hierome,</hi> are of the same opinion. Their expresse words are
set downe at large in my <hi>Suruey of Popery.</hi> And it will not
serue the turne, to say as some do, that though Christ was
borne of a Virgin, yet should she haue bene corrupted, &amp;
no Virgin, if her wombe had beene opened in the byrth
of Christ.</p>
                  <p>For first, not onely holy writ, but the auncient Fathers
also, and other learned Deuines, are to be heard before all
Physitions, in the misteries of our faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Fernetius</hi> maketh nothing for the Papistes, as
who speaketh only of the dilatation of the Matrice, &amp; that
after the naturall and ordinary course.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, albeit it be most true, (as all holy Writers with
vniforme assent do contest) that Christs holy Mother the
blessed Virgin Mary, was euer a pure Virgin, before his
birth, in his birth, and after his birth; yet it is likewise
true,<note place="margin">Aquin. 22, q. 52. ar. 1. ad. 3</note> that her wombe was opened in his byrth, as is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
proued. For as their owne Angellicall D. sayth, (whose
Doctrine sundry Popes one after another haue confirmed)
Virginity is not lost by fraction of the signacle, but by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the minde, and purpose of the will.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath a learned and large discourse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this onely point of Doctrine; wherein he sheweth
grauely,<note place="margin">Aug. lib: 1 de ciuit. dei cap. 18</note> that the apertion of the matrice, may bee done,
sundry waies; (viz:) either by Arte in the way of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
or by violence of the corrupter, or by other acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1601:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
means; and that Virginity this notwithstanding, may
be free from all corruption. Much more might Christes
most holy mothers wombe, bee opened by his diuine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and neuerthelesse her most sacred wombe, still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
inviolable.</p>

                  <p>God can by his omnipotency bring a Cammell through

                  <p>I answere first, that this sillogisme is vnfitly couched, &amp;

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the consequence is so against all rules of
Logicke, as the framer thereof, is worthy to be hissed out
of all schoooles.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Mat. 19, 24</note> the Gospell saith indeed, it is easier for a Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell
to passe through the eye of a Needle, then for a rich
man to enter into the kingdome of heauen. But no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
no Apostle, no Epistle, no Gospell sayth, as our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
doth. For as these wordes, (keeping his riches) are
the Scripture of our sawcie Popeling, but not the holy
scripture; so also are these words, (keeping his greatnes,)
the inuention of his own brain. And therfore I must salute
him with these words of the holy Apostle; though we,<note place="margin">Galat. 1, 8.</note> or
an Angell from heauen preach any other Gospell to you,
then that which we haue preached to you, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that by the word (<hi>Camell</hi>) may be vnderstood
a cable rope, and not a beast. For the Greeke word is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to them both.<note place="margin">Vide tu The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophil: in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo locum:</note> 
                     <hi>Cauinius</hi> obseruerh out of the <hi>Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudists,</hi>
that it is a prouerbial phrase, by which Christ doth
insinuate vnto vs, that rich men do not without great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
enter into heauen.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, that a Camell keeping his greatnes still, cannot
possibly by any power passe through a Needles eye, the


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1601:31"/>
Needle still keeping the former quantity. The reason is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident,
because it implyeth flat contradiction, as is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
proued. Not for that there is any defect in the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
of God, (who is able to do more, then mans wit
can comprehend) but because there is repugnance in the
thing that should be done.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, that God can dilate the eie of a Needle so, as a
Camell may passe through the same, and that without any
preiudice to the naturall quantity of his body.</p>

                  <p>GOD made the furnace of Babylon,<note place="margin">Page 99</note> though neuer so
hot,<note place="margin">Dan. 3, 35</note> not to heat, yea to refresh the three children. Why
then can hee not make a great body, to occupy but a smal
roome? For to occupy place is an effect and accident of
quantity, as to heat, is of heate.</p>

                  <speaker>T. B.</speaker>
                  <p>I thus reply; first, Scripture is to our Iesuite as a nose of
wax. He addeth to it, and taketh away from it, as seemeth
good in his owne conceit. For, that fire did refresh the 3.
Haebrewes, no Scripture doth affirme.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whether to occupy place be an effect and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
of quantity, or no, because it is diuersly holden of
diuers learned men, and nothing pertinent to our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie,
transeat for the present. For, whether occupying
of place be intrinsecall or extrinsecall to quantity, it skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not for this matter, and this question nowe in hand.
The reason is euident, because to haue <hi>partem extrapartem</hi>
one part without another, is by vniforme assent of al lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Writers, as well of Phylosophers as of Diuines, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecall
and essentiall vnto quantity, as it can by no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
neither create, nor vncreate, be taken away from it.
And this is the cause, not occupation of place, why christs
body beeing greater, cannot bee contained in the Popish
round cake.</p>
                  <p>This was my former reason, and it stands stil vntouched,
neither can all the Iesuites in the worlde, euer yeelde a


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1601:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sound answere to the same. For if they could, it shoulde
now haue beene performed. Because our Iesuite hath had
the best aduice and helpe, that any of them could possibly
make him. Heere by the way I m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

monster in the Popish host or Cake, (viz:) of their
accidents without subiects. Which their position is against
all Phylosophy, all reason, all learning. It is a constant
axiome generally receiued in all Schooles: <hi>Accidentis esse
est inesse.</hi> The essence and being of an accident, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
and being in the subiect. No Text in the lawe of
<hi>Moses;</hi> no sentence in the Prophet; no word in the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes;
no affirmation out of the Gospell; no Testimony out
of the Epistles of the Apostles; no verdict out of the holy
Fathers; no note out of the Auncient Counsels can euer
be found; which once maketh mention of accidents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
subiects. This may suffice for answere to sundry other
impertinent bibble babbles, which our Iesuite powreth
out by ladle fuls in this Chapter.</p>

must be read warily, who saith, that there appeareth not
any coactiue thing in the Gospell, by which we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
Heretiques to vnderstande these wordes, <hi>This is my
body,</hi> properly. But wee must hold this to be onely of the
authority of the Church, which so declareth the words of
consecration. Thus writeth <hi>Iosephus Angles,</hi> out of whose
words, I note first, that <hi>Caietane</hi> who was a learned man,
a Domincan Fryer, and sometime Cardinal of Rome, must
be read warily. Secondly, the cause for which he must be
warily read, and that consisteth of these two heads. First,
that no Text in the whole Gospel can be produced, which
conuinceth these words (<hi>This is my Body</hi>) to be vnderstood
properly.</p>
                  <p>Marry sir, it is high time indeed, to read this Cardinal wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
for if his words were wel knowne and marked of all
Papists, I weene they would forsake the Pope, thicke and
threefold; If these words (<hi>this is my body</hi>) be not vnderstood
properly, as Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> telleth vs; then doubtlesse
farewell the Popish reall presence: then downe with the
Pope, then downe with Popish Masse and at all. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> telleth vs plainely, that it is not the
scripture, but the authority of the Pope or Church (which
is all one in effect) that causeth vs so to vnderstande these
words (<hi>this is my body.</hi>) If this Cardinall durst haue sayde
all he thought against the Popes doctrine, it seemeth, he
would haue tolde vs more. Now, let the Reader Iudge,

holde constantly as an Article of the Christian fayth, that
the true body of Christ is truely and really in the Sacrifice

                  <p>Marke gentle Reader, for Christes sake, and then shalt
thou see, that our Iesuit hath nothing in him but falshood,
lying, and Hypocrisie. The Iesuite will needs haue me to
contradict my selfe, because <hi>Aquinas</hi> contradicteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
What equity? What charity? What reason is in this
man? I charge them in my <hi>Motiues</hi> and elsewhere, with
manifold dissentions and contradictions: plainely telling
them, that if they would be consonant to their writinges,
then we and they should soone agree. But our Iesuite can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure, to heare himselfe and his fellowes confounded
by their owne writings.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs see, who vnderstandeth <hi>Aquinas</hi> aright. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi>
holdeth, that Christs body is in the popish cake, and
withal, that one body cannot be in two places at once. Our
Iesuite would reconcile this apparant contradiction thus.
<hi>Aquinas</hi> meaning saith he, is plaine and euident. For hee


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1601:33"/>
thinketh Christs owne dimensions to bee the cause of his
being in that place, where he is naturally;<note place="margin">Page 102</note> and the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the bodie which is Transubstantiated, the cause of
his being, where he is Sacramentally. Here our Iesuite first
taketh vppon him, to tell what men thinke; which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to God alone. Then he feyneth a distinction, of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
being of Christes body. For if we once take away fey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
Popery will soone come to mourning.</p>
                  <p>Christes owne dimensions, sayth our Iesuite, are the
cause of Christs naturall being; but the dimensions of the
bread changed and Transubstantiated into Christs body,
(O horrible blasphemy,) are the cause of Christes sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
being. The Papists hold generally, that the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of bread in their consecrated host or cake, remaine
there without a subiect. But heere we haue another tale:
viz. That they are in Christs body. Most miserable is that

                  <p>First, in Christs natiuity, two bodies were in one place
at once, because Christes body opened not his mothers
wombe.</p>
                  <p>2 Againe, Christ arose out of the sepulchre, the stone not
being roled away.</p>
                  <p>3. Christ came to his disciples when the doores were shut,
and so both his body, and the wood of the doore, were in
one place at once: <hi>Ergo,</hi> two bodies may bee in one place
at once: and consequently, one body may be in two places
at once.</p>

                  <speaker>T. B.</speaker>
                  <p>Concerning the opening of the Virgins wombe, I haue
answered sufficiently already. For the rolling away of the
stone from the Sepulchre; I answere, that the Angell of
God had done it away before Christs resurrection,<note place="margin">Mat. 28, 6.</note> and had
brought it to the mouth of the sepulchre againe. What
need many wordes? the answere of the Angell to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
doth fully determine this question. <hi>He is not here</hi> (sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Angell) <hi>for he is risen as he saide.</hi> Loe, Christs body
was not in the Sepulchre, because Christ was risen: so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Angell reason. But Gods Angell must goe to the
schoole againe, to learne to frame his argument in better
manner, if one body can bee in two places at once. And
why? for the women might haue said to the Angel. What
if he be risen? Yet may his body be heere stil in the graue.
For one body may be in two places at once. But the Angel
reasoned thus. He is risen, therfore he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be here. Or he


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1601:34"/>
not heere, because, he is risen. These are the words of the
Ang. <hi>oukestin oode, egerthe gar, kathoos eipe.</hi> He is not heer, for
hee is risen,<note place="margin">Mat. 28, 6.</note> as he said. Where I obserue, first the assertion
simply in it selfe. Secondly, the cause and reason of the
same assertion. The assertion is this; Christ is not in the
Sepulchre. The reason heereof is this; because Christ is
risen.</p>
                  <p>Now then, since Christ cannot be in the sepulchre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is risen; it followeth of necessity, that eyther the
Angell of God inspired with Gods holy spirit, made a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
foolish and friuolous argument (which to affirme is void
of all Christianity) or else, that Christs body cannot be in
two places at once; which is that indeed, which I intende
to proue. For, if it were not as I say; the women might
haue replyed effectually against the Angell thus; albeit
Christ be risen as you say, yet may he be also in the sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre
still; for he may be in two places at once. But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
of GOD reputing it a thing cleere and euident, that
Christes body could not bee in two places at one and the
selfe-same time; concluded directly and forcibly (as hee
thought) Christs absence in the sepulchre, because he was
risen againe.</p>

When therefore any substaunce is a bodie, the quantity
thereof is in the magnitude of the bignesse; but the health
or soundnesse is not the quantity, but the quality thereof.
The quantity therefore of the body could not attain that,
which the quality could. For the partes being so distant,
which could not be together, because all seuerallie keepe
their spaces of places, the lesse, lesser places; and the great,
greater places; there could not be in all the places seueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the whole, or so much; but there is a larger quantity in
the larger parts, a shorter in shorter partes, and in no part
so much as in the whole. For if spaces of places bee taken
from bodies, they shal be in no place; and because they
shall be in no place, neyther shall they haue any being at

                  <p>Thirdly, that two quantities cannot bee in the same
place, and at and the same time.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that a greater quantity must haue a greater
place, and that it cannot be contained in the lesser.</p>

whole.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, that when bodies are without places, they then
loose their Natures and beings. I therefore conclude, that
it is impossible for Christs Naturall body, to be contained
in a little round Popish cake, and his whole body in euery
little part thereof. All which for all that, the Papists this

                     <hi>Bell</hi> will wring the contrary out of <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> as water
out of a flint. First, because he granteth, that a sacrafice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth
intrinsecally the consumption of the thing sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.<note place="margin">Page 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But this is answerd out of <hi>Bellar.</hi> teaching that Christ
hath two kinds of being; to wit, naturally, and sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally.
And the consumption of his sacramentall beeing in
the Masse, is no killing, because is is not by reall separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his soule and body, but onely by consuming the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
formes, in which he was sacramentally.</p>

                  <speaker>T. B.</speaker>
                  <p>We see heere freely graunted to vs, that a sacrifice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
intrinsecally the consumption of the thing sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
Let vs hold this while wee haue it, or else our Iesuite
will out of hand take it from vs. Then let vs adde this vnto
it; viz: That no liuing thing after it be consumed, can stil
haue life in it. And consequently, eyther Christ is not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sacrificed in the Popish Masse, (contrary to the doctrine
of the Pope and his Iesuites) or else he is there consumed
a thousande times a day, and so often killed in the Masse.
For to be consumed is more then to be killed. The case is
cleere, euery childe may perceiue it. But what? hath our
Iesuite no euasion? Yes forsooth, but it is a very silly one.
Christ (saith he) hath a double kind of being; a being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
and a beeing Sacramentall. According to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he dyeth in the sacrifice of the Masse; but according to
the former, he still lyueth in heauen.</p>
                  <p>What a wonderment is this? Christ is both liuing and
deade at once; both sacrificed and not sacrificed at once;
both consumed and not consumed at once. If these be not


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1601:36"/>
flat contradiction, my skil is naught, let the reader iudge.
Now, methinkes this is in deede and in plaine termes, the
Iesuites answere; and consequently, the best answere that
all the Papists in Europe can make; for hee hath learned
and heard the best aduise of them all, (viz:) that Christ in
the Popish Masse, both is consumed and dyeth; yet not
really, but Sacramentally. All which my selfe will most
willingly admit, and agree vnto. But our Papists will say
and vnsay. They say that Christ is in their Masse, truely and
really sacrificed, and not onely Sacramentally. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
we should agree to them, and they to vs. And then
must they needs say, that he is really, not onely sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
sacrificed in their Masse; and consequently, that he is
killed and consumed in the same really.</p>

because otherwise the Masse should not be a true and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Sacrifice. Hee addeth the reason, because the Essence
of a Sacrifice consisteth in killing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that by consideration the thing which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
is ordained to true, reall, and externall destruction,
as a thing needfull to the Essence of a Sacrifice; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
that if Christes body be really in the Masse, it
must be really killed or destroyed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that Christes body suffereth no hurt in the
Masse, because only it loseth the Sacramentall being, in


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1601:37"/>
ceasing to bee really on the Aultar. These obseruations
being well marked, it will appeare as cleere as the Sunne
shining at noone-day: that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> granteth the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of euery true and reall Sacrifice, to consist in killing
or destruction.<note place="margin">Tom. 2. col. 1063.</note> And therefore doth he graunt freely, that
Christ is killed in the Masse sacramentally, though not
really. Christes body (saith hee) although it suffer no
hurt in it selfe, neither lose it naturall beeing; when the
Eucharist is eaten; yet it loseth it sacramentall being, and
ceaseth to be really on the Popish Aultar. But euery one
knoweth, that when any thing loseth the being or life, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it is killed and destroyed. In regard heereof, <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
(as is already prooued) affirmeth resolutely, that eyther
there is a reall killing in the Masse, or else no Sacrifice
there at all. Marry he expoundeth this reall killing in the
Masse, to bee nothing else indeede, but the sacramentall
destruction of Christs body in the Eucharist. But therein
he contradicteth himselfe; because neither a sacramental
body is a true and reall body, neyther a sacramentall kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a true and reall killing. And so when all is saide and
done, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can conclude no more indeed, but that
Christs body is in the Eucharist sacramentally. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when Christ saith, (<hi>This is my body,</hi>) the true sence &amp;
meaning is this, &amp; no other; <hi>This is my body Sacramentally,
or the Sacrament of my body.</hi>

<hi>Bell</hi> inferreth, and how wisely soeuer our Iesuite dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth,
this must euer bee true, (viz:) That the Popish


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1601:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Priest in the Popish Masse, doth what in him lyeth to kill
christ in the Masse, so often as he pronounceth their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
consecration words; if it should be true which the
Pope and his Popelinges holde, that by vertue thereof
Christes body is put apart from his bloud, and his bloud
apart from his body. For most certaine it is, that no true
man, &amp; consequently Christ, can liue any longer, then his
body and bloud be vnited together, &amp; it is a meerfoolery
to say as our Iesuite doth; that to put a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s body &amp; bloud
apart where they were not before, is not to kill the man.
For example sake, because our Iesuite seemeth very grosse
(I will not say a foole) if it will please his worship to call
a Butcher to him, to take all his bloud from him, as hee
doth from an Oxe or Calfe, and to receiue it into a great
vessell, so as no part thereof fall vppon the ground; and
that doone, to carry the same to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church in
<hi>Rome,</hi> and to put it vnder the high altar there; and vvhen
he hath so done, to carry his body to <hi>Hexam,</hi> in the north
parts of England, there to bee solemnely buryed; if then
(I say) our Iesuite remaine aliue, and be not killed, I will
subscribe to this his doctrine. And yet is it cleere, that in
this case his body &amp; bloud shold be put apart, where they
were not before. But our Iesuite seemeth to ayme at a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mark. What is that? at the creating of Christs body
and bloud. Is it so indeed? Is it possible so to thinke? It
is very so. For these are his words, as you heare, else God
should kill a man, if hee created a Soule and body apart.
Well, now I remember an old said saw,<note place="margin">The Papists haue two Gods and two Christs.</note> (which doubtles
is as foolish as it is old) that the priest in the popish masse
can create his God. God so blesse me and all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,

else that it was needles in his bitter passion on the crosse.
To which he answereth, that neyther of both dooth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
For (saith he) Christs Sacrifice at his Supper, was a
most perfect vnbloudy Sacrifice; and yet his Sacrifice on
the Crosse was needfull, as the peculiar price which
GOD exacted at his handes, for the redemption of the
World. Loe,<note place="margin">O horrible blasphemy.</note> he granteth freely, that Christs Sacrifice at

                  <p>Heere is all that confessed, which I intended for to
prooue. (viz:) That the bread of the Eucharist is called
Christs body, because it is the signe and Sacrament of his
body; And therefore, that <hi>Berengarius</hi> was most cruelly
and villanously dealt withall, when he was enforced ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to bee burnt with fire and Fagot, or else to sweare,
that he beleeued in his hart, that Christs body was truely
touched and broken with the hands of Priests, and truely
torne with the teeth of the faithfull. When for all that,
many learned Papists, <hi>Bellarmine, Melchior Canus,</hi> and
others, with this our Iesuite, (who would and dooth say
the best he can for the Popes defence,) do freely graunt,
and plainely confesse, that Christes body can neither bee
broken with hands, nor yet torne or chewed with teeth.
Loe, <hi>Berengarius</hi> was compelled to beleeue, as an article
of his faith, that Christes body was truely, (<hi>in veritate,</hi>)
broken with the hands of Priests, and torne with teeth;
and yet the truth is farre otherwise, as both <hi>Bellarmine;

                  <p>I prooued out of <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine,</hi> that famous Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suiticall
Fryer, that Christs body cannot bee broken and
torne, saue only in a figure or Sacrament. And that by his
doctrine,<note place="margin">Read the Downfall.</note> it may be sayd to bee broken and torne, when
the signe thereof is broken and torne. Out of whose doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
I inferred this golden <hi>Colorrary:</hi> (viz:) that if it
be true to say, Christs body is broken and torne, because
the signe of his body is broken &amp; torne; then truely may
we say, and truely do we say, that Christes body is in the
Eucharist, because the signe of his body is there, because
the Sacrament of his bodye is there, because the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of his body is there. And much more
truely might Christ himselfe say,<note place="margin">The Iesuite is striken dead.</note> 
                     <hi>This is my body,</hi> when he
gaue the signe and Sacrament of his body. I then added,
that it is the constant doctrine of the church of England,
(which also many other reformed Churches approoue
therein) that Christs body is receiued, broken, torne, and
consumed with mouth &amp; teeth, figuratiuely, significant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
mystycally, sacramentally. And consequently, if the
Papistes would be iudged by this doctrine, which by the
pen of the Iesuite <hi>Bellarmine</hi> they heere deliuer, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1601:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would soone bee at an end. Now, I referre my
self to the indifferent Reader, whosoeuer he be; whether
the Iesuite <hi>S. R.</hi> bee an honest man, or no. For first, hee
beareth the Reader in hand, that I condemne Christ and
the holy Fathers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that I condemne both the English Churche,
and many forraine Christians.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he chargeth mee to hold the same Doctrine,
which I vtterly condemne in Popery.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he iustifieth the condemnation of <hi>Berengari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi>
whose doctrine for all that, both <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior
Canus</hi> do iustify, and himselfe vnawares in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
If I should deale with the Papists in this manner, all
the world would exclaime against me. If any indifferent
Reader shall duly and truely, (all affection and partialitie
set apart) read both <hi>The Downefall of Popery, and the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites

he will declare. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> saith, the Apostles are <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
Dominum.</hi> The bread our Lord, but that <hi>Iudas</hi> ate
<hi>Panem Domini,</hi> the bread of our Lord. Marke well the

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1601:40"/>
betweene that which the Apostles are,<note place="margin">See the Downefall.</note> and that
which <hi>Iudas</hi> ate. The Apostles (saith hee) are the Bread
which is our lord but <hi>Iudas</hi> the bread of our lord. This as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
of this holy father, say I, confoundeth the Papists;
for, if our Lord &amp; maker be present really in flesh, bloud,
&amp; bone, vnder the accidents of bread, and that so long as
the same accidents remaine vncorrupt, as the popish faith
holdeth; the doubtles, <hi>Iudas</hi> should haue receiued his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perforce <hi>Iudas</hi> should also haue receiued <hi>Pane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <hi>Iudas</hi> could not by any possibility, haue barely
receiued <hi>Pane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Domini,</hi> which yet S. <hi>Austen</hi> affirmeth most
constantly. For first, if it were true, (as it is not) that after
Popish supposed consecration, the substance of bread
were transubstantiated into Christes body naturall, as it
truely consisteth of flesh, bloud, and bone; And again, if
it were also true, that the self-same body remained vnder
the forme of bread, vntill it were corrupted, as Popish
Doctrine telleth vs; then say I, (and it will bee prooued
an vndoubted truth) that all the Papistes in <hi>Europe,</hi> and
else-where, are neuer able to shew me, how <hi>Iudas</hi> did not
receiue <hi>Panem Dominum,</hi> the bread which is the Lord, but
<hi>Panem Domini,</hi> The bread of our Lord. That is to say, how
<hi>Iudas</hi> could receiue the forme of bread, with the Flesh,
bloud, and bones of Christs Organicall and naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
hidden vnder the same; and for all that, not receiue
Christ himselfe, and <hi>Panem dominum,</hi> as the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
did. This indeed is the vpshot of this Question, and
striketh the Papistes starke dead: they can neuer answere
it truely, while the world standes. Now, where our fond
Iesuite asketh mee, how I can say, the Apostles are bare
bread, seeing they are the bread which Saint <hi>Austen</hi>
saith is the Lord; I answer, that though perhaps he haue

non est illud figura quod est substantia. Apostolus autem figura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in hoc loco pro ipsa substantia &amp; pro aequalitate essentiae posuit.</hi>
Concerning men, a figure is one thing, and substaunce
another thing; because whiles an image and figure is
painted in the Wall, the figure is not that which the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is. But the Apostle in this place put the figure for
the substance, and for the equality of Essence. And the
Popes owne deare Doctor <hi>Nicolaus de Lyra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyr. in hunc loc.</note> teacheth the
selfe-same Doctrine. These are his wordes; <hi>Dicitur imago
vel figura substantiae. 1. Eiusdem substantiae cum patre.</hi> Hee is
called the Image or figure of his substance; that is to say,
He is of the same substance with his father. By which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
thus deliuered by these two learned writers, we see
euidently, that the Apostle vnderstandeth by figure <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
so as this is the sence; he is of the same substance
with the Father. For as the same <hi>Haymo</hi> saith in the same
place; as in the fire, three things are inseparable, the fire,
the heate, and the brightnesse, and in the brightnes is
shewed to vs the fire and heat, (though humaine things
may not be compared with things diuine;) euen so the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost,
is vnited inseperably; and by his word, as by brightnes,
hee hath vouchsafed to shew himselfe vnto vs. Fondly
therefore doth our Iesuite dispute, when he would proue


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1601:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Christs body, to be both the figure and the thing figured
out of the apostles words; wherfore by the word <hi>(Figure)</hi>
vnderstandeth the Essence and equality of God. Hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
a Metaphoricall speech, for the dulnes of our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities;
who can vnderstand nothing in the admirable &amp;
diuine mysteries, but by similitudes drawne from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>To our Iesuites second Obiection,<note place="margin">Gen. 5, ver. 3.</note> that <hi>Seth</hi> was both
a true man, and withall the figure of a true man, I make
this answere, (viz:) That it maketh against himselfe. The
reason is euident, because (as I haue prooued out of <hi>Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi>)
the figure of the thing figured, in humaine Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are different, and the one distinguished from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And the Iesuite must needes graunt so much, or else
say, (as I think he will not for shame;) that <hi>Seth</hi> was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
and his owne Father. But in Christes body the case
is otherwise; for the Papistes hold, that Christes body in
the Eucharist, is <hi>Idem corpus numero,</hi> the same body in
number with his body on the crosse, and his body now
in heauen. If they shall say otherwise, then perforce must
they say, that which they dare not; that Christ hath moe
bodies then one.</p>

                  <p>Behold here gentle Reader, what vncertaintie is in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
faith and Doctrine. For first, our Iesuite telleth vs,
that either the last word in their supposed consecration
worketh transubstantiation alone, or with the help of the
rest; or else God worketh all, when the last word is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
Marry, which of these is the truth, that hee cannot
tell vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Aqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> their Angelicall Doctor, and Saint <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
saith, that this conuersion is not like to naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersions,
but is altogether supernaturall, wrought by the
onely power of God. Thirdly, the same Saint <hi>Aquinas</hi>
telleth vs, that this conuersion is doone in an instant.
Fourthly, if either fit matter want, or any word of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration,
or the intention of the Priest, nothing is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
it still remaineth bread. Now then, on the one side,
euery action that God doth, is done in an instant; the
reason is euident, because God is of infinite power, to
whose action no resistance can be made: All learned pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
graunt this to be so. On the other side, euery action
that man doth is successiue &amp; in time, because man is of
finite and limited power: the words therefore of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1601:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
either worke nothing at all, (and so they are ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
which to hold is absurd in popish doctrine) or else
transubstantiation is effected in time, which is repugnant
to Gods infinite power. Heere I must tell our Iesuite,
that he passeth ouer with silence two most notable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
whereof he speaketh not one word for feare
of biting. I told him in <hi>the Downefall,</hi> that <hi>Berengarius</hi> was
compelled to confesse and beleeue, that Christes body is
broken with hands; and yet doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> graunt, that
it is not broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with hands: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is broken with hands,
and not broken with hands. What can be a plainer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction?
None at all.</p>

                     <hi>In the Downefall of Popery,</hi> I proued out of <hi>Durand,</hi> that
onely the forme of Bread is changed in the Eucharist, &amp;
that the matter of Bread remaineth stil. Out of <hi>Rupertus</hi>
the Popish Abbot, that the bread is vnited Hypostatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the sonne of God. That <hi>Caietanus, Henrieus, Capreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
are of another opinion. That <hi>Iohannes Parisiensis,</hi> helde
also that the bread was assumpted, but in a different ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

affirmeth the annihilation of the bread: And that <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
holdeth with the counsell of Trent. Nowe, to this

(viz:) that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> neuer knewe how
to thinke of their real presence, for the space of one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
fiue hundered, forty yeares, and odde; vntill the
late dayes of their counsell of Trent, in which Counsell,
they receiued (as it may seeme) some new (no Reuelation

their masse. And heere may the indifferent Reader cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>We say after Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> and Saint <hi>Pontian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pa. 142, et 143</note> that priests
<hi>Conficiunt Corpus Christi,</hi> make Christs body; but dreame

because <hi>Innocentius</hi> holdeth, that all such priests do

no point of faith. For with catholiques it is no more mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Consecrate; then it is with Protestants, whether all or
one should Christen the Childe, if many at once should

                  <p>Here is first graunted, that priests make Christs body,
but not GOD. To which I say first, that such making is
great villany against the sonne of God. Secondly, that I
know not how popish priests can make Christs body, and
not make God: Vnlesse perhaps they bee <hi>Arrians,</hi> and so
deny Christ to be God. For where Christs body is, there
is Christ, true God, and true man. And therefore, when
they make Christs body apart from Christ, then they ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make a distinct body from Christ (and so Christ must
haue two bodies) or else they take christs body from the
God-head, and so make him no God at all.</p>
                  <p>Heere is secondly graunted, that one Papist contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth
another in the hye mistery of the Masse. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
it skilleth not, because it is no matter of faith. This
is our Iesuites short aunswere, but as much to the matter


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1601:44"/>
as a poke full of Plumes. Marry sir, this is a iest indeede,
For he must be a right wise man indeed that can tell what
Popish faith is. Many most godly men and women haue
beene burnt, for denyall the Popish Transubstantiation,
and yet could not the Papists tell what it was, vntil their
late Counsell of Trent. God keep vs from such Popish
faith.</p>
                  <p>Heere is thirdly confessed, that it is no more matter
whether many Priests do make Christs body one after an
other, then whether many Christen a childe one after an
other. Behold heere, howe roundly this Iesuite hudleth
vp many sacred misteries, as things of smal or no account.
I must tell him, that with Godly Christians of all ages,
rebaptization was euer reputed a greeuous sinne: and
yet we see heere, that one may be baptized of many, one
baptizing after another, as one consecrating, after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for so is the case in this controuersie. I must tell him
likewise, that it is not onely great irreuerence, but also
execrable idolatry, and more then Heathenish Villany
so to abuse Christs most sacred body. And I cannot but
wonder, if any that shall know truely their faith and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
do not detest their late start-vp Religion.</p>

with the Brother and his owne naturall sister, as his

he would vndoubtedly haue done, if he had beene able
to haue performed it, that hath he not done, viz: he hath
not replyed to my answere, neither said one word to my
large confutation of the saide forerunner. I there proued
by the expresse verdicts of three famous Popish writers;
(viz:) <hi>Siluester Prieras, Bartholomaeus Fumus,</hi> and <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus

canonized Saint<note place="margin">See the Popes fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> 
               <hi>Austoninus</hi> affirmed resolutely, that pope

likewise out of <hi>Cardinall Caìetan,</hi> that the Pope can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence
in al the degrees of Consanguinity, saue only with
the father and his daughter, and with the mother and
her sonne. It is therefore no straunge thing to charge the
Pope to graunt licence for marriage, euen betweene the
brother and sister. For larger discourse heereof, I referre
the reader to my book, intituled <hi>the Popes Funeral,</hi> where
this point is so handled, as neither this Iesuite nor any of

must they tell me, eyther what sinne they did with theyr

(which I wish the Reader euer to remember) (viz:)
that whatsoeuer is against the will or law of God is sin,
whether it be voluntary, or not voluntary. For Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>

               <p>I aunswere, that Saint <hi>Austen</hi> and other Fathers doe
comparatiuely, as it were extenuate and excuse innate
concupiscence, but not simply make it no sinne. When
they seeme to make it no sinne, then they so speake, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for that it is not imputed to the regenerate, who
manfully fight against it; or else, because it is an ingrafted
prauity of Nature, and not a voluntary transgression of
Gods law. Breefely, the Fathers call it sinne, yet not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
but comparatiuely in respect of actuall sinnes. Saint
<hi>Austen</hi> in the place which our Iesuite citeth, disputeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the fond opinion of some persons, who to auoyde
those sinnes, to which they thought their original raging
concupiscence would drawe them, resolued to commit
one sinne for all, in murthering themselues, and so be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
from many sinnes, to which they feared their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1601:47"/>
would allure them. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> therfore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
from such heynous crimes, encourageth such ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
consciences by way of extenuation, telling them
that concupiscence is without fault, in those that striue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, &amp; do not consent vnto it. Not for that it is no sin
in it selfe, but because it is not imputed to the godly. For,
(as we haue heard already, and as I haue proued at large
in <hi>the Downfall of Popery</hi>) whatsoeuer deflecteth, or swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
from the will of God, the same is most properly sin.
The reason is euident, because not to bee correspondent
and agreeable to Gods will, is the very intrinsecall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
essence, and nature of sinne. Yet so it is, that the
<hi>Ataxia,</hi> disorder, and concupiscence in the regenerate, is
repugnant and disagreable to the will of God; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
it must be sinne indeed. And as for the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Saint <hi>Austen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See the</hi> Downefall of Popery.</note> I haue proued at large in the <hi>Downfall,</hi>

punnishment of sinne, and cause of sinne, so concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the flesh is sinne, punnishment, and cause of sin.
But I aunswere, that Saint <hi>Austen</hi> compareth concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
with blindnesse of heart, in the materiall disorder
of sinne.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T. B.</speaker>
               <p>I answere; that I know not whether I should pitty the
ignorance of our Iesuite, or exclaime against his mallice.
For first, Saint <hi>Austen</hi> cannot bee expounded, as Maister
Fryer saith, though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his Brother hath lent him
his solution. For if Saint <hi>Austen</hi> had meant materially, &amp;
not formally, he would neuer haue called it sin the thirde
time, after hee named it twice sinne matterially before,
(viz:) when he called it the cause of sinne, and the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of sinne. Yet after both these, he addeth, that it


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1601:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is sinne formally. For else he had saide no new thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because our Iesuite confuteth himselfe vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
when he writeth thus; Saint <hi>Austen</hi> prooueth by
the blindnesse of hart, that it was not onely punishment
and cause of sinne,<note place="margin">Page. 186.</note> but also sinne; that is, naught, cuill,
and disorderly; because it is against the rule of reason,
which is to be sinne materially, though it want the form
of sinne, which is voluntarines. This is his answer: Now
I pray you Gentle Reader, iudge indifferently between
mee and this Fryer. First, hee graunteth that Originall
concupisence is naught, euill, and disorderly. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it is against the rule of reason, and all that he can
say for himselfe is this, that it is indeede sinne mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially,
but not formally. Where if I may finde an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Reader, the victory is mine own: GOD is my
iudge, I speake as I thinke. For to be against the rule of
reason, is formally sinne.<note place="margin">August, vbi supra.</note> Which Saint <hi>Austen</hi> (as is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
proued) declareth euidently, when he defineth the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
law to be nothing else, but the reason or will of
God. The reason is confirmed, because Saint <hi>Austen</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
it with the blindnes of hart, which (as euery good
Christian knoweth,) is sinne most formally. For if master
Fryer <hi>Parsons,</hi> shall deny blindnesse of heart, thorough
which man beleeueth not in God, to bee sinne formally,
he will be hissed out of all good schools; howsoeuer our
holy Father the Pope, sitting in his chaire vppon men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
shoulders, giue him ten hundred thousand yeares pardon
for the same. Nay, I will yet say more to our holy Fryer
maister <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> (the Author of this fond presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
answere to the <hi>Downfall of Popery,</hi>) (viz:) that in the
last precept of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> or Ten commaundementes,
(<hi>Thou shalt not lust,</hi>) is prohibited not onely actuall and
voluntary concupiscence, but the very Originall and
Fountaine of all concupiscences with all her involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
branches.</p>
               <p>I prooue it first, because that concupiscence actuall,


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1601:48"/>
wherewith wee couet that that is another mans, and not
our own, is forbidden, by all the sixt, seuenth, and eight
precepts of the second Table. This doeth our maister
Christ teach vs, when hee saith; <hi>That whosoeuer shall see a
woman to lust after her,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat, 5, 29</note> 
                  <hi>hath already committed adultery with hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
in his hart.</hi> The same doctrine teacheth S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> when hee
sheweth the hatred of our brother to be agaiust this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept;
<hi>Thou shall not kill.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I. Iohn, 3, 5, 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, because if no other thing were prohibited
in this commandement, but actuall concupiscence, there
shoulde bee but nine precepts in the <hi>Decalogue;</hi> seeing
the last shoulde bee no newe Commaundement, but
only a bare recitall or repetition of the nine former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because S. <hi>Paul</hi> granteth himselfe to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
sold vnder sin,<note place="margin">Rom, 7, 14 5, 19, 20.</note> by reason of original concupiscence,
and not actuall; against which he fought stoutly, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
gaue consent vnto it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, because that which the Saints of God detest,
&amp; call sin by the iudgement of the holy ghost, must needs
be sin properly. But so it is, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the name of all
the Saints of God, detesteth this Original co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiscence,
calleth it sin, and mourning, tearmeth himselfe vnhappy
for it, and desireth to be deliuered from it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it must
needs be sin properly.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, to say that it is called sin figuratiuely and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
is against that generall rule which all Diuines haue
deliuered, when the scriptures must bee vnderstood pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
and when figuratiuely, viz: that then they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
figuratiuely, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sence, which the words in their
proper signification yeeld, do not agree with other scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the Analogy of faith, but are repugnant vnto
the same.</p>
               <p>Now, no scripture can bee produced, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth
that Originall concupisence with the involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
motions thereof,<note place="margin">Romans, 7.</note> is properly sin: Nay, the Apostle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1601:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
twelue times in one Chapter, plainely and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
calleth it sin, neither will it helpe to say, that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
freeth Gods children from sinne.<note place="margin">August, vbi supra.</note> For as saint <hi>Austen</hi>
sayth, they are not deliuered from sinne so, that it is not
in them, but that it is not imputed to them. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
teacheth the same doctrine, when he pronounceth
<hi>The man blessed</hi> not who hath no sin, <hi>but to whom the Lorde
imputeth no sinne.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalme, 32, 2.</note> And the Papists must either recall their
doctrine in this point, or else cry fire and faggot for their
chiefe maister <hi>Petrus Lombardus,</hi> sur-named the Maister
of sentences (whose Booke to this day is publikely Read

animas vero iam redempti sumus &amp;c.</hi> But touching
our soules, wee are redeemed in part, not wholly; from
the sinne, not from the paine; neyther wholly from the
sinne or fault: For we are not so redeemed from it, that it
be not (<hi>in vs</hi>) but that it rule not (<hi>ouer vs.</hi>) Lo, Maister
<hi>Lombard</hi> that famous Writer, graunteth first, that we are
redeemed in part, but not in the whole.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that wee are not wholly redeemed from
sinne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he telleth vs, how we are redeemed from sin,

Lo, the greatest and best learned Papists, teach the
same doctrine that I do.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Saint <hi>Austen</hi> affirmeth plainely, that Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Concupiscence is prohibited by this Precept (<hi>Thou
shalt not Lust;</hi>) and not onely the habituall concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence
it selfe, but also all the actuall involuntary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereof;<note place="margin">Bellar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

alleadgeth him; These thinges (saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>)
are spoken after Saint <hi>Austens</hi> mind, who by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
(<hi>Thou shalt not Lust</hi>) vnderstandeth all the motions
of concupiscence, euen the involuntary, to bee prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
in some sort; and that the consent to these motions


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1601:49"/>
forbidden by that other precept; <hi>follow not thy concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence.</hi>
Thus writeth our Iesuiticall Cardinall; by whose
doctrin it is euident that S. <hi>Austen</hi> affirmeth the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of concupiscence, which peruert reason, and cannot
be auoided, to be condemned by S. Paul, as sinfull and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the law of God. Which doctrine of S. <hi>Austen,</hi> doth
so sting and confound all Papists, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not in the world what hee shall answere to the same.
And therefore he addeth deceitfully in his exposition of
S. <hi>Austens</hi> words, this word. (<hi>Quodam modo,</hi> after a sort,)
which word for all that, is neither in S. <hi>Austen,</hi> nor yet
agreeable to his meaning. For S. <hi>Austen</hi> saith plainely,
simply, and absolutely, without all ands, or ifs, or other
qualifications, that such motions are forbidden by this
commaundement (<hi>non concupisces.</hi>) If I (gentle Reader)
should thus deale in reciting or expounding my authors,
what exclamations, what outcries wold be made against
me? all the cursed brood of Iesuites and Iesuited Papists
would pursue me with hue and cry, as if I were a rancke
Traytor. But S. <hi>Austens</hi> words are so plaine, as no denyall
or <hi>Legierdemaine</hi> can haue place: for he sayth, that Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
concupiscence with the involuntary motions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are forbidden by the last precept of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> and
the consent to the same, by that other precept, <hi>Go not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thy concupiscence.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Let this bee wel marked</note> Heere S. <hi>Austen</hi> vttereth his owne

and flatly distinguisheth, betweene originall concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence
it selfe, and the consent that is giuen to the same.
Hee telleth vs simply and resolutely, that the concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence

it, by another. Which the Iesuiticall Cardinall seeing

that it is sinne formally in the regenerate. And so I
haue my purpose, (viz:) that sinne still abideth in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
though it be not imputed to them. For, if ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
sinne be truely remitted in baptisme, and bee not
truely sinne indeede in the Baptised; then can none bee
iustly damned, that are baptized. For how shall they bee
iustly condemned, for that which is remitted? It cannot
be. And this notwithstanding, to grant that all baptized
shall be saued, is most absurd. For larger discourse here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

vnlesse he did by not imputing for sin, meane, making no
sin, he hadde not answered the question, why concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence

Saint <hi>Austen</hi> at your pleasure, and without ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scripture, Father, Text, Circumstance, or Reason,
say this is his meaning; it must bee as you say, I shall in
vain dispute against you. But I hope the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will not afforde you that freedome. The Question
which Saint <hi>Austen</hi> mooueth,<note place="margin">Marke, for the lesuite is striken dead.</note> is this: Why originall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
is sin in the Childe, and no sin in the Baptized
Parent. And Saint <hi>Austen</hi> himselfe, aunswereth himselfe,
because it is not imputed for sin in the Parent. Thus stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the case; this is the question; this is the aunswere:
The difficulty is this; How the Childe can contract and
receiue of the Parent, that which is not in the Parent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no man can bestow and impart that, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
hath not. The answer to the difficulty is this; that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
concupiscence is still in the Parent after baptisme
receiued, as truely and formally sin in it owne Nature, as
it is truely and formally sin in the vnbaptized Child: and
so the Child contracteth nothing of the Parent, but that
very same which was in him. This notwithstanding,
there is this difference betweene the sin formally in the
Parent, and the sinne formally in the Childe, (viz:) that
though it bee formally, really, and truely in them both;
yet is it is in the one after one manner, in the other after


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1601:51"/>
another manner. It is formall sin in the Parent, but not so
imputed, yet in the child before Baptisme, it is both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
sin, and so imputed. So that the difference is not in
the thing, but in the manner and modification of the
thing. And this is the true meaning of S. <hi>Austen,</hi> when
hee saith; <hi>Non imputatur in peccatum,</hi> It is not imputed
for sinne. As if he had said, it is still sin aswell in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
as in the Childe, (or els the Child could not receiue
and contract it of his Father) in the nature of the thing it
selfe: Neuerthelesse, it is as if it were not in him, because
of mercy it is not imputed to him for sin. Breefely, it is
sinne in the Parent, but not so imputed; In the Childe it
both is sin, and for sin imputed.</p>

These thinges are spoken after the minde of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten,</hi>
who vnderstandeth all the motions, euen those
which bee involuntary, to bee forbidden in some sort
by this Commaundement, (<hi>Thou shalt not Lust.</hi>) VVhere
wee see, that not onely <hi>Bellarmine</hi> theyr Cardinall, but
Saint <hi>Austen</hi> that woorthy Piller of the Church, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
both Originall concupiscence, and the involuntary
Motions thereof, to be forbidden in this precept. Where
I may not forget to tell the Reader, that though <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
to make his matter good, (if it would) addeth
to Saint <hi>Austens</hi> wordes (<hi>In some sort,</hi>) yet dooth Saint

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that habituall Originall Lust is not idle,
but woorketh ill desires in vs continually agaynst our

               <p>So sayth S. <hi>Austen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de nup. et concup. lib. 1. co, 2. 27.</note> in these words; <hi>Agit. n. Aliquid concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscentia

somthing, euen when there is not giuen vnto it, either the

consent of the heart, where it may raigne; or the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
as VVeapons, which may accomplish what it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth.
And what doth it, but the very wicked and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
desires? For if they were good and lawfull, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
would not forbid to obey them.</p>
               <p>Marke these wordes, gentle Reader, for they are of
great consequence, and giue a deadly blowe to the
Papistes. Two thinges are cleered by this Testimony
of Saint <hi>Austen;</hi> the one, that Concupiscence to which
consent is not giuen, bringeth foorth ill desires; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the sayde desires are vnlawfull, and prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Law of GOD. And so wee haue euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prooued, that habituall Concupiscence, to which the
regenerate yeelde no consent, but stoutly resist the same,
is so farre from beeing meritorious, as the Papists would
haue it, that it is sinne formally, and properly so called.
And wee haue further, that habituall concupiscence wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
ill desires in vs against our will, and therefore that
those desires are truely called originall, because vvee
doe them not, but rather suffer them to bee doone in
vs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that though the Law in saying, <hi>Thou shalt not
lust,</hi> seemeth by the force of the word which signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
action, to prohibite onely the voluntary act of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence;
yet dooth it forbidde the very Originall
Concupiscence it selfe, withall the braunches, effects,
and involuntary motions thereof, as is already prooued

Concupiscence is forbidden by the tenth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.
The first, is meerely called Originall. This
is that vvhich vve all contracted of <hi>Adam,</hi> and which
is the Fountaine of all concupiscences and sins, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
truely called of the Apostle sin.<note place="margin">Rom, 7,</note> The second, is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Originall, and partly Actuall. Originall, because


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1601:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it yssueth naturally from the Originall prauity of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Actuall, for that we couet in act, albeit against our
wil, and because it is against our wil, it is more properly
&amp; truly called Originall, then actuall. The third, is meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
actuall, because it is voluntary.</p>

loadeth my back with slaunderous speeches and false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.
I will heere in regard of breuity, onely set downe
the Testimony of a famous Papist <hi>Augustinus Hunnaeus,</hi>
by name, in that Epistle which he sent to Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the
fift. These are his words; <hi>Vrbanus &amp;c. Vrbanus</hi> that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Prelate of the Apostolique sea, admiring the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
doctrine of this man, (he speaketh of <hi>Aquinas</hi>) &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
it as fallen from heauen to driue away the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
mist of ignorance from mens minds, doth grauely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort

of <hi>Tholouse</hi> to follow it as the cheefe, in all their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
and aunsweres concerning faith and manners.
<hi>Innocentius</hi> the fift of that name, esteemed the same mans
Doctrine so greatly, that hee doubted not to giue it the
first place after the Cannonicall scripture. Thus writeth
<hi>Hunnaeus.</hi> By whose words it may appeare, in what reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the Doctrine of <hi>Aquinas</hi> is with the Papists; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that our Iesuite cannot answere me, but by lying. And
thus I will end this article,<note place="margin">Page, 161<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

order in the inferior powers, and therefore is both
positiue and priuatiue euill. Thus writeth our Iesuite;
who after he hath long wearied himselfe in struggling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the truth, doth at the length vnawares confesse the
same. For doubtlesse, when he graunteth, that habituall
<hi>Concupiscence</hi> in the regenerate, includeth want of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
order in the inferior powers, and therefore is both
positiue and priuatiue euill; he graunteth in substance &amp;
in the truth of the matter, as much as I desire. He deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in wordes, that Originall concupiscence, is formally
sinne, but in effect and substance, hee graunteth the
very same. Whosoeuer shal seriously ponder both my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

the Nature, definition, and essence of sinne; he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

               <p>Our Iesuite wold gladly perswade his reader, that I am
an enemy to good workes. The best mean he hath to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himselfe and Popery withall, is cogging, lying, and
false dealing. I must needs be an enimy to <hi>Good workes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1601:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I will not admit euill workes for good. I say with
S. <hi>Austen; Sequuntur, iustificatum, non precedent iustificandum.</hi>

                  <hi>Good. Workes</hi> follow him that is iustified, but they go not
before him that is to be iustified. Behold here, gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that S. <hi>Austen</hi> is the same enemy to <hi>Good workes</hi> that I
am. He affirmeth them to follow iustification, and so doe
I. Hee denyeth them to goe before iustification, and
so doe I. What a thing is this? Our Iesuite dareth not
call Saint <hi>Austen</hi> an enemy to <hi>Good Workes;</hi> and yet doth
he call mee so, who defend and holde the same doctrine
that Saint <hi>Austen</hi> doth. Nay, how is it possible to haue
<hi>Good Workes,</hi> before wee haue fayth? Seeing (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle

                  <note place="margin">Heb, 11, 6</note>
Who so listeth to pervse my <hi>Suruey of Popery,</hi> shall there
find euery thing soundly aunswered, whatsoeuer can bee
sayde for Popery in this kinde of subiect. But our Fryer
will proue <hi>Good workes</hi> to go before iustification, because
Christ sayde to <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke, 7. 47</note> 
                  <hi>Many Sinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen
her, because shee loued much.</hi> I answere, that Christs
Argument is not drawne from the cause, but from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
As if Christ had sayd; wee may know by her great
loue, that great gifts are bestowed on her, that many sins
are forgiuen her. For, that no remission of her sinnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from her loue, but her loue of the forgiuenesse of
her sinnes, appeareth by the similitude of the debters. For
Christ tolde Peter of two debters, whereof the one ought
fiue hundered pence, the other fifty, and that when they
had not wherewith to pay, the Creditour forgaue them
both. Hee therefore demaunded of <hi>Peter,</hi> whether of
the Debters loued the Creditour more? <hi>Peter</hi> aunsvve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that he to vvhom more vvas forgiuen. Christ appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<hi>Peters</hi> ansvver, and concluded therevpon, that seeing
<hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> loued more, he might know that she had
more forgiuen her, because saith Christ, <hi>To whome little is
forgiuen, the same loueth little.</hi> Neyther is it possible, to
draw any other meaning out of christs words. The reason


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1601:55"/>
is euident, because christ saith plainly, that the debts were
freely forgiuen the debters, who were not able to pay
the debts. For otherwise, <hi>Maries</hi> forgiuenesse shoulde
haue no coherence with the similitude of the debters.</p>
               <p>The second part of his position is, that good works e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
follow (as fruits the tree) the persons that are freely
iustified. This is most manifestly falfe in infants, whereof
many iustified in baptisme, dye before they do any good
worke. And if his comparison of the tree be good, some
iustified, neuer do good worke; and al, want them long
time, some giue ouer doing good, as some trees are bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
some cease to beare fruit, and none beare alwayes.</p>

               <p>This Fryer thinketh he can daunce in a net naked, and
yet no man see him; but I weene, euery indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
doeth easily espy his manner of dealing, (viz:) that
he hath nothing in him, but Cauils, Slanders, and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
leasings. Good workes, sayth he, cannot euer follow
iustified persons, as fruits follow trees, because some trees
neuer do good, and all want a long time, and none beare
alwayes. Is this Fryer trow ye, wel in his wits? Hath not
malice so blinded him, that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not see wood for trees?
Hath the Pope dispensed with him, to say what hee list?
Good workes say I, euer follow persons freely iustified,
as fruits follow the Tree, by Gods mercy in Christ Iesus
for his merits and condigne deserts. Now what doth our
Iesuite? he aplies himselfe wholy to cauils &amp; extreme fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
He perceiueth, that truth wil preuail, &amp; therfore strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
with cauils and deceitfull dealing against the same.</p>
               <p>First, he leaueth out GODS mercy, and the merites of
Christ Iesus.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he inferreth a fond conclusion of his owne
making, and beareth the Reader in hand, that it is mine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he triumpheth before the victory, boasting
that hee hath confuted my position, when indeede hee
hath onely confuted himselfe, and fought the combate


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1601:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with his owne folly. For I do not say, that <hi>Good Workes</hi>
do euer and continually without all interruption, follow
persons freely iustified. Let the Reader duely and truely
pervse my wordes, and then tell me, if our Fryer Iesuite
be not a notorious lyar. I say <hi>Good Workes</hi> do euer folow
but not simply, absolutely, &amp; at all seasons; but as fruites
follow trees. Now, I pray you gentle Reader, how doe
fruits follow trees? Our Fryer telleth vs. Some trees ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
haue any fruit (sayth he) some want a long time, and
none beare fruit euer. Alas, alas, what a fond fryer-Iesuit
is this <hi>Robert Parsons?</hi> Where were their wits, that made
him the <hi>Prouinciall</hi> of England? If good workes follow
persons iustified no otherwise, but as fruits follow trees,
which is my position; then doubtlesse are they not to be
expected euery hour, but when the due circumstances of
time, place, and persons do require. For good trees do not
euer bring forth their fruits, but in due times and seasons.</p>

               <p>Our Iesuite shall aunswere and confute himselfe,<note place="margin">Page 230</note> for
these are his owne words a little after. Because (sayth our
Iesuite) as workes are rewarded euen aboue their virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
&amp; proportionate equality, as Diuines say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>vltra condignu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi>
no maruell, if S. <hi>Paul</hi> called eternall life rather <hi>Grace,</hi> or
<hi>Gift,</hi> then <hi>Stipend,</hi> seeing it hath much more of <hi>Grace,</hi> then
it hath of <hi>Iustice;</hi> yet he no where calleth it meere grace.
Beside that, as Saint <hi>Austen</hi> writeth, he might haue called
it a <hi>Stipend,</hi> as hec calleth <hi>Death</hi> in respect of <hi>Sinne,</hi> but
forbore, least wee should thinke it were so iustly deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1601:56"/>
by <hi>Good Workes,</hi> as death is by euill. Thus discourseth
our <hi>Fryer.</hi> Where we haue first by his owne free graunt,
that <hi>Workes</hi> are rewarded aboue their desert. Albeit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee called them condigne, and of condigne merite.
These are his wordes: <hi>Good workes</hi> (saith he) <hi>done in Gods
grace, are condignely meritorius of eternall life.</hi> Secondly,<note place="margin">Page 221</note> that
<hi>Saint Paule</hi> calleth eternall life rather <hi>Grace</hi> then <hi>Stipend,</hi>
because it hath much more of <hi>Grace,</hi> then it hath of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi>
where vnawares he confuteth himselfe doubtlesse;
because where there is more of <hi>Grace</hi> then of <hi>Iustice,</hi> it
is vnpossible to establish condigne merite. For as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
teacheth vs; <hi>To him that worketh, the reward is not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
of Grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom, 4, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>but of debt or duety.</hi> And the same Apostle
declareth it more plainely in another place. <hi>For by Grace</hi>
(saith he) <hi>you are saued throgh faith (&amp; that not of your selues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes, 2, 8:</note>
                  <hi>for it is the gift of God) not of workes, least any man shoulde boast
himselfe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 3, 5.</note> And again in another place thus; <hi>Not by the works
of righteousnesse which we did, but according to his mercy he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the Apostle calleth eternall life, rather
grace then stipend, as S. <hi>Austen</hi> writeth; because it is not
so iustly deserued by <hi>Good Workes,</hi> as death is by euill
workes. No, no, S. <hi>Austen</hi> saith plainly; <hi>Cum Deus co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronat
merita nostra, nihil aliud coronat quam munera sua.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
God crowneth our merites,<note place="margin">Aug. Ep. 105. tom. 2.</note> he crowneth nothing els but
his owne giftes. First therefore, seeing <hi>Good Workes</hi> are
rewarded aboue their deserts. Secondly, seeing <hi>Good
Workes</hi> haue more of grace then of Iustice. Thirdly, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Good Workes</hi> cannot so merite heauen; as ill workes
merite hell. Fourthly, seeing the best merits are nothing
else, but the meere giftes of GOD; I must needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that Workes are not condignely meritorious of
eternal life.</p>

the Law, but besides the Law.</p>

               <p>Heere is an answere, aunswerelesse. For first, our Fryer
graunteth, that I haue prooued by the Scripture, by Saint
<hi>Ambrose,</hi> by S. <hi>Austen,</hi> by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> their famous Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
by the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> their learned bretheren, by <hi>Iosephus
Angles,</hi> their religious Fryer, and reuerend Byshop, and
by <hi>Durandus,</hi> their famous Schoole-Doctor; that euery
sin, more and lesse is against the Law of God; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
mortall of it owne nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, our Fryer freely confesseth, that this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of mine, doth so trouble the Papists, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
agree among themselues, how to answere the same.
Some sayth he, deny the proposition, some deny the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
other some say they cannot tell what: and our
Iesuite himselfe standes amazed, whether it is better to
yeeld to the truth, or to face it out desperately, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
with <hi>Legierdemain,</hi> iugling, falshood, and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

               <p>Yet better it is to say,<note place="margin">Page, 270.</note> that veniall sinnes are beside the

               <p>Our Iesuite being in perplexity, (like as <hi>Buridanus</hi> his
Asse) what to answere to my argument, resolueth to take
the best way as he supposeth: for, he thinketh as felons &amp;
Traytors standing at the barre in their arraigment, that
it is the best to plead (not guilty.) But I must tell him two
things: The one, that to be beside the Law and against
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Law, is al one in effect. For as our master Christ saith,
<hi>Hee that is not with him, is against him,</hi> and consequently,<note place="margin">Mat, 12, 30.</note> if
he do besides Christs commaundement, hee doth against
the same.</p>
               <p>The other, that <hi>Durandus,</hi> and many Popish Schoole-Doctors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>


                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:1601:58"/>
confesse resolutely, that euery sinne is against
Gods law. And <hi>Iosephus Angles</hi> affirmeth constantly, that
<hi>Dwrands</hi> opinion is now adaies the Doctrine of theyr
Schooles. Where I wish the Reader to note by the way,

though all sins bee against Gods friendship (who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

the transgression of the law. And out of S. <hi>Austen,</hi> that

But these Fathers define onely mortall sin.</p>

               <p>Mark for Christs sake, and behold our Iesuite at a great
<hi>Non plus.</hi> I haue prooued both by the Scripture out of
Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> and by the testimony of the holy Fathers, and
famous Popish Writers; that the very Essence, Nature,
and formality of sin, is the transgression of Gods Lawe.
That Gods law is nothing else, but his eternall reason or
will decreeing what ought to be done, or not to be done,


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1601:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and consequently, that euery sin is mortall, as beeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Gods reason, <hi>Will, and Law.</hi> Now, our <hi>Fryer</hi> being
indeede at his wits end, knoweth not what aunswere to
make; but saith at Randon, that the Fathers onely define
mortall sin. He neither hath Rime nor Reason thus to say;
but we must (if ye will) admit his bare word, for he is an
honest man, I warrant you; his word is as good, as no
Obligation. The Fathers define sin generally, they make
no exception at all, yet our Iesuite will needs haue them,
to define onely mortall. What a thing is this? Who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
hath heard the like? The Question is, whether euery
sin be mortall, or no. I affirme euery sin to bee mortall;
and I prooue it, because the holy Scripture, the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers, and the Doctors doe define sin to bee so;
yet our Iesuite thinketh it enough barely to aunswere,
that they all speak of mortall sin, not of veniall. O sweet
Iesus? Our Iesuite is either too too foolish, or els too, too
malicious. His fond answer is tearmed in Schooles, <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
principij,</hi> the begging of the Question. He will needes
haue the Fathers to except veniall sins, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
such sins, although they take no notice of such sins,
neither once name such sins; but contrariwise affirme, all
sinnes without exception to bee mortall. These Fathers
(saith our fatherly Iesuite) define mortall sin, not veniall.
Euen so sorsooth, for why should they define that, which
is not? The Fathers were wise; they knew that euery sin
in it owne nature deserued death and therefore defined
sin accordingly. They knew,<note place="margin">Rom, 6, 23,</note> that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> saith; <hi>The
reward of sinne is death.</hi> They knew, what God saith by his
Prophet <hi>Ezechiell; The Soule that sinneth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eze, 18, 20,</note> 
                  <hi>shall dye the death.</hi>
They knew what God saith by his Prophet <hi>Dauid;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal, 5, 4,</note> 
                  <hi>Thou
art not a GOD that loueth wickednesse, neither shall euill dwell

dome; <hi>Depart from me ye cursed, into euerlasting fire.</hi> But our
Iesuite saith,<note place="margin">Math, 25, 41</note> that veniall sinnes breake not friendshippe
with God. Well,<note place="margin">Page 271.</note> let him stand in iudgment against God

               <p>I admit,<note place="margin">Page 275.</note> that by sin Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> vnderstood all kinde of
Actuall sin, and deny that <hi>Anomia</hi> Iniquity, is taken for
wickednesse, and perfect transgression of the Lawe; but
generally as it is common to perfect transgression, &amp; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
swaruing from the Law.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T. B.</speaker>
               <p>I answere, First, that <hi>Anomia</hi> is the transgression of the
Law, according to the nature and proper signification of
the word, as their most famous <hi>Linguist, Arias Montanus</hi>
graunteth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that iniquity is perfect sin and wickednesse,<note place="margin">Psal. 6, 9.</note>
as the Prophet telleth vs; <hi>Discedite à me omnes, qui operami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
iniquitate.</hi> Depart from me all ye, that worke iniquity.
So the Latin <hi>Vulgata editio</hi> readeth, which the papists must
approoue perforce, because the Pope hath so inioyned
them. Heere iniquity, must needes bee taken for mortall
sin: for as our Iesuite saith, Veniall sinnes do not breake
friendship with God: and I may presume to affirme of
holy <hi>Dauid,</hi> that hee commaunded not them to depart
from him, who were in fauour with God. No, no, God
loueth not those that worke iniquity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Page 273.</note> that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh of mortall sinne, by
our Iesuites owne confession.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that Saint <hi>Bede, Lyranus,</hi> and <hi>Carthusianus,</hi> do
all three with vniforme assent, expound it of mortall sin.</p>
               <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">Page, 278</note> that our Iesuite vnawares graunteth no lesse.
These are his wordes; <hi>For iniquity requireth onely want of
equitie, and conformitie to Gods Lawe.</hi> Loe, hee graunteth
iniquity, to want conformity to Gods Law: and so (say
I) vnawares he granteth, iniquity to be against Gods law,
seeing it is here confessed of our Iesuite, that it wants co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity

mine opinion. But he addeth two things for his defence,
as hee thinketh, yet I deny them, and so I thinke will
the indifferent Reader, to be very ridiculous, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
childish. First, he saith, it is no matter of faith. What
then good Sir? Is nothing to be regarded, but matters of
Fayth? Is it a matter of faith, that your Pope cannot erre?
That he is aboue a general Councel? That he can depose
kings? Nay, that either he or your selfe be an honest man?
And what is a matter of fayth? Forsooth, whatsoeuer the
Pope will haue a matter of fayth. Secondly, he saith, <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand</hi>
and <hi>Angles</hi> intend not to fauour mee. This is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-folly

               <p>Thirdly, it is formally transgression of Gods Law,<note place="margin">Page 278</note> as
I haue many wayes confirmed. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is formally sin.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If Adultery or murther doone by a foole or

a beastly affirmation. Our Iesuite barely sayth it, hee
prooueth it not. I know his supposed ground; because
forsooth, it is not voluntary. But I would haue him
to tell mee, how it is not as well sinne in Fooles and mad
men, as <hi>Adams</hi> fault is sinne in Infants against their will.
Because (saith he) they cannot auoyde it. The same say I,
of Infantes. I adde, that Beastes neuer hadde it in their
power, to auoyde sinne, and sinnefull actes; but Fooles,
madde men, and Infantes, were all at once enabled to
haue kept the Lawe, when they were in <hi>Lumbis Adae;</hi>
which is enough for their iust condemnation. And it is
confirmed, because they may as well bee freed from O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
sin, as from murther and Adultery. It is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
saying, that if a drunken man, kill a man,<note place="margin">Aristotle, libr. 3. ethic. cap. 5. §. 72.</note> when hee

First, for his drunkennesse, then for the sinne that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

bring an action of the case against mee; for that (as hee
saith) I slander their Religion. He would haue me to tell
him and his Pope, when, wherein, and by whom, the late
<hi>Romish Religion</hi> corrupted the purity of the old. I answer,
first, that I desire to know our Iesuites name, because we
may perhaps agree without suite in Law. Secondly, that
I haue in a printed Booke published many yeares ago, to
the view and iudgment of all the Christian world, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in plaine and expresse tearmes, at what times, in what
points, &amp; by what persons, the old <hi>Roman Religion</hi> taught
by Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> (as holy <hi>Writ</hi> telleth vs) and by Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
(as Histories Ecclesiasticall doe relate,) was succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely

for the truth. This Booke is intituled the <hi>Suruey of

of our Lord God, 1596. I haue challenged all Iesuites
and Iesuited <hi>Papists,</hi> ioyntly and seuerally, to answere it,
and all my other Bookes. They haue oftentimes in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of theyr slaundrous Libels, made mention both of the
<hi>Suruey,</hi> and of my other Bookes, and promised aunswers
to the same, but while the Grasse growes, the Horse
dyes. This is the first answer, that euer I receiued to this
day. Which how silly it is, let others iudge. For their late
forerunner did but snatch here and there, and aunswered
directly nothing at all. Our Iesuite heere insinuateth
something, which hee cannot well tell how to shuffle vp.

and a Preacher a long time at <hi>Argentoraium,</hi> sayd
many a time to his friendes, that it was impossible for a
man to make his confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according to their Traditions.
Thus writeth <hi>Rhenanus.</hi> Out of whose words I note. First,
that the vain, curious destinctions of the Schole-doctors,


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1601:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue brought much mischeefe into the Church of GOD.
Which thing if a Papist had not spoken it, would seeme
incredible to the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it is impossible for a Papist to make his
confession, acording to the Popish law; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that all Papists by Popish doctrine, must perish euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly.
Marke well my words (Gentle Reader) the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
teach vs to hold for an article of our beleefe, that we
are bound to make our confessions as the Popish law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth;
that is, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> haue set downe the
same. And for all that <hi>Gielerius</hi> a Papist himselfe &amp; a great
diuine,<note place="margin">Loe, Papistes dare not say al they thinke.</note> complained often to his frends, that no man could
possibly performe the same. Now then, since on the one
side, Popish confession must be made vnder pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
and since on the other side, none possibly can
make the same as it is required; it followeth of necessity
by Popish Doctrine, that all Papistes must be damned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally.
O miserabie Popery, coufounded by thy selfe!
O late start-vp Religion, patched like a Beggers cloke!
Thine own Doctors, <hi>O Popery,</hi> (such force hath the truth)
haue bewrayed thy treachery to the world. Thirdly, that
many likewise among the Papists, do externally obey the
Popish Law; who for all that, in their hearts, detest the
late hatched Romish Religion. This is euident by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
complaint of the learned man <hi>Gielerius,</hi> who tolde
that to his trusty frends, which he durst not tell the pope.</p>

same, which great learned Papists do defend. And I must
needs heere put the Reader in minde, of the newnesse of
late Romish religion. (viz:) that <hi>Venial Sinnes</hi> were neuer
known to the Church, vntil the late dayes of <hi>Pius</hi> the fift,
and <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. that is to say; about forty yeares ago.<note place="margin">An: Dom: 1566.</note>

the <hi>Nevv religion.</hi> I must likewise insinuate to the Reader,
another point of great importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (viz:) that the popes act
is reputed the decree of the Church, and that no part of
Romish religion is a matter of faith, vntill it please the
Pope so to apoint it. Now, for <hi>Fisher</hi> and <hi>Gerson,</hi> the one is
a cannonized Popish Saint, the other a Popish Byshop.
But these are not matters to stand vpon, though they help
our Iesuite to passe ouer the time, and to dazle the eyes

               <p>He concludeth this Article with this goodly reason.<note place="margin">Page, 281</note>
One stealeth iust so many Egges, as are necessary to make
a <hi>Mortall sinne;</hi> another stealeth one lesse. But there can
be no reason, why God may iustly condemne the one to
hell, and not the other. Therefore they both sinne <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally</hi>
alike. To this I aunswere, by demaunding a reason,
why the <hi>Iudge</hi> may condemne him to death that stealeth
thirteene pence halfe peny, and not him that stealeth one
peny lesse. If he answer, because the law condemneth one
and not the other; I aske againe, what reason was there,


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1601:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the Law was made against the one, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> against
the other? And if <hi>Bell</hi> can find a reason in this, he wil find
one in his owne Question. The reason of both is, because
such a quantity, is a notable iniury to our neighbour, and
consequently, it is against charity, and so breaketh the
Law; and a lesse quantity is not.</p>

               <p>The destinction betweene <hi>Mortall</hi> and <hi>Veniall Sinnes</hi>
lately inuented by the Pope, doth so trouble our Iesuite
after his consultation with his best learned friendes, that
hee can shape mee no aunswere, touching a few Egges.
Gladly he would seeme to say something; yet after hee
hath wearied himselfe with strugling against the truth, he
is where he first began. Not knowing how to answere, he
demaundeth two Questions; and that done, hee telleth
me, I must answere my selfe. This notwithstanding, after
better aduisement and consideration had of the matter,
he pretends to shew a reason of both his owne questions.
But howsoeuer that be (which is indeed a meere mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
he leaueth my argument vntouched. Let vs suppose for
explication sake, that Egges worth thirteene pence halfe
peny makes a <hi>Mortal sinne,</hi> and that God may iustly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
him that stole them; as also a <hi>Mortall Iudge,</hi> amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
<hi>Mortall men.</hi> Let vs likewise suppose for example sake,
that neyther the <hi>Ciuill Iudge,</hi> nor God himselfe can iustly
condemne him, that hath stollen but so many Egges
as are woorth twelue pence halfe penny. Nowe, this
is my Question; Nay, this is mine assertion; that there
can no good reason be yeelded, why God may iustly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the one to Hell, and not the other. To answere as
the Iesuite doeth, after hee hath deepely pondered the
matter, that one is a notable iniury to our neighbor, not
so the other, is too teo childish and friuolous. For, if
thirteene pence halfe peny be a notable iniurie, so is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
twelue pence: One penny doubtlesse, cannot make
<hi>Mortall</hi> and <hi>Veniall</hi> difference: neyther is it to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1601:63"/>
to say as our Iesuite doth; viz. that the ciuil Iudge
cannot condemne the theefe, that stealeth one peny lesse.
The reason is euident, because the ciuil Iudge is vnder the
law and subiect to it, but God Omnipotent is aboue his
Law, and may dispense with it at his good pleasure. So
did Christ aunswere the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> on the behalfe of his
disciple. <hi>The sabboath</hi> sayth Christ,<note place="margin">Marke, 2, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>was made for man, and
not man for the sabboth. Therefore is the sonne of Man,
Lorde of the sabboth also.</hi> The Iesuites reason thus reiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as friuolous, and nothing to the purpose, let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the matter to the bottome, for it is a point of great
consequence. First then, this is an vndoubted truth, that
the supreme ciuill Magistrate, may as lawfully appoint
death for stealing of twelue pence, as for 13. pence halfe
peny, for the penalty of death, is wholly arbitrary to the
iudge. He must frame his laws, as serue best for the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
gouernment of his people. Whereupon it commeth,
that in diuers countryes, diuers punishments are designed
for the same faults, and all agreeable to Gods law. This is
likewise an vndoubted truth in Popery, (viz:) that some
<hi>Sinnes</hi> are <hi>Veniall</hi> of their owne nature, other some mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.
Against this false ground of Popery, doe I now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.
We haue seene already, that a theefe may as wel be
condemned to dye for twelue pence, as for more, euen
so then, God <hi>à fortiori,</hi> may as iustly condemne one for a
Popish <hi>Veniall sinne,</hi> as for a <hi>Mortall,</hi> for euery sinne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
death of it owne nature, bee it more, be it lesse.
Yea, if any sinne should of it owne nature, be <hi>Veniall,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
should <hi>Originall sinne</hi> in an infant, be <hi>Veniall</hi> most of all,
because the Infant neyther can auoyd it, neyther hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
will to do it. I therefore conclude, that it is against all
sence and reason, to say, that God may iustly condeme a
man, for stealing so many Egges as in Popery make a
<hi>Mortall Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> (let them name what number they will,)
and that he cannot likewise condemne him, that stealeth
but one Egge lesse. And it is absurd to say or thinke, that


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1601:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the least sinne that can be named, doth not breake off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and friendship with God,<note place="margin">Psal, 5. 4</note> if wee respect the sin in it
owne Nature.<note place="margin">Psal, 6. 8</note> I proue it, because the least sinne that can
be named, doth auert and turne the doer from the face of
God; <hi>Ergo,</hi> from the amity and fauour of God. I proue the
<hi>Antecedent,</hi> for the consequence is good, and cannot bee
denyed. No sinne whatsoeuer, more or lesse, can be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto God, who detesteth all sinne; <hi>Ergo,</hi> euery sinne,
bee it neuer so small, turneth vs away from the fauour of
God. Truely therefore wrote Byshop <hi>Fisher</hi> and Maister
<hi>Gerson,</hi> that euery sin is mortall of it owne nature. And so
is that proued, which I defend.</p>

tell him, that hee heere confuteth himselfe. But for the
Readers helpe, I will breefely aunswere his particulars.
To the first I say,<note place="margin">Page. 134.</note> it is soundly and largely answered in the

and to haue bin a perpetuall Virgin, both before Christs
byrth, and in his byrth, and after his byrth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that albeit I defend (as our Iesuite also hath
granted) all things necessary to be beleeued vnto salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be contained in the holy scriptures; yet do I not
deny, but willingly graunt, and reuerently admit many
things, receiued by the perpetuall consent of the church,
and not repugnant to the written word,<note place="margin">Aug ad Iam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whatsoeuer is neyther against Fayth, nor against good manners;
may indifferently be obserued for their society amongst whom we
do conuerse.</hi> Againe, it is one thing to say, that all necessary

points of fayth and Doctrine, are contained in the holy
scriptures; another thing to say, that nothing not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the scripture, hath bin receyued by tradition, &amp;
may be admitted for a truth. It cannot be convinced out
of the scriptures (and therefore no matter of fayth) that
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and S, <hi>Paule</hi> dyed together at <hi>Rome;</hi> yet do I
admit it for a truth, as receiued by <hi>Tradition</hi> from the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue

falshood and lying.</p>
               <p>This is good. But secondly hee addeth, that to adde
Gods word though vnwritten, is a lawfull thing: but this

is a silly begging of the question, as the Schooles tearme
it. For I deny that vnwritten <hi>Word</hi> to bee Gods <hi>Word,</hi>
which our Iesuite should prooue, but cannot. And our
Iesuite hath already confessed, that all necessary pointes
of faith,<note place="margin">Page, 284, 285.</note> are contained in the Scriptures &amp; written <hi>Word.</hi>
And consequently, it is to late to tell vs now, of adding
or admitting the vnwritten <hi>Word.</hi> I admit his former as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
as consonant to the Scriptures; this latter I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
as childish, vaine, and friuolous. I proue it, because
euery word of God is to be admitted as a matter of faith;
and yet all matters of Faith are written, as is already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and granted. This therefore not being written, must
be hissed out of the Schoole of Christians.</p>

First, because the Prophet nameth not onely the <hi>Law,</hi> but
<hi>Testimony</hi> also, which comprehendeth Gods vnwritten

hee interpret the Scripture, so he may any way make it
seeme to serue his turne. For hee desperately heere affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
without all reason and authority, that by <hi>Testimony,</hi>
is vnderstood the vnwritten <hi>Word.</hi> Whereas indeede it is
the written <hi>Lawe,</hi> added onely for explication sake: as
if he had sayde; <hi>Ye must not seeke helpe at the dead, which is
the illusion of Sathan, but yee must seeke remedie in the word of
God, where his will is reuealed:</hi> ye must in all doubtes and
difficulties haue recourse to the <hi>Law</hi> of God, which is the
testification of Gods will towards man. In it ye shall find,
whatsoeuer is necessary for you to know. Breefely, as if
he had sayde; <hi>Ye must euer haue recourse to the Law, as to the


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1601:66"/>
Testimony of Gods holy will.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> yeeldeth the same
exposition of this place,<note place="margin">Hier. iu hune locum.</note> in these words; <hi>Si vultis noscere
quae dubia sunt, magis vos legi &amp; Testimoniis tradite Scriptura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
If ye will know the thinges that are doubtfull, yee
must haue recourse to the <hi>Law,</hi> and to the <hi>Testimony</hi> of
the Scriptures. Loe, hee ioyneth the <hi>Testimony</hi> with the
<hi>Law,</hi> not as a thing distinct from it, but as an explication
of the same. This reason is confirmed, by the coronation
of King <hi>Ioas;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Par. 23. 11.</note> who receiued at his coronation these three
things; <hi>Vnction,</hi> the <hi>Testimony,</hi> or the <hi>Law;</hi> and the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme,</hi>
or <hi>Crowne.</hi> Where the Latin <hi>Vulgata editio</hi> (to which

to be the <hi>Law.</hi> Which glosse striketh our Iesuites expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
dead. So then, by the Popes own approbation, the
<hi>Testimony</hi> is taken for the written word of Gods <hi>Law,</hi> and
his Iesuite hath here proued himselfe, to be a very Daw.
And where our Iesuite weeneth to find some helpe in the
word (<hi>Rather;</hi>) It seemeth to mee, that it doth him hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
For, if his sence bee admitted, it will bee lawfull in
some cases and times, to haue recourse vnto Witches.
But I will leaue him to himselfe, as a carelesse and fond

is al this huge Masse of lying? forsooth,<note place="margin">P 3. q. 42. art. 4. ad pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</note> because these

For Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writing after all, when the Cannon of the

must needes meane of all; and that for two respects. First
because all the rest of the Scriptures tend to one and the

may beleeue, <hi>That Iesus is the Sonne of GOD.</hi> Secondly,
because <hi>Miracles</hi> alone without <hi>Doctrine,</hi> are not able to

is not grounded in Miracles, but in the promises and word of

these words of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> affirming all thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

in another place you haue these expresse wordes;
<hi>All such points of Christian Faith, as are necessary to be actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeued, of euery one that hath vse of reason, are actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Scripture.</hi> Now, out of these wordes I note:
First, that the Scriptures were written for our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
and good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that nothing is omitted in the Scripture,
which is necessary for our saluation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Euangelists</hi> wrote many
things not so necessary for vs, and therefore, would in no

soules health.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that all thinges which euery one is bound to
beleeue actually, are actually set downe in the Scripture.
This being true, as it is most true indeed; I am content to
stand to the censure of euery indifferent Reader, whether
by the Iesuites confession and free graunt, the Scripture
be a totall rule of our Faith, or no. For doubtlesse, that
which containeth all necessary points of Christian Faith,
cannot be a partiall rule, but a total and consummate rule
of our faith.</p>

               <p>I haue prooued in the <hi>Downefall,</hi> that though our <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
of late daies do impudently affirme, that their Pope
cannot erre, when hee defineth iudicially; yet this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withwithstanding,


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1601:68"/>
Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> teacheth and telleth vs plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and roundly, that in his time the Byshop of <hi>Rome</hi> had
no such authority, as this day he proudly, &amp; Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly
taketh vpon him. For he roundly withstood the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of Pope <hi>Stephanus,</hi> who was then the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and both sharpely reprooued him, and stoutly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his falsely pretended authority. And for all that,
Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> was euer reputed a very holy Byshoppe in
his life time, and a glorious Martyr beeing dead. But, if
the Byshop of <hi>Rome</hi> had beene Christs Vicar, and so pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged,
as our <hi>Papists</hi> beare the World in hand hee is;
then doublesse Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> must needes haue beene an
Heretique, and so reputed and esteemed in the Church of
GOD, For, if any Christian shall this day do or affirme,
as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> did in his time, or publiquely deny the
Popes falsely pretended prymacy in any place, Country,
Territories, or Dominions, where Popery beareth the
sway; then without all peraduenture, he must bee burnt
at a stake, with fire and Fagot for his paines. Now, what
doth our Iesuite answere to this discourse? Forsooth, that
whatsoeuer is no true <hi>Tradition,</hi> the same must be tryed by
the Scripture. Alasse, alasse, Who seeth not, that our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite,
(and consequently all <hi>Papistes,</hi> seeing hee hath the
aduise of all the learned among them,) is at a <hi>Non plus?</hi>
I contend, that <hi>Traditions</hi> ought to bee tryed by the
Scripture, whether they bee true and sound, or no: Our
<hi>Fryer</hi> answereth, that false <hi>Traditions,</hi> and such as bee not
true, must be so tryed. What a iest is this? The Scripture
is the Touch-stone, by which wee must try false and true
<hi>Traditions;</hi> and so we cannot know them to be true <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi>
before we try them by the Scripture. How fondly
therefore aunswereth our <hi>Fryer,</hi> that if they bee not true,
they must be tryed by the Scripture? We deny these, and
these <hi>Traditions</hi> to bee true, and therefore appeale to the
Scripture for the tryall thereof. No, no, saith our Iesuite,
these may not bee tryed by the Scripture, because they


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1601:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are true <hi>Traditions.</hi> Marry Sir, this is indeed an aunswere
answerlesse. For ye take all the tryall to your selfe, and
leaue none at all to the Scripture. You will first set down
in your iudgements, which be true <hi>Traditions,</hi> and which
be false; and that done, we must goe try those to be false
by the Scripture, which you hold for false; but with the
other, we must not deale at all. By this kind of dealing,
I must needes say, the Scripture is but a partiall rule of
Faith indeed. And what shalbe the total rule of our saith?
Our Iesuite here tels vs, that it is the Popes iudiciall sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
whose faith cannot faile. For false Faith (saith he)
can haue no accesse to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chaire: as though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> did thinke, that the Byshop of <hi>Romes</hi>
Faith could not faile, where hee meaneth nothing lesse,
then to ascribe such a priuiledge to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
For, if he had beene of that minde, he would neuer haue
vrged Pope <hi>Stephanus,</hi> to be tryed by the Scriptures. No,
no, Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaketh not of errour in Faith or Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
but of neglect of discipline and false dealing of
<hi>Schismatiques,</hi> to whose false tales and reportes, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi>
would neuer yeelde their consent. As if he hadde
said; <hi>The Schismatickes which wee haue driuen out of Affrica,
seeke intertainement at Rome, but the Romans (whose Faith the
Apostle praised,) will neuer hearken vnto them, or giue credite
to their reportes.</hi> He speaketh of one <hi>Felicissimus,</hi> and other
bad fellowes his Companions, whose naughty dealing
Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> thought <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the godly <hi>Romaines</hi>
would neuer fauour. But such beggerly shifts as these be,
are good enough for Popish falsly pretended prymacy.

in the former part of this Obiection, he will admit,
nothing without the scripture; (<hi>In thinges concerning faith,

the Scripture the store-house of all truths,<note place="margin">Page, 324.</note> necessarie
to be knowne of Christians: and in another sayeth, that

               <p>His meaning is as you say, and I approue the same. But
why doth he require other helpe then the scripture, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the scripture as he graunteth, is the store-house of all
necessary truths? Shall I tell you? You will not thanke
me for my paines. I haue set downe at large in my Booke
of <hi>Motiues,</hi> what this your holy Byshoppe hath written of
<hi>Purgatory</hi> and <hi>Pardons.</hi> I will now recount the argument,<note place="margin">See my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, in the 7. Preamble.</note>
onely referring the Reader to the place.</p>
               <p>First, Maister <hi>Fisher</hi> telleth vs, that the Greeke church
neuer bel eeued <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Latine Church and Church of <hi>Rome</hi>


                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:1601:70"/>
did not beleeue the sayd Purgatory, for many hundered
of yeares after S. <hi>Peters</hi> death, whose successor for al that,
the Pope boasteth himselfe to be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that this Purgatory was not beleeued of all the
Latine Church, at one and the same time; but by litle &amp;
little. Where I wish the Reader to note by the way, that
Popery crept into the Church by little and little, and not
all at one time, which is a point that galleth the papistes
more then a little I weene.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that Purgatory was beleeued in these latter
dayes, by speciall reuelation of the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that Pardons came not vp, till Purgatory was
found out, for in Purgatory resteth the life of Pardons;
as which (if ther be no Purgatory,) are not worth a straw.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that Purgatory was a loug time vnknowne.</p>
               <p>Seauenthly, that Purgatory could not be found in the
Scripture, of a very long time.</p>
               <p>Eightly, that it was not wholly found out by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but partly by Reuelations. And heere wee see that
verified, which our Iesuite out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> telleth vs,
(viz:) that the holy Scripture is but a partial rule of faith.
For, if it be a totall rule of fayth, the Pope (as Maister <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher</hi>
affirmeth) must both want his Purgatory, and be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued
of his pardons.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, that pardons were not heard of, or knowne,
to the <hi>Primatiue Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenthly, that then Pardons began, when men began
to feare the paines of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>This is the summe of that worthy Doctrine, which By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Fisher</hi> hath published to the world; euen at that time
when he defended the Pope and Popery, after the best
manner he could. He that shall read his words in my <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues</hi>
at large, cannot but detest the Pope and all popish
faction. Hence it is most apparant, why the Byshop sayd
that they must vse other helpes then the holy Scripture,
for the maintenance of their Religion, for the Scripture


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1601:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is but a partiall rule of popish faith, as wee haue heard

the Apostles to write, as with his own hands. But this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
nothing against vs, both because S. <hi>Thomas</hi> saith not,
what Christ would haue vs beleeue, but what hee would
haue vs read, and <hi>Traditions</hi> be such, as Christ would haue
vs beleeue, though we read them not. As also because S.
<hi>Thomas</hi> speaketh not of all points of beleefe, but onely of
Christs sayings &amp; doings, besides which the very sayings
and dooinges of the Apostles recorded in their Acts and
Epistles, or testified by <hi>Tradition,</hi> are to be beleeued.</p>

               <p>I answere; First, that Popery is this day a most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Religion, and woe vnto them that do beleeue and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the same. This is, or may bee euident to euery one,
throughout this whole discourse. Secondly, that <hi>Aquinas</hi>
auoucheth very plainely (as I sayde in the <hi>Downefall</hi>) that
all things necessary to our saluation, are contained in the
Scriptures. For in Christs deeds are contained his myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
his life, his conuersation; in his sayinges Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably,
are contained, his preaching, his teaching, his
doctrine, and consequently, whatsoeuer is necessary for
vs to know. If then this be true, as it is most true, (for the
papists may not deny the doctrine of <hi>Aquinas</hi>) that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
Christ would haue vs to know, of his myracles, of
his life, of his conuersation, of his preaching, of his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
of his doctrine, the same is written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
then doubtlesse, none but such as will <hi>Cum ratione
in sanires,</hi> can deny all thinges necessary for our saluation,
to be contained in the holy scriptures. Yea, if our Iesuite
will stand to his owne doctrine, plainly auouched in this
present Pamphlet, this Controuersie is at an end, for we
agree therein. These are his expresse words: <hi>For surely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 278</note> 
                  <hi>the

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1601:71"/>
remembrance, would omit no one point, which was necessary to bee
actually knowne of euery one; especially, seeing they haue written
many things, which are not so necessary.</hi> And this teacheth S.
<hi>Austen</hi> when he sayth, that those things are written which
seemed sufficient for the saluation of the faithfull.</p>
               <p>Thus writeth our <hi>Fryer</hi> Iesuite: Out of whose words I
note first, that the Prophets and Apostles wrote their
doctrine for our good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they left no point vnwritten, which was
necessary for vs to know.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that he yeeldeth a reason why all thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
are written; (viz:) because the Prophets &amp; Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
haue written many things which were not so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for vs to know.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that S. <hi>Austen</hi> teacheth vs the same doctrin,
(viz:) that all things necessary for our saluation are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to writing and set downe in the Scripture; yea, the
Iesuite affirmeth in another place, out of the same Saint
<hi>Austen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 286.</note> that all things are plainly set downe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which concerne either faith or manners.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that our Iesuite granteth al things to be written
of Christs both sayings, and doings, which Christ would
haue vs to read. Marry, hee addeth three worthy excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
First, that though all Christs sayings and dooings,
be written, which Christ would haue vs to read, yet not
all which he would haue vs to beleeue. As thogh forsooth
Christ would haue vs beleeue something, which we may
not read. What a fond saying is this? Nay, what a fond
Religion is Popery? All things necessary for vs, are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
(saith our Iesuite,) and yet he telleth vs withall, that
we must beleeue things which are not written. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
we must beleeue thinges which are necessarie
for vs. Nay, which is more, that Articles of the Christian
fayth are not necessary for vs. Loe, Popery is a very
strange Religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that we must beleeue <hi>Traditions,</hi> which Christ


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1601:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would not haue vs to read, and consequently, that Christ
would not haue vs to read our beliefe. <hi>Lord haue mercy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs, and keepe vs from this doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that we must beleeue many vnwritten <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the Apostles, which are neither contained in
Christs sayings, nor in his dooinges. But the holy Ghost
came downe from Heauen, not to teach the Apostles
new Reuelations, saue those thinges onely which Christ
had foretold them, and which they did not perfectly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.<note place="margin">Iohn 14, 16.</note>
                  <hi>But the comforter the holy Ghost</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>whom
the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and
bring all thinges to your remembrance, whatsoeuer I haue saide
vnto you,</hi> so is the Originall in Greeke. <hi>Panta ha eipon

hath tyed all Papists, readeth thus; <hi>Whatsoeuer I shall say
vnto you.</hi> And hence it is, that they would establish their
vnwritten <hi>Traditions.</hi> But the truth is, as we haue seene,
(viz:) that Christ hath commanded his Apostles to writ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he would haue vs know and beleeue; as also, that Christs
Apostles receiued no new Reuelations of the holy ghost,
but the perfect vnderstanding of those thinges, which
Christ afore had taught them, and heere we may note by

what lately you haue heard in this short reply.</p>
               <p>First, that the Greekes neuer beleeued your Popish
<hi>Purgatorie,</hi> as which cannot bee prooued, out of the

               <p>Secondly, that the Byshoppe of Rome to challenge

               <p>Thirdly, that to acknowledge sinnes <hi>Veniall</hi> of their

                  <hi>Bell</hi> Obiecteth out of <hi>Theodoretus,</hi> that the Haebrewe
Bookes were Translated into all Languages. This is
nothing against vs, who deny not but Scripture hath bin
and may bee, vpon iust and vrgent causes, translated into
all languages, so it be not vulgarly vsed, and common to
all kind of vulgar people.</p>

               <p>You say, you deny not, but Scripture hath beene, and
also may bee Translated into the vulgar Languages: yet
you adde two restrictions, by which, you in effect vnsay
that, which you had saide before.</p>
               <p>First, you say, it may be in the Vulgar languages, so it
bee not vulgarly vsed. What is this? Fast and loose, your
<hi>Legierdemaine?</hi> To what end I pray you, shall it and may
it bee turned into the vulgar Languages? That the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
people may Read it, or no? If you say, yea; then may
it be vulgarly vsed. For that is to bee vulgarly vsed, to be
read vulgarly. If you say, no; then in vaine do you graunt
it to be Translated into the vulgar tongue.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you say, it may also be Translated, so it be


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1601:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doone vppon iust and vrgent causes. You should haue
doone well, to haue named those iust and vrgent causes.
But Sir, seeing the thing may bee doone, and seeing also
there may bee iust and vrgent causes, why it should bee
doone; how commeth it to passe, that none may doe it,
vnlesse the Pope licence him thereunto? How happeneth
it, that none may read it when it is translated, vnlesse hee
haue the Popes licence so to doe? How chanceth it, that
it was neuer done, since the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> aspired to his
vsurped prymacy? This would I learne.</p>

all vnwritten <hi>Traditions</hi> whatsoeuer, which are obtruded

Other <hi>Traditions</hi> not contrary to Gods <hi>Word,</hi> which the

the same. And if you were constant to your own writings,<note place="margin">Page, 284. 285. 286. 290. 291.</note>
you would subscribe to this my doctrine. For you graunt

               <p>Two thinges our <hi>Fryer</hi> vrgeth, neither of which vvill
do him any seruice, (viz:) my meaning, and the proofe


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1601:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of my conclusion. My meaning is cleerely vttered,<note place="margin">See the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Page 129.</note> when
in the <hi>Downefall</hi> I affirmed Saint <hi>Policarpus,</hi> Saint <hi>Policra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and other holy Fathers, to bee so farre from acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the Byshop of <hi>Rome</hi> to bee the supreme head of
the Church, and that he could not erre; that they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
themselues his equals, touching gouernment Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall;
that they all reprooued him very sharpely;
that they all with vniforme assent, affirmed him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
a grosse errour, &amp; to hold a false opinion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they with might and maine withstand his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.
Whereas this day, if any Bishops, Magestrates, or
other Potentates in the World (where <hi>Popery</hi> beareth the
sway) should doe the like; they might all roundly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
and not onely deposed from their iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
but also to be burnt with fire and Fagot for their
pains. Thus I then wrote, so as our <hi>Fryer</hi> could not doubt
of my meaning, but that malice carryeth him away to ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Well, but how is my conclusion proued? Thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth;
I alleaged this great contention among the holy
Fathers, to proue the vncertainty of obtruded vnwritten
<hi>Traditions</hi> in these our dayes. My Argument was, <hi>A ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iori
ad minus,</hi> as the Scooles tearm it, (viz:) that if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the most ancient Church, when she was in good
estate, and stained with very few or no corruptions at all,
could finde no certaintie in vnwritten <hi>Traditions;</hi> much
lesse can wee trust to vnwritten <hi>Traditions</hi> in these dayes,
when the Pope and his Iesuited Popelinges, employ all
their care, study, &amp; industry, to bury the truth of Christs
Gospell vnder the ground. And so haue I both prooued
my conclusion, and also our <hi>Fryer</hi> to be either full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,

wee ought to fast one day, some two daies, others more, and some

a place clearely against himselfe. For here Saint <hi>Ireney</hi> &amp;
<hi>Eusebius</hi> affirme cleerely, that at the beginning there was
one manner of fasting <hi>Lent</hi> appointed, though some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,

it. Which prooueth not the said <hi>Tradition</hi> to be vncertain

some few to the whole. And by this is aunswered, vvhat
he bringeth out of <hi>Socrates</hi> touching the diuersity of time

               <p>I prooued in the <hi>Downefall</hi> out of <hi>Eusebius Caesariensis,</hi>
the vncertainty of <hi>Popish vnwritten Traditions,</hi> by the great
diuersity about the keeping of <hi>Lent.</hi> Because some
thought they ought only to fast one day, some two daies,
others more daies, and some forty. I prooued semblably
out of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that the people did differ no lesse in theyr
manner of eating, then they did in their daies of abstay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
For some (saith he) would eate no liuing thing; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersome
of liuing things, eat onely Fish; some together
with fish, did ate also Birdes; but some ate onely Bread,
and others at night eate all kind of meats without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
yea, hee telleth vs in the same place, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
fast three weekes before <hi>Easter,</hi> besides the <hi>Sabbaoth</hi>
and the Lords day. And that the <hi>Illirians</hi> and <hi>Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
doe fast sixe weekes, and yet doe they all tearm their
fast, <hi>Lent.</hi> Here I inferred in the <hi>Downefall,</hi> the vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Popish vnwritten Traditions.</hi> Now our <hi>Fryer</hi> thinketh
to answere all this (though a Bulwarke inuincible) with
his onely bare <hi>Word;</hi> (viz:) in telling his Reader, that
<hi>Bell</hi> sheweth his want of iudgement, in bringing a place
cleerely against himselfe. Mary Sir, this is a ready answere


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1601:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
indeede. If such answeres will serue, in vaine is all dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
But our <hi>Fryer</hi> would seeme, to yeelde a reason of
this his answere. And what is that? Forsooth, that in the
beginning all obserued one manner of <hi>Fast,</hi> though some
afterward, either of ignorance or negligence (he cannot
tell whether) did breake it. To my Testimony out of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
he saith it is an vntruth, because the <hi>Romains</hi> fasted
the Saterdaies. But I answere thus; First, that the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety
of <hi>Traditions</hi> is heereby so apparant, as it is great
impudency to deny the same. For how can there bee any
certainty, where not onely the time of fasting, but also
the meats that must be eaten, is vncertaine? Both which
happen is this case.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the ancient Cannons of the Apostles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
<hi>Socrates</hi> his affirmation; for there is it thus written;

spake the truth, &amp; that he hath falsly accused him;
or else (if hee like this better) that the Pope contemned

forsake the Faith, yet neuer preach a false faith.
They may sacrifice to Idolles, yet neuer preach Idolatry.
They may deny Christ, yet neuer preach against Christ.
And indeed for preaching, it may be true, in an vsual Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish

               <p>First our Iesuite granteth, that the Scripture is the onely
rule &amp; Cannon which we must follow in beleeuing &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
any thing. That done, he by &amp; by telleth vs, that it
neither is, nor is cald the onely Cannon of Faith. This is a

to be folowed, in beleeuing or defining any thing. This is
true, hold thee here good <hi>Fryer.</hi> But what followeth? The

But it neither is, nor is called the onely Cannon of Faith.
Loe, first hee graunteth the Scripture to bee an infallible
rule of Faith, and then he denieth it to be the onely rule
of Faith. Is not that worthy to be the onely rule of Faith,
which is the infallible rule thereof? Shall we forsake the
infallible rule, &amp; betake our selues to a fallible rule? Ther
is no remedy, the Pope will haue it so. The Scripture
therefore by Popish grant (GOD reward them for their

The one forsooth, because it was not conuenient,
that the head should follow the members. The other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Emperour would euer sit in the highest place.
Out of these wordes I noted two pointes of importance;
the one, that in the Auncient Church, the highest place
in the Councels, was euer reserued to the Emperour. The
other, that the East Churches did neuer acknowledge the
Popes prymacie, which hee this day challengeth ouer all
Kingdomes and Regalities most arrogantly. To vvhich
twaine, this pleasant adiunct perforce must be annexed:


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1601:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(viz:) that our humble Father the Pope (who hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
calleth himselfe <hi>Sernus seruorum Dei,</hi>) would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
come to the Councels, because forsooth he could not
endure to see the Emperour sitting in the highest place.

               <p>The second point was, that the Bishops sweare to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
his Canons and decrees, whom they freely grant, may
bee an Heretique. The third point was, that the Bishops
sweare obedience to him in matters of Faith, whom they
can depose for heresie. These pointes which our Iesuite
proposeth couertly (because he would not haue the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to vnderstand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) must neuer be forgotten. We must
(saith our <hi>Fryer</hi>) obey &amp; beleeue what the Pope decreeth
iudicially, though in hart he be an <hi>Heretick.</hi> This is strange
Doctrine to a Christian hart, though approued of all <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</hi>
It is not amisse here to adde, the Testimony of their
graue <hi>Quodl betist.</hi> These are his words; As the prudent
<hi>Greeke</hi> appealed from <hi>Alexander</hi> furious, to <hi>Alexander</hi>
sober; and Bishoppe <hi>Crostate</hi> from Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> priuate,
to Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> publique, and as <hi>Summus pontifex in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedra
Petri,</hi> so may the Seculars appeale from the Pope
as <hi>Clemens,</hi> vnto his holinesse as <hi>Peter.</hi> These words are
expressely set downe. <hi>Quodl. 6. art.</hi> 10. By this Doctrine
so plainely deliuered (which is a constant position in the
<hi>Romish</hi> Church) the Secular Priests giue vs to vnderstand,
that execrable and neuer enough detested fallacy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Pope &amp; his popelings, haue a long time seduced


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1601:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a great part of the Christian world, (viz:) that the Pope
may erre as a priuate man, but not as a publicke person.
Of which absurd Doctrine I haue written at large in my
Treatise, intituled <hi>The Hunting of the Romish Foxe.</hi> I will
therefore for the present onely speake thereof, as these
words giue me fit occasion.</p>
               <p>First then; we see heere, that if we meane to wring any
truth out of the Popes nose, we must haue recourse to his
holines, at such time as he is sober; not when he is furious
least he become starke mad, &amp; forget for euer the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we must haue his aduise, when he is a publike
person, not a priuate man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we must go vnto him, not as he is indeed, this
or that Pope, but as he is S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that blessed Apostle of
our Lord Iesus. Thus much is deduced out of this popish
Doctrine, by euident and necessary consecution. These
points, if they be well marked, will vtterly confound all
popish Doctrine, and turne it vpside downe. For first, it is
a constant <hi>Axiome</hi> in all popish Doctrine, that the Pope
and none but the pope, must be the Iudge in all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies
of faith and Doctrine.</p>
               <p>This notwithstanding, wee see by this popish doctrine
(which is currant in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church) that if the Pope
Iudge of any matter, as he is furious and not sober; as he
is a priuate man, and not a publike person; as hee is <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,
Sixtus, Adrianus,</hi> or some other like pope, and not
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe; then may hee erre, and so both bee
deceiued himselfe, and deceiue all others. Whereupon it
followeth of necessity, that euery one must well examine
the popes Doctrine and Iudgement, before he beleeue it,
otherwise doubtles, he may receiue poyson for medicine,
falshood for truth, and erroneous, for <hi>Orthedoxe</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
doctrine. Nay, otherwise he cannot possibly tell, when
he shall appeale from the pope, as a false teacher and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer
of the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:1601:82"/>
Secondly, the time cannot be named, in which the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> shall be the Byshop there, &amp; not a publick
person at the selfe-same time, for euen then when hee is a
sleepe, he is a publicke person, or else no Byshop doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.
For once a Byshop euer a Byshop, by Popish inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leble
Character. Yet I willingly graunt, that a publique
person may do some act, which may be censured the acte
of a priuate man; but that cannot serue their turne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the Papists will neuer apeale to the pope,
nor haue any intercourse with him, vntill he be Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
they shall neuer do it, till the worlds end.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if he be <hi>Peter</hi> by Office or calling, then is hee
alwayes <hi>Peter;</hi> vnlesse perhaps hee be sometime <hi>Lucifer,</hi>
which were a rare <hi>Metamorphosis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, this Popish distinction, may fitly be termed a trick
of fast and loose. For, if the Pope define a truth, they may
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> say, he defined as a publick person. But if he define an
error, then they say, he defined as a priuat ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So doubtles
it may be said indeed, that he can neuer erre, but some ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in his robes, or some <hi>Deuill</hi> vnder his <hi>pall.</hi> Briefely, on the
one side (as we haue heard already) the Pope commands
vpon paine of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> not to dispute of his power, nor
to examine his doings, and yet on the other side, we must
know whether he speake and define as a publicke person,
or as a priuate man, before we beleeue his decrees: which
knowledge for al that can no way be had, but by due exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the popes doings. What remaineth but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
and complaine to our trusty friendes (as the great
learned Papist <hi>Gielerius</hi> did) that by this Popish Doctrine
no man can go to heauen.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. R.</speaker>
               <p>For we must obey and beleeue what he decreeth iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,

            <sp>
               <speaker>T. B.</speaker>
               <p>Then sir, we must examine the doctrine which the pope
deliuereth, to know whither it proceedeth from the Pope
as a publique person, or as a priuate man. For otherwise


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1601:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we may as soone receiue deadly poyson, as wholy medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine;
and as soone worship <hi>Harmannus</hi> the Heretiques
bones, as the reliques of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>S. Paule.</hi> But this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
the Pope forbids and your selfe (Maister Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
tels vs the same tale in your next wordes, which are
these; <hi>Because Byshops must not examine the Doctrine, which
the Pope deliuereth iudicially out of</hi> S. Peters <hi>chaire, as supreme
pastor of Gods Church, but onely that, wherein hee vttereth his
owne priuate Opinion.</hi> Thus writeth our Iesuite, truly telling
vs the Popish faith. Which Doctrine, if any but a Papist
had deliuered it, few or none woulde haue giuen credite
thereunto. O sweet Iesus! I wonder how any Papist hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
such Doctrine published in print, by our Iesuites, so
deare &amp; so neare to the Pope himselfe, and duely ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the vanity thereof, and the blasphemy therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
can still be a Papist, and not defie the Pope &amp; his
damnable doctrine. What shal we do with holy scripture?
Is it the infallible rule of faith? Is it superior to the Popes
iudiciall sentence? No, no, if the Pope define against it,
his sentence must bee obeyed, neyther may any Byshop,
(much lesse euery priuate man) examine the same, or else
cal it into Question, <hi>Apage, Apage,</hi> fire &amp; faggot for such
rotten Popery, God will vomit it out of his mouth.</p>

that the Doctrine of pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. of that name, was
condemned at <hi>Paris,</hi> as false and erroneous.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that his Doctrine was condemned with the

               <p>Thirdly, that it was condemned, in the presence of the

               </p>

               <p>Fiftly, that the great Learned Doctours of the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

               <p>Sixtly, that neyther the king, nor the learned papistes,
did in those dayes graunt such authority to the Pope, as
now adayes the Pope arrogantly challengeth to himself,
vvhereuppon it followeth consequently, that the Pope
taught false Doctrine, euen in a weighty matter of faith.
To which is consectary, that his Doctrine was publicke,
as which was publikely condemned at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that in
the presence of the King. But now kings must not deale
in such matters, where the Popes holinesse beareth any

seeing the force of this Testimony, to ouerthrowe, the
highest point in popery, bestirreth himselfe mightily in
defence of the popish faith. He telleth vs forsooth, if we
will beleeue him, (as none will that haue either any wit
or reason) that pope <hi>Iohn</hi> erred in deede, as <hi>Adrian</hi> and
<hi>Alphonsus</hi> witnesse, but he did that as a priuate man (sayth
our Iesuite) not as pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which distinction

no deniall can be made.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Pope erred in a very serious matter,
euen in a matter of Popish faith; (viz:) that Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
was so dissolued by reason of Heresie, that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
man or woman might marry againe, the Hereticall
party liuing. Which thing, sayth <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> was manifest
to euery man to bee an Heresie, and the late Counsell of

               <p>Fiftly that the said Decree cannot this day be found, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

Priest makes the Chaire. The place doth not sanctifie the
Manne, but the manne sanctifies the place. Euery
Priest is not an holy man, but euery holy manne is a
Priest. Hee that shall sit well in the Chaire, receiues the
honour of the Chaire, but hee that sits euill, dooth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury

which would to GOD the Pope and his Iesuited Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,

make this Vniuersall Church, whose head and Spouse is
Christ. And this Church is it, that cannot erre: yea, the
Popes owne glosse vpon his owne Decrees, dooth most
liuely describe that Church which cannot erre, to bee
the congregation of the faithfull. Thus is it there written
in expresse wordes; <hi>Quaero, de qua ecclesia intelligas,</hi>

it is very certaine that the pope may erre. I answere ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the church is here taken for the congregation
of the faithfull, &amp; such a church can neuer erre (indeed.)
Out of these words of these great Papistes, I note: First,
that the Church is the Vnïuersall Congregation of the
faithfull, throughout the whole VVorlde; whereof the
head is not the Pope, but Christ Iesus our Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that this is that Church, which cannot erre.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that when the Pope saith, the Church cannot
erre, then his owne deare and faithfull interpreter telleth
him, that that priuiledge is not graunted to the Pope, but
to the whole congregation of the faithfull. And the sayd
Glosse prooueth the same, by many Canons of the popes
owne Decrees.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that the church in which the truth alwayes

all which our Iesuite hath brought in all this his great

for the better contentation of the Christian
Reader, I thus reply vpon our Lordly <hi>Fryer.</hi>

                     </gap>sse diuinam nobis consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terit,
iam ex seipsa habet, vt ei per omnia credere teneamur.</hi> It
commeth from the Church, that we know which is holy
Scripture: but after we know it to be the holy Scripture,
henceforth it hath of it selfe, that wee are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
it in euery point. Thus writeth this famous Papist;
and he doth illustrate his assertion, by a similitude drawn
from a Creditor and a Debtor. As if (saith he) witnesses
should bee brought for the proofe of an Instrument, in
which <hi>Peter</hi> standeth bound to pay to <hi>Iohn</hi> 100. crownes,
the witnesses do not make <hi>Peter</hi> to be bound to <hi>Iohn.</hi> For
although <hi>Peter</hi> should deny it, and no Witnesses could
prooue it, <hi>Peter</hi> for all that should owe the debt. But
the Witnesses effect so much, that hee may be conuicted
to owe the debt. Much more to this effect hath <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
but I desire to bee briefe. This I inferre out of his
words, that though we grant the Scriptures to be known
by the Testimony of the Church; yet after that notifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it deserueth credite of it selfe, for euery iote contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the same.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that seeing the Scripture acknowledged
for Gods word of all Christians, containeth by the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
confession (as is already prooued) all thinges neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for christian beliefe vnto Saluation; it followeth of


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1601:89"/>
necessity, that no vnwritten <hi>Tradition</hi> is necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
For doubtlesse, if euery Article, and all thinges
necessary to salution be written; then can nothing at all
be necessary, that remaineth vnwritten.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I constantly auouch and christianly affirme,
(mark gentle Reader attentiuely) that the holy Scripture
dow shew it selfe to be Gods word; euen as the Sun and
the Candle by their light, do shew themselues what they
are. I proue it: First, because the Prophet cals the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

                  <hi>Thy word O Lord</hi> (saith holy <hi>Dauid</hi>) <hi>is a

confirmeth the same,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 19.</note> when hee saith; <hi>Wee haue a

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, because Christ himselfe telleth vs, that his

                  <hi>My Sheepe</hi> (saith he) <hi>heare

the Church sheweth Christ to them, but because
Christ knoweth them. This point must bee well marked,
that Christs sheep therefore know Christ, because Christ
first knoweth them; not because the church make Christ
knowne vnto them. <hi>Ergo</hi> they know the scripture to bee
Gods worde, because Christ, not the church, sheweth it

               <p>Thirdly, because the spiritual man (as the Apostle wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)

bring to passe, that a man may discerne the Doctrine of
God necessary to saluation, from contrary error which is
not of God. Thus writeth the grauest Papist for learning,
in the vniuersall world; and consequently, it is and must
bee of great force against the Papistes, whatsoeuer hath
passed from his pen. And I protest vnto the (Gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
that nothing hath more estraunged me from Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and set me at defiance with it, then the cleere &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
Doctrine, of the best Learned and most renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Papistes, for whosoeuer will seriously pervse the
Bookes which I haue published to the view of the world,
shall therein finde by the Testimony of the best approued
Papists, euery point of setled Doctrine in the Church of
England.</p>
               <p>Out of the words of this learned Popish Byshop, that
when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> sayth, <hi>The vnction teacheth vs all things:</hi> Hee
meaneth not the difficult Questions in Religion, but <hi>all,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn 2. 27.</note>
                  <hi>such points as are necessary for euery mans saluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that no man wanteth this knowledge and
iudgment of Doctrine, but he that is willingly ignorant,
and will not apply himselfe to liue Christianly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that euery priuate man, is able to discern true
Doctrine from Falshood and Error, so farre forth as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for his saluation; as well as a sound and good tast
is able to discern differences of tasts. <hi>Ergo,</hi> euery faithful
Christian is able to discern Gods word from mans word;
because it is a thing necessary for his owne soules health.
The case is so cleare, as it can by no reason be denyed.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, because the formall obiect of our faith, is <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas

confirmeth in these Golden wordes; <hi>Iam hic videte &amp;c.</hi>
Nowe bretheren behold heere a great sacrament. The
sound of our wordes pierceth your eares, but the Maister
that teacheth you is within. Thinke not, that man lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
any thing of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We (Preachers) may admonish you
by sound of words, but if he be not within that teacheth,
in vaine is our sounde. The outward teachings, are some
helpes and admonitions, but hee sitteth in his chaire in
heauen, that teacheth the hart. The maister is within that
teacheth. It is Christ that teacheth. It is his inspiration,
that instructeth. Where his inspiration and vnction is not,
there the outward noyse of words is in vaine. Thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
this holy, auncient, and Learned father, with many

if nothing else were saide, that howsoeuer <hi>Paule</hi>
plant, or <hi>Apollo</hi> water, yet will no increase followe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
God giue the same.</p>
               <p>I therefore conclude, that we do not beleeue this book
or that Booke to be Cannonical, because this man or that
man, or the church saith so, but because the Scripture is
'<hi>axiopistos;</hi> because it hath in it selfe that dignity, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and that Maiesty, which is woorthy of credite in it
selfe. The declaration of the church, doth make vs know
and beleeue the scripture; but is onely an externall help,
to bring vs thereunto. We indeed beleeue the Scripture,
&amp; this or that Booke to be canonicall, because God doth
inwardly teach vs, and perswade our harts so to beleeue.
For <hi>Certes,</hi> if we should beleeue this or that booke to be


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1601:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
canonicall, because the Church saith so; then should the
formall obiect of our faith, and the last resolution therof,
be man, and not God himselfe; as <hi>Areopagna, Aquinas,</hi> &amp;
the truth it selfe teacheth vs.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, because we cannot be assured, that the Church
telleth vs the truth. For how can the Church perswade
vs, that she knoweth it to be Gods word? If aunswere be
made, that shee knoweth it of another Church; then I
demaund againe, how that other Church can performe
it? And so, either contrary to all Diuinity, Phylosophy,
and right reason, <hi>Dabitur processus in infinitum;</hi> Or else
they must say, they receiued it by <hi>Tradition</hi> from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are they where they began. For first, they
cannot make vs know that assuredly. Againe,<note place="margin">Page 387.</note> our Iesuite
confuteth that answer, when he liberally telleth vs, that
many partes of the Bible were long after the daies of the
Apostles doubted of, and consequently, their <hi>Apostolicall</hi>
so supposed <hi>Tradition,</hi> is of no effect. If answere be made,
that the Church knoweth it by Reuelation, then their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Bishop <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> telleth them plainely,<note place="margin">Canus de Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, lib. 3. ca. 4 <hi>Page</hi> 101.</note> and
roundly, that it cannot bee so. These are his expresse
wordes; <hi>Nec vllas in fide nouas reuelationes ecclesia habet.</hi>
For the Church hath no new Reuelations, in matters of
Faith. If answere be made, that the Scripture saith, the
Church cannot erre, and so her testification is an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
rule thereof; we admit the answer, we hold the same,
the controuersie is at an end, the victory is our own One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we must adde this, which is already proued, that that
Church which cannot erre, is not the late <hi>Romish</hi> church,
but the congregation of the faithfull.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the Scripture it selfe in many places telleth vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
that it is the word of God.</p>
               <p>First, wee haue in the foure <hi>Euangelistes</hi> these vvordes
expressely set downe. <hi>The Holy-Ghost of Iesus Christ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Matthew, Marke, Luke,</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> affirmeth, in the beginning of


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1601:92"/>
the <hi>Actes of the Apostles,</hi> that he made a Book of al those
thinges which Iesus both did and taught; meaning that
gospell which is the third in number.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">2. Peter. 1. 21.</note> wee are taught by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
of Scripture is made by any priuate motion, but
that holy men of God spake, as they were mooued by the
Holy-Ghost.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 23.</note> S. <hi>Paule</hi> telleth vs, <hi>That he receiued that of our

               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, the same Apostle affirmeth, that <hi>That Gospell

                  <hi>that one

answered, <hi>that they had Moses and the Prophets, whom

Apostles; <hi>that all thinges must needes bee fulfilled which were
written of him in the Law of Moses, in the Prophets,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke. 16, 13, 15, 25, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>and in the
Psalmes. Yea, Christ tolde the two Disciples going toward Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus,
that they ought to beleeue all thinges which the Prophets
spake: and therefore beginning at Moses and all the Prophets,
hee did interpret to them in all the Scriptures, the thinges which
were written of himselfe.</hi> And consequently, the Scripture
it selfe doth plainely tell vs, that it is the word of GOD.
For out of these wordes of the holy Scripture, wee haue
these points of Doctrine most cleerely deliuered.</p>
               <p>First, that our Sauiour Christ spake them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that all things must be beleeued, which are
written in the <hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and in the <hi>Psalmes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that all things foretold of Christ in the <hi>Law,</hi>
the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> were fulfilled indeed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that Christ did interprete the chiefest partes
of all the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Psalmes.</hi> I therefore


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1601:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conclude, that it is the word of GOD. As also, that the
dignity, the excellency, and the Maiesty thereof, dooth
insinuate no lesse vnto vs.</p>

which the Iewes haue; but which the Catholique church

tels vs right plainely in another place, that many parts of
the Bible were doubted of, a long time after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
For, if you had receiued by <hi>Tradition</hi> from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
all the Scriptures, both of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
ye could neuer so long after the Apostles, haue bin
in doubt of many partes thereof. For by your supposed
<hi>Tradition,</hi> you had the same assurance for the whole, as
for the parts. And consequently, seeing you graunt your
vncertainty for many parts, you must perforce graunt the
same vncertainty for the whole. And so you confesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares,
and against your wils, so much in effect and true

                  <hi>Bels</hi> third solution is,<note place="margin">Page 370.</note> that the <hi>New Testament</hi> is but

                  <hi>Bell</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Page 371.</note> canonicall Scripture may bee discerned of it
selfe, as light from darke. He prooueth it,<note place="margin">Psa 119 105.</note> because Gods
word is called a light and a Lanthorne which shineth to
Men.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1, 19.</note> Because spirituall men iudge all things; because the

                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2, 27.</note> But this is easily refel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
First, because though <hi>Samuell</hi> were a faithfull and

                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:1601:93"/>

not euery thing, but onely so much as is necessary for

when and in what degree it pleaseth God to giue it.
<hi>Some of Gods children are effectually called at the first hour,</hi>

                  <hi>yet are they al

               <p>I answere; first, that all the faithfull rightly so tearmed,
are spirituall and not carnall,<note place="margin">1. Co. 3, 1, 2, 3</note> neyther do the places quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by our Iesuite,<note place="margin">Gal. 6, 1.</note> proue any thing for his purpose. For if
he will haue none to bee spirituall that are sinners, then
must he deny the Apostles of our Lord to haue beene spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.
For as S. <hi>Iames</hi> granteth freely,<note place="margin">Iam. 3, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>They all sinned in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thinges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that if the Apostle had not explicated, by
what meanes the Spirituall man iudgeth all things, as he
did indeed, yet would it not follow thereupon, that our
Iesuite may expound it to his best liking.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the Apostle sayth plainly in the words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
going,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2, 10, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>That the spirituall man iudgeth by the spirit of God
that is in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, that our Iesuite belyeth <hi>Bell</hi> heere, as he doth
many times else-where. For <hi>Bell</hi> would not haue the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
man to Iudge the scripture by the euidency of the


<pb n="735" facs="tcp:1601:94"/>
things, but by the spirit of God, which is euer at hand, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
within him to teach him all necessary truth.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 10, 3, 4, 24.</note> which no man doubteth of. But the

               <p>This is but irkesome <hi>Tautologie,</hi> it is answered againe
and againe.</p>
               <p>First, the late Romish Church, is not the church that
cannot erre: this is already proued.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I haue proued, euen out of their owne Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
<hi>Tolet, That Christes sheepe know him, because hee first
knoweth them.</hi> Yea, the Text doth plainly yeeld that sence.
<hi>I knowe my sheepe</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>and they know mee,</hi> As if he
had said, <hi>My Sheepe therefore know mee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 10, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>because I first know
them.</hi> Christ therefore, not the church, maketh his sheep
to know and discern his voyce.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the church is an outward help, as is the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the word. To beget a kind of morral certitude or
humane faith in the hearers, but neither of them eyther
doth or can, beget faith Diuine in any man. <hi>Paule may
plant, and Apol'o may water, but only God can giue the increase.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3, 6.</note>
Experience may confirme this to be so. For no testificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Romish church, can make the Turke or Iew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeue
or acknowledge Christs Gospel. If it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

I wil say more,<note place="margin">August<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vbi supra.</note> and it is S. <hi>Austens</hi> Doctrin; <hi>Many come

                  <hi>for euery good tree
bringeth forth good fruits,</hi> as our master christ telleth vs. And
what is the cause? Forsooth, saith S. <hi>Austen, because they

               <p>First, when S. <hi>Austen</hi> saith, <hi>I wold not beleeue the Gospel, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse

As if he had said; <hi>If I this day were not a Christian, but
a Manichee, as I once was, I woulde not beleeue this Gospell,</hi>
(which I wish thee to embrace) <hi>vnlesse the Churches Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
did moue me to the same.</hi> For these are S. <hi>Austens</hi> own
words;<note place="margin">

If therefore I shoulde finde one, that yet beleeueth not

               <p>Loe, he speaketh of him that beleeueth not the gospell,
and of himselfe not being a christian, not of himselfe, or
any other that professeth the gospell. Where I am to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
the Reader, that here, as in many other places of
my Bookes;<note place="margin">I was almost 200, miles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> london.</note> this period last recited, is vnperfect in the
<hi>Downefall.</hi> For my selfe being absent from the Presse, as
dwelling farre off, many faultes escape the Printer. That
this is the true meaning of S. <hi>Austen,</hi> I proue it first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in the very same Chapter hee confesseth, that the
Authority of the Gospell, is aboue the authority of the
Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> because in the Chapter aforegoing, after
he hath discoursed of many notable things in the church


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1601:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Consent, Miracles, Antiquitie, and Succession;</hi> he addeth
that the truth of the Scriptures, must be preferred before
them all.</p>
               <p>These pointes and reasons,<note place="margin">Page 381.</note> I cited before out of Saint
<hi>Austen;</hi> which because they confound our Iesuite, hee
impudently denieth them; affirming that Saint <hi>Austen</hi>
saith not so. These therefore are S. <hi>Austens</hi> owne words,
in the first Chapter; <hi>Quòd si forte in euangelio aliquid aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimum

If happily thou canst finde in the Gospell, any manifest
thing of the Apostle-ship of <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> thou shalt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite
the authority of Catholiques to mee, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
mee not to beleeue thee. Againe, in the fourth
Chapter he hath these wordes; <hi>Apud vos sola persona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis
pollicitatio, quae quidem si tam manifesta monstratur, vt in
dubium venire non possit, praeponenda est omnibus illis rebus, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
in Catholica teneor.</hi> With you onely soundeth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of truth, which if it bee prooued so manifest, that it
cannot be doubted of, it is to be preferred before al those
thinges, that hold me in the catholique church. Loe, in
the former place Saint <hi>Austen</hi> graunteth freely, that the
authority of the Scripture, is aboue the authority of the
church; And in the latter, that the truth of the Scripture
must be preferred before all other things whatsoeuer. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
therefore with our lying <hi>Fryer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vide Aug. ep. 165.</note> and giue hearing to
his fables no longer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the faith that proceedeth from the Church
for Testificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is but humaine, and not diuine. For none
saue God onely, can beget faith diuine in vs. It pleaseth
GOD to vse externall meanes and Ceremonies, for the
confirmation of our Faith; but the grace, power, &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
is from himselfe alone. <hi>The Law was giuen by Moyses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 17.</note>
                  <hi>but grace and truth came by Iesus Christ.</hi> I prooue it: First,
because a supernaturall effect, must needes bee produced
of a supernaturall cause; and consequently, diuine faith


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1601:96"/>
beeing a supernaturall effect, cannot proceede from the
<hi>Romish</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a corporall agent, cannot ascend and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
a spirituall obiect; as a materiall Sword cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
an immateriall Spirit; and consequently, neither
produce an immateriall effect, as is faith diuine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, no immateriall and spirituall accident, can bee
receyued into any corporall subiect; and consequently,
no corporall subiect is apt to produce a spirituall effect.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Aug. tract. 72. in Iohan. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin. p. 1. q. 45. art. 5.</note> Saint <hi>Austen</hi> saith plainly, that it is a greater
woorke to iustifie a man, then to create the VVorlde;
but no power (saith the <hi>Popish Angelicall Doctor Aquinas</hi>)
which is vpon earth, can concurre to creation; <hi>Ergo,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to iustification; and consequently, neither to the
producing of Faith diuine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when saith is wrought and begotten in vs, we
may not diuide the worke; giuing part to God, and part
to the Church; but we must ascribe the whole to GOD,
the true Author of the whole. Therfore, after S. <hi>Paule</hi> had
tolde the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he had laboured more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
then all the Apostles; hee forthwith added these
wordes.<note place="margin">1. Cor, 15. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Yet not I, but the grace of God, which is with me.</hi> For
though ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not in his actions as a brute beast or block,
but free from all coaction and constraint; yet hath he no
power but from aboue, neither hath he any part more or
lesse, in producing Grace, Faith, or the supernatuall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
For though it be Gods pleasure to vse mans exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
acts and operations, for the exercise of his faith, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he meaneth to produce supernaturall effectes; yet dooth
hee himselfe solely and wholy of himselfe, produce the
same effectes. And heere I must tell the Reader of a great
defect in the Latine <hi>Vulgata editio;</hi> which the late Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Trent</hi> extolleth to the Heauens; and withall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
are bound to vse and beleeue.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 10</note> It saith thus: <hi>Yet not I,
but the grace of God with mee;</hi> as if forsooth, part were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to grace, and part to the act and woorke of Saint


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1601:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Paule.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vide Hier? lib. 2. aduers. Pelag. fol. 129. D.</note> Whereas indeed, the Apostle ascribeth the whole
to God, and vtterly refuseth to take any part to himselfe.
Which the Article (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) in the Greeke left out, in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
<hi>Vulgata editio,</hi> maketh plaine and euident. For after
Saint <hi>Paule</hi> had saide, <hi>That hee had laboured more then all the
Aopostles;</hi> he by and by addeth this correction; <hi>Yet not I,
but the grace of God, which is with me.</hi> And heere (because
sensible things worke most in sensile persons) let vs take
an example of the Napkins and Partlets, which were
brought from Saint <hi>Paules</hi> body vnto the sicke, for the
Napkins by touching Saint <hi>Paules</hi> body,<note place="margin">Act, 19, 12, 11.</note> receiued no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
vertue to worke Miracles. The Text saith plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that God wrought the Miracles by the hand of <hi>Paule.</hi>
The Napkins and Handkerchiefes were but outward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens,
to confirme the faith of those that were to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the absence of the Apostle; that they might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
know and perceiue, that the gift of healing (which
God for his own glory had bestowed on him) was not
tyed to the presence of his body. The like may be said, <hi>Of
touching Christs Garment, and of the Clay which Christ vsed in
restoring the blind man to his sight.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 9, 21. Iohn, 9, 6. Luke. 8. 46.</note> For the vertue was not
in the garments, but in Christ himselfe. Christ said not;
<hi>Vertue is gone out of my Garments;</hi> but (as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth)
<hi>I perceiue that vertue is gone out of mee.</hi> And all men
know, that Clay was rather an hinderance, then a furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
to effect that was wrought in the blind man. For,
if we respect the nature and operation of Clay, wee shall
finde it more apt to destroy sight where it is, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
sight where it is not. But it pleased Christ, this way
to try the faith and obedience of the blind man. For there
can bee no better tryall of true faith, then when a godly
mind being content with the simple word of God, doth
promise that vnto it selfe, which otherwise seemeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.

because not onely our Sauiour did not rebuke him,<note place="margin">Marke 10. 21</note> (as

answere is not to the purpose, (to say nothing of our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits

               <p>This obiection I both propounded and answered in <hi>the

but neuer truely confute it. He maketh a gallant shew of
many verses, cited out of the 119. Psalme, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
may be kept, and were actually kept of the
Prophet <hi>Dauid. I haue not</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>declined from
thy Law. I haue kept thy law. I haue not declined from thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
I haue not erred from thy Commandements.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 51. 55 102, 110, 157.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
from thy testimonies.</hi> But to al these &amp; the like I answer
with all facility, that the selfe-same Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
freely, that neither himselfe nor any mortall man,
is able perfectly to keepe Gods law. When the Prophet
<hi>Nathan</hi> told him of his Adultery and murder,<note place="margin">2. sam. cap: 11. &amp; ca. 12</note> he humbly
confessed the same, and presently receiued remission at
Gods hands.</p>
               <p>Againe, in many Psalmes hee confesseth his owne sins,


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1601:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and withall, constantly affirmeth, that none liuing can be
iustified by his best workes. <hi>Haue mercy on me O God, wash
me from my sinnes, and clense me from mine iniquity.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalme 51</note> 
                  <hi>I know my
sinne, and mine iniquity is euer before me. I was borne in sinne, &amp;
in sinne hath my Mother conceiued mee,</hi> Againe, in another
place thus; <hi>If thou O Lorde, straightly markest iniquities: O
Lorde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalme 130</note> 
                  <hi>who shall abide it? But with thee is mercie, that thou
mayest be feared.</hi> Againe in another place thus: <hi>Enter not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
iudgement with thy seruant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalme 143.</note> 
                  <hi>for in thy sight shall none that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
be iustified.</hi> So then, as wee haue in one Psalme, that
<hi>Dauid</hi> did keepe Gods commaundements, so haue wee in
many other Texts of holy writ, both in the Psalmes, and
else where, that neither himselfe nor any liuing, can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
keep the same. What must we now do? One scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not contrary to another. The spirite of God spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in <hi>Dauid,</hi> saith in one place, <hi>That he kept Gods Lawe;</hi>
in another place he saith, <hi>That neither hee nor any other can
keepe his Commaundements.</hi> How stand these two together?
This is the resolution and true sence of holy writ. <hi>Dauid</hi>
(as euery childe of God in like maner) is truely saide to
keepe Gods Commaundements, when he hath an inward
feruent desire to do the will of God, and chearefully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
his heart and all his affections to that end,<note place="margin">Howe Gods children thogh sinners, keepe his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</note> so farre
foorth as standeth with mans infirmity, and the state in
which we liue, although he be a greeuons sinner indeed,
and Trangresse Gods law many waies. This I prooue to
be so by many arguments: first, because the sinnes of the
faithful, are not imputed to them for the merits of Christ
Iesus. Therefore (saith the Apostle) <hi>Being iustified by faith,
we are at peace with God, through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Again
thus;<note place="margin">Rom. 5, 1. Rom, 4, 7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiuen, and whose
sinnes are couered. Blessed is the man, to whom the Lorde will
not impute sin.</hi> By these places it is cleare, that Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are said to keepe his Commandements, not because
they keepe them exactly and perfectly, but for that the
want and defect is not imputed to them. This is it that S.

Lord hath not imputed sinne. This the wayes of our Lord
performe, and by reason heereof, because the iust man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
by faith, that iniquity estraungeth from this way,
which is infidelity. For in this way of the Lord, that is, in
a godly faith, whosoeuer walketh, he either sinneth not,
or if any thing be done amisse, it is not imputed by reason
of the way, and is so taken as if he had not done it. Thus
writeth this holy father vppon that very Psalme: out of
which our Iesuite hath borrowed certaine Textes, which
(as S. <hi>Austen</hi> sheweth plainely) are altogether applyed,
contrary to the Prophets meaning, and to the truth of the

is not only the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> but also al the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, thoght to keep Gods commandements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

is not imputed to them. Briefely, by Gods grace, not of
our selues, we keep his Commandements, though not in
such perfection as his Iustice requireth; yet, in such mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
as he of his mercy in Christ accepteth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because the sonne of God, hath truly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the wrath of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 26, 27 Mark 14, 14</note> by once offering vppon the Altar

paiment of that which was due vnto him, though by the

cannot with Iustice require the same at the Debtors
hands; no more can GOD almighty, (who is not onely
iust, but iustice it selfe in the abstract) iustly require satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saction
of his elect for their sinnes, for whose transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

               <p>Secondly, that saluation followeth not onely our first
iustification so called of the Papists, which they confesse
to be of <hi>Grace,</hi> but their second falsly supposed iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
also, which they wold haue to come of <hi>Works.</hi> For (as
we see here, our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is after al maner of iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
(if ther were as many as the Papists imagine) is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of grace, not of <hi>Workes.</hi> You are saued saith Saint <hi>Paule,</hi>
marke wel the word (<hi>Saued.</hi>) He saith not, you are iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by grace, which goeth before saluation, but you are
saued by grace, which followeth your iustification.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the Apostle saith Negatiuely (<hi>We are not
saued of Workes,</hi>) and consequently, that he confoundeth
our Papistes, who say that their second iustification and
their saluation come of their works. But as their second
falsly so named iustification, was neuer knowne to any of
the holy Fathers, nor to any ancient counsel; so wil their
saluation neuer bee knowne to Gods elect, vnlesse they
repent and reuoke this their damnable Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:1601:102"/>
Fourthly, that God worketh our <hi>Good Workes</hi> in vs.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that God hath ordained <hi>Good Workes</hi> for this
end, that we walke in them. This doctrine is confirmed
by the same Apostle in another place,<note place="margin">Tit. 3, 5</note> where he hath these
wordes. <hi>Not by the Workes of Iustice which wee did, but
according to his Mercy hee hath saued vs.</hi> Loe, the holy
Apostle is still constant in his former position, (viz:) that
<hi>We are not saued by the Workes of Iustice, but of mercy &amp; grace.</hi>
For this cause saith S. <hi>Austen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. lib. 9. con. fession. cap. 13. Chrisost de co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>Woe vnto the best liuer vppon
earth, if God examin his life, his mercy set apart.</hi> For this cause
saith S. <hi>Chrisostome, &amp; si millies moriamur &amp;c.</hi> Though we
die a thousand times, and though we accomplish all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of the minde, yet do wee nothing woorthy of those
things, which we receiue of God. For this cause saith S.
<hi>Theophilact; Seruauit nos aeternum, non ex operibus, &amp;c.</hi> Hee
hath saued vs eternally,<note place="margin">Theophil. in 3. cap. Tit.</note> not of the workes which we haue
done; that is, neither haue we done the works of Iustice,
neither are wee saued by them, but his goodnes and his
clemency, hath wrought our saluation wholly. Yea,<note place="margin">Berna. in cant. serm. 68. tom. 1 pagina 1006.</note> for
this cause saith their highly renowned Abbot <hi>Bernardus;
Sic non est &amp;c.</hi> So there is no cause, that thou shouldst now
aske, by what merits we hope for glory, especially since
thou hearest the Prophet say; <hi>I will do it</hi> (sayth the Lord,)
<hi>not for your sake, but for mine owne.</hi> It is sufficient to merite,
to know that our merites are not sufficient. Thus write
these holy fathers, with the famous popish Abbot, whose
words are so plaine for the truth which I defend, as euery
childe may with facility discerne the same. For I did not
say, (as our Iesuite woulde deceitfully perswade his
Reader) that <hi>Good Works</hi> are an impossible mean to come
to heauen; No, nor that the young man did enquire of an
impossible way to heauen. For I know, and I haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
affirmed the same in the <hi>Downfall;</hi> that <hi>Goodworkes</hi>
are a meane, and the way that leadeth to heauen. But
withall, I said then, and now againe; that neither can the
best liuer on earth, keepe the Commandements so exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1601:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as the law requireth; neither can any man for any works
he doth, condignly merit eternal life. And this is the point
indeede, which I defend against the Papists. Whosoeuer
shall with a single eye pervse the <hi>Downfall,</hi> will find it to
be so. For, it is one thing to say, that <hi>Good Workes</hi> are a
meane, or the way to heauen; another thing to say, that
a man can fulfill the Law, and by his <hi>Workes</hi> condignely
merite heauen. The former I graunt willingly, the latter
I deny constantly; neither is any Papist able, to answere
my reasons in that behalfe. For example, the Pope (<hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>)
sicke at <hi>Rome,</hi> of his meere good wil bequeathed by
his Testament 7000. crownes of Gold, to <hi>Robert Parsons</hi>
the Iesuite, lame of hands and legs at <hi>Paris</hi> (his lamenesse
not knowne to the Pope) to be giuen to the said <hi>Parsons,</hi>
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to <hi>Rome</hi> in his own person to demand the
same. Now, the said <hi>Parsons</hi> hauing inteligence of the said
Legacy, prouideth a good Gelding, a strong man-like
fellow, and so taketh his iourney towards <hi>Rome,</hi> where
he no sooner demaundeth the saide 7000. Crownes, but
he in friendly manner receiueth the same, acording to the
true meaning of the Popes will. In this case, the Gelding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the tall fellow, and the iourney it selfe, were good &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
meanes to receiue and possesse the said Crownes:
Howbeit, neither did they merite the said Crownes,<note place="margin">Rom. 6, 23</note> ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were they the cause of bequeathing them Euen so in
our case,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2, 8</note> 
                  <hi>Eternall life</hi> (as the Apostle saith) <hi>is the free gift of
God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 2, 10</note> 
                  <hi>it is of grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 17</note> 
                  <hi>not of Workes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8, 30</note> neuerthelesse, <hi>Goodworkes</hi>
(as the same Apostle telleth vs) <hi>are the way which God hath
ordained for vs to walke in; and the vsuall, ordinary, &amp; vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
meanes, by which God intendeth to bring his elect to heauen.</hi>
This notwithstanding, this must euer bee a constant
and vndoubted position, with all the children of God,
(viz:) that none (<hi>not the best liuer vpon earth) is able ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
to keepe Gods commandements, and by the merit of his works
to enter into heauen.</hi>

               <speaker>T. B.</speaker>
               <p>I answere; first, that the word (<hi>For</hi>) is not heere taken
<hi>Causaliter,</hi> but <hi>Consequutiue,</hi> to speake as the Schoole-doctors
do, that is to say; It doth not <hi>Connotate</hi> the cause
but the euent, as was saide before of <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> So
that the sence is not for giuing meat to Christ, when hee
was hungry, or drink to him being thirsty, they did merit
heauen, but that by doing such charitable works, (which
are the effects of a true iustifying faith, they shewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to bee the children of God, and the heyres of his
kingdome. And this sence is deduced, out of the very text
it selfe. <hi>For seeing the kingdome of heauen,</hi> (as Christ heere
auoucheth) <hi>was prepared for them before the foundation.</hi>
and consequently, before they were borne, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could doe any <hi>Good Workes,</hi> it followeth of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
that their workes could not merite heauen, but
only signifie to the world, that the inheritance of heauen
was due vnto them, as to the children of God the heyres
of the same. For (as the Apostle sayth) <hi>If we be sonnes, then
are we also heyres;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8, 17</note> 
                  <hi>heyres of God, and ioynt-heires with Christ.</hi>
Yea (as the same Apostle saith in another place.<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 4.</note>) <hi>As he
chose vs in him before the foundation of the world, that we should
be holy and immaculate in his sight through loue, who hath prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuated
vs into the adoption of children by Iesus Christ vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
according to the good pleasure of his will.</hi> To which I must
needs adde that,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 50.</note> which the same Apostle saith yet in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
place; <hi>Whom he did predestinate, them also he called: and
whom he called, them also he iustified; and whom he iustified them
also he glorified.</hi> Out of this holy discourse of the Apostle of
our Lord Iesus, I obserue these golden lessons.<note place="margin">Psa. 59, 12</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, that we are the sonnes of God, not by nature (for
so we are his enemies, and the children of wrath) but by


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1601:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
grace and adoption in Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that God chose vs to be his Children before
we were borne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that he chose vs, not because wee were holy,
but that we might be holy and immaculate in his sight.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that he predestinated vs to bee his Children
by adoption, not for any <hi>Goodworkes</hi> wee eyther had done
or could doe, but for his owne good pleasure to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his grace. For, as to doe any workes at all before we
are borne, is altogether impossible, so to doe <hi>Goodworkes</hi>
when we are borne (seeing we are conceiued in sin, born
in sinne, and by nature the Children of wrath) is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in like manner.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that all our <hi>Goodworkes,</hi> are the effects and fruits
of our predestination. For,<note place="margin">Psa. 51, 5.</note> if it be true, as it is most true,
(else the Apostle should be a lyer) that wee were elected
to be holy,<note place="margin">Esa. 59, 2.</note> and to do <hi>Goodworkes;</hi> it is also true, (it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denyed) that holy life and <hi>Goodworkes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 2, 3, 5.</note> are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes
and fruites of our election and predestination in
in Christ Iesus. For this cause (saith the Apostle) that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination
proceeds freely of Gods eternall purpose; Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
of predestination; and glorification, of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
For first, hee chooseth vs in Christ; then,<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 30.</note> he iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth
vs in Christ. Thirdly, and lastly, he glorifieth vs
for his owne names sake. For this cause saith that famous
Papist, <hi>Nicholaus de Lyra,</hi> in this manner; <hi>Dicendum, quod
predestinatio diuina est preparatio gratiae in presenti, &amp; gloriae in
future &amp; ides cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sit aeterna,</hi>

I answere (saith this <hi>Popish Doctor</hi>) that Gods predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

in the World to come. And therefore, seeing it is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
as hee hath predestinated any one from eternity to
endlesse blisse or beatitude; so hath he also fore-orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the meane, by which hee would bring him to the
same. For this cause saith the <hi>Popish Angelicall Doctor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,</hi>


                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:1601:104"/>

                  <note place="margin">Aquin. p. 1. q. 23. art. 3. ad 2.</note> And hee addeth these

both of that which is expected in the life to come, that is
to say, <hi>of Glory,</hi> and also of that which the predestinate

reason of predestination, another of execution; for in
predestination, God decreed to giue the Kingdome of
Heauen to certaine men, whom hee loued without any
fore-sight of workes; Howbeit hee decreed withall, that
in respect of the execution, <hi>Goodworks</hi> should be the way
to come to the Kingdome. For this cause say our <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi>
that our first iustification is of Gods Grace, and not


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1601:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of our deseruinges; because none of all our actions that
were before our iustification, could merite or iustly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Grace of iustification. Out of this discourse of
the famous <hi>Popish Doctours,</hi> I obserue these memorable
Lessons for the great good of the Reader.</p>
               <p>First, that all the Grace, Faith, and <hi>Goodworkes,</hi> which
we haue in this world, and the glory which we expect in
the World to come, doe wholy proceed from Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination
without all deserts of man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that as God prepared the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
for his elect, before they were borne, or had done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Goodworkes;</hi> so did he also prepare the way and means,
by which he intended to bring them thither.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that no works either done, or foreseene to be
doone, did mooue God to predestinate any man to the
ioyes of heauen.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that <hi>Goodworkes</hi> are not the cause, but the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of predestination.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that <hi>Goodworkes</hi> are the way and meanes, which
God ordained for the execution of predestination, and
for the accomplishment of glorification.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that not onely predestination, but also iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
proceed of Gods meere fauour, grace, and good
pleasure, without all deserts of man.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, that our vocation, our iustification, and our
glorification, are the effects of predestination. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conclude, that <hi>Good workes</hi> are not the cause, vvhy
Gods Children possesse Heauen as their inheritance, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is the effect of Gods predestination; yet that they
are the ordinary way and meanes, by which God decreed
in his eternall purpose to bring his elect to Heauen. For
as hee ordained the end, that is to say, the kingdome of
heauen or eternall life; so also ordained he the way and
meanes to attaine the same; that is to say, vocation, iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
faith, and <hi>Goodworkes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that there is great disparity betweene salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1601:105"/>
and damnation, and therefore that <hi>Goodworkes</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
merite Saluation, though euill workes bee enough
for damnation. The reason is euident, both in Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
and Diuinity, because as Saint <hi>Dionysius Areopagita</hi>
saith (and the <hi>Popish Angelicall Doctor Aquinas</hi> approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

               <p>I proue the conclusion,<note place="margin">Page 429.</note> because Christ saith, <hi>My yoke

refuted, for Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> spake in respect of vs assisted
by Gods Grace, when he saide; <hi>This is the Law of God, that

not heauy.</hi> He saith not (<hi>Christ</hi>) but (<hi>We</hi>) must keep Gods

               <p>Now I referre my selfe to the censure of the indifferent
Reader, how sufficiently I haue refuted the Iesuite, and
how vniustly he hath slandered me. For it is one thing to
say, we fulfill the Commaundements in Christ, another
thing to say, the wordes are spoken in respect of Christ,
not in respect of our selues: The latter are his, the former
are mine, viz: that in Christ we fulfill the law: and I lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

nostram, nec in se, sed in nobis constititutum, similitudine carnis
peccati, in qua crucifixus est, demonstrauit. <hi>God made Christ
sinne for vs, to whom we are to be reconciled; that is, a
sacrifice for sinnes, by which we might be reconciled. He
therefore was made sinne, that we might be made Iustice;
not our Iustice, but Gods Iustice; neither in vs, but in
him; as hee declared, sinne not to bee his, but ours; not
placed in him, but in vs, by the similitude of sinfull flesh,
in which he was crucified. Thus writeth this ancient, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and learned Father. Out of whose graue Testimony,
together with the Texts of holy scripture produced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
I obserue these memorable documentes, for the
comfort of the well affected Reader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, that albeit wee are not able of our selues, nor
in our selues, to fulfill the Law of God, and to keepe his
commandements; yet are we able to keepe them, and to
fulfill the Law, in our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that as we were made sinners by the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of one, euen <hi>Adam;</hi> so are we made righteous, by
the obedience of one, euen <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that our formall righteousnes is not inherent
in our selues, but in God, for the obedience of Iesus
Christ his onely sonne and our onely sauiour.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that as the sinne for which Christ suffered,
was ours, not his; in vs, not in him; euen so that iustice
by which we are made righteous, is not ours, but Gods;
not in vs, but in him. I therefore conclude, that we fulfill
the Lawe in Christ, not in our selues. And I adde with S.
<hi>Austen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">O lesuite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse thou art confounded.</note> (to the euerlasting confusion of our Iesuite and al
Iesuited Papists in the world) that that Iustice, by which
and with which wee are formally iustified in Gods sight,
is not inherent in our selues, but in God; not ours, but his;
not in vs, but in him; and yet ours by imputation, as our
sinnes by imputation were his. So as all the faithfull may
ioyfully say with the Prophet <hi>Dauid; Blessed are they vvhose
iniquities are forgiuen, and whose sinnes are couered. Blessed

is the man, to whom the Lord will not impute sinne.</hi> And with
the Apostle <hi>Paul:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm, 32, 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>As many by the disobedience of Adam, were

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>so many by the obedience of Christ are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
And heere I wish the reader to marke well: that to
be iustified by imputation, is to bee made iust truely and
indeed; though not by Iustice inherent in our selues, but
by the Iustice of Christ.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5, 21</note> For as our sinnes were truely and
indeed imputed to him, so is his Iustice truely and indeed
imputed to vs. I also admonish the Reader, to remember
well these words of S. <hi>Austen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. in ench. cap. 41. tom. 3. pagina 118.</note>

a full keeping, when the defect is pardoned; which
is a farre different thing from saying, that Christs keeping
is counted our keeping. And he meaneth, that our keeping
is defectuous, because we keep not the commandements
<hi>ad vnum apicem</hi> (as he saith) to the last iot or title, but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
<hi>Veniall sinnes</hi> haue neede to say, <hi>Fogiue vs our Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes;</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T. B.</speaker>
               <p>I answere; first, that it is a meer calumny to charge me
with saying, that Christs keeping is our keeping. I onely
said then, and now say againe; that wee fulfill the Law in
Christ, which is such a truth, as you are neuer able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
the same.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that I haue proued already, that euery sinne
is deadly of it owne nature: and consequently, that it is
too great arrogancy in our Iesuite, to expound S. <hi>Austen</hi>
after his owne fancy, hauing neyther authority, nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
so to do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that when our Iesuite confesseth that their
<hi>Veniall sinnes</hi> are pardoned, he vnawares confesseth, that
they cannot keepe Gods Commandements. I prooue it,
because God either hath forbidden their <hi>Venials,</hi> or is
well pleased with them. If he be well pleased with them,
then are they no sinnes at all, for God is not well pleased
with sinne.<note place="margin">Psalme 5, 4 This <hi>Dilemma</hi> is insoluble.</note> If hee haue forbidden them, then are they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his precept, and consequently, seeing the Papistes
graunt that they cannot liue without their <hi>Venials,</hi> they
must also graunt of necessity, that they cannot keep Gods
holy Precepts. And therefore it is time for all Iesuites and
Iesuited Papists, to say with S. <hi>Iames, Wee all offend in many
things.</hi>

He saith likewise, that he is to be detested as a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer,

               <p>This Obiection is as a Bulwarke, for Popish supposed
<hi>Condigne Merite of vvorkes.</hi> I therefore both proposed it
in the <hi>Downefall,</hi> and answered it in the same place. My
answere is there to bee seene at large, to which I referre
the Reader. This is the summe and effect thereof, (viz:)
that God commaunded nothing, which was eyther im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
in it selfe to be done, or to bee doone of man as
man; The same ie there prooued at large. Touching S.
<hi>Hierome,</hi> I will adde a little, because our Iesuite affirmeth
him to be on his side. The truth is this; that S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in
3. whole books against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> hath no other scope,
purpose, or intent, saue onely to proue against them out
of the holy Scriptures, that none liuing doth keepe Gods
Commaundements, which hee prooueth no other vvay,
but because all haue sinned, and done euill in Gods sight.
Three thinges therefore are cleere and certaine with S.
<hi>Hierome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, that all haue sinned, and cannot bee iustified, but
by the mercy and fauour of God. These are his wordes;

and that the perfection of all the iust in the flesh, is
imperfect. Out of this discourse of this holy and learned
Father, I obserue these worthy documents.</p>
               <p>First, that all men, euen the best liuers vpon earth, haue
committed not a few, but many sins.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that wee neuer read of any man, who neuer
had done any sin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that it is not possible for any man, to lead his
life without sin.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that no man can be saued by his free will &amp;
holy life, but by the mercy of God.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that no man fulfilleth the Law, nor keepeth the
Commaundements contained therein.<note place="margin">Marke this point well.</note> This is a point of
great consequence, it would be remembred.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that though all men bee Sinners in respect of
themselues, yet are the faithfull iust in respect of Gods
mercy, who imputeth not their sins vnto them.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, that man is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iustified, when he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
himselfe to be a Sinner; and then perfect, when
he acknowledgeth his own imperfection. This is a most
excellent and golden Lesson. For here we see, how Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1601:109"/>
are iust and perfect in Gods sight. Marke well, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Reader. None (saith Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>) can fulfill the law;
none can keepe the Commaundementes; none can liue
without sinne; and yet the greater Sinner, the more iust
man, if hee with the lowly <hi>Publican</hi> doe humbly confesse
his sinnes. For (as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> telleth vs) to acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our imperfection,<note place="margin">Luke. 18, 13.</note> is our perfection before GOD,
and to confesse our selues sinners, is our iustification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him in Christ Iesus. Away then with all Popish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent

this holy and most learned Father. Out of whose do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
I note thus much.</p>
               <p>First, that the way to heauen (that is to say Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements)

               <p>Thirdly, that this way of Gods commandements, is so
very hard; that in S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> opinion and iudgement, he
may be ashamed, that saith it is easie. Our Iesuite therfore
may be ashamed of his Doctrine,<note place="margin">Page 432</note> and twice ashamed to

                  <hi>Bell</hi> saith so, and that truely, and is already proued in this
discourse,<note place="margin">4 Reg. 23, 25</note> and more at lage in the <hi>Downfall.</hi> Now to your
particulars. King <hi>Iosias</hi> (whom our Iesuite falsly nameth
<hi>Iosue</hi>) returned to God in al his hart, al his soul, and al his
strength. Which is nothing else indeede, but that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to God with a sincere heart, and vnfainedly, not
Hypocritically. Not that he was pure and free from sin, &amp;
no part of his hart or soul defiled with corruption, which


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:1601:110"/>
our Iesuite might haue perceiued, to be implyed in the
word (<hi>Returne.</hi>) For, from what did he returne, saue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from sinne. If he had euer beene with God in all his
heart, all his soule, and all his strength; then doubtlesse
could he not haue returned to him. For hee that is euer
with one, cannot be truly saide, to returne to him. But
the scripture decideth the Controuersie,<note place="margin">2. Par. 35, 21 22.</note> when it telleth
vs, that <hi>Iosias</hi> hearkened not vnto the wordes of <hi>Mecho,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2, Par. 15, 17.</note>
(king of <hi>Aegipt,</hi>)<note place="margin">de Asa. notetur</note> which were of the mouth of God, but
came to fight in the valley of <hi>Megiddo,</hi> where hee was
slaine for his paines. K. <hi>Dauid</hi> likewise (saith our Iesuite)
sought God in all his hart, which must needs be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
as I said of K. <hi>Iosias.</hi> For he was both an adulterer,
&amp; a murderer,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.</note> thogh also the child of <hi>God.</hi> This is already
proued, &amp; plainly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth the doctrin which I defend.<note place="margin">Psalme, 51</note>
The same may be saide of king <hi>Ezechias,</hi> who was a great
sinner,<note place="margin">2. Par. 22, 25</note> and yet is saide to haue serued God with all his
heart, and to haue kept his commaundements.<note place="margin">4 Reg. 18. 6. 7, 8.</note> The same
answere serueth to the rest, that God hath those, that wil
serue him with their whole heart;<note place="margin">De Asa vide</note> that is, vnfainedly and
chearefully.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Par.</hi> 16, 7, 13 &amp; cap. 15, 17 &amp; vda.</note> For, as wee haue heard already out of the
scriptures, <hi>None liuing is without sinne.</hi> Againe, <hi>The faithfull
are saide to keepe Gods Commandements, and to serue him with
all their heart; Because to such as serue God vnfainedly and
chearefully, whatsoeuer is left vndone, is of mercy pardoned and
forgiuen.</hi> It is the flat doctrine both of S. <hi>Austen</hi> and of S.
<hi>Hierom,</hi> as I haue already proued. And heere I may not
forget, to put our Iesuite in mind, that concerning the
circumcising of the Iewish hearts, it may please him to
read the verses following, for there shall he find his sillie
obiection fully answered, euen in the text it selfe. These
are the words:<note place="margin">Deu. 30, 8, 10</note> 
                  <hi>Return thou therefore and obey the voyce of the
Lord, and doe all his Commaundements, which I commaund thee
this day.</hi> Loe, the Iewes, whose hearts God promiseth to
circumcise, haue gone from him and disobeyed his voice,
and therfore must haue their harts circumcised, that they


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1601:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may returne to him againe, &amp; serue him with their whole
heart, that is to say, chearefully and vnfeignedly. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
can and will read S. <hi>Hierome</hi> (in the place quoted in
the Margent) seriously and at large,<note place="margin">Hier. lib. 2. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. Pelag. fol. 133. tom. 3</note> shall finde this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
so fully decided, as hee can no longer stande in
doubt thereof. For euer must this Apostolicall Doctrine,<note place="margin">Iames 3, 2.</note>
be holden for a most constant position:<note place="margin">3. Reg. 8. 46</note> 
                  <hi>In multis offendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

which can bee auoyded. For neither reason, nor Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice

this holy and learned Father, the most Noble

these excellent obseruations may be gathered.</p>
               <p>First, that that is no sinne, which GOD imputeth not
for sinne: and consequently, that when GOD doth not
impute our sinnes to vs, then are wee truely saide to bee
without sin, (<hi>In Gods acceptation euer vnderstand</hi>) although
sin be still inherent in vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they are to be condemned for proud &amp;
arrogant persons, who thinke themselues to bee without
sinne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that our mercifull God imputeth no sinnes to
his faithfull Children, who in the Lords Prayer humbly
desire pardon for the same. This is a point of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
it must bee well remembred, and neuer forgotten.

mortall and deadly of their owne Nature, (as I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the <hi>Downefall</hi>) yet are all sinnes (as Saint <hi>Austen</hi>
grauely and Christianly in this place vnfoldeth) <hi>Veniall</hi>
to Gods Children; who in true Faith inuocate his holy
Name, and humbly craue pardon for the same. So as it
may truely be said; that some sinnes are Mortall, &amp; some
Veniall, though not in Popish sence and meaning. For,
though sinnes be mortall in their owne Nature, and not
at all Veniall, yet are all sinnes Veniall to the Faithfull,
by the great mercy of GOD, who imputeth no sinnes to
his elect Children,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1, 30.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beholdeth their Robes wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 1. 4.</note> For hee doth not

dispaire, or take delight in sinne; but to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
who euer haue a feruent desire to do Gods holy will,
and to keepe his Commaundements. And though of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
or frailty they often fall into sinne, yet do they
foorthwith bewayle their sinnes, humbly craue pardon
for the same, and apply themselues wholly to woorthy
fruites of repentance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that when we either want charity, or haue it
not in that degree and perfection, which the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth;
we forthwith commit sinne, and become guilty in
that behalfe.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that we sinne euen in doing that, which we can
no way auoyd. Hereof Saint <hi>Austen</hi> yeeldeth this reason,
(viz:) that if we can auoid it, then our present will is cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
&amp; in default, if we cannot auoyd it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>will past</hi> was
the cause thereof. For (as the same holy father saith else<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>where


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1601:112"/>
&amp; is to be seen in the <hi>Downefall,</hi>) euery such sin of
ours is voluntary, eytheir in the worke it selfe, or else
in the Originall; that is to say, in the <hi>Protoplast Adam;</hi>
whose will in Gods iust iudgement is reputed ours,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 10.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we were in his loynes as in the beginning,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. ethicor. cap. 5.</note> and root
of all mankind.<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> To which I adde; that though the Deuill
cannot auoyde sinne, yet cannot our Papists deny, but he
both sinneth heynously, and voluntarily: yea, the Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
telleth vs, <hi>That the drunken man deserueth double punnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
For we must euer haue in minde, that our necessity
of sinning, is punishment iustly inflicted vpon vs, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from our voluntary sinne in <hi>Adam.</hi> I likewise
adde for a complement and consummation of the doctrin
which I now deliuer and defend; that <hi>Celestine</hi> (against
whose errours Saint <hi>Austen</hi> wrote this Booke, <hi>Deperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionciustitiae</hi>)
defended <hi>Mordicus</hi> as a resolued &amp; vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
doctrine; <hi>That vvhatsoeuer Man could not auoyde, but
doe of necessity, could not truely bee called sinne, nor for sinne
be iustly imputed to him.</hi> To whom Saint <hi>Austen</hi> answered;
that albeit wee cannot in this corruption of Nature liue
wholy without sin, but so farre onely as our nature is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
yet might we haue auoided sin perfectly and wholly
before <hi>Adams</hi> fall, which is enough to make vs truly and
formally sinners in Gods sight. Let his wordes bee well
marked and remembred, and this controuersie wil soone
be at an end. For it is all one, as if S. <hi>Austen</hi> had sayde;
<hi>Though we cannot now liue without sinne, but sinne of necessity;
yet are our sinnes iustly and truely imputed to vs, because we sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
voluntarily in</hi> Adam, <hi>and by that means most iustly brought
this necessity vpon vs.</hi> This Doctrine the <hi>Papistes, Volentes,
Nolentes,</hi> must admit; or else accuse God of Iniustice, for
condemning Infants eternally, for that sinne which they
cannot possibly auoyde. For infants dying without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
they affirme to perish euerlastingly.</p>

               <p>As for <hi>Bels dilernma,</hi> it is easily aunswered, and might


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1601:113"/>
haue been better left out (as himselfe writeth in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.)
For though Infantes after they haue sinned, and
eaten the Apple in <hi>Adam,</hi> cannot avoyde the guilt of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
sinne, but must needs contract it by origine from
<hi>Adam:</hi> Yet becautse as Infants sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> so they
might haue not sinned in him, but haue auoided the guilt
of sinne; falsely dooth <hi>Bell</hi> say, they could not possibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde
it. And I wonder, why <hi>Bell</hi> hauing taught bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that Concupiscence (the effect of <hi>Originall Sinne</hi>) is

               <p>I answere; First,<note place="margin">Page 436.</note> that in the <hi>Downefall of Popery,</hi> these
words are written indeed in the Margent; (<hi>Omittatur haec
clausula meo indicio.</hi>) But I protest, that neyther did I write
them, neyther did they please mee, when I espyed them.
Many like faultes are in many of my Books, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deale withall. If I had Money at my will, (as our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
hath) to defray my charges, while my Bookes were
at the Presse, I could then so handle the matter, as such
faults should not offend his worship. How this Margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
note crept into the place, I may coniecture and bee
deceiued. This I am assured of, that our Iesuites can do
greater matters. This euery child may know, that I wrote
it not, but our lesuite will needes haue it so. For, if I
would haue had it left out, it was in my power to haue ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
the same; this supposed (which I deny) that it was
mine owne act.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that our Iesuit killeth himselfe with his own
sword. For, I contend against him, that all sinnes are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
in <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Law possible to haue bin kept
in him, which the Iesuite vnawares, doth heere confesse
against himselfe. This is the maine point in Controuersie,
(viz:) whether that which we cannot auoyd, may bee
sinne in vs or no. I hold the <hi>Affirmatiue,</hi> out Iesuite the


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1601:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Negatiue.</hi> I reply, that infantes are guilty of that sinne,
which they could not avoyde; and consequently, that
that may be sinne in vs, which wee cannot avoyde. But
withall I constantly affirme, that infants sinned volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in <hi>Adam,</hi> because they were in his loynes; as also,
that we might haue kept the commaundements in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7, 10</note> though after corrupt <hi>Adam,</hi> we cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
performe the same. This notwithstanding, I deny
that infantes could any way haue avoyded Originall sin.
For I cannot conceiue, how a childe can avoyd that sin,<note place="margin">Qui potest ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere, capiat.</note>
which was committed before he was borne. For though
it was once in <hi>Adams</hi> power, to haue auoyded all sinne,
and so to haue freed all his posterity from all sinne, yet
was it neuer in any Infants power, to haue caused <hi>Adam</hi>
to keep Gods holy precept; which seeing no Infant was
able to performe, neyther could any Infant possibly haue
auoyded sin. Our Iesuite therefore must learne to know,
that it is one thing to say, that it was in <hi>Adams</hi> power not
to haue transgressed Gods Lawe, another thing to say,
that it was in our power before wee were borne, to haue
kept <hi>Adam</hi> from that transgression. Which seeing it was
neuer in our power, neyther were wee euer able to haue
auoyded the same; and consequently, neither to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded
sinne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, where our Iesuite saith, it is <hi>Bels</hi> custome to
gaine-say himselfe; if it may please his reuerence to put
Iesuite for <hi>Bell,</hi> the truth then will be on his side.</p>

to Gods children and faithful seruants; not of their own

               <p>I answere; First, that the Commaundements of God
are not simply and absolutely impossible, but accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Per accidens.</hi> They are not impossible in themselues,
because Christ himselfe kept them, neyther impossible

that we cannot possibly avoyd sinne.<note place="margin">Heb. 7, 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse, wee are iustly punnished for our sins,
because the necessity and impossibility, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen

default, when that we were in the Loynes of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that our Iesuites argument of my flying to

childish, because it was neuer in my power to slye to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,

But (saith he) <hi>Where pardon must be demanded, there
the Law is not exactly obserued.</hi> The other is out of our daily
confessions, where we acknowledge our faults, and most
great faults. I Answere, as the petition <hi>of forgiuing our sins,</hi>
dooth euidently conuince, that wee do not so exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
keepe the Lawe, as that we neuer swarue from it;
so the other petition of doing Gods will heer on Earth
as it is in Heauen, euidently conuinceth, that wee

can do it without deadly breaking it. As for our confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wee do not confesse that our daily offences are most
great faults, but daily confesse our most great falts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
done then or before.</p>

               <speaker>T. B.</speaker>
               <p>I answere: first, that our Iesuite graunteth as much
as I desire, as euery childe may perceiue. For his wordes
are plaine, that they do not keepe the law so exactly, as
they neuer swarue from it. Hold thy selfe here good <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
and we shall soone agree. For if you swarue from the
Law, then doubtlesse, ye doth not keepe it. This is all,
that I require at your hands, (viz:) that ye wil confesse,
that ye swarue from the Law and keepe it not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the other petition proueth not, that you
Papists can keepe Gods commandements, and liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sin, as the Saints do in heauen. For euery meane Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician
can tell you, that the worde (<hi>As</hi>) doth <hi>Connotate</hi> a
similitude, but not an <hi>Identity</hi> (viz.) that as the Angels &amp;
Saints do Gods will in heauen, and liue altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sinne, acording to the condition of the perfect state;
so wee may do his will in some measure and proportion,
according to the imperfect state in which we liue. And
thus much the word (<hi>as</hi>) doth import vnto vs, so often as
as say the Lords Prayer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that your answere is so <hi>Aenigmaticall,</hi> as my
sle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der capacity is not able to penetrate the depth therof.
You freely grant, that you daily confesse your most great
faultes, but not that your daily offences are most great
faults, O the depth of Iesuiticall wit! <hi>Qui potest capere, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piat.</hi>
The great God <hi>Apollo</hi> must come downe from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
to vnfold this high mistery. Well, seeing it will bee
no better, let vs make the best of it we can. Let vs holde
fast that, which is freely graunted vs, (viz:) that our Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
commit most great faults sometimes, though not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
day Let vs likevvise hold this fast; (viz:) that our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
confesse those most great faultes euery day, which


<pb facs="tcp:1601:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they commit sometimes, but not euery day. This done;
let vs out of these two assertions plainely and freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
inferre these two most Golden and memorable
<hi>Corollaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, that seeing our Iesuites freely graunt, that they
commit sometimes most great faults, though not dayly;
it followeth of necessity, that sometimes they break gods
holy commaundements, though not daily; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that sometimes they sinne damnably, though
not euery day; as also, that they are so farre from louing
<hi>Condigne Merites of Glory,</hi> as they woorthily demerite e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
torment in hell fire.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that their Sacrament of <hi>Pennance</hi> doeth not
conferre Grace <hi>Ex opere operato:</hi> neyther are their most
great faults therein forgiuen; seeing after their auricular
confession and absolution receiued of their ghostly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
they still stande in such feare of remission of their
most great faults, that they must needs confesse the same
daily in time of Popish Masse. To which two <hi>Corollaries,</hi> I
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but adde this delicate Post-past for his holines, viz:
That the supposed certainty of the operation of Popish
sacraments, is as vncertaine as the wind. For though all
Papists of all sorts be bound to beleeue, that Popish ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
ministred by a Popish priest, after Popish auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
confession, doth vndoubtedly purge them from all
their sins, (though neuer so many, &amp; neuer so great;) yet
after such confession, and such absolution receiued from
the Priestes mouth, they are bound by Popish lawe and

               <p>True keeping and true breaking in diuers respects, both
may and do well stand together. For as the faithful in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their sinnes inherent in them, doe breake Gods
Commaundements and are in state of damnation; so, in
respect of Christs merits imputed to them of mercy, they
are iust and keepe Gods commaundements perfectly. For
<hi>as the disobedience of Adam, made all men sinners; so the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 9</note> 
                  <hi>made all the faithfull holy and iust.</hi> This is it
that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith: <hi>He that is borne of God sinneth not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1, 3</note> which
is not meant,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5, 21</note> that he sinne not indeed, but (as wee liaue

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 19</note> and Abbot <hi>Bernard) That his

                  <note place="margin">1 Iohn. 3, 9</note> 
                  <hi>and not imputed to him.</hi> Hitherto, we haue
