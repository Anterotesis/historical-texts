            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And the petitioner for the concession hereof shall ever pray for your Lordships, &amp;c.</p>

                           <pb n="23" facs="tcp:66246:12"/>
                           <head>The reasons why the petitioner (Master <hi>Prynne</hi>) humbly conceiveth, that this honorable Court ought in point of law and Justice, to admit his answer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own hand, without his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, which he cannot procure.</head>
                           <p>FIrst, because there are many late presidents in this<note place="margin">1.</note> Court, wherein divers defendants answers have been admitted without the hands of councell, in cases where no councell would set their hands to them, as <hi>Close,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Laytons</hi> cases, with many others, and but one president only against it: which being ancient, singular, upon a speciall reason, in case of a Woman, not of a man, much lesse of a Lawyer, and in a farre different case from this defendants, ought not, as he humbly conceaveth, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verballance the presidents for him.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, because upon an <hi>Ore-tenus</hi> and Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories<note place="margin">2.</note> in this Court, in many cases before his Majesty and the Lords at the councell-Table, in Parliament, and in the Kings-Bench upon Indictments, and Informations [especially for Felony or Treason] the defendants are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed freely to make their owne answers and defence without counsell, if they please, and in some cases are denied Counsell.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, because counsell [who were not <hi>ab initio,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">3.</note> but came in long after causes,] both in this honorable Court, and elsewhere, are allowed and assigned, not out of necessity, but favour onely, for the helpe and benefit of defendants, not to be so strictly tied unto them, but that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66246:13"/>
they may have liberty to make answer without them in case where they and their councell differ in the substance of their answers, or where councell advise them to their prejudice, either out of feare, ignorance, or otherwise, else it would lie in councells power both to prejudice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and betray their causes, and make them lyable to censure though innocent.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, because every answer in the eye of the law<note place="margin">4.</note> is the defendants only, though signed by his councell for formes sake: he onely is summoned to make answer, he onely is to sweare it, and he, not his councell, is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the hazard of it: therefore he alone in point of law and Justice is onely bound of necessity to signe it, not his Councell.</p>
                           <p>Fiftly, because else there would be a fayler of Justice<note place="margin">5.</note> in many Cases, through the want, feare, neglect, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, diversity of opinion, or treacher of councell: for if one be peremptorily enjoyned to put in an answer by a day, as this defendant now is, and counsell neglect, refuse, delay or feare to doe it upon any occasion by the time, (which is this defendants Case) he must (without any default, contempt, or neglect in him) suffer thereby as a delinquent, though innocent, without any legall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; which were injury and injustice in the highest degree.</p>
                           <p>Sixtly, because the very law of nature teacheth every<note place="margin">6.</note> Creature, but man especially, to defend, preserve and make answer for himselfe, either when the party accused cannot procure others to doe it, or can doe it better then others will, can, or dare doe, himselfe: But in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Case, this defendant cannot procure his councell to make such an answer as his cause requireth, which rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon bookes, matters of Divinity, and on other points, wherein his counsell have but little skill, all which he must justify in his answer, he is better able to make
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66246:13"/>
his answer and defence thereto, then his counsell can, will, or dare to doe, in case they were willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which now they utterly deny and refuse onely out of feare and cowardize,) as aforesaid, and therefore ought, as he humbly conceiveth, to be permitted to doe it, both in point of Law and Justice.</p>
                           <p>Seventhly, because God and Christ, the supream Judges<note place="margin">7.</note> of the World, and patternes of all Justice both here on Earth, have, and at the generall day of judgement, when all men shall appeare before their dreadfull tribunalls, wil allow every man to make his owne personall answer, and defence, without counsel or proxie, much more then should every inferiour Judge, and Terrene Court of Justice doe it, if the party desire it, and others will not, dare not doe it.</p>
                           <p>Eightly, because by the judiciall Law among the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">8.</note> every man was to make his owne defence, neither did their Law judge any man, before it heard him and knew what hee did. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 51. And by the civill Law, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Pagan <hi>Romans,</hi> it was not the manner to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne any man, before that hee who was accused had the accusers face to face, and had Licence to answer for himselfe concerning the crime layd against him, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 16. If then the Lawes amongst <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> gave every defendant leave, thus to make answer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and never condemned any as guilty for not answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by counsell (as appeares by the cases of <hi>Naboth, Susanna, Christ</hi> and others, though unjustly condemned, yet not without a full hearing, and witnesses first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, though false,) this defendant humbly conceiveth, that by the Lawes and Justice of this Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, and this honorable Court, hee ought to have like liberty in this cause of so great consequence, and that the Information against him ought not to be taken, <hi>Pro confesso,</hi> without hearing witnesses, or defence, in case
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66246:14"/>
he tender an answer under his owne hand, onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his counsells who refuse to advise or direct him, else our Christian Lawes, and Courts of Justice, might seeme to be more unreasonable then the <hi>Iewes,</hi> or <hi>Pagan Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Lawes and tribunalls, which God forbid any man should imagine.</p>
                           <p>Ninthly, because S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was slandered &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused<note place="margin">9.</note> by <hi>Ananias</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi> high-Priest, with the Elders, and <hi>Tertullus</hi> their Orator, to be a pestilent fellow, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of sedition among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> throughout the World, and a ring-leader amongst the Sect of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarens,</hi> and that severall times, both before <hi>Felix, Festus</hi> and King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> (three heathen Governors and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,) had still free liberty granted him by them all both to answer and speake for himselfe to the full, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie and cleare his innocency, without any counsell assigned. <hi>Act.</hi> 24, &amp; 25, 26. neither did nor could the <hi>Iewish,</hi> high-Priest except against it. This defendant therefore being now accused in this honorable Court of the like crimes, by some <hi>English</hi> Prelates and high-Priests insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, hopes to enjoy the selfe same priviledge and freedome before so many honorable Lords, and Christian Judges, which <hi>Paul</hi> did before these <hi>Pagans.</hi> And hee supposeth his said adversaries will not be against it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they will be thought to feare, and decline the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants answer, as guilty persons, who dare not admit their actions to be scanned in so honorable a Court; or men unwilling to have this defendant cleare his owne Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; or else be deemed more unreasonable then <hi>Ananias</hi> himselfe, especially in this defendants particular case; who having beene a Barrester, and counseller at the Law formerly admitted, even in this honorable Court, to put in answers under his owne hand in other mens cases, cannot but hope and presume to obtaine the like Justice, and favour from it now, in his owne cause, (being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66246:14"/>
necessitated through his counsels feare and deserting of him) for the premised reasons, which he in all humility submits to this honorable Court.</p>

                        <p>IN all humblenesse sheweth, That the petitioner e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<note place="margin">Master <hi>Prynnes</hi> second petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lords.</note> since his appearance to the Information exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited against him, hath beene denyed the liberty of Pen, Jnke or Paper at his Chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to draw up his answer, or instructions for his counsell: That his servant who should solicit his businesse, coppy and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse his answer, hath for a moneths space beene kept close prisoner from him in a Messengers hands, by his chiefe adversaries practise and power, contrary to Law and Justice, of purpose <hi>to retard his answer,</hi> and disable him in the prosecution of his cause: That his friends have beene restrayned from him, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe ever since the day before the Terme, prohibited all accesse to his counsell (granted to his Codefendants) who without any neglect or default in the petitioner,

for reasons best knowne to themselves, refuse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to him, or to undertake any thing in his cause, which they have all quite deserted.

expresse order not to signe it, and afterwards being tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it by master <hi>Prynne</hi> himselfe, who demanded the reason of this deniall; he told him, that hee durst not subscribe it for an 100 pounds though he had drawne it, for feare of being put from the Barre, he having received a command to the contrary. In the meane time Master <hi>Tomlins</hi> who was willing to signe it, departed into the Countrey upon his necessary occasions, so that his hand could not be gotten; Master <hi>Prynne</hi> thus deluded, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints the Lieutenant of the Tower with this false dealing, requesting him to informe the Lord Keeper of it; and to desire his Lordship in his behalfe, either to enjoyne Master <hi>Holt</hi> to signe his answer according to promise as hee had done in Master <hi>Burtons</hi> case; or to accept of it without an hand; or of it, or another answer signed with his owne hand, since he had done his utmost, and had no meanes to compell his counsell to subscribe his answer against their wills; The Lord Keeper upon this Information, answered, that hee had no power to force counsell to signe an answer, and that it was not his use to doe it, or to receive any answer without counsells hands.</p>
            <p>Upon the returne of which answer, Master <hi>Prynne</hi> replied; that if the <hi>Lord Keeper being cheife Iudge of the Court, the greatest officer in the Realme under the King, and a freeman, had no power to enforce his counsell to signe his answer according to duty, equity and promise; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he, being a poore close prisoner had farre lesse power to doe it; and ought not to suffer for his default, which he could not remedy.</hi> Hereupon insteed of accepting his answer, this order was made against him, and Doctor <hi>Bastwick</hi> to take them both <hi>pro confesso</hi> for their contempt in not answering, and to appoint a day for hearing the Cause.</p>

            <p>VPon this strange Certificate of the Judges Master <hi>Burtons</hi> answer was miserably mangled, the whole body and substance of it being quite rased, and nought but the head and feet left upon record; whereby he was made to deny that to be done by him, which he confessed and justified upon oath in his answer, as it stood before this rasure of it.</p>
            <p>VVhereupon the examiner comming to Master <hi>Burton</hi> to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> where he was close prisoner, to examine him upon Interrogatories grounded on his answer, he hearing of this expungement, refused to be examined, unlesse his answer might be admitted as it was put in; or he permitted to put in a new answer; he disclaiming this answer to be his, since altered in all the materiall points tending to his justification and defence, and turned from a <hi>speciall,</hi> to a <hi>generall not-guilty,</hi> necessarily involving him in the danger of periury: Of which the Court being informed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Attorney,</hi> made this ensuing Order, to take the Bill <hi>pro confesso</hi> against him, only for not answering Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; a thing never heard of before in that Court, when there was an answer admitted.</p>

            <p>THese prisoners having this liberty granted them just the day before the hearing, Master <hi>Prynne</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon repaired with his answer (formerly drawne up and engrossed by Master <hi>Holt</hi>) to Master <hi>Tomlins</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his counsell, newly returned out of the Country the evening before; and having got him to signe this engrossed answer, he goeth therewith to Master <hi>Holt,</hi> desiring him likewise to subscribe it according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; who refused to doe it now as hee had done before, protesting, <hi>that he durst not for an</hi> 100 <hi>peeces signe it, because he had received an expresse command to the contrary.</hi> Whereupon Master <hi>Prynne</hi> caries it signed with Master <hi>Tomlins</hi> hand to the Star-Chamber Office, where hee tendred it to Master <hi>Goad,</hi> together with another longer answer signed with his owne hand, and an <hi>Affidavit,</hi> that hee could not possibly procure his counsells hand to his answer before that time; But Master <hi>Goad</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with his deputy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> refused to receave either the answers or <hi>Affidavit,</hi> though earnestly pressed to it by Master <hi>Prynne:</hi> who thereupon returned with his answers to the Tower; and prepared himselfe for the hearing the next morning, resolving, that since he was thus fore judged, and taken <hi>pro confesso,</hi> upon a meere false pretence of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in refusing to answer, to speake nothing, but what
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66246:24"/>
the Court should give him occasion when he appeared at the Barre; Doctor <hi>Bastwick,</hi> and Master <hi>Burton</hi> taking up the like resolution; because they were certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that whatever they spake, their sentence was already determined, and set downe in writing before the hearing came, all being thus taken <hi>pro confesso</hi> as you have heard and seene by the former orders.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you a faithfull relation of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in this cause before the hearing, out of the <hi>Orders</hi> and Records of the Star-Chamber, the legality whereof you shall finde discussed in the close of this Treatise; Now before I come to the day of hearing, give me leave to acquaint you onely with one particular touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Master <hi>Holt,</hi> hee being sharply checked and terrified for drawing and signing Master <hi>Burtons</hi> answer, and charged not to signe Master <hi>Prinnes</hi> answer when hee had drawne it, as you have heard before, was much troubled at it; and being in Court at the hearing the next day, he offered two or three times to speake something in defence of Master <hi>Burtons</hi> cause; which the then Lord Keeper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, beckoned and held up his finger to him to hold his peace, whereupon hee kept silence. And comming home to his house, as soone as the sentence was passed, his wife inquiring of him how the cause went; he broke out into these speeches. <hi>O wife, I never saw a just cause, so unjustly caried, which I could have defended by Scripture against all the World. I had a great desire to speake in the cause for my client, but my Lord Keeper beckened and held up his finger to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to hold my peace: And the poore Gentlemen have received the most unjust, and hardest censure, that ever I heard in that Court. For my owne part, I gave over my practise in other Courts, and be tooke my selfe wholy to this Court to enjoy the liberty of my conscience, thinking to finde nothing but Iustice, and</hi>

               <hi>just proceedings there: But now alas J finde things so carried there, that for this dayes worke sake, I desire ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to come more to that Barre, J desire of God, that this may be the last cause that ever I may plead in that Court, which hath partly miscarried through my default (as I am affraid most will judge) though I durst not doe otherwise, beeing so checked and threatned.</hi> This sayd, he continued sad, and soone after falling sicke for conceit only of the miscarriage of this cause (as his wife &amp; friends beleeved) hee died; never going to the Star-Chamber after this sentence: the proceedings and passages whereof, I shall next relate.</p>
