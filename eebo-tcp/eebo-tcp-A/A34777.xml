         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TRUE INTELLIGENCE
from IRELAND:
Being the Copie of a Letter from Captain Courtney at Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
to M. Snow one of the Adventurers for Ireland,
Dated the 10. of November, 1642.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ith grief I have conſidered your laſt
Letter, and no marvell of ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
in the Kingdome, when
as the Ports are opened to receive
thoſe rebels and traitors which paſſe from
hence to His Majeſty, and as by your Letters
and Pamphlets of newes they are received and
made chiefe Commanders of His Majeſties Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
there is, as I conceive, a great default in the
ſearchers of Plymouth, Briſtoll and Mineard,
which ſuffer any to paſſe without examination
or otherwiſe, ſo that the Kingdome is in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
condition, and lies at the brink of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>Oneale the great Rebell hath of late beene

he is well recovered, but by his ragged ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which we take daily, they have confeſſed
that he cannot live; and in caſe he ſhould die,
the young Makarkey ſhall be made Generall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the whole Kingdome: what ſouldiers we
take we dare not keep them for feare of infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for the plague is very much diſperſt among
them, &amp; hundreds die at a time. We have had it
likewiſe amongſt our ſouldiers, but we received
it firſt from the Rebels and captives which we
took; but we hope the worſt is paſt, for there
dieth not above 100. a week, and ſome weeks
leſſe, which is but a moitie of thoſe hat die of
the rebels. Sir, about 4. dayes before the date of
my Letter, wee advanced our Forces towards
Felles, where we found ſome of the Iriſh Army
drinking of carowſes and healths to the King
of Spaine their ſuppoſed Protector; but in the
midſt of their jollity our Army fell upon them,
and ſlew 200. whereupon a greater party of the
Rebels appeared, and aſſaulted us, and there was
a ſtout fight on both ſides, laying aſide pikes &amp;
muskets, and fighting only with our ſwords, ſo
that our men had ſlaine and wounded moſt of
them, had not Colonell Bourne with a freſh
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61997:3"/>
ſupply of 600. come in the interim. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
our ſouldiers made good their parts, and
came off with the loſſe of 100. at the moſt. We
brought from them 1000. cowes, beſides horſe
and ſheep, and great ſtore of other pillage that
was freely given to the ſouldiers for their pains,
which very much incourageth them. Oneal his
ſouldiers are moſt lamentable diſtreſſed poore
people, hardly ſufficient to cloath their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
We were much afraid of the Spaniſh For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which landed at Waterford two dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fight, but, as God would have it, our
ſouldiers carried their pillage quite away before
they came to aſsiſt Colonell Bourne, who was
chiefe Commander amongſt the Rebels in that
fight.</p>
            <p>We have great hopes of Captaine Bartlet,
for hitherto he hath done very good ſervice;
and this inſtant day he took a Dunkirk ſhip full
of ammunition, and 40. Iriſh Commanders in
it, and immediately brought them to Baranna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killy:
they were driven with a tempeſt upon
our coaſts, for it appeared by their examination
that they intended to have landed at Ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
Dartmouth, or ſome ſuch like creek in
the Weſt parts of England.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61997:4"/>
I cannot but admire at a Merchants ſhip of
Briſtoll which lately anchored at Crockhaven
by reaſon of tempeſtuous weather, the Captain
and Maſter of the ſhip fearing leſt the rebels
would ſink her, invited the chiefeſt rebels of
the towne aboard, and gave them royall enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
in hopes to have merchandize for
their Tobacco, they had fair promiſes proteſted
aboard, but when the rebels got the Captain &amp;
Maſter aſhore, they vowed to hang them if they
commanded not the reſt of the Mariners to
come aſhore and leave their ſhip and goods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them. The Captain and Maſter eſcaped
with their lives, though it were not a penni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth
of hurt if the rebels had hanged them in
earneſt, for they needed not to h<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>zzard ſhip or
goods, nor were they conſtrained to go aſhore,
but they might have caried away or curbed the
rebels at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Sir Charles Vavaſour is worthy of honour,
and very forward in any deſigne, he hath lately
been at Kelly and Barry, and although the
townes have been beſieged, yet with leſſe then
500. he raiſed the ſiege, and enforced them to
take their bulwarks for their refuge, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

he ſpied at leaſt 200. of the rebels dead, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the ſickneſſe, and lay on the ground like
dead dogs: he commanded his ſouldiers not to
touch any of them, which they all obeyed, yet
he departed not empty, for his ſouldiers tooke

other ſpoile by fire which he did before
he departed, he took 12. Commanders, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
them in chaines, and brought them unto
Dublin. I will not trouble you with ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

great expence for the paiment of ſouldiers, and
is ſtrongly fortified within and without, being
double chained in every croſſe ſtreet, and 1000.

the Courts of Guard: nevertheleſſe the rebels
