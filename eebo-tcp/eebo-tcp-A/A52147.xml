            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Second Advice TO A PAINTER, FOR Drawing the History of our <hi>NAVALL</hi> Business; <hi>In Answer to</hi> Mr. Waller.</head>
            <l>NAy <hi>Painter,</hi> if thou dar'st design that Fight,</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Waller</hi> only Courage had to Write;</l>
            <l>If thy bold hand, can without shaking Draw,</l>
            <l>What even the <hi>Actors</hi> trembled when they saw;</l>
            <l>Enough to make thy Colours change like <hi>their's,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And all thy Pencills bristle, like <hi>their Haires.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>First in fit distance of the prospect Vaine,</l>
            <l>Paint <hi>Allen</hi> Tilting at the Coast of <hi>Spaine</hi>;</l>
            <l>Heroick Act, and never heard till now,</l>
            <l>Steming of <hi>Her'cles</hi> Pillers with his Prow,</l>
            <l>And how two Ships he left, the Hills to waft,</l>
            <l>And with new Sea-marks, <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Calice</hi> graft.</l>
            <l>Next let the flaming <hi>London</hi> come in view.</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Nero's Rome,</hi> burnt to Rebuild it new:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98096:3"/>What lesser Sacrifice then this was meet,</l>
            <l>To offer for the fafty of the Fleet?</l>
            <l>Blow one Ship up, another thence doth grow;</l>
            <l>See what free Cities; and wise Courts can do.</l>
            <l>So some old Merchant to ensure his Name,</l>
            <l>Marries a fresh, and Courtiers share the Dame:</l>
            <l>So what soe're is broke, the Servants pay't,</l>
            <l>And Glasses are more durable then Plate.</l>
            <l>No <hi>Mayor</hi> till now, so rich a <hi>Pageant</hi> fain'd;</l>
            <l>Nor one <hi>Barge</hi> all the <hi>Companies</hi> contain'd.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Painter</hi> draw <hi>Coerulean Coventry,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Keeper, or rather Chancelor of the Sea;</l>
            <l>Of whom the Captain buys his leave to dye,</l>
            <l>And Barters it for Wounds, or Infamy:</l>
            <l>And more exactly to express his hue,</l>
            <l>Use nothing but <hi>ultra marinish</hi> blue;</l>
            <l>To pay his Fees the <hi>Silver Trumpet</hi> spend,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Boatswains</hi> whistles; For his Place depends;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pilots</hi> in vain repeat the Compass o're,</l>
            <l>Untill of him, they learn that one Point more;</l>
            <l>The constant Magnet to the Pole doth hold,</l>
            <l>Steel to the Magnet, <hi>Coventry</hi> to Gold:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Muscovy</hi> sells us Hemp, and Pitch and Tar?</l>
            <l>Iron and Copper <hi>Sweden; Munster</hi> War;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ashley</hi> Prizes, <hi>Warwick</hi> Customs, <hi>Cartret</hi> Pay?</l>
            <l>But <hi>Coventry</hi> doth sell his Fleet away.</l>
            <l>Now let our Navy stretch its Canvas wings,</l>
            <l>Swoln like his purse, with tackling like its strings,</l>
            <l>By slow degrees of the encreasing Gale,</l>
            <l>First under Sale, and after under Sail:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:98096:3"/>Then in kind visit unto <hi>Opdams</hi> Gout,</l>
            <l>Hedge the <hi>Dutch</hi> in, only to let them out:</l>
            <l>So <hi>Huntsmen</hi> fair, unto the <hi>Hares</hi> give law,</l>
            <l>First find them, and then civilly withdraw,</l>
            <l>That the blind <hi>Archer,</hi> when they take the Seas,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Hamborough</hi> Convey may betray at ease.</l>
            <l>So that the Fish may more securely bite,</l>
            <l>The Fisher baits the River over night.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Painter</hi> now prepare t'enrich thy Piece,</l>
            <l>Pencills of <hi>Ermins,</hi> Oyl of <hi>Ambergreece</hi>:</l>
            <l>See where the <hi>Dutches</hi> with triumphant tayl</l>
            <l>Of numerous Coaches. <hi>Harwich</hi> doth assayl;</l>
            <l>So the <hi>Land-Crabs,</hi> at Natures kindly call</l>
            <l>Down to engender, at the Sea do crawl;</l>
            <l>See then the <hi>Admiral</hi> with Navy whole,</l>
            <l>To <hi>Harwich</hi> through the Ocean <hi>Caraloe</hi>:</l>
            <l>So <hi>Swallows</hi> buried in the Sea, at Spring,</l>
            <l>Return to Land, with Summer in their wing.</l>
            <l>One thrifty Ferry-boat of Mother-Pearl</l>
            <l>Suffic'd of old, the <hi>Citherian Girl</hi>:</l>
            <l>Yet <hi>Navies</hi> are but propperties, when here</l>
            <l>A small Sea-mask, built to court you Dear.</l>
            <l>Three <hi>Goddesses</hi> in one. <hi>Pallas</hi> for Art,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Venus</hi> for Sport, and <hi>Juno</hi> in your heart.</l>
            <l>Oh <hi>Dutches</hi>! if thy Nuptial Pomp were mean,</l>
            <l>It's paid with intrest, in this Naval Scean:</l>
            <l>Never did <hi>Roman Mark</hi> within the <hi>Nyle,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>So feast the fair <hi>Egyptian Crocodile</hi>;</l>
            <l>Nor the <hi>Venetian</hi> Duke with such a State,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Adriatique</hi> Marry at that Rate.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98096:4"/>Now <hi>Painter</hi> spare thy weaker Art, forbear</l>
            <l>To draw her parting passions, and each tear,</l>
            <l>For love alass, hath but a short delight,</l>
            <l>The Winds, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> all calls to fight;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>She</hi> therefore the <hi>Dukes</hi> person recommends</l>
            <l>To <hi>Brunker, Pen</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> as friends;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pen,</hi> much more to <hi>Brunker,</hi> most to <hi>Coventry.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For they (she knew) were more 'fraid then <hi>bee.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Of flying Fishes, one had fav'd the Finn,</l>
            <l>And hop'd with that, he through the Aire might spin:</l>
            <l>The other thought he might avoid his Knell,</l>
            <l>In the Invention of the Diving Bell:</l>
            <l>The third had tri'd it, and afirm'd, a Cable</l>
            <l>Coil'd round about men, was Impenetrable:</l>
            <l>But these the <hi>Duke</hi> rejected; only chose</l>
            <l>To keep far off, and others Interpose.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Rupert</hi> that knew not fear, but health did want,</l>
            <l>Kept state suspended in his Chair <hi>volant,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>All save his head shut in the wooden Case,</l>
            <l>He shew'd but like a broken weather-Glasse;</l>
            <l>But arm'd in a whole Lyon <hi>Cap-a-chin,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Did represent a <hi>Hercules</hi> within;</l>
            <l>Dear, shall the <hi>Dutch</hi> his twinging Anguish know,</l>
            <l>And feel what Valour (whet with pain) can do:</l>
            <l>Curst in the mean time be that traitrous <hi>Iael,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That through his Princely temples drove the nail.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Rupert</hi> resolv'd to fight it like a Lyon,</l>
            <l>But <hi>Sandwich</hi> hop'd to fight it like <hi>Aryon</hi>:</l>
            <l>He to prolong his life in the dispute,</l>
            <l>(And Charm the <hi>Holland Pyrats</hi>) tun'd his Lute,</l>

            <l>Hence by the <hi>Gazetteir</hi> he was mistooke,</l>
            <l>As unconcern'd, as if at <hi>Hinchinbrooke.</hi>
            </l>

            <l>First paint me <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Rupert,</hi> ratling far,</l>

            <l>Till as the Ecchoe vanishing abate,</l>
            <l>Men feel a deaf sound, like the Pulse of Fate:</l>
            <l>If Fate expire, let <hi>Monck</hi> her place supply,</l>
            <l>His Guns determine who shall live or die;</l>

               <l>GReat Prince, and so much greater, as more wise</l>
               <l>Sweet as our life, and dearer than our eyes;</l>
               <l>What <hi>Servants</hi> will conceal, and <hi>Counsellors</hi> spare;</l>
               <l>To tell the <hi>Painter,</hi> and the <hi>Poet</hi> dare;</l>
               <l>And the assistance of an heavenly Muse,</l>
               <l>And Pencils, Represent the Times abstruce.</l>
               <l>Here needs no Fleet, no Sword, no Forreign-Foe;</l>
               <l>Only let Vice be damn'd and Justice flow:</l>
               <l>Shake but (like <hi>Iove</hi>) thy Locks Divine, and frown,</l>
               <l>Thy Scepter will sffice to guard thy Crown.</l>
               <l>Hark to <hi>Cassandras</hi> song 'ere Fate destroy,</l>
               <l>By thy own Navies Wooden-Horse, thy <hi>Troy.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Us, our <hi>Apollo,</hi> from the Tumults wave,</l>
               <l>And gentle Gales, though but in Oars will save.</l>
               <l>So <hi>Philomel,</hi> her sad embrohdery strung,</l>
               <l>And vocal Silks tun'd with her vocal Tongue;</l>
               <l>The picture dumb, in Colours loud reveal'd,</l>
               <l>The Tragedies of Court, so long conceal'd.</l>
               <l>but when restor'd to voice, inclosed with wings,</l>
               <l>To Woods and Groves, which once she painted sings.</l>
