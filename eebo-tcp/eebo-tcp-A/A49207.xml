         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following <hi>Edicts</hi> being Extraordinary, both for the Matter and Manner, It's preſum'd that the Tranſlation may not only be Grateful to the Curious, who don't underſtand them in the Original; but uſeful to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that they may ſee the difference betwixt a Legal and Tyrannical Government. The diſparity of the Stile in theſe two Edicts is very Remarkable. That for the Tax on Water, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it as a Royal Prerogative and Right; but for ſuch Reaſons as will ſooner move Laughter than Choler in any but his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who have cauſe indeed to be afraid of that ſevere <hi>Innuendo,</hi> that they are fineable for having made uſe of the Water without his Royal Licenſe; when they conſider, that he, who hath been ſo often guilty of breaking the moſt Sacred and Solemn Treaties with his Superiours and Equals, will never be tied to keep Promiſe to his Subjects, any longer than Opportunity or Neceſſity affords him a Pretence to do otherwiſe. Then, as for the Edict impoſing the Poll-Tax, it is every whitt as ſneaking as the other is haughty: He uſhers it in with a flattering and Romantick Prooemium, and to make his Subjects digeſt it the better, inſinuates that the <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> of the Allies hath occaſion'd this War, tho' it be juſtly chargeable on his own <hi>Uſurpations;</hi> and that their <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> is the Cauſe of its Continuance; whereas it is his own <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice:</hi> but being ſenſible of the Risk which he runs by continual Incroachments on his Peoples Liberties, he finds himſelf under a Neceſſity to <hi>fawn</hi> ſometimes, as well as to <hi>Hector</hi> at others; and therefore hopes that his Nobility and Gentry, who are ſo prodigal of their Blood, won't be niggardly of their Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is
<pb facs="tcp:96193:3"/>
ſenſible of the <hi>Nobilities Pretenſions</hi> to be exempted from this Poll, and what Reaſon his Souldiery have to Grumble, that they, <hi>who ſpend their Blood in the War,</hi> ſhould alſo be <hi>taxed to maintain it;</hi> and therefore finds himſelf obliged to give ſoft words, at leaſt; ſuch is the difference betwixt Dominion founded on the Love of the Subject, and that maintain'd by Tyranny and Force. How great is the odds betwixt the Authority of an Act of Parliament, and the Edict of the moſt Abſolute and Imperious Monarch! How chearfully do Subjects obey the one, and with what Regret are they forc'd to ſubmit to the other.</p>
            <p>How much greater Reaſon have we in <hi>England</hi> to pay <hi>what is charg'd on us by Law for maintenance of our Liberties,</hi> than our Neighbours of <hi>France</hi> have to pay that which is arbitrarily demanded to ſupport one who <hi>tyrannizes over their Souls and Bodies?</hi> And why ſhould we repine at paying for our <hi>Beer,</hi> when our Neighbours are forced to pay for their <hi>Water?</hi> This is judg'd ſufficient by way of Preface, the Edicts themſelves being ſo plain, that he who runs, may read in how much better Condition we are than the French, ſeeing no Money can be levied upon us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our own conſent: <hi>Whence it comes to paſs, that we have not only wherewith to maintain our ſelves at Home, but Money to ſpare to make us redoubtable Abroad; whereas they have ſcarcely any thing left to be taken from them, and cannot plead a Property in that poor Remainder, but muſt ſurrender it at the Will of their Prince, whenever his Ambition or Neceſſity requires it:</hi> And that the latter is very great, needs no better De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, then that he who never us'd to accoſt his Subjects in any other Dialect than <hi>We Will and Command,</hi> is now forc'd to make uſe of <hi>Arguments and Intreaties to move and perſwade;</hi> which comes far ſhort of that Auguſt Stile,—Be it enacted by the King's moſt Excellent Majeſty, with the Advice and Conſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in Parliament aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled; and as it comes ſhort of the Authority, will come as ſhort of the Effects.</p>

                        <hi>LEWIS,</hi> by the Grace of God, King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarre;</hi>
                     </signed>

                     </salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>Since the Glory of Our State, and the Proſperities wherewith it has pleaſed God to bleſs Our Reign, have excited the Envy of moſt of the Powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> and engaged them to make a League, in order to wage an Injuſt War againſt Us; the ſincerity of Our Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Advantages We have Yearly got over them, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Us ſtill in hopes of a ſpeedy Peace, We have endeavour'd, in order to repel the Efforts of the States in League againſt Us, to make uſe of no other Means, but ſuch as were leaſt burthenſom to our Subjects: In order thereunto we have alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Rents, of which we have aſſign'd the Payment on Our Ordinary Revenues; and Created Offices, the Sallaries of which are ſet down on the Settlements of Our <hi>Finances.</hi> And
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96193:4"/>
if in the Sequel, We have been obliged to make uſe of ſome other Means which have been more burthenſom to Our People, it was only becauſe it was abſolutely neceſſary to ſettle and fix ſuch Funds as were requiſite for the weal of Our State. But the Obſtinacy of Our Enemies, who ſeem to be inſenſible of their Loſſes, and who, far from being concern'd at the Miſery of the People, ſeem even to take an Advantage at the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation We expreſs towards a Peace, giving Us a Proſpect of the Continuance of the War, and obliging Us to prepare for it, We are in hop's to make all <hi>Europe</hi> ſenſible, that the Forces of <hi>France</hi> are Inexhauſtible, when they are well mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and that We have certain reſerves in the Hearts of Our Subjects, and in their Zeal for their King's Service, and for the Glory of the <hi>French</hi> Nation. Confiding in this, We have reſolved in order to put Our ſelf in a Condition to maintain the Expences of the War, as long as the blindneſs of Our Enemies will incline them to refuſe a Peace, to eſtabliſh a general Poll-Tax, to be paid during the time of the War only, by all Our Subjects, without any diſtinction, by Hearths or by Families: And We are the more inclined to look on this Mean as ſafe and effectual, ſeeing that the moſt zealous and moſt knowing of Our Subjects of the Three Orders which compoſe this State, ſeem to have prevented Our Reſolution; and moreover that the Eſtates of <hi>Languedoc</hi> being aſſembled according to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Cuſtom, after having granted the free Gift of Three Millions which We had deſired of them, and made Proviſion for the other uſual Charges which the War has conſiderably increas'd, by an Expreſs Decree of their Aſſembly, of the Month of <hi>December</hi> laſt, carrying their Foreſight and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of their Zeal and Affection, beyond whatever We could expect from them, have propos'd this Aid to Us, and ſet down the Reaſons, for which it ought to be preferr'd to all the other Extraordinary Means which we might practiſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>And indeed this Poll-Tax extending generally over all Our Subjects, will prove no great Burthen to every one in particular, and being joyn'd to Our uſual Revenues, will raiſe ſufficient Funds, which being Collected without Charge or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, will render the ſaid Aid the more Speedy, Eaſie and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96193:4"/>
We do moreover believe, that in caſe the ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſucceeds, as We have reaſon to think it will, it will enable Us for the future, to lay aſide the extraordinary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, to which the neceſſity of the Times has obliged Us to have recourſe; promiſing upon the Faith and Word of a King, to annul the ſaid General Poll-Tax, within Three Months after the Publication of a Peace. <hi>For theſe Reaſons,</hi> and other Conſiderations Us thereunto moving, of Our cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Knowledge, Abſolute Power, and Authority Royal, We have by theſe Preſents, Sign'd under our Hand, Said and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, do Say and Declare, Will, and it is Our Pleaſure, That, to reckon from the Firſt Day of this Month, a General Poll-Tax be Eſtabliſh'd, Rais'd and Levy'd throughout Our whole Kingdom, Countries, Lands and Lordſhips under Our Command, as well as in the Countries and Cities Conquer'd by Us, ſince the Declaration of this preſent War, by Hearths, or by Families, payable Yearly during the preſent War on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not to be Continued or Exacted under any Pretence whatever, Three Months after God's having granted Us a Peace: That in order thereunto, the Intendants and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſent forth in each of the Generalities, Provinces, Countries and Diſtricts, the Syndics of the Dioceſes and of the Eſtates; and the Gentlemen, who are to act joyntly with the ſaid Intendants according to this preſent Declaration, do agree about the Rolls of the Diviſion of the ſaid Poll-Tax, conformably to the Bill of Rates agreed on in Our Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Diſtribution of Our Subjects, in Two and Twenty Claſſes, which ſhall be fix'd under the Counter Seal of theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents. Willing that none of our Subjects of what Quality or Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever, whether Eccleſiaſticks, Secular or Regular, Noble, Military or others, ſhould be exempted from the ſaid Poll-Tax, Excepting only ſuch of our Subjects as are aſſeſs'd on the <hi>Taille,</hi> or other Common Impoſitions under Forty Pence, the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant Orders, and the Poor Mendicants, whereof the Curates of every Pariſh ſhall give a Liſt Sign'd and Certify'd by them, upon their Honor and Conſcience. We are perſwaded that the Eccleſiaſticks will the more chearfully ſubmit to this Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, ſeeing that beſides that, the Intereſt of Religion, and the Zeal which they have always expreſs'd for our Service
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96193:5"/>
Ingages them to it; their Profeſſion hindring them from ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in our Armies, where moſt of them ſhould be call'd by their Birth, they have no other way on this occaſion to contribute towards the defence of the State of which they make up the firſt Body: But in as much as the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Clergy of our Kingdom is to be held this Year, and that the Teſtimonies we have ever receiv'd of the Zeal of that Body, makes us preſume that they will continue to give us Proofs of the ſame; granting us by a Voluntary Gift, Aids proportionable to the Neceſſities of the State, and that it would not be reaſonable at the ſame time to oblige them to Contribute towards the Poll-Tax; <hi>It is Our Will and Pleaſure,</hi> That at this Time, the Clergy, and the Members which have a dependence on them, be not compris'd in the Aſſeſsment which ſhall be agreed on in Our Council, nor in the Rolls which ſhall be made by the Intendants for the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Taxes of this preſent Year. Neither do We queſtion, but the Nobility of Our Kingdom, who daily Expoſe their Lives, and Spill their Blood generouſly for Our Service, and for the Support of the State, will as freely Sacrifice ſo ſmall a portion of their Revenues, as that to which the Tax which will be laid on Gentlemen will amount. And whereas the Product of the ſaid Poll-Tax is deſign'd to ſupply the Expences of the War, it is neceſſary for us to be in a Condition to make uſe of it during the next Campaign: Therefore we do Require and Command all thoſe who are liable, to pay their Aſſeſsments in two Terms and Equal Payments; the firſt on the Firſt day of <hi>March,</hi> and the ſecond on the Firſt day of <hi>June</hi> following. That Our Subjects who are liable to the <hi>Taille,</hi> do pay the ſaid Tax into the hands of the Receivers of the <hi>Taille</hi> of every Election, or to the Collectors imploy'd by them, who ſhall thereupon remit the Fund of their ſeveral Collections, to the Receiver-General of the <hi>Finances</hi> of their Generality: And the Citizens and Inhabitants of free Towns, which are not lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pay the <hi>Taille,</hi> into the hands of the Receivers of the Publick Stock of the ſaid Towns, who ſhall afterwards remit the ſame to the Receivers General of the <hi>Finances</hi> of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and the ſaid Receivers-General to the Keeper of Our Treaſure Royal. That in ſuch Countries in which Eſtates are

And to prevent the Diſputes which might ariſe about the Impoſition and recovery of the ſaid Poll-Tax, <hi>It is Our Will and Pleaſure,</hi> That thoſe who have many Places, Titles, Dignities or Qualities, and who upon that account might be comprehended in ſeveral Rolls, ſhall only be oblig'd to pay once, according to the higheſt Tax, which they are liable to upon the account of all thoſe Qualities.

And whereas ſeveral Alterations may happen from Year to Year in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Perſons liable to the ſaid Poll-Tax: It is Our Will and Pleaſure, That upon Notice given thereof to Our ſaid
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96193:7"/>
Intendants and Commiſſioners appointed, they ſhall have the Power alone, or Jointly with the Syndics of the Eſtates, of the Dioceſes, and with the Gentlemen by us Nominated, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify their Rolls, to increaſe or diminiſh their Taxes in that of the following Year, ſending an Account of the ſaid Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations or Diminutions by them made, to the Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troler General of Our <hi>Finances.</hi> And whereas it is very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial for the Good of Our Service, and for the Eaſe of Our People to prevent whatever might retard the Raiſing of the ſaid Poll-Tax, or put the Perſons aſſeſs'd to Charges: It is alſo Our Will and Pleaſure, That all Diſputes which might ariſe upon the Account of the ſaid Impoſition and Recovery, ſhall be Judg'd ſummarily and without Charges by the ſaid Intendants and Commiſſioners appointed, and in relation to Our good City of <hi>Paris,</hi> by the Provoſt of the Merchants, and the Sheriffs, whom we do hereby appoint to be the ſole and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Judges thereof; ſo bidding all our other Courts and Judges to take Cogniſance of the ſame: It is alſo Our Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, That whatever ſhall be ordain'd by them, ſhall be Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by Proviſion, allowing them however an Appeal to Our Council. We do alſo declare, That by theſe Preſents, and by the Eſtabliſhment of the ſaid Poll-Tax, We do no-wiſe deſign to derogate from the Privileges, Prerogatives and Rights of any of the Orders of Our Kingdom, which We will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and preſerve.

of Our principal Rights of Royalty or Demain, the Kings, Our Predeceſſors, took a particular care to prevent their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Uſurp'd: In the mean time, We are inform'd, that divers of Our Subjects have in Contravention to our Orders, let out or turn'd off the Water of Navigable Rivers and Streams, and have moreover taken the Liberty to convey the Waters of the ſaid Rivers Navigable and not Navigable, Brooks, Springs, Fountains and others, through the great Roads, Streets and publick Places, the Property of which belongs unto us; which occaſions a prejudice ſo much the more conſiderable, that by theſe Enterpriſes they alter the Courſe of Navigation, and deprive the Publick of the benefit which they might reap from the ſame, and that they do many times alſo render the Ways unpaſſable, by overflowing of the ſame; which does alſo oblige Us to be at the Expence of Ditches for maintaining the Canals, and augments Our Yearly Charge, for keeping up of Our Bridges and Cauſeys.

In ſuch ſort, that, according to the Tenor of thoſe Letters Patents, and that Act, We have Right to declare, That all thoſe who have Water, have incurr'd a Fine for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the ſame, contrary to the ſaid Declaration, and the Acts iſſued for Execution of the ſame. Nevertheleſs, having taken into Conſideration, that this Fine join'd to the Sums which We may pretend to againſt the ſaid Poſſeſſors for time paſt, would much diminiſh the Value of their Stocks and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96193:15"/>
We have judged it more convenient to confirm and maintain them in the Poſſeſſion of the ſaid Waters, on paying of a Moderate Sum, in conſideration of which, they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſame as in time paſt: Whereunto We are ſo much the more inclinable, that by ſecuring the publick Roads and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable Rivers from ſuch Attempts for the future, We do in ſome meaſure make up the Loſſes of Our Demain, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure unto Our ſelves a preſent Supply from many Perſons who have not hitherto contributed any thing to the extraordinary Charges of the State. <hi>For theſe Cauſes,</hi> and others Us thereunto moving, and from Our own certain Knowledge, full Power, and Royal Authority, We have by this Preſent, Perpetual and Irrevocable Edict, Said, Statuted and Ordained, and Say, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, Ordain, Will and Pleaſe, that in the ſpace of one Month at fartheſt, from the Day of the Enrolling of this preſent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and the Publication thereof in the Baliwicks, Seneſohal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and other Royal Courts, all Communities Secular or Regular, and all particular Perſons of what Quality and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſoever, who have Waters derived from Navigable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers within the limits of Our Kingdom, or Countries, Lands and Lordſhips ſubject to Us; As alſo thoſe who have Waters deriv'd from Rivers that are not Navigable, Brooks, Springs and Fountains, or otherwiſe, which they ſtop or retain about the Roads, or bring it acroſs the Streets, Ways and Publick Places for their own uſe, whether it be to Water their Lands, Embelliſh their Houſes, or what other Uſe ſoever; Alſo thoſe who have let out, or turn'd off the Waters through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the High Juriſdictions which belong to Us, and in thoſe by Us Mortgaged; ſhall be obliged to give unto him whom We ſhall entruſt with the Execution of the preſent Edict, his Proctors, Deputies and Subſtitutes, exact Declarations of the Quantity of Lines of Water which they enjoy, from whence they flow, the Houſes and Edifices better'd or beautify'd by them, the Places, Streets and Ways thro which they paſs, and what Acres of Land belonging unto them, are thereby watered, on pain of being fin'd in 500 Livres, which ſhall neither be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nor moderated upon any Pretext whatſoever. We Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, That upon thoſe Declarations, it ſhall be forthwith E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted in the Rolls of our Council, in which the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities

and particular Perſons ſhall be Taxed, that is to ſay, thoſe of Our good City, Provoſtſhip, Vicounty, Preſidial and Province of <hi>Paris,</hi> at the Rate of 150 Livres <hi>per</hi> Line. Thoſe who enjoy any in other Cities of Our Kingdom, where there is a Parliament Chamber of Accounts, Courts of Revenue, Provoſtſhips or Baliwicks of the ſame, at the rate of 100 Livres <hi>per</hi> Line: Yet ſo, nevertheleſs, that the ſaid Taxes may not exceed the Sum of 1000 Livres for each Grant, for what Quantity of Lines ſoever. Thoſe of other Cities of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at the rate of 50 Livres <hi>per</hi> Line; yet ſo as their Taxes may not exceed the Sum of 500 Livres. The Proprietors of Watered Lands, at the rate of 3 Livres <hi>per</hi> Acre. And thoſe who ſerve themſelves of the ſaid Waters for what other Uſe ſoever, whether for Profit or Ornament, without the Extent of the ſaid Cities and other Places deſigned as above, at 25 Livres <hi>per</hi> Line, yet ſo as their Taxes may not exceed the Sum of 250 Livres; which Sums ſhall be paid, as alſo the 2 Sous <hi>per</hi> Livre of the ſame, the one half within a Month after the ſignification of the ſaid Rolls, and the other half in the Month following, to ſuch Perſon as we ſhall name, to recover the ſame, his Proctors, Deputies and Subſtitutes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal upon their Acquittance, bearing a Promiſe to furniſh them with a Diſcharge from the Keeper of Our Royal Treaſury; and the 2 Sous <hi>per</hi> Livre, upon their bare Receipt. By means whereof, it is Our Will that they be confirm'd in their Right, Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment, from the Grant of the Mayors and Sheriffs, without being liable to be diſpoſſeſſed for any Cauſe or Pretext whatſoever, nor obliged to pay unto Us, by reaſon thereof, any Annual Sum; and in caſe of Default, and not payment of the ſaid Sums, within the time above ſpecified, that they ſhall be Conſtrained thereunto, as for our proper Revenues and Affairs; And in caſe that the Houſes, Goods and Eſtates where there is Water, ſhall come to be really ſeiz'd, It is our Will, that the Sums for which they ſhall be Compriz'd in the Rolls, ſhall be paid out of the Money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the Leaſes ſo ſeiz'd, or that which ſhall be made by the Sale of the ſaid Goods preferrable to all other Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. We don't however comprehend in this preſent Enquiry, the Canals, Aqueducts, and other Works, which ſerve for

the Conveyance of Waters of Publick Fountains, Hoſpitals, or Alms-houſes of Lay adminiſtration. In caſe of oppoſition to the Execution of the ſaid Rolls, It is Our Will that they ſhould not be received until the ſaid Perſons from whom they ſhall be due do in the firſt place conſign the Third of their Taxes. We Command all Our Officers, alſo thoſe of Lords, and all Mayors, Sheriffs, Clerks, and other Municipal Officers of Cities, Towns and Pariſhes of Our Kingdom, Countries, Lands and Lordſhips, under Our Juriſdiction, to furniſh him who ſhall be imployed by Us for the Recovery of the ſaid Taxes, Extracts of the Grants which they have made to any for the Enjoyment of the ſaid Waters; for each of which Extracts, they ſhall be paid Four Sous for all Charges, the Stampt-Paper being therein included. We do expreſly diſcharge all thoſe who ſhall find themſelves Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Rolls, enacted in the Execution of Our preſent Edict, to oblige any of thoſe who grant them, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the ſaid Waters, to Vouch or make good the Grant, in order to the Re-demanding of the Sums which they ſhall have paid unto us.
