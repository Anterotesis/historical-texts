         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Declaration of his Excellency the
Lord General Fairfax, and his general
Councel of Officers, ſhewing the Grounds
of the Armies advance towards the City
of London.</head>
            <p>BEing full of ſad Apprehenſions concerning the danger and evil of
the Treaty with the King, and of any Accommodation with Him,
or Reſtitution of him thereupon, we did by our late <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi>
upon the Reaſons and Grounds therein expreſſed, make our Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereby, unto the preſent Houſe of Commons, that the dangerous
evil of that way might be avoyded, and the Peace of the Kingdom
ſetled upon more righteous, ſafe, and hopeful grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> a more
equal diſpenſing of Juſtice and Mercy in relation to things done or
ſuffered in the late Wars, and the eſtabliſhing of the future Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Kingdom upon a ſafe Succeſſion and equal Conſtitution
of Parliaments, and that (for the ending of preſent, and avoyding of
future differences) to be ratified by an Agreement and Subſcription of
the people thereunto.</p>
            <p>This courſe we took, out of our tender care and earneſt deſire, that
all ways of Extremity might be avoyded, and that thoſe matters of
higheſt concernment, to the publique Intereſt of this Nation, might be
purſued, and provided for, (if poſſible) by thoſe whoſe proper Work
and Truſt it was. And herein we were willing to hope that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſo truſted, or the Majority of them, might poſſibly have been
either driven into that deſtructive way, by forcible Impulſions, or
lapſed thereinto through ſome Inconſideration, or Miſapprehenſions
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61445:3"/>
and conceived Jealouſies: And therefore we did carefully decline the
inſiſting upon any thing that might continue or renew any former Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
or Animoſities, and kept only to ſuch things as were of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
or advantage to the common Cauſe, and of common and equal
Concernment to thoſe that have engaged in it: Which things we
preſſed in the way of Reaſon and Perſwaſion only, that they might
be duly and timely conſidered. But to our grief we find, in ſtead of
any Satisfaction or a reaſonable reaſonable Anſwer thereto, they are
wholly rejected, without any conſideration of what ever Reaſon or
Juſtice might be in the things ſet forth or propounded therein; for
what leſs can be underſtood, when the things propounded were mainly
for the avoydance of evils appearing in the Treaty with the King:
And yet they put off the conſideration of them, till there ſhould be no
place left for any conſideration at all: Firſt, laying it aſide till Monday
laſt, by which time the Treaty (as then ſuppoſed) would have been
concluded; but that failing, and two days more being added to the
Treaty, the conſideration of our <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> on the day appointed,
was waved and layd aſide; the Treaty, the mean while, going on in
the former way and terms, and like to be concluded the very next day.</p>
            <p>Now, though we are far from that preſumption, that the things
ſhould therefore be anſwered or conſidered, becauſe propounded by
us, ſave for the Reaſon, Juſtice, or publique Concernment therein;
yet, having no Anſwer, or any thing ſhewed us to the contrary, we
cannot but upon the grounds Remonſtrated (and many more which
might be added) remain confident in our former Apprehenſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them. And ſeeing the prevailing part of thoſe, to whom we did
apply, to have, as it we, their eyes wilfully ſhut, and ears ſtopt, againſt
any thing of Light or Reaſon offered to them, we find no place left for
our former charitable or hopeful Apprehenſions, concerning their
error in ſuch evil ways; but remainng fully aſſured of the
danger and deſtructiveneſs thereof, as to all thoſe publique ends for
which they were intruſted, and alſo of the juſt advantage and neceſſity
which lye in the things we have popounded and inſiſt on, we now ſee
nothing left, to which their engaging and perſiſting in ſuch ways and
rejection of theſe better things propounded, can rationally be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
leſs then a treacherous or corrupt neglect of, and Apoſtacy from
the publique Truſt-repoſed in them; although we could wiſh from our
ſons, we might yet finde the contrary. Nevertheleſs, we do not in
theſe things aſſume a ſtanding Power of Judgement (as of Right or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61445:3"/>
Truſt) to conclude others thereby, acknowledging that to lye moſt
properly in thoſe whom the people duly chooſe and truſt to Judge for
them: But conſidering that ſuch power, where it is, is committed but in
Truſt, and that neither this, nor any other people, did ever give up their
Natural capacities of common Sence or Reaſon, as to the ends and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
of that Truſt, and that as to the breach of ſuch Truſt, there
is no higher formal power of man in being to Appeal unto for Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in ſuch caſe (as all others concerned in ſuch breaches of Truſt
will) ſo as we cannot but exerciſe that Common Judgement
which in our Natural Capacity is left to us: And though in ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
failers of ſuch Truſt, which might be born, without hazard
of Deſtruction to that Intereſt, and thoſe People, for which
eſpecially the Truſt is, or where the Truſtees were of an indifferent
equal conſtitution, in reference to the whole, or where we had
an orderly and open way left for a juſt ſucceſſion of another form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and proper Judicature to be appealed unto in due time; we ſhould
not oppoſe or hold forth our private Judgments to the leaſt diſturbance
of that orderly and peaceable courſe of Judgment ſo eſtabliſht; yet
in our preſent caſe we are ſo fully convinced of the greatneſs and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructiveneſs
of thoſe evils we have declared againſt, and of the nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſito
and eſentiallity of thoſe better things we have deſired and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
and how inconſiſtent it is with the publique Truſt, and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
ends of it, ſtill to purſue the one, and reject the other, as that
we dare with confidence appeal therein to the common Judgments of
indifferent and uncorrupted men, and to the more righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God above all.</p>
            <p>And as the incompetency of this Parliament, in its preſent conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to give an abſolute and concluſive Judgment for the whole, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to be the ſole Judges of their own performance, or breach of
Truſt,) doth make the juſter way for ſuch an Appeal, ſo indeed we
ſee no other way left for remedy, in regard the preſent unlimitted,
continuance of this Parliament doth exclude the orderly ſucceſſion of
any other more equal, formal Judicature of men, to which we might
hope in due time other ways to appeal.</p>
            <p>Thus then we appreehend our ſelves in the preſent caſe, both neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to, and juſtified in an Appeal in this Parliament, in the preſent
Conſtitution as it ſtands, unto the extraordinary Judgment of God,
and good people; and yet in the proſecution of this Appeal, as we ſhall
drive it on, but to the ſpeedy obtaining of a more orderly and equal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61445:4"/>
Judicature of men, in a juſt Repreſentive, according to our Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
(wherein to acquieſce,) ſo in the preſent procuring of Juſtice
with the peoples eaſe and quiet, and in the ſettling of the Kingdom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a due, ſafe and hopeful ſucceſſion of Parliaments: It is our hearts
deſire, and ſhall be our indeavor, that ſo much, both of the matter and
form of the preſent Parliamentary Authority may be preſerved, as can
be ſafe, or will be uſeful to theſe ends, until a juſt and full Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, both for matter and form (ſuitable to the publique ends
it ſerves for) can be introduced.</p>
            <p>And therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt, It ſhould be our great rejoycing, (if God ſaw
it good,) that the Majority of the preſent Houſe of Commons were
become ſenſible of the evil and deſtructiveneſs of their late way, and
would reſolvedly and vigorouſly apply themſelves to the ſpeedy exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Juſtice, with the righting and eaſing of the oppreſſed people,
and to a juſt and ſafe ſettlement of the Kingdom upon ſuch foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as have been propounded by us, and others, for that purpoſe, and
would for the ſpeedier and ſurer proſecution of theſe things exclude
from Communication in their Councels all ſuch corrupt and Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
Members as have appeared hitherto, but to obſtruct and hinder
ſuch matter of Juſtice, Safety, and publique Intereſt, and to pervert
their Conncels a contrary way, and have therein ſo ſhamefully both
falſified and forfeited their Truſt.</p>
            <p>But how ever (if God ſhall not ſee it good to vouchſafe that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to them and the Kingdom,) we ſhall, ſecondly, deſire, that ſo many
of them as God hath kept upright, and ſhall touch with a juſt ſence
of thoſe things, would by Proteſtation, or otherwiſe, acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from ſuch breach of Truſt, and approve their faithfulneſs by
withdrawing from thoſe that perſiſt in the guilt thereof, and would
apply themſelves to ſuch a poſture, whereby they may ſpeedily and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
proſecute thoſe neceſſary and publique ends, without ſuch
Interruptions, Diverſions, or Depravations of their Councels from the
reſt, to their endleſs trouble, oppreſſion and hazard of the Kingdom as
formerly, and for ſo many of them, whoſe hearts God ſhall ſtir up thus
to do; we ſhall therein, in this caſe of extremity, look upon them
as perſons having materially the chief Truſt of the Kingdom remaining
in them, and though not a formal ſtanding power to be continued
in them, or drawn into ordinary Preſidents; yet the beſt and moſt
rightful that can be had, as the preſent ſtate and exigence of Affairs
now ſtand; And we ſhall accordingly own them, adhere to them,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61445:4"/>
and be guided by them in their faithful proſecution of that Truſt, in
order unto, and until the introducing of a more full and formal power
in a juſt Repreſsntative to be ſpeedily endeavored.</p>
            <p>Now yet farther to take away all Jealouſies in relation to our ſelves,
which might withhold or diſcourage any honeſt Members from this
courſe, as we have the witneſs of God in our hearts, that in theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
we do not ſeek, but even reſolve we will nor take advantages
to our ſelves, either in point of Profit or Power; and that if God
did open to us a way, wherein with honeſty and faithfulneſs to the
publique Intereſt, and good people engaged for us, we might preſently
be diſcharged, ſo as we might not in our preſent Employments look
on, and be acceſſory to, yea ſupporters of the Parliament, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
corrupt, oppreſsive and deſtructive proceedings, we ſhould with
rejoycing, and without more ado, embrace ſuch a diſcharge, rather
then interpoſe in theſe things to our own vaſt trouble and hazard; ſo
if we could but obtain a rational aſſurance for the effectual proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theſe things, we ſhall give any proportionable aſſurance on our
parts, concerning, our laying down of Arms, when, and as we ſhould
be required: But for the preſent, as the caſe ſtands, we apprehend
our ſelves obliged in duty to God, this Kingdom, and good men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
to improve our utmoſt abilities in all honeſt ways, for the avoiding
of theſe great evils we have Remonſtrated, and for proſecution of the
good things we have propounded, and alſo that ſuch perſons who
were the Inviters of the late Invaſion from <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Inſtigaters
and Incouragers of the late Inſurrections within this Kingdom, and
(thoſe forcible ways failing) have ſtill purſued the ſame wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
by treacherous and corrupt Councels, may be brought to publique
Juſtice, according to their ſeveral demerits. For all theſe ends we are
now drawing up with the Army to <hi>London,</hi> there to follow Providence
as God ſhall clear our way.</p>
