         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Empreſſe of the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Citie of

truth of Chriſtian Doctrine, and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelfe above the Princes and Potentates of the earth,
ſtrives to extirpate Chriſts little ſtock, it being their fathers

and the cup of his judgements upon that place, which is
guiltie of ſo many fornications, idolatries, and bloud-ſhods,

about two of the clock in the after-noone, from that hill
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98866:3"/>
which was anciently called <hi>Mons Tarpeius</hi> on which
the Capitoll, the Temple, conſectated to all the Heathen
Gods, was ſometimes ſituated, and now the Church of Saint
<hi>Marie de Monte major.</hi> In which is probable are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as many idolatries as were perpetrated in the other, was
heard great and mournfull groanes, as if it had been of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
now departing this life; when on the ſudden, the aire
which was verie cleare and faire, the dayes in <hi>Italy</hi> being as
long in December as they are here in mid March; and the
great Luminarie of Heaven, the Sun, operating with as much
vigour, was moſt ſtupendiouſly darkened, lightning, fire and
ſmoke uſhering in a moſt hideous tempeſt of thunder, which
in thoſe parts is verie rare at that time of the yeare, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the thinneſſe and puritie of the aire, unſubject to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
which with dreadfull bolts, as if it had threatened diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
not onely to <hi>Rome,</hi> but to all the Nations of the
world; Heavens Canoniers diſcharging their fatall artillerie
on the mountaine, with ſuch ſpeed and violence, that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to rent (as it were) with an earth-quake, divers flames
of fire breaking forth with ſtrange eruptions out of the earth,
as if it would have conſumed the whole Citie: the people
in the meane time being in ſtrange and terrible amazements,
thinking the day of doome had been come: the Popes tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Crowne falling from his head for feare, as I am certainly
enformed, and the Conclave of Cardinals in mightie feare
and perplexitie, as it is conjectured; but that the Devill
was ſomething too great in them, would have repented
them of their ſins. For after the terrible flaſhes of lightning,
with thunder-claps, and the like hideous and fearfull ſounds,
which endured the ſpace of a full houre, the aire began to
cleare up, and the face of Heaven appeared as it were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with a cleare ſhining light, and the noyſe ſeaſed, and
a new one began, which was of a ſhrill ſounding Trumpet,
after which came flying in the aire from the North and from
the South, two dreadfull flaming Dragons of huge &amp; exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
forme: one of them appearing to hover over Caſtle Saint
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98866:3"/>
               <hi>Angelo,</hi> the Popes principall Citadell, and the other over
mount <hi>Tarpey.</hi> In the middle ſpace betweene which was
ſeene the reſemblance of a naked man, the priſe for which
(it ſhould ſeeme) theſe infernall Combatants came thither
to ſtrive for: and ſo with huge out-cries and ghaſtly grones,
which were plainly heard, the trumpets ſounding as it were
a charge, the two winged Devils made haſte to encounter
one another: the Dragon that came from the North, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to ſelfe upon the man with out-ſtretched wings and
Harpenian tallons; when preſently the other Dragon from
the South came in as it were either to the naked mans reſcue,
or elſe with more furie to devoure him: at laſt, after divers
hovering and dreadfull claſhings together with their ſcaly
wings, which ſounded a far off like dints of ſwords upon
ſteely Corflets, they furiouſly met, and like eager Faulkons,
or incenſed Eagles, endevoured to plume one another in
their rapinous tallons; the man all the while caſting forth
pitifull ſighs and heart breaking grones, as if he had ſeemed
to implore aſſiſtance from Heaven; and the teſtified ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatours,
who ſtood quaking with as much dread as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
frailtie can doe at ſuch unwonted ſpectacles. When
after two or three gyres in the aire (like angry Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets)
the Dragons ſeemed to all their viewes, juſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the head of the man, to cloſe together, then could
no man imagine the dreadfulneſſe of the combate, <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi>
Grey-hounds with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maſtives, Serpents with
Eagles, nay, two encountring ſhips at Sea, ſeeming to be
but modells of this conflict, ſometimes one Dragon, and
ſometimes the other having the better, and extending
their ſcaly mouths to devour that Phantome or Apparition
of a man that hung in the ayre betwixt them, and ſo joyning
together beake to beake, wing to wing, and body to body;
two cunning wraſtlers never gave greater demonſtration of
skill then theſe two Monſters by their imbraces, ſtriving
to overthrow, not to ſupport each other. At laſt, after at
leaſt halfe an houres fight in this ſtupendious manner which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98866:4"/>
ſtroke at the beholders with an extremity of feare and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Dragon that came from the North, in all mens view
ſeemed to have the better of the conflict, the other with
ſubtile and cunning turnes, as it were, rather to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
then offend his enemy, flying up and downe the empty
ayre, whileſt the other moſt violently purſued him: But as
you have ſeene in the races of horſes, wherein the one at the
beginning runs at an eaſie rate, whileſt the other is at his full
careere and ſwiftneſſe; yet at the end the horſe that kept
a ſober pace at the firſt, when the other is out of breath out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrips
him and gains the poſt, and with it victory: ſo as neer
as could be conjectured went the buſineſſe of the combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
theſe two Dragons; for the Dragon of the North
having by delayes and jugling manner of fight recovered
breath, as Rams that retire to come on with the greater
acrimony and fierceneſſe, moſt furiouſly returned to aſſault
the Dragon of the South, thundering upon his wings, which
flagg'd like ſailes when they want wind, and piercing his
body with his cruell gripes; the other caſt forth many a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
outcry bewailing, as it were, his miſchance, and
making ſuch a noyſe as ſouldiers doe that are vanquiſhed,
labouring with might and maine to diſingage himſelfe from
the gripes of his cruell adverſary, who ſtill laid on freſh load,
ſo that the poore Dragon of the South was in a moſt diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſtrait, and ſo ſtriving with all his diminiſhed forces, at
laſt he got out of the reaches and imbraces of the Dragon of
the North, and then like an ill-bred Hawke, in a cloud of
ſulphurous lighning, turned taile and fled, the Victor not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to purſue him, in an inſtant he was vaniſhed, leaving
behinde him ſuch an horrible ſtench as was enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the whole Region; the conquering Dragon in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim
giving forth many joyfull ſhouts from his divelliſh
throat, and inſulting triumphantly in his victory, made haſt
toward his incorporeall prey, the naked man, who was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
viſible, and as it ſeemed, ſenſible of his approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
ruine; for with dolorous clamours he gave forth ſuch
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98866:4"/>
skreekes as would have amazed the hardieſt man living,
and did ſo ſtupifie the auditors, that what betweene their
feares and the expectation of the novelty, were in an agony
and diſtraction; at laſt it was heard plainly to pronounce in
the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue, <hi>Roma, Roma, tua doctrina non ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Catholike, in which certainly that divell againſt his
naturall quality ſpoke truth. But to be briefe, this wretched,
or leaſt ſeeming wreched man, being now, as it were, in
the very jawes of death, the Dragon of the North being even
ready to ſwallow him up at a morſell, was heard in the ayre
a very loud ſound of d<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>s, neighing of horſes, and clangor
of trumpets, when forth of a cloud to the North-weſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
an army of aeriall ſouldiers in white garments, with
red croſſes in their front before them, and marched with
ſwift and furious approach toward the Dragon, ſome of them
ſhooting off Muſquets, which were plainly heard, the fire
ſmoaking in their pans, and the ſmell of the powder being
ſmelt below in the City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Dragon no whit amazed at the
multitude of a ailants, flew couragiouſly among the armed
ſquadrons, and dealt a very deathfull dole amongſt them, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
downe both horſe and man with his ſcaly and impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable
wings; ſo that divers of them were ſeene to drop
downe, as if they had falne into ſome other region of the
ayre, and ſo were no more: but the other ſouldiers coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
charging this cruell Dragon on all ſides, who vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up flames of fire and ſulphure, and at laſt with a hideous
and fearefull skreech, extending its ſcaly wings, and ſo fell
downe into the emptie regions of the ayre as the ſlaughtered
ſouldiers had done, and were ſeene no more, but left that
curſed and divelliſh ſmell behind him, that it ſeemed hell had
belched up all his vapours and infernall Lethean fogs, the
army of celeſtiall ſouldiers in the interim compaſſing the
poore ſhadow of a man about: and so in triumph with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
diſplayed, and Drums beating, departed with all the
ſignes of victory and triumph; immediatly the ayre began to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98866:5"/>
cleare, and the Sunne being juſt ready to ſet, it being then
about five of clocke (the dreadfull combat having indured
at leaſt two houres) diſplayed his cheerefull countenance,
and the Cardinalls and Senators of <hi>Rome</hi> going towards
their palacies in much amaze and affright diſcourſing of the
effect of this portent, and ſome of the Inhabitants of good
account going up to the top of mount <hi>Tarpey</hi> under the place
where the laſt battell was fought upon the Church-walls
and the Church-yard, they found diffuſed a great quantity of
blood, which lay there like water on the tops of the graſſe,
and this they made evident report of to his unholineſſe, who
made at it a mockery, and interpreted it according to his
own divelliſh fancie, that it portended the downfall of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,
ſuch as his Holineſſe termes all true believers, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
his heatheniſh Supremacy and Apoſtaticall tenents.</p>
