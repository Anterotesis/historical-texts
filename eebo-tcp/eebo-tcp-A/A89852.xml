            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Secret Shooting of the Wicked, reproved; Or, A word to the nameleſſe Publiſher of that he calls <hi>Strength in Weakneſſe, Or the burning Buſh.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>NOw is the living God viſiting his people, and gathering his ſeed out of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and hath called out his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and ſent them to theſe ſtrange Kings with his Meſſage, to bring out to light that which hath been kept in priſon, whereat <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is exceedingly troubled, and the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Poſts meet one another with this Cry, Our Kingdome is taken at one end, the Sea rages, and all that have treaſures in Ships are gathered to ſtand up for their God, and their King, to keep in bondage. But, from him that ſits upon the ſeat of iniquity, to the Magitians that uſe the inchantments to deceive withall; yea, and upon all that believe them; ſhall the hand of the Lord be, to make <hi>Babylon</hi> deſolate, and to daſh her Children againſt the ſtones which lie in the ſtreets thereof, which all the builders refuſe. This is the Lords doing, and woe to him that doth reſiſt him, who hath ſent his Word to ſtrange Nations, and to people of dark underſtandings, whether they will hear or forbear.</p>
            <p>And thou amongſt the reſt, who calls thy ſelf the publiſher of what I writ to <hi>James Nowell</hi>'s Wife, but conceales thy name, as one aſhamed of his viſion, ſaying, (in thy practice) Smite him ſecretly, as the backbiters and whiſperers of old ever did, ſtirring up prejudice in the minds of people, and making them evil affected againſt the truth, ſo doſt thou againſt the movings and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the living God in his ſervants, rendring them under the names of ſore Temptations, terrible Adverſaries, bitter Aſſaults of the enemy, and ſuch like corrupt words thou uſes to inform the Reader withall, before he read the Letters: and when thou haſt caſt out thy venome againſt the truth of the Lord, then thou covers thy ſelf with feigned words, ſaying, I leave it to the moſt wiſe and holy God to direct the wiſe in heart to conſider them: Oh thou full of all ſubtilty, was not God able to direct the wiſe without thy foreſtalling ſlanderous opinions? how haſt thou helped God, or any wiſe man herein? hadſt thou printed them both, and been ſilent, then thou hadſt left it to God indeed, and I ſhould have been ſilent alſo; haſt thou dealt moderately herein, or as thou would be done unto? ſhall not the leaſt of wiſe men Judge thee, and thy ſpirit? nay, haſt thou not helped on the Devils Kingdome with lies, as I ſhall bring no other witneſſe againſt thee herein, but her whom thou ſo highly Commends; for, ſayes thou, her temptations, afflictions, and conflict, was repeated and renewed ſo often as opportunity was given by her new viſiters; (which viſiters are theſe letters which thou haſt publiſhed) but ſaith ſhe, I am no way troubled at ſuch continued charges; Now how muſt this be divided betwixt you, ſeeing the one at leaſt muſt be the Liar, both in this and divers other things I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: but I delight not to rake into ſuch filth, onely I ſhall let thee ſee in a few words what a body of Confuſion is in this daughter thou art boaſting of; which ſhame might have been hid, had it not been for your glorying againſt the truth: and though to me both thou and ſhe is known without words; yet before others who yet judge things according to the outward appearance, I ſhall take but a word or two out of her own mouth, whereby her foundation might be diſcovered, to the leaſt of thoſe who know the Kingdom. She ſayes, ſhe knowes her ſelf aſſuredly to be in the Kingdom of God; yet ſtill kept groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Adoption: I ſay, the Kingdom of God conſiſts rot in groaning for Adoption, but in righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in that which is holy, and none are there but ſons who are adopted; no farther in the Kingdom then newborn, and ſelf denyed, though ſhe ſay her ſelf is in the Kingdome, which never came ſo far as a diſciple where ſelf is ſtanding, much leſſe not into the Kingdome. Further, ſhe confeſſes her own deceivings yet within her, unjudged, which are yet to try; and the yoke of ſinfull Covenant in her, yet unbroken; all which and much more may be taken from her own pen without wronging her, as her letters (by thee) publiſhed may witneſſe; yet withall this ſhe ſayes, She knowes her ſelf to be in the Kingdom of God, when it is no other but exalted into the Chambers of your own imaginary: for all who knowes the Kingdom of God can witneſſe againſt you, that no ſuch unclean ſtuffe comes there, no ſelf nor ſelf-deceivings; no ſin, nor ſinful Covenant comes there: all this is in the Kingdom of Satan, and not of God, never was: or ever ſhall be; bleſſed be God who hath condemned out all that filth and Confuſion, and all that lives in it, that he may keep his Kingdom pure, therefore do the Virgins love him: And had ſhe known the Kingdom of God in her, ſhe had never wondered how I durſt adventure to write to one vvhoſe face I had not ſeen, as ſhe doth in her paper; and (ſayes ſhe) conſider whether ever the Apoſtles or Prophets thou art like herein: I ſay, did not God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his ſervants to write his Meſſage to ſtrange Lands, and ſtrange perſons? and did he firſt ſend them to look upon their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to knovv what to write to them, or doth that adde to his Word? Oh ſhame with your blindneſſe herein; is God become as blind as you, who cannot judge but by carnal appearance, and will you limit him to your ſelves? that eye never ſavv? Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets nor Propheſies, Chriſt nor Apoſtles: but this is all you knovv of God or his Word, his Judgments and Kingdom, who are blindand deaf, as to the inviſible: and ſo the viſible and carnal Judges, judging God to be like your ſelves, imagines ſelf to be in the Kingdom; but the blind and deaf comes not there in that ſtate. Had God no other ſervants but ſuch as you, it might be long ere the obedience of Chriſt and his ſufferings ſhould be manifeſt in fleſh, for the gathering his ſeed into the light, as ever he did ſend them to ſtrange people who declared his Word to them whoſe faces they had not ſeen, to open their blind eyes, and ſo bring them out of darkneſſe into the Light to be ſeen, which to her is a wonder. And this is thy daughter thou boaſts on, and calls her a daughter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is a daughter of diſobedience, ſtrengthening her ſelf againſt the Word of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the inſtrument had not ſeen her face, reſiſting in her own will the tender of eternal love, and this thou calls <hi>Strength in weakneſſe,</hi> which is obſtinate wickedneſſe, and that both ſhe and thou muſt know, when you have finiſhed your meaſure; and of her blood I am clear for ever. And this is the buſh thou boaſts of which is not conſumed though fire be in it: I ſay, there is a time when the fire is in the buſh, and the buſh unconſumed; then is the ſeed of God in Egypt under <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Magitians, and in that ſtate death raignes from <hi>Adam</hi> till <hi>Moſes:</hi> Alſo there is a time when the light of Iſrael doth burn up the buſh, and devour the Briars and thorns in one day, then is that God known who is a conſuming fire to all that choakes his ſeed; go learn what this means, then ſhalt thou ſee whereof thou art glorying; and under that glory a fire ſhall be kindled. Who would ſet Briars and Thornes againſt me in battle; I will go through them and burn them together.</p>
            <p>Thy murmuring againſt the Northern people is come before the Lord; thus ſaith the Lord, I have raiſed one from the North, from the riſing of the Sun is he come, upon you as upon morter and clay; who declares from the beginning knowes him, and who is before time can ſay that he is righteous, but thou canſt not hear him nor declare him, who conſumes the buſhes, and makes plain before him, that he may plant in the Wilderneſſe, and make it a Land of ſprings, for the poor and needy to drink at, where ſhall come no more fear of Briars and Thorns, but the little ones ſhall feed ſafely; this, death, knowes not onely the fame you have got. Woe to you brambles and buſhes who tears the lambs on every ſide; <hi>Joſephs</hi> bough you know not, nor its fruit, (though you have got it to talk of) you are the fruit of the curſed ground, your end is at hand: yet a lamentation there is, (that doth not Change) for the ſeeds ſake,</p>
