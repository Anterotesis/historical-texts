         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This I muſt obſerve upon the differences
here taken, that 'tis not neceſſary to the
maintaining a real difference, to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, that none of theſe words were ever
uſed to ſignifie what is the natural ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the other: for Example, <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and <hi>Milites,</hi> are ſufficiently diſtinct
in their ſence; and yet when but one of
the words is uſed, either of them may,
and often does take in the other: But
when <hi>Barones, Milites, &amp;c.</hi> are ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the <hi>Barones</hi> are a Rank of men ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the ordinary <hi>Milites;</hi> 'tis enough
to prove that the differences above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
are rightly taken, if according to the
ſubject matter, and circumſtances, we can
clearly divide the one from the other.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee the words of the <hi>Charter,</hi>

Place at Court to come to the King's

ever it was known that a Council was to
meet, which might have been done by an

            <p>This ſhews very plainly that there were

thoſe that were to come to thoſe

was void, being contrary to the King's

for the parties then at Council to have

as appears by many Records of that
Age, that the King's Tenants only aſſented
to the Reſignation.</p>
            <p>Either way it reſolves into this, that a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105035:11"/>
               <hi>Council</hi> of the King's <hi>Tenants,</hi> was not a

            </p>
            <p>Indeed I meet with a MS. wrote I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

that nothing could be of Univerſal
Obligation, even in King <hi>John</hi>'s time, but
what was aſſented to as univerſally as
Laws were when he wrote) gives us King
<hi>John</hi>'s Charter of Reſignation in a very
full and complete form, as if it had been—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Per conſilium &amp; aſſenſum noſtrorum Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerum

               <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronum,
Militum, Liberorum hominum, &amp;
omnium fidelium noſtrorum:</hi> Whereby if
his Authority could ſtand in competition
with the <hi>Great Councils,</hi> he would remove
the Objection that had been long before
made, which was, that this <hi>Reſignation</hi>
made in the ordinary <hi>Curia,</hi> was not in a
<hi>Legal Repreſentative</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems that both the <hi>Parliament</hi> and
this Author were then ſatisfied that the
King's Feudal Peers or Tenants in Chief
could not make a <hi>Commune Conſilium Regni,</hi>
as a full Parliament in King <hi>John</hi>'s time.</p>
            <p>Beſides it is worthy of conſideration,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105035:11"/>
that if none but <hi>Tenants in Capite</hi> were of
the <hi>Common Council of the Kingdom</hi> at this
time, then all the Abbots, Priors, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Dignified Clergy, who held not of
the King in <hi>Chief,</hi> and yet were very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
together with the whole <hi>body</hi> of
the inferiour <hi>Clergy,</hi> were entirely exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from, and never admitted to this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Council</hi> any more than the reſt of the
Layty, from the time of <hi>William</hi> the Firſt,
to the forty ninth of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third.</p>
            <p>This I conceive is enough in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
that the King's Tenants could not
within the meaning of this Charter make
the <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>General Council of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
If it be ſaid that they made the
Common or ordinary Council for matters
of Tenure or ordinary Juſtice, I ſhall not
oppoſe it, in which ſenſe they might be
ſaid to be a <hi>Commune Conſilium Regni,</hi> but
that ſenſe cannot be here intended, becauſe
the words are <hi>Commune Conſilium de auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is
aſſidendis aliter quam, &amp;c. &amp; de ſcutagiis,
&amp;c.</hi> So that 'tis manifeſtly no more than a
<hi>Common Council</hi> for the aſſeſſing of <hi>Aids</hi>
and <hi>Eſcuage;</hi> and if I ſhew that the <hi>Aids</hi>
and <hi>Eſcuage</hi> concern'd the King's Tenants
only, then the <hi>Common Council</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
dwindles into a <hi>Common Council</hi> of
the King's <hi>Tenants</hi> for matters concerning
their Tenure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:105035:12"/>
If no inſtance can be ſhewn from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
or Hiſtory of <hi>Auxilia</hi> or Aids raiſed
by the Kings of <hi>England</hi> without more
general conſent, except ſuch as were raiſed
of his immediate <hi>Tenants;</hi> and thoſe caſes
wherein the King here reſerved to himſelf
a power of charging with Aid or Eſcuage
without conſent of a Common Council
concern'd his Tenants only, and more than
thoſe Tenants were parties or privies to
this Charter, it muſt needs be that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caſes wherein the conſent of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Council was requiſite, concerned Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
only, ſince only their conſent is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and they only ſtood in need of this
clauſe of the Charter.</p>
            <p>That two of the three above mentioned
(<hi>viz.</hi>) Aid to make the Eldeſt Son a
Knight, and to marry the Eldeſt Daughter
were incident to Tenure, appears by the
<hi>Stat. Weſt. 1. Cap.</hi> 36. which aſcertains the
Aid which before as that declares was not
reaſonable, and ſhews upon whom it lay
(<hi>viz.</hi>) Tenants by Knights Service and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage
Tenants, and there is no doubt, but if
the King might by Law have required
Aid, in thoſe two caſes he might have done
it, in the third for the redemption of his
own body, which was a ſervice a King of
<hi>England,</hi> eſpecially after the loſs of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
which often occaſioned the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

that there was no need to redreſs, by

            <p>Though the Statute here ſpoken of be

as to all others not mentioned. So

but Tenants by Knights Service and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage
are liable to theſe <hi>Auxilia.</hi> But over
and above theſe incidents, whether with
conſent of Tenants, or advice of other
Council, or meerly of their arbitrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Kings uſed to raiſe money upon their
Tenants, and theſe were called <hi>Auxilia,</hi>
which is the word uſed in this Charter of
King <hi>John,</hi> the leavy upon Tenants by
Knights Service was called Eſcuage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their <hi>Servitium Scuti,</hi> Service of
the Shield, that upon Tenants of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſns
in Common Socage, Tallage,
which is a word that might be of a large
extent, as it ſignifies a cutting off from the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105035:13"/>
Eſtate, but being it was never uſed as an
impoſition with pretence of Duty but upon
his Tenants, and that which was raiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Tenants by Knights Service had its
proper name, therefore this has generally
been applied to the payments of Socage
Tenants, either as ordinary Services, that is,
upon the ordinary occaſions wherein 'twas
of courſe raiſed by the King, or upon
extraordinary occaſions and neceſſities,
which required advice.</p>
            <p>Yet as an exaction or unjuſt payment
it has been taken in the largeſt ſence
to reach to all Tenants and others; as

            <p>Purſuant to this the very ſame year is

               <note place="margin">Rot. Clauſ. 34 Ed. 1. M. 16. dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</note> ſays the Record, and yet he had tied
up his hands from raiſing it without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of Parliament.</p>
            <p>However King <hi>John</hi> had in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
redreſſed their grievance, giving them
aſſurance that there ſhould always be the
general conſent of Tenants for what was
not payable of right and cuſtom, without
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105035:16"/>
any conſent of theirs,<note place="margin">25 <hi>Ed. 1. cap.</hi> 6. In this part declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Law, as by King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter.</note> and for the aſſeſſing
thoſe ſums to which conſent was made
neceſſary, there ſhould be a convenient
notice that none might complain of the
injuſtice of the charge.</p>
            <p>But all theſe things ſo manifeſtly relate
to <hi>Tenure,</hi> both the caſes excepted and the
caſes provided for, that no other <hi>ſenſe</hi> can
be <hi>tolerable,</hi> for where the King reſerves
three incidents to Tenure, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
within the proviſion are appendant to
Tenure, and none but Tenants are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
ſhall we believe that ſomething For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
is intended by the very ſame words?
though we may well believe that all Aids
whatever were intended by the Statute of
<hi>Edw.</hi> 1. becauſe the conſent of all People;
Tenants, and others is required.</p>
            <p>Thus far I think I am warranted by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good Authorities; I take leave to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
farther, that it ſhould ſeem that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Charter the King might have
charged his geldable or talliable Lands,
that is, thoſe Lands which were held of his
Demeaſn in Socage at his own diſcretion,
but could not charge them that held by
Knights Service without their conſent, and
ſo this part take it, barely to the conſenting
is for the advantage and relief of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage
Tenants only. The Charter of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105035:17"/>
by Knights Service, <hi>ab omnibus geldis,</hi>
that is, tribute or forced payments beyond
ordinary Services, leaves the King a Power
of charging his other Tenants by meaner
Services, though not thoſe which held
by Serjeanty, <hi>pro omni ſervitio.</hi>

their Perſonal Services; for the firſt there
could not be any time of ſummons or place

priviledge, the adminiſtration of Juſtice
being within the King's Ordinary Power,

            <p>That the <hi>Curia Regis</hi> then conſiſted not
of the King's Tenants <hi>only:</hi> I could ſhew
more particularly by a diſcourſe of the
Feudal Law, and of what prevalence it
was here before the Normans time: But
I think there is enough to this purpoſe
here from one Piece of Antiquity, which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105035:18"/>
ſhews what in Ancient time made a <hi>Churl</hi>
or <hi>Peſant</hi> become a <hi>Theyn</hi> or <hi>Noble,</hi> and
that ſo Anciently, that in a Saxon MS.
ſuppoſed to be wrote in the Saxon time, it
is ſpoke of as antiquated.</p>
            <p>That was five hides of his own Land, a
Church and a Kitchin, a Bell-houſe and a
Burrough-gate, with a Seat and any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Office in the Kings Court. This
Churle is in an Ancient MS. cited by Mr.
<hi>Selden</hi> called <hi>Villanus;</hi> ſo that if a man
were not Free-born if he could make ſuch
an acquiſition he became <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> a <hi>Thane,</hi>
a <hi>Free-man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thani autem appellatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, viri in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionis homines,</hi> in terdum Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, atque ſaepenumerò miniſtri notantur, Gloſ. ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Lamb.

a <hi>Thane</hi> or <hi>Free-man,</hi> ſo a <hi>Thane</hi> or <hi>Freeman</hi>
had a place in the Great Court, as we ſee
<hi>Edgar</hi>'s <hi>Curia</hi> had all the <hi>Majores totius
Regni,</hi> without any qualification from Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure.
But this is to be obſerved that this
being ſpoke of as antiquated, and that the
People and Laws were in reputation when
this was the uſage, there is a ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
from hence, that ſince that time
a leſs matter than five hides of Land,<note place="margin">Vide Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel<hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of</hi> England, p. 97,</note> a

the People, the Nobles of leſs reputation.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105035:18"/>
The Normans followed not only the Lane
but the decent Cuſtoms and Ceremonies
of the former Government, though not
directly yet by way of reſemblance.</p>
            <p>And whereas the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>Upon theſe Writs many uſeful things
might be obſerved, but I will confine my
ſelf as nigh as I can to my purpoſe.</p>
            <p>From them as interpreted by equal
authority of Hiſtory it appears, that <hi>Wil.</hi>
the firſt us'd to commiſſionate ſeveral of
his <hi>Barons.</hi> I will not oppoſe their being
his great <hi>Tenants</hi> in <hi>Chief,</hi> theſe were to
preſide in the Tryals of matters within
ordinary Juſtice, which were to be try'd
in the ſeveral Counties where the queſtion
aroſe, ſometimes in one County, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in ſeveral together as the men of the
ſeveral Counties, that is, the ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were united.</p>
            <p>Sometimes theſe great Men, ſometimes
the Sheriffs were to Summon the Parties,
and to take care that an Inqueſt of the
County or Counties concern'd be impan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell'd,
in the Counties, that is, by the choice
of the <hi>Freeholders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kings Commiſſioners were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Judgment in the Kings Name
or ſtead: So the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtance</hi> did

The Inqueſt upon their Oaths found
the matter of Fact, the <hi>Judges</hi> ſtated it
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105035:24"/>
to the people, and delivered their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
to which the <hi>Primores &amp; probi homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>

this agrees with what <hi>Bracton</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But it may be objected that the Kings
Writ is to the Great Men to do Juſtice,
to which the Books give an anſwer that
the Kings Writ does not change the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Juriſdiction of a Court, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though a Writ of Right or a <hi>Juſtities</hi>
be directed to the Sheriff,<note place="margin">Cook. 6. Rep. fo. 11. a. &amp; b.</note> yet the Suitors

            <p>And what their Juriſdiction was in the
time of <hi>Wil.</hi> the firſt,<note place="margin">Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans caſe.</note> is to be gathered
from what continued to the Freeholders or
Suitors of the County Court of <hi>Cheſter</hi>

accordingly.</p>
            <p>The Parties Aſſembled at the Council

            <p>The Teſtimony of <hi>Eadmerus</hi> concerning

to a Great Council as I take it in this

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:105035:37"/>

or were members of the ordinary

ſaid to be added, were more than the

Court to which they were added was only
the ordinary Court of Juſtice. If we can

determin'd, and who ſucceeded into the
places of the ordinary members of it, we
may go farther to clear the matter in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than perhaps has yet been done. If the
Lords the great men, ſucceeded the
Court of Tenants, and were let into that
juriſdiction which they exerciſed, and
there is no colour of proof that Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the <hi>Curia Regis</hi> ever voted in
Capital cauſes, but if on the other ſide,
(the prohibitions running againſt <hi>judicia
ſanguinis,</hi> and the conſtitution of <hi>Clarendon</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:105035:39"/>
referring to the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> where the

to be excluded the <hi>Curia, quando de

that the Biſhops, as a part of the houſe
of Lords, anſwering to the Court of the
Kings tenants, never had any right to vote
in Capital caſes.</p>
            <p>But it lyes upon me here to ſhew when
and how the <hi>Curia Regis</hi> went off.</p>
            <p>I have before obſerved that the duty
of Tenants was either to attend the King
in his Wars, in his adminiſtration of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
juſtice, or as a Council to give
him aid in lieu of, or by way of advance
upon their perſonal ſervices in the
Wars.</p>
            <p>As they attended in the Wars they
could not be a Court or Council, and ſo no
<hi>Curia Regis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a Court of juſtice, their attendance
was ſuperſeded by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> 2, or 9 of
<hi>Hen.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Communia placita non ſequantur Curiam
noſtram ſed teneantur in aliquo loco certo.<note place="margin">Magna Charta, cap. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby the adminiſtration of juſtice was
taken from the ordinary <hi>Curia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by <hi>Articuli ſuper chart.</hi>
               </note> and fix'd
at the Courts in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-hall.</p>
            <p>Yet after this they continued a Court,
or Council for aids till the 34th of <hi>Edw.</hi>

the firſt,<note place="margin">Stat. 34 Ed. 1. De tallagio non conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo.</note> and by that they were wholly
gone as a ſeparate Court, or Council; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from that time no tax nor aid could be
raiſed without full conſent of the great
Council, or <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this Court was gone, as before I
obſerved, we find Tenants in chief plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that their coming to the Great Court
or Parliament was <hi>pro omni ſervitio,</hi> which
ſhews manifeſtly, that the Great Court
not only took in the leſs, as it did in the
nature of the thing, being that and more;
but that it preſerved the Image of it; and
indeed what was a duty in them that came
to, or were members of the ordinary <hi>Curia,</hi>
turn'd to a priviledge or right in them
who ſucceeded to the dignity, though not
the ſervices of Tenants.</p>
            <p>As the Tenants were obliged by their
Tenure <hi>intereſſe judiciis Curiae Regis,</hi> they
that ſucceeded to their dignity had right
to be Judges in <hi>Parliament.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> as a Court of Juſtice
was taken away or defeated in the time
of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. we find by <hi>Britton,</hi> ſuppos'd

            </p>
            <p>Here this <hi>Judicium vitae &amp; membrorum</hi>
muſt be meant of the whole tryal, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
otherwiſe it is ſuppoſed, that he
tells us, the King granted thoſe men Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to pronounce, or depute thoſe that
ſhould pronounce, the final Judgment,
who yet neither by themſelves, nor Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
had any thing to do with the praelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,
the queſtions ariſing between, and
leading to the Juſtice of the Judgement,
which is an abſurd ſuppoſal.</p>
            <p>The having <hi>Judicium,</hi> or power <hi>in judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi>
does not, as I conceive, any way <hi>ſuppoſe
a tryal already begun,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Grand Queſtion, <hi>p.</hi> 34.</note> 
               <hi>and the Biſhops preſent
ſo far in it; but when it comes to the point of
mutilation or death, then they have leave
to withdraw;</hi> that is, they are a Court, or
of the Court, for ſuch a cauſe, and yet they
are not a Court for ſuch a cauſe; for the
cognizance of cauſes takes in the <hi>Judicium,</hi>
the tryal, in the agitation, <hi>Agitare judicium,</hi>
and in the final or ſolemn pronouncing of
the Judgement. It is indeed poſſible, though
not rational, that the law ſhould give the
Juriſdiction over part of a Cauſe, and not
the whole, yet 'tis not to be imagined that
ſuch was the meaning of the Law-makers,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:105035:41"/>
eſpecially, when we find the words of the
law, according to the ſenſe put upon thoſe
words, by the moſt learn'd, in the age
nigheſt to them that tranſmit the law to
us, are not to be brought to ſuch a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſenſe without a great deal of force:
And to this the ſeveral other copies of this
conſtitution give weight.<note place="margin">Grand queſt. <hi>p.</hi> 34.</note> But we are told
that <hi>the ſenſe is beſt underſtood by the practice
of that age.</hi> If the ſenſe be plain, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
practice is not to determine the ſenſe
another way, as, as great an Author, the
learned Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> proves at large
in his anſwer to Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi>'s Epiſtle Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical,<note place="margin">Still. <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to</hi> Creſſy, à p. 339. ad p. 447. p. 449.</note>
where he ſhews the number of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes

although ſo often repeated;</hi> nor did
common practice agree with the poſitive
and plain law.</p>
            <p>But the teſtimony of <hi>Petrus Bleſenſis</hi>
brought to prove the practice in the time
of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. I could ſet aſide with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the laſt of which, in common acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
relates to the Laity; and for their
withdrawing juſt at the final judgement,
ſurely there could be no pretence from
the <hi>practice of that age.</hi> But let's take his
authority,<note place="margin">Grand queſt. <hi>p.</hi> 34.</note> and make the beſt of it. <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes
Sacerdotum &amp; ſeniores populi licet non

            </p>
            <p>Here he expreſsly confirms the ſenſe,
which I ſhall enforce, and makes the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

            </p>
            <p>Some Clergy-men it ſeems did thus <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernere
judicium ſanguinis,</hi> and he blames
them for it, but can their practice of any
thing againſt law be an Argument that
there was no law againſt ſuch practice?
And beſides this being brought to ſhew
the meaning of the conſtitution of <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
which ſpeaks only of the <hi>Curia Regis;</hi>
this has no colour of a proof, becauſe they
might have handled ſuch matters in their
own Courts, where the King gave them
<hi>judicium vitae &amp; membrorum,</hi> as <hi>Bracton</hi> has

            <p>One of the Editions of <hi>Bleſenſis</hi> has but
<hi>quidam,</hi> ſome of them only could diſpenſe
with the obligation; of what nature the
obligation was, I ſhall ſoon ſhew, and will
uſher it in with the judgement of Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
who was beſt acquainted with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
copies of this conſtitution, and with
thoſe laws which were the ground of it,
perhaps of any man ſince the making the
conſtitution.<note place="margin">Titles of Honour, <hi>fo.</hi> 582.</note> 
               <hi>The meaning of it is,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>that all Biſhops, Abbots, Priors, and the like,
that held in Chief of the King had their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
as Baronies, and were accordingly to do
all ſervices, and to ſit in judgement with the
reſt of the Barons in all caſes, ſaving caſes of
blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The exceptions of caſes of blood proceeded
from the Canon Laws which prohibited Clergy-men
to aſſent to ſuch judgements.<note place="margin">So of <hi>Gloceſt.</hi> Bote war man ſhall be <hi>belemed</hi> other to <hi>deth ido. Jani An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies altera, p.</hi> 100.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>But we are told,</hi> that <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. in the
Parliament at <hi>Northampton</hi> declar'd, that
Biſhops were bound by virtue of the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Clarendon</hi> to be preſent, and to give their
Votes in caſes of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>That this was only a <hi>Curia Regis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Grand queſt. <hi>p.</hi> 40.</note> no
Parliament, I have ſhewn.</p>
            <p>That it ſhould be affirmed that the King
then preſs'd the Biſhops to give their Votes
in a Capital caſe, (as the Author ſuppoſes
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:105035:43"/>
every <hi>crimen laeſae Majeſtatis</hi> then to have
been) I wonder, becauſe 'tis apparent from
the circumſtances that the King preſt for
a final judgement, and therefore could not
urge that as the duty of their tenure, when
even according to this learned man, the
Canons prohibited their pronouncing final
ſentence,<note place="margin">P. 28.</note> and the King at <hi>Clarendon, out
of regard and reverence to the Canons of the
Church,</hi> requir'd only that they ſhould <hi>act
in ſuch cauſes, till the cauſe was ripe for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi>
not that they ſhould ſtay at the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
that <hi>point</hi> he <hi>was content to yield
them;</hi> and he himſelf ſhews us out of <hi>Fitz-Stephen,</hi>
that the Biſhops look'd not on the
matter as Capital, for they did not urge the
Canons in the caſe; but <hi>they excus'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon the account of the Arch-Biſhops
prohibition.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Grand queſt. <hi>p.</hi> 40.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>the King reply'd, that (viz.</hi> that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition)
<hi>had no force againſt the Conſtitution
of</hi> Clarendon,<note place="margin">Ejus ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitio. Steph. <hi>MS.</hi>
               </note> which was in effect to ſay,
you have no manner of pretence, no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
forbidding you to paſs judgement upon
<hi>Becket,</hi> and therefore according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> you ought <hi>intereſſe
judiciis Curiae Regis</hi> at this time.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the plain ſenſe of all
this, we find a very artificial management
of <hi>Fitz-Stephens,</hi> and other authorities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:105035:43"/>
1. As if <hi>Becket</hi> were accus'd of a Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
matter, it being call'd <hi>Crimen laeſae Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtatis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. As if the crime he was accus'd of was
appealing to <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Grand queſt. <hi>p.</hi> 40.</note> and that ſuch appeal
was <hi>treaſon by the ancient Common law before
any Statutes made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I will readily grant that in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of that age <hi>Becket</hi> was accus'd or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach'd
of <hi>Crimen laeſae Majeſtatis,</hi> but that all
<hi>Crimina laeſae Majeſtatis</hi> were then capital,
<hi>Glanvile,</hi> who was Chief Juſtice in that
Kings reign,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Glanvile</hi> de legibus lib. 1. c. 2.</note> denies. <hi>Crimen quod in legibus

every breach of the laws by Acts
of injuſtice is a breach of his peace, <hi>contra
pacem &amp; Coronam;</hi> therefore <hi>Becket</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
denied juſtice to <hi>John</hi> the Marſhal,
and refuſing to anſwer the King who
charg'd him in account, eſpecially ſtanding
in contempt of the Kings Court, was guilty
of this crime. Indeed <hi>Glanvile</hi> when he has
named Homicide, malicious firings, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
crimes, adds <hi>Et ſiquae ſunt ſimilia;</hi> quae
ſcilicet crimina ultimo puniuntur ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,
aut membrorum truncatione. As if no
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:105035:44"/>
crimes were within this name, but thoſe
which drew after them capital puniſhment,
but that is certainly to be meant of ſuch as
are not there ſpecified: that is, all ſuch like
crimes, provided they are capital in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
annext by law, are <hi>Crimina laeſae
Majeſtatis,</hi> though neither homicide, nor
firing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor any direct and open breach
of the peace.</p>
            <p>'Tis evident that he confines not <hi>placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta

that follow;<note place="margin">

            <p>But it appears from <hi>Fitz-Stephen,</hi> that
<hi>Becket</hi> was not impeach'd for appealing to
<hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stephani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. <hi>So</hi> Gerv. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rob. f. 1389.</note> even upon his ſecond Impeachment,

to which he pleads, that the King remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

that he then was <hi>quietus &amp; ſolutus ab omni

            </p>
            <p>But further, that he was called only to
anſwer in the cauſe of <hi>John</hi> the Marſhal,
in which he complained that he had had

the <hi>Proceres</hi> to proceed to judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, he finding them ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>What is here like the pretence of his
being accuſed in a capital matter, and the
Kings urging the Biſhops to judge him
notwithſtanding a capital accuſation? Nay
further, admit that he had been impeach'd
of appealing to <hi>Rome</hi> (which 'tis evident
both from <hi>Fitz-Stephen</hi> and <hi>Gervaſe</hi> that
he was not) I queſtion whether it had
been capital then, or whether the Lord
<hi>Cook</hi> ſays that <hi>ſuch an owning of the Popes

               <note place="margin">Grand Queſtion, <hi>p.</hi> 40.</note> 
               <hi>by the ancient Common

where 'tis reſolv'd that a ſubjects bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:105035:45"/>
ancient Common Law of <hi>England</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Now this publiſhing a Bull of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
and thereby aſſuming
the exerciſe of juſtice without the Kings
authority, is certainly a much greater of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
againſt the Kings Crown and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than barely the appeal: however ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might have been <hi>Crimina laeſae Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtatis,</hi>
againſt the Crown and Royal

            <p>But this is further obſervable that the

            <p>This is of cauſes begun in eccleſiaſtical
Courts, theſe were not to go further than
the Archbiſhops Court, that is, not to the
Pope without the Kings licence; now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
an appeal had been before the Pope
with the Kings licence, yet it might have
been <hi>Crimen laeſae Majeſtatis,</hi> to put the
Popes ſentence in execution without new
licence had: but where a matter lay not in
theſe inferiour Courts, as <hi>Becket</hi>'s did not,
whether the appealing in ſuch a caſe had
been againſt the Law then, I make a doubt, I
am ſure it is not prov'd at leaſt, that 'twas
capital. I know not of any greater penalty
than a <hi>Premunire</hi> ever annext to it, till
the Reformation. But if it were capital
from the beginning, 'twould not be any
thing to the purpoſe here, becauſe <hi>Becket</hi>
was not impeacht for appealing.</p>
            <p>I cannot but charge this Author with a
great deal of artifice in this place, and of
much labour to reconcile things, as I ſhould
think, very diſagreeing: he tells us that
according to <hi>Fitz-Stephen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 35.</note> 
               <hi>Becket was accus'd
of Treaſon, and the Biſhops ſate together with
other Barons, and becauſe it did not come to a
Sentence of death, after a great debate between
the other Lords and Biſhops about pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:105035:46"/>
the ſentence, the Biſhop of</hi> Wincheſter
<hi>did it:</hi> here he jumbles together, what in
another place he rightly divides, he takes it
right that there were Two cauſes, the one
that of <hi>John</hi> the Marſhal, the other that
which he would make capital; in the firſt,
the Biſhops did certainly ſit in judgement,
there the Biſhop of <hi>Winch.</hi> pronounc'd the
ſentence; as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (who this Author
confeſſes has <hi>printed the proceedings of this
judgement very exactly</hi>) ſhews out of <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Grand Queſtion, <hi>p.</hi> 38.</note>
for this our Author do's not pretend
that <hi>Becket</hi> was accus'd of Treaſon, and yet
he ſays that <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Winch. <hi>gave ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi>
where he was <hi>accus'd</hi> of <hi>Treaſon;</hi>
nay, though his own Author <hi>Stephanides</hi>
is expreſs, that upon the ſecond charge,
which contain'd the ſuppos'd capital
matter, the Biſhops withdrew, <hi>&amp; quidam
Vicecomites &amp; Barones ſecundae dignitatis</hi>
were taken into the Court.</p>
            <p>Thus I think I have ſhewn that the King
did not declare at <hi>Northampton, that the
Biſhops were bound by virtue of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of</hi> Clarendon <hi>to be preſent and to give
their votes in caſes of Treaſon,</hi> (as ſuch were
capital) but rather it not being a Capital
caſe upon which the King demanded
judgement, that therefore the Biſhops
were by that Conſtitution oblig'd to be
there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:105035:46"/>
Admitting that this conſtitution is no
law prohibiting Clergy-men to Vote in
Capitals, only obliging them to the duty
of their tenure; and leaving them to act
in matters of blood, according as they
thought themſelves bound by the Canons:
Yet I think herein it appears that thoſe
Canons were received by the temporalty,
and ſo became laws.</p>
            <p>But not to inſiſt upon this, the queſtion
here is,</p>
            <p>1. Firſt, What the Canon law prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>
            <p>2. What force that prohibition has at
this day.</p>
            <p>1. The Author of the Grand Queſtion
has I conceive miſrepreſented the ſenſe of
<hi>Lanfranc</hi>'s Canon concerning this matter,
which he has render'd thus:</p>
            <p>

the cavil which many make upon ſome

            <p>Now can we think the wiſe Council of
<hi>Toledo</hi> underſtood ſenſe ſo little to declare,
that Clergy-men ought not to debate
about, or try ſuch cauſes, and therefore
ſhould prohibit only the final judgement?
nay 'tis very clear that they, agreeably to
the maxim they receive, forbid them <hi>quod
morte plectendumeſt ſententiâ propriâ judicare,</hi>
to judge of, or try the matter, or cauſe in
their own perſons; not but that where the
King gave them <hi>judicium vitae &amp; membro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
as we find in <hi>Linwood,</hi> they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate
authority to others to judge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
breach at leaſt of after Canons. But
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:105035:47"/>
this of <hi>Toledo</hi> I conceive wholly ſhuts them
out from the cauſe, or tryal of it. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this very Author, this Canon
of <hi>Toledo</hi> is to be taken as explanatory of
<hi>Lanfranc</hi>'s, which is much ſhorter, and
leſs expreſs; yet comes to the ſame, in the
ſignification of the words, as well as in
the intention of the Council,<note place="margin">Grand Queſtion, <hi>p.</hi> 27.</note> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the above-cited Canon of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo.</hi>

were not to judge themſelves; nor ſit by,

Judicium ſanguinis agitare non licet,</hi> ſurely
comes up to the preliminaries, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
underſtand the coherence of ſaying to
this effect.</p>
            <p>It is a received Maxime that Clergy-men
ought not ſo much as to vote in preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarys,
relating to capital caſes; and
therefore to give the final Judgement is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unlawful by the Canon, which declares
that to vote, even in preliminarys, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond's time, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
underſtood not this nice reaſoning,
and therefore they enter their formal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation

            <p>'Twas not ſo much becauſe 'twas in
Parliament, as becauſe matter of Blood
was in queſtion. And indeed the Canons
mentioning <hi>Judicia Sanguinis,</hi> that is Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Judgements, ſuch as were agitated in
the Kings Ordinary Court of Juſtice, and
the conſtitution of <hi>Clarendon</hi> referring on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to that Court, it appears that theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
were received in Parliament in
the Reign of <hi>Edw.</hi> the firſt.</p>
            <p>When the King ty'd up his hands from
giving Clergy-men Power, even ſo much
as by his ſpecial Commiſſions, to ſit upon
the tryals of ſuch cauſes.<note place="margin">28 Ed. 1. cap. 3.</note> We for the Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of our Realm and for the more aſſured
conſervation of our peace have provided
and ordained that Juſtices aſſigned to take
Aſſizes in every County, where they do
take as they be appointed Aſſizes, inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
after the Aſſizes taken in the Shires,
ſhall remain both together <hi>if they be Lay.</hi>
And if <hi>one of them be a Clerk, then one of the
moſt diſcreet Knights of the Shire being Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
to him that is a Lay-man, by our Writ
ſhall deliver the Gaoles of the Shires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby it appears that if one of the
Judges were a Clergy-man, he was not ſo
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:105035:49"/>
much as to ſit with the other upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of the Gaol; that is the tryal of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Cauſes; but another Lay-man
ſhould be commiſſion'd for that purpoſe.
And agreeable to this we find in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of the <hi>Tower,</hi> that when two have
been Commiſſioned as Judges for the
ſame Circuit, whereof one has been a
Clergy-man the other Lay, the Clergy-man
has had only <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> in his

I take leave to offer farther, what as I
conceive may give yet clearer ſatisfaction;
which is, that the difference of an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical

preſent in either, but the matters of which
they treated, and the parties which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged

ſeems to have been as general as
the ſummons; but there is a ſhrewd cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
to induce the belief that many

till neceſſity preſs'd them, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he would never have been terrified
into a diſhonourable peace, the parting
with all his right of patronage to the Pope,

            <p>But that this was not a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of the Nation appears by the Statute
of Proviſors which declares that the
Popes aſſuming the <hi>jus patronatus</hi> was an
incroachment,<note place="margin">Stat. 25 Ed. 3.</note> that is uſurpation, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
act, which it would not have been,
if the <hi>Comites, Barones,</hi> and <hi>turba multa ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi>
that unanimouſly agreed to thoſe
ſhameful terms which King <hi>John</hi> yielded,
had been enough to conſtitute a full repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
of the Nation.</p>
            <p>If they had been call'd to Council not
to fight, then indeed upon knowledge that
matters of general obligation were to be
ſettled, though but few had come, they
would have concluded the reſt.</p>
            <p>The Army as it was computed were
about 60000,<note place="margin">Pryn<hi>'s King</hi> John, f. 269.</note> but that being made up of
Servants, Villains and all manner of people,
'tis not to be ſuppoſed that there were
there nigh the half of the proprietors,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:105035:59"/>
which muſt have been preſent, to make
any thing of general obligation without
notice of its being ſo intended.</p>
            <p>Of the ſame nature with this, was that
ſhameful reſignation of the Crown before
mentioned near <hi>Dover,</hi> whereas the firſt

out of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This year there was a <hi>Great Council</hi>
at St. <hi>Albans</hi> where were all the <hi>Magnates

Upon this part 'tis obſervable, that
there had been a general notice or Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the time when he would have
thoſe that ow'd him Military Service to
attend with their Armes, but the place
was not named, for they were to follow
him whereever he would have his Court,
and therefore herein was an apparent
Grievance in ſome meaſure redreſs'd by
his <hi>Charter</hi> Two years after in aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the place of Meeting to Conſult of
Aids and Eſcuage; but beſides theſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,

            </p>
            <p>Thus much I take to be clear from it,
that here was an union of the Ordinary
<hi>Curia Regis,</hi> the Court of the King's Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Tenants, who were to attend with
their Armes, and of peaceable Senators,
in a great Council. If the <hi>Barones</hi> of
whom the Sheriff was to take ſpecial care
were only ſuch as were <hi>Barons</hi> by <hi>tenure,</hi>
'tis not ſuppoſable, that contrary to the
Obligation of their tenure, they ſhould be
ordered to come unarmed, whil'ſt only
their Tenants, or at leaſt Inferiour Tenants
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:105035:60"/>
to the King had their Swords in their
hands; wherefore <hi>Barones</hi> here muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the moſt large and comprehenſive
ſenſe. But this is farther obſervable, that
where the Summons was General to all the
Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Priors,
Earles, Barons, Knights and Free-holders,
yet there has been a ſpecial Inqueſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
or taken out of the Generality, as
in the Summons to attend the Juſtices in

repreſent it at Parliament, which has no

of the Counties, only the preſenters
and methodizers of that buſineſs, to which
the Great Council gave their Aſſent or

            <p>From this time to the Great Aſſembly at
<hi>Rumny Mead,</hi> I find neither a Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:105035:60"/>
nor <hi>Curia</hi> mentioned, that to be ſure
was of more than the King's Tenants, as I
have already ſhewn; I ſhall only obſerve
farther, that it conſiſted of that Army
which was got together on both ſides.
On the peoples ſide was a very great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

Villarum &amp; Civitatum;</hi> and after this, they
had a great acceſſion, by gaining the whole
City of <hi>London,</hi> and all that were neutral
before, and even moſt of thoſe that had
kept along with the King: upon this the
King condeſcends to treat, the place is
agreed upon, and accordingly <hi>convenerunt
ad colloquium Rex &amp; Magnates,</hi> who theſe
were the Record tells us, and the Aſſembly
was as General as the Conceſſion on the

            </p>
            <p>Even this was a <hi>Curia Regis</hi> in a large
ſenſe, but not the <hi>ordinary Curia;</hi> and
though 'twere the <hi>Common Council</hi> of
the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as 'twas the Aſſembly of
the whole Community, yet not the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Common Council, for that might
be, and I need not ſcruple to ſay that it
was, of the King's Tenants and Officers,
which in that ſenſe, and to the purpoſes
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:105035:61"/>
for which of courſe it met, was the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
concilium regni,</hi> yet like the Kings
ordinary Privy Council, or his Courts of
Juſtice long ſince ſettled at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall,
they could exerciſe no act of legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that the charging Tenants
with more than was due of cuſtom were
ſuch an Act, by the ſame reaſon the power
of making By-laws would argue a legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power, and there would be a little Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in every Village.</p>
            <p>Without re-examining particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
I conceive 'tis obvious, that admit
the ordinary <hi>Curia Regis</hi> at any time exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
a power peculiar to the <hi>Great Council,</hi>
of which I dare boldly ſay there are very
rare if any inſtances, ſuch that it can be
affirm'd with certainty this was an <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Curia,</hi> without a more ſolemn conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Summons; yet in irregular times
many of them would not make one legal
Preſident, eſpecially againſt ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
and confirmations of the antient
laws, and free cuſtomes, as Princes either to
obtain, or aſſure the Crown to them ſwore
ſolemnly, inviolably to obſerve and keep.</p>
            <p>If ſometimes the marks of diſtinction
between the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> and the <hi>Great
Council</hi> are not clearly apparent, in that
the <hi>Curia</hi> only might be ſummon'd <hi>ad col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquium,</hi>
and in that ſenſe might be ſtyl'd
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:105035:61"/>
               <hi>Parliamentum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pat. 4 Ed. 1. m. 14.</note> though not <hi>Generale Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amentum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In primo generali Parl. noſtro poſt Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem.</note>
and the <hi>Generale Parliamentum</hi>
might be, as indeed it alwayes was, <hi>Curia
Regis,</hi> though not the <hi>Curia de more:</hi> Yet
the certain difference is upon particular
inſtances, where the full circumſtances
are ſet down, alwayes to be known. As
the ordinary <hi>Curia</hi> conſiſted of the Kings
Tenants, and Officers; and there appears
no grievance worth publick notice to have
lain on the laſt, nor on the firſt, as to their
attendance at the Wars, or as a Court of
Juſtice, the remedy was properly apply'd
by King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter, to that wherein
they were uneaſie, which was the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
about the matters relating <hi>ad ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
to their <hi>ſervices,</hi> without convenient
notice for time, or for the occaſion; ſo
that they might think it was only for
matters of ordinary juſtice, which might
go on well enough without them, when it
was really to charge them in their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
by ſuch as ſhould appear, by deſign
and contrivance, which was a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
            <p>Wherefore for this the redreſs was,</p>
            <p>1. That they ſhould have forty dayes
notice.<note place="margin">Charta Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannis.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. That the time, place and occaſion of
meeting ſhould be aſcertained.</p>
            <p>And then they that were there were
juſtly concluded by the reſt, and had no
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:105035:62"/>
reaſon to complain of the charge.</p>
            <p>Thus I conceive, I have given a rational
account of this <hi>Charter,</hi> and I queſtion
whether upon other grounds any man can
reconcile it with the Records and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
both before and ſince the Charter
till the 49 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. when 'tis ſuppoſed
that more than Tenants in Chief, which
compos'd the <hi>Common Council</hi> here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
were let into the <hi>Great, or Common
Council of the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they cannot, I conceive they muſt
take my ſenſe.</p>
            <p>For, this Charter was either declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the law as 'twas before, or intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
of a new law.</p>
            <p>If the firſt, then it muſt be interpreted
by the Records and Hiſtories both before,
and ſince, till a time of change can be
aſſign'd with ſome colour.</p>
            <p>If introductive of a new law, then we
muſt ſee what interpretation practice has
put upon it; not that the ſenſe of a law is
alwayes to be interpreted by practice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
then we ſhould think, eſpecially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſeveral Statutes againſt Proviſors,
which were rarely executed according to
the letter, that we could not judge of the
ſenſe of former laws by the plain words.
But if the words will any way admit of a
double ſenſe, that ſenſe is alwayes to be
taken which agrees with conſtant practice,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:105035:62"/>
eſpecially if the ſenſe inclines moſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the practice.</p>
            <p>I have at large ſhewn the evident
proofs, that to the <hi>Great Council of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
there us'd to come more than the
King's <hi>Tenants in Chief,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
this very Charter confirming
free cuſtomes of every particular the
place, or of the inhabitants of thoſe
places. According to this Charter
the Common Council of the Nation by
law conſiſted of more than the King's
Tenants in Chief, and that the Law was
thus there is a very ſtrong proof, which
turns upon them who ſuppoſe that King
<hi>John</hi>'s Charter gives us the full form of
the <hi>Great Council,</hi> and that none but the
King's Tenants in <hi>Capite,</hi> made the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

               <hi>Quod omnes tunc temporis non fuerunt jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta

ſome would render and call King <hi>John</hi>'s
Charter, and that the complaint was, that
the Peers had not their particular Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
according to the tenour of that Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Were it ſo, 'twould prove nothing for
them that urge it; becauſe it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
but that the aid demanded might
have been Eſcuage or Taillage, or both,
which lay upon the King's Tenants only,
ſuch a Common Council as that Charter
I conceive eſtabliſhes. But it is <hi>Cartae ſuae,</hi>
not <hi>Cartae Regis Johannis patris Regis nunc:</hi>
'tis the then King <hi>Henry</hi> the third's Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
no man will ſay that 'twas the Barons
Charter, and beſides it was the <hi>Great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and no other <hi>Charter</hi> then maintained
that Epithete. But what puts this out of
diſpute is, that though <hi>H.</hi> 3.'s Charter was
comprehenſive of all the fundamentals of
the Government, and was ſo many times
confirmed, and explained where it was
thought needful; yet there is not one
clauſe referring to the Great Council of the
Nation, but what leaves to every particular
place, and the Inhabitants thereof all anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Cuſtomes and Liberties; ſo that unleſs
it be proved that ſuch a <hi>Commune concilium
Regni</hi> as is in King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter, us'd to
compoſe the Great Council excluſive of all
others, (excepting what is implyed in the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:105035:63"/>
general <hi>Salvo</hi> at the end) they muſt needs
have referred themſelves to the ninth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter

and as the whole Nation is made up of

               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:105035:64"/>
they being the integral parts of every
<hi>County,</hi> all the Counties of <hi>England</hi> were
to be ſummon'd according to their free
cuſtomes.</p>
            <p>And methinks the right of the <hi>Counties</hi>
for their coming to the <hi>Great Council</hi> and
its being preſerved under the free cuſtomes
of the <hi>Villae,</hi> appears from the Plea of the
men of <hi>Coventry</hi> the Inhabitants of that
<hi>Villa</hi> in 34 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>They plead and their plea is allowed,
That in the times of that King and of his
Progenitors, which to be ſure reaches to
the cuſtome before <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> they us'd
not to be taxt as Citizens, Burgeſſes, or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of the Kings demeſn, but only along
with the Community of the County of
<hi>Warwick,</hi> that is, with the <hi>whole</hi> County
and not with the Cities, Burroughs, and
antient demeſn of the Crown. So that when
the <hi>Commune Concilium,</hi> in K. <hi>John</hi>'s Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or the Kings Tenants in chief, laid any
charge or gave an <hi>Auxilium</hi> or aid, this
could not affect them; but when they
came, and agreed to any charge with the
<hi>Body</hi> of the County,<note place="margin">Inter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munia de Termino ſancti Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelis, An. 34 E. 1. pro hominibus villae de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventre.</note> as part thereof, then
they were liable, and no otherwiſe: and
indeed the ſtream of Records of both <hi>H. 3.
E.</hi> 1. and <hi>E.</hi> 2. evidently prove all this:
but let us touch the Record, <hi>Ex parte eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundem

            </p>
            <p>No man will imagine ſurely the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Plea to be that the Vill or Town
of <hi>Coventry</hi> was not lyable when the
Kings immediate Tenants taxt themſelves
only, but they were when ſuch Tenants
taxt the whole County; for that would
have been an admittance of a grievance
beyond that againſt which they petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
for by that the Kings Tenants
might have excuſed themſelves, and have
laid the burthen upon them who were
not Tenants in Chief, ſo that it would
have been their greateſt advantage to
claim the priviledge of being Tenants to
the Crown, and in that capacity to have
had a right and priviledge to be parties,
and conſenting to all charges and grants
laid upon them, and given to the Crown:
and for that they might have prayed in
Aid and pleaded King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter, nor
ſhould we have met with ſo many Records
in thoſe times, whereby ſo many pleaded
off the Tenures in <hi>Capite</hi> as chargeable and
burthenſome; nay even the tenure of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony
it ſelf; but on the contrary every one
would have given the King great ſumms
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:105035:65"/>
of money to have changed their tenures to
have held in <hi>Capite ut de Coronâ</hi> (when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it clearly appears they did the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
becauſe they not only could ſave their
individual Eſtate, if they had the ſole
power of making Laws, and giving Taxes,
but would have encreaſed and better'd
them by their Services and Tenures, which
capacitated them to lay charge upon all the
Barons, Knights and Freeholders of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
who held not in Chief and who were
by far the major part, many of which held
of the great Lords by ſuch and ſuch duties
or payments <hi>pro omni ſervitio,</hi> and beyond
that were not lyable without their own
conſents to be charged; and all this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative
if any will read over and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the infinite number of pleadings in
the Ages we ſpeak of, <hi>viz.</hi> (for ſome few
inſtances) that <hi>A. B.</hi> holds of <hi>C. D.</hi> of
his Mannor of <hi>E.</hi> by paying 10 <hi>s.</hi> rent or
one bow and arrow, or one horſe, or the like,

or ſuch a Chamber there when ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
by the great Lord <hi>pro omni ſervitio;</hi>
but to charge them without their aſſent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was to overthrow the very <hi>Salvo</hi> in

<hi>Here the</hi> Communitas populi <hi>were the</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitas

            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:105035:68"/>
Perhaps by this time they that ſuppoſe
the <hi>Commune Conſilium regni</hi> within King
<hi>John</hi>'s Charter to have been a <hi>Full Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
or Great Council, till the <hi>49th</hi> of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Third, will compound for
their Notion, and will yield, That more
than ſuch often came to Council, but
that 'twas of courteſie, and that the King's
immediate Tenants alone could charge
the reſt, and often did.</p>
            <p>For which they have two falſe grounds;
though perhaps but one within the time
we are now upon, yet both are worth
notice.</p>
            <p>1. They take it for granted, that the
Lords us'd to anſwer for their Tenants in
Benevolences out of Parliament; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this weak, and at leaſt uncertain foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
they build the Suppoſition, <hi>That
they at other times repreſented them in all
Great and Publick Councils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. (Which falls within the time) That
it ſhould ſeem by Record, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Tenants have charg'd others
without their Conſent.</p>
            <p>1. To prove that the Lords anſwered
for their Tenants, they run back as far
as <hi>William</hi> the Second's Reign; when his
Brother <hi>Robert</hi> ſent to him to borrow
Ten thouſand Marks of Silver, proffering
<hi>Normandy</hi> for Security for Repayment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:105035:69"/>
The Biſhops, Abbots, and Abbeſſes,
brake in pieces the Silver and Gold Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of their Churches, the Earls,
Barons, and Sheriffs, <hi>ſuos Milites ſpoliave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi>
that is, robbed thoſe which were
under them; and 'tis a <hi>fine Preſident</hi> for
the <hi>Right</hi> of the thing, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<hi>Sacrilege</hi> and <hi>Robbery</hi> in the face of
it.</p>
            <p>Here the Sheriffs robb'd or took away
from the <hi>Freeholders</hi> that were within
their <hi>Ball'ia</hi> or <hi>Balliva,</hi> and the Lords took
from the Tenants within theirs; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the Lords could charge their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
the Sheriffs could the Freeholders:
but I would fain ſee one Preſident, that
the Kings Tenants ever anſwer'd for them
that were within their <hi>Ball'ia,</hi> further
than the Sheriffs did for thoſe within
theirs, which at the moſt was as Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
under the King, of what was duly
charg'd upon their Tenants; but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
I take it, they did no more than
certifie how many held of the King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Precinct, as the Juriſdiction of
great Men extended its ſelf within
ſuch a compaſs, they were beſt able to
give the King an account of thoſe that
were liable to any payment within that
<hi>Ball'ia.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:105035:69"/>
And thus in <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's time,<note place="margin">Inter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munia de Term. Mich. Anno 28 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. Rot. 27. dorſo.</note>

ſo many were enter'd in the Exchequer

            <p>The ſubſtance of this is, that the word
<hi>Baro,</hi> was applicable to the whole people,
the Body of Free-holders, eſpecially as
aſſembled in Parliament, till the King
confer'd particular Honour upon ſome by
his eſpecial Writs of Summons, and none
other came, but in purſuance of the <hi>aliae
illa brevia,</hi> that is, the Writs for Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Counties, Cities, and Boroughs:
that this was begun to prevent thoſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
of which both the King, and the
Barons, had Fatal experience.</p>
            <p>That this was Enacted in due form of
Law; though the Form is not expreſs'd,
yet 'tis imply'd under the <hi>Statuit &amp; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navit,</hi>
being words of Legiſlation, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:105035:77"/>
for confirmation, that it was ſo, it has
been followed ever ſince: And that the
Barons by Creation, who have ever ſince
their Creation had Right to ſit as of the
higher Order previous to their ſitting
or expreſs Summons, came not in till the
<hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>Againſt this Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> whoſe inſight

            <p>
               <hi>Tanti viri pace,</hi> This objection comes
not nigh the point, it not being prov'd at

Form of a Parliament or General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
or of any other than a Council of the
Kings Tenants, for matters belonging to
their <hi>Tenure:</hi> and this ſenſe Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>

Third, or the time to which that ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
refers the Law of alteration, which
ſeems to ſhew, that there were then Barons
by Writ only; as well as ancient Barons by
Tenure: That Teſtimony in <hi>Mat. Paris,

as were Barons by Writ only.</p>
            <p>Thus much he yeilds here. If there
were not Barons by Writ, there being in
thoſe times other Barons beſides Barons
by Tenure, Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> and his Author
were in the right, and the word <hi>Baro,</hi> was
of large extent, that is reacht to every
<hi>Free-holder,</hi> who according to Sir <hi>Henry
Spelman,</hi> had that appellation.</p>
            <p>However it does not follow, becauſe
there were other Barons beſides Barons
by Tenure, that they muſt be by Writ;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:105035:78"/>
for what hinders, but that they might
have been by reaſon of their <hi>Poſſeſſions,</hi>
and the freer from Feudall Tenure, ſo
much the rather <hi>Barones,</hi> as Free-men.</p>
            <p>The diſtinction of <hi>Barones Majores</hi> and
<hi>Minores,</hi> I take it has been moveable,
ſometimes all the Tenants in Chief were
<hi>Majores,</hi> as in <hi>Henry</hi> the Seconds time,
where the <hi>Barones Secundae dignitatis,</hi> that
is, <hi>Minores,</hi> are added to ſit upon the
Judgments with the Tenants in Chief:
In King <hi>John</hi>'s time we find <hi>Majores Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones</hi>
holding in Chief, <hi>&amp; alios,</hi> ſo that,
the Eſtates of the Great Barons being
parcel'd out, ſome that held immediately
of the King, were <hi>Minores Barones,</hi> by
reaſon of the ſmallneſs of their Eſtates.</p>
            <p>But this is clear from Record, That
Writs of ſpecial Summons made none
Barons out of Parliament, whatever they
did in Parliament, except where there was
ſuch an unuſual Clauſe as we find in a
Writ of Summons, 27 <hi>H. 6. Volumus
enim vos &amp; heredes veſtros maſculos de cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore
veſtro legitimè exeuntes Barones de

               <note place="margin">Clauſ. 27 <hi>H.</hi> 6. M. 26. dorſo.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Here was a ſpecial Clauſe of Creation
to a Barony; but if the uſual Writs, <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus,</hi>
Writs of Summons, made none
Barons out of Parliament, and there is
not the leaſt ground of conjecture, that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:105035:78"/>
ſuch Writs were devis'd in the time of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Third, it follows, That when
<hi>Henry</hi> the Third Summon'd only his
own Tenants to perform their Military
Services, not to Parliament, and theſe
were <hi>Barones tenentes in Capite,</hi> but there

            <p>That an uſual Writ, or Writs of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,

            <p>This Great man was no Baron in the
ſenſe of the word <hi>Baron</hi> then appropriated,
the ſeveral Writs of Summons had made
him no Baron, and yet he was a Lord of
Parliament, and ſince the King <hi>dignatus eſt
brevia Summonitionis ad eum dirigere,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> he being before
one of the multitude of Barons, the word
<hi>Baro</hi> which was applicable to all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
the Free-holders in him, <hi>pertinebat
ad ſummum honorem.</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s laſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is this,</p>
            <p>(3.) That old Author alſo uſed by the
Learned <hi>Camden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Titles of Honour. <hi>fol.</hi> 590.</note> ſpeaks of Earls no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
than of Barons, as if ſome like
excluſion had been of any of them alſo; than
which nothing can be more advers to the
known truth both of that Age, and all times,
and even in that we have ſome Character of
the ſlightneſs of his Authority, whoſoever he
were.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:105035:80"/>
This I conceive can be of no great
weight, for he might as well have ſaid
that Barons were never excluded before,
and by the ſame conſequence not then;
for I know not how any man can prove,
that Earls had more <hi>Right</hi> than Barons,
in the moſt Honourable acceptation eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
            <p>But this being then made a Law, 'tis
not improbable, that the diſpoſition of
this Honour of receiving particular Writs
of Summons to Parliament, might have
been lodg'd in the breaſt of the King,
who is the Fountain of Honour; nor is
it likely that any Earl, but he that juſtly
forfeited the Kings favour, would have
been denied it; however, he were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of no natural Right. Since the
<hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, indeed, the
Nobility have had ſettled Rights by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
which are as ſo many conſtant

in the way of being call'd to the

               <hi>ex

had the ſame Right to a general Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
and the Right of being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
as properly concluded, the one
as the other, unleſs where the King had
exerted his Prerogative. But where the
King <hi>ex tantâ multitudine Baronum,</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
in their circumſtances, (ſome
holding of him immediately, others of
meaſn Lords, and his very Tenants being
divided into two different Claſſes, of

be of his particular Council in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

made them not Judges in Parliament, <hi>eo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nomine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
becauſe a Court may amerce its

by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> are not amerceable but
by their Peers, and therefore none but
their Peers could without their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
be of the Court with them; which
though they might be with conſent, as
to all Acts amongſt themſelves, ſtill it
would be a queſtion how far they might

them to ſuch Honour; act in that
Station to the prejudice of others. That
ſpecial Summons to Parliament, without
a Seat there granted and ſettled by the
King, gives no man Vote amongſt thoſe
who now have Right to ſuch Summons,
appears, in that the Judges and Maſters in
Chancery have had the ſame Writs with
the Lords; and yet are, and have been,
but aſſiſtants to them, no Members of
their Houſe.</p>
            <p>The great Tenents in Chief, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

himſelf (if he would have them oblig'd

were it not that they might have
