            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:57633:3"/>
Gods vegetable Creatures which are placed within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of my Calling, and with pains, care and diligence, I have writ down the knowledg of propagating of each Plant, to help me the better in my Calling; for in viewing of it I am put in mind of thoſe Herbs and Flowers that the Winters cold breath hath bereaved of life, or otherwiſe I might forget them though I might know them very well formerly: they are ſo infinite in their number, ſo various in their nature, that my Head cannot carry in mind what Experiments my Eye and Hand hath ſeen and done without the help of my Pen: upon this account I have ſet down theſe Obſervations which I know to be true, and I doubt not but it is a laudable Piece: now I think fit to publiſh it to the World for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods Creatures, and for the good of my ſelf and others that ſhall put it in practice, that it may be a rule to guide the ignorant, and confirm the judgement of thoſe that have good experience. The reaſon why I undertook this Work is this; I have made diligent enquiry after ſuch Books of ſuch Authors as might help me in my Practice, and I could find very few, and for thoſe that are they did not anſwer my deſires, becauſe they only treated of the uſe and vertue of Herbs, the beauty, variety and preheminence of Flowers, the goodneſs and profit of Fruit-Trees, but they have written little or nothing as to the practicall part of the advancement of the nature and growth of Herbs, Flowers, and Trees; and for that which is written, ſeems to me, and other Men which have experience, as fancies, dreams, and conceits which might come into their heads as they were ſitting in their Studies; for I and others have found (by wofull experience) that their direction concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of any Plant, to be more hurtfull than uſefull; but this is not my intended Diſcourſe, for in the enſuing Treatiſe, I have ſpoken little againſt Authors, and took leſs from them; for mine is the <hi>Gardeners practicall part,</hi> which hath never been written by any, and having good
<pb facs="tcp:57633:3"/>
experience therein (a talent God hath given me to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove) I think it not fit to lay it up, but to unfold my Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, that it may contribute to a publick good.</p>
            <p>I further humbly conceive, that it was my duty to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it to you before any other whatſoever, becauſe I was a Plant nouriſhed up within the pale of your habitation, and I hope not altogether unfruitfull: yet conſidering I was nurſed up with your bounty, preſerved with your love and care, then the fruit is no more mine but yours worthy Sir, and I know it is very uſefull for all as have a deſire of ſuch a Work as tendeth to the propagating of Plants, wherein is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of excellent things both for food, medicable and phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall Arts for the uſe and comfort of mankind, that God in all things may be glorified; every ſenſible man knoweth this, and he hath ſo much reaſon (if he will but ſet his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding awork) whereby he can diſcern the wiſdome of a Creator, in forming ſuch a harmony of Creatures, and in giving of them ſuch various operations in their ſeverall natures, and that all things are ſo ordained that it ſhall be no way uſefull without knowledge and labour: then let all degrees of men know, whether they be high or low, rich or poor, they ought to labour either in body or mind, that they may ſome way or other cooperate and contribute to the common good, or elſe they are unworthy of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of this life: yet all men deſire a good name, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and honour, whether they are deſerving yea or no.</p>
            <p>Now my counſell is to all ſuch, that they will look upon you, worthy Sir, as an example of all good endeavours, (to wit) your great love, care, and diligent ſearch after the knowledge of thoſe Plants which are mentioned in this Book, and that they will take notice of your more eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vertues, as conſtance in times of diſtraction, ſuch a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led devotion in times of faction, ſuch lowlineſs of mind in ſuch heighth of Eſtate: much more my eyes and ears have
<pb facs="tcp:57633:4"/>
gathered from your eminent parts which my Pen cannot expreſs.</p>
            <p>And Sir, let me intrude farther on your patience, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with this Treatiſe, wherein I have faithfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the way of contriving, modelizing and ſituation of a Garden of Pleaſure, with artificiall Knots to be amplified therein, for the variety of delight, pleaſure and contentment of all noble and ingenious perſons. I have given rules and directions for the advancement of a phyſicall Garden and a Kitchin Garden, and for each of theſe I have given a right information, how each Herb, Flower and Tree in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is to be propagated in its own nature; alſo Experiments of alteration, ingemination in the fructition, or by convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, with varieties, properties and beauties appertaining to Plants either for food, phyſick or pleaſure; and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it cannot be altogether unwelcome to you and the reſt of the Nobility of this Nation, if they take into their conſideration, thoſe excellent effects that I ſhew from the practice of a skilfull Gardener, as Fruit ſo deſirable, Herbs ſo vertuous, Flowers ſo beautifull, how delightfull all theſe are placed in uniform ranks, whoſe beauteous luſtre beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Banks, the Earths Cabinet, wherein is its chiefeſt treaſure and School of Divinity: on the contrary, by reaſon of the ignorance of the Gardener in artificiall work, Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are deprived of their pleaſure, their minds are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and the place is diſgraced, if in propagating of Plants they will follow old errors, by reaſon of the dulneſs of their brains, and ſtubbornneſs of their wills, which will not let reaſon work, to know the times and the ſeaſons, the difference in Climates, the mixture, the operations of the Earth, and the vaſt difference in the vertue of Plants; for want of theſe Obſervations the owner is deprived of his profit and earneſt expectations of fruit, which cannot chooſe but be a trouble to Maſter and Gardener: to prevent theſe dangers I give this my teſtimony, which is a true relation

how Plants may be propagated and made fruitfull without any ſenſible error, it being ſome part of the beſt invention of my lean brain; I now right worthy Sir recommend it to you as yours, and my ſelf as obliged to you by the Law of nature and gratitude, ſubmit my ſelf to your loyall will, and ſhall ſtudy the remainder of my dayes as now I do, how I may be truly worthy for to be</p>

<pb facs="tcp:57633:5"/>
which he doth, that man is without reaſonable knowledge, and if he die ſo, the end of that man is miſerable: Then it fits the time, the place and the work, that I give you ſome reaſons why I writ this Treatiſe, and a brief account of what it is, and what the uſe and profit of it will be, or otherwiſe I ſhall condemn my ſelf to be one of thoſe miſerable men. Reaſon at the first ſet my understanding awork, to know to what end I was made, preſently the Word told me, and Reaſon confirmed it, that I was made to ſet forth the greatneſſe and the goodneſſe of God in his wonderfull works he hath ſet before me, and unleſs I ſhould blind my eyes by winking at the light of Nature, I could not chuſe but ſee the wiſdome of a Creator in forming the whole Creation, and in giving ſuch a Decree that all his work muſt once come to a period; but whilſt it hath a being underneath the Sun, it muſt be in actual labour according to its courſe of Nature; nay the Sun it ſelf never reſteth, but ſtill is running of a race to enlighten a dark World; the Moon goeth her circuits, the governing of the Sea and mans body; for the obſervation of times and ſeaſons, the Stars and Planets are alway travelling of their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits; the Wind paſſeth to and fro and never abideth in one place, the Air is continually moving in and out at the noſtrils of all living Creatures; it is that which giveth life, beauty, vertue vertue and perfection to all ſenſible and unſenſible Creatures: the freſh Waters are alwayes aſcending and deſcending through the Air and the Earth for the preſervation of the whole Creation: The Clouds are continually riding on the wings of the Wind, the dropping of their moiſture to ſtop the mouth of a thirſty Earth: The Sea hath no reſt, but is at all times ebbing or flowing: The whole body of the Earth hath ſuch motions, operations by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulations, which doth give nouriſhment to all Plants therein; the fire is alwayes craving and never ſatisfied; the Stones are in a poſture of growth for the increaſe of their number, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
<pb facs="tcp:57633:6"/>
of their nature; the innumerable company of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables ſpread over the face of the earth, do participate, draw and contract into their ſeveral natures, the operations of the teeming womb of the Earth; the endleſs and hidden company of Fiſh in the boundleſs Sea, have an order and diſcipline ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their kinds, they can diſcern what tendeth to the good or evil of their life: The univerſality of Fowls, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their diſtinct kinds, have unity and copulation one with another, they know how for to build their neſts, and to provide for their young: The Worms know the times and the ſeaſons, they provide for the Winter in the Summer, they will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender but with their fellow-creature: The numberleſſe and powerfull hoſts of Beaſts have a government, whereby they know their Superiour and Inferiour, they are offenſive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, they know their prey and paſture, and have genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one with another. And laſtly, according to Creation, is the harmony of Properties, Phiſiognomies, Languages, Speeches, Actions, Judgements; of the innumerable and triumphant Army of men, which by reaſon and labour ſubdues and brings to their uſe and ſubjection all creatures elſe, they multiply by conception. Theſe are the humane labours wherein all things work according to their ſeveral natures; now I communicated with my ſelf, how to know the difference betwixt men and bruits, I found in reſpect of gemination, appetites, ſleeping, waking, wrath, luſts, diſeaſes, ſeeing, hearing, beginning and ending; what befalleth the body of the beaſts, befalleth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man, <hi>as the one dieth ſo dieth the other;</hi> yea they have one breath, all are of the duſt, and turn to the duſt again, and man hath no preheminence over a beaſt ſave this, that man hath a ſpirit that goeth upward, which giveth him a ſpiritual understanding, whereby he can diſcern the work and will of God and his own duty, and he is able to give a reaſon for each, which maketh him a reaſonable creature: But all men are not thus able to give a reaſon for that, yet all men have a ſpirit, but that ſpirit (by the generality of men) is kept in ſubjection
<pb facs="tcp:57633:6"/>
to the fleſh, for it muſt not labour no more than for the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame; theſe men are unreaſonable men, for they have only a knowledge, and ſo hath the beaſt, <hi>For the ox knoweth his owner, and the aſſe his maſters crib, but Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſider,</hi> Iſa. 1. 3. So it is plain and evident, that man with a bare knowledge of thoſe things which neceſſity and cuſtome hath taught him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſpiritual conſideration, and a temporal knowledge of the ſeveral workings of the courſe of nature under the Sun, is no better than the Ox and the Aſs that knoweth their owner and his crib. Now let thee and me conſider this, it is unconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that undoes worldly men, for without conſideration accompanied with reaſon and labour, no man can underſtand the uſe of external things which are viſible every moment to the ſight, how then ſhall a man underſtand eternal things which are inviſible in the Heaven of Heavens, where no mortal eye can approach, but by an extraordinary means of reaſoning and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring betwixt the body and the ſpirit: The generality of men are far from this ſpiritual underſtanding, for they have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but what cuſtome hath taught them, no faith but what is builded on other mens foundations: The diſcovery is this, Let the cuſtome be never ſo evil and hainous in the ſight of God and good men, yet if it be but a general one they will follow it, and for a wiſe man to perſwade them to the contrary, he were as good to throw feathers againſt the wind, or ſhoot arrows at the Moon: And for their faith, let it be never ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to natural reaſon, never ſo falſe to ſpiritual underſtanding, yet they will keep to it, and lay it on the Clergy mans ſhoulders, whether they are able to bear it yea or no, they will venture all and learn nothing; as ſimple paſſengers do that are going over the Seas for a far Countrey, when they are aboard, there they lie like the ballaſt not knowing whither they are going, nor will they ſearch out by reaſon how Mariners guide the Ship with Globe, Map, Croſſe-ſtaff, Scoul, Rudder and Compaſſe, why then for all they know the Pilot may be a Devil to carry them
<pb facs="tcp:57633:7"/>
to a burning <hi>Sodom,</hi> as well as a Saint to convey them to a glorious <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Thus ſtands the caſe with ignorant and dull ſpirited men in their paſſage towards eternal life; and it is plainly ſeen, that they manage their affairs ſo in this life, by impriſoning the ſpirit in the corrupt body of clay, that will not let their inventions to work no farther than filthy lucre doth draw them; truly the reaſon is this, the fleſh and the Devil warreth againſt the ſoul, and bringeth the natural and ſpiritual underſtanding into this total ectipſe of utter darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Again, my ſoul wondreth to ſee how laborious carnal men are in bodily labour, and in the workings of the ſpirit they are ſo idle, dull and ſtupid, that they will not open an eye or an ear to give wiſdome any entertainment, can they give a reaſon for this? Sure they cannot. Now I wiſh all men would ſtudy even as I do, how they may be able to give a reaſon for their words and actions; the truth of it is, the god of this world hath ſo blinded their eyes that they cannot ſee the reaſons of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the courſe of nature, nor how they labour for that which they do not enjoy: They will part with their underſtandings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will part with their money: See what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of them, <hi>Prov. 1. 19. So are the wayes of every one that is greedy of gain, which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</hi> Theſe words are of efficacy enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me, that thoſe men that look no higher than their barns, no farther than their fels and flocks, no nigher than their cheſts and apparel, are men without wiſdome or ſpiritual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding if ſo bruit, then I think it is reaſon man ſhould labour to obtain wiſdome: <hi>For wiſdome is better than rubies, and all things that may be deſired are not to be compared to it,</hi> Prov. 8. 11. So Reader, let this wiſe Kings counſel, and my weak argument ſerve to prove why man ſhould labour for wiſdome and reaſon, which is to underſtand the working of the courſe of nature, as God hath fitted, created and
<pb facs="tcp:57633:7"/>
ordained it. Much more I have to ſay, and I could have enlarged upon each of theſe principles but for paſsing the bounds of my Preface, and being too troubleſome to the Reader.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall conclude the introductory part with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to all ſleepy headed, ignorant and cuſtomary men, that they will take the Wiſe mans counſel, as he ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 10. Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the grave whither thou goeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly the weighty conſiderations of theſe words, and the perſwaſions of reaſon was the grand cauſe of my ſtudying this work, and with truth and honesty I have finiſhed it, which told me I must publiſh it to the world; and as my duty I have done it for the preventing of publick dangers, not for the gaining of filthy lucre, or purchaſing of vain glory, but for the gaining of a free conſcience, and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſociety and love of juſt and wiſe men: Let theſe few reaſons ſerve to acquaint thee why I writ and publiſhed this work.</p>
            <p>Now I will give you a brief account what it is, and what the uſe and profit will be.</p>
            <p>For aſmuch as divers men have took in hand to ſet forth in order the perfect way of propagating of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, amiable, deſirable, medicinable, phyſical, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and myſticall Arts, which are derived from the hand, and are placed within the compaſſe of a Gardeners Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, thoſe Authours have written many large and methodical Volumes upon this ſubject, and have greatly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed our Students with ſuch Books, but little or nothing have they given unto the practical man, that which is ſet down is too dark for their apprehenſion; yet let me not judge hardly of theſe Authours meanings, for I aſſure
<pb facs="tcp:57633:8"/>
my ſelf, had they had ſo much of the practical part, as I have, that they would have delivered their Art in a great deal better method than I have done, in expreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the quinteſſence of wit and refinings of Scholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip unto the learned, which would have fitted their minds, as well as the apparel fitteth the body; ſo that they cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent the apprehenſion with their learned ſtyle, they make thoſe helpleſſe rules which they ſet down for to paſſe blameleſſe, whereas if they did illuſtrate in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, a weak capacity might comprehend what is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous or improbable, alſo what is laudable and full of practice.</p>
            <p>But whereas the vulgar ſort of people have tired their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, with the peruſing of ſuch Treatiſes as are ſo full of Oratory of words, and ſo filled and varniſhed (as it were) with Quirks. Quiblets and Paradoxes, ſpeaking little abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, but imaginations very obſcure and promiſcuouſly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and compoſed together, running far wide of the practice, and for the major part ſuſpitious and incredulous, ſeeming to men of experience as an Emblem, ſo that the Studies of them which ſtudy naturall work, and deliver it in methodicall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, prove unfruitfull unto the unlearned ſort of men, and I my ſelf being wanting of Scholarſhip, had a ſympathy with thoſe in their wants, which cauſed me for to write this plain and extemporary Work in the following Treatiſe, which was meerly drawn from the very practicall part, that it might red ound to an extraordinary and publick profit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I ſuppoſe will be as followeth:</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, there is the expert way for the ſituation of a Garden of Pleaſure, ſo that in it you may have large, ſound, plenty, beautifull and wholſome fruit, which is accompliſhed by the obſervation of the year as the chiefeſt part, next in the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ground for to keep it fruitfull, declaring what errors are in it to be obſerved, and how they may be prevented with
<pb facs="tcp:57633:8"/>
great and eaſie Rules, how Gardens may be laid in deſcents, that it may be best for to draw or amplifie every Knot preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed therein by the moſt ſevere, commendable, and workman-like way as may be imagined.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is preſented to thy view plenty of Knots and whole Garden plats, and ſuch as are meerly inacted and ſprung from my own Study, yet I will not ſay but ſome of them have reference to ſome other thing; yet let me tell you that if they were the ſame, yet they were worthy of the Impreſſion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my own way and method of drawing of them, for I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an eaſie ſcale to each particular Knot, which ſheweth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what each Plat doth contain, being drawn upon the ground, and that no other Author hath done.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You have an Inventory of all Plants cultivated in Gardens now in <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe are divided into three generall parts; the firſt is a Garden of Pleaſure, conſisting of Flowers and curtous Trees: the ſecond is a Phyſicall Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, deſcribing how it ought to be planted with phyſicall Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as Herbs and Trees of that nature; the third is a Kitchin Garden, where it is moſt properly ſhown, how ſuch a Garden ſhould be planted with ſalletting Herbs, Pulſe and Roots.</p>
            <p>The profit of this Work will be more than I can or will ſtand to reckon up to him that doth put it in practice: 1. In that thou canſt not think of any Plant but preſently thou haſt my judgement for the propagating of it, which I aſſure thee are certain and true Rules: 2. You have a Catalogue of Plants, alſo fit places for the planting of them in; with apt times and ſeaſons for the ſowing, planting and replanting of all Plants whatſoever. If this Catalogue ſeem indifferent to thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet it will turn to thy profit, if it be but only for to put thee in mind of particulars.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, What the lack of theſe things may be to the practicall man, a wiſe man will underſtand; therefore I ſhall ceaſe to give any farther information, and for any vindication of the
<pb facs="tcp:57633:9"/>
Work, I ſhall not give it, let it vindicate it ſelf: ſo I leave this my teſtimony, and conclude my Preface, reſting a ſervant unto all men, as I am</p>

            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Firſt for the Situation.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F a Man would have a Garden ſituated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deſire, it would be ſo, that it might be ſhelving or declining on the South-Eaſt Sun; ſo that the Sun at its firſt riſing may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the Garden, for the vaniſhing of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, diſpelling of miſts, and quallifying of cold air and froſts, which oftentimes periſh Herbs and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in their firſt gemination, and nipping of fruits at the firſt knitting, which cauſeth them to fall at an untimely birth; or if you pleaſe, before they come to perfection.</p>
               <p>The air is farther to be obſerved for Plants that are at their full growth. Being planted in a bad air, though the ſoyl be never ſo rich, yet the Herbs are never ſo vertuous, the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers never ſo beautifull, the fruit of the fruit-trees is never ſo ſound, as thoſe that are planted in a clear air. Yet ſeeing that all men cannot obtain this, though they have never ſo earneſt a deſire, therefore let the Inhabiter learn how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence with his own habitation, ſo that he may make the beſt improvement that may be upon all advantages, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his Garden fruitfull. And let the Purchaſer learn, that in purchaſing, the choice of air is the chiefeſt thing to be looked after: for if the ſoyl be bad, it may be improved with labour and ſoyl, and made rich: or if it ſhould be ſo barren, that it could not be made rich under two or three years time, by any art in digging and dunging of it; yet a man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thir barren earth and bring good mould in its ſtead; or otherwiſe it may be laid a top of the other: ſo a man may have a Garden fruitfull, if the air be good, with induſtry and charge. But if the air be bad, all the coſt, care and skill that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57633:10"/>
may be uſed, cannot change it, or remove it for a good; Therefore the air is the chiefeſt to be looked upon for health, pleaſure and wealth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What means is beſt to be uſed for the ſituation of Gardens of pleaſure, according to every mans reſpective place, which is the modelizing and contriving of it.</p>
               <p>The modelizing of a Garden, is to compoſe it of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs according to the coſt intended for it, in the making of it up, and for the keeping of it afterwards. This rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, the ſecond thing in modelizing, is to raiſe it by a direct ſquare, from that part of the houſe where it is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be; for if it be not took by a true ſquare, there will be a confuſion in all the work that is to be done in that ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plat, intended for a Garden: beſides that it will never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the face of the houſe, but all things will ſeem to ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skew, when there is any proſpect took of it from a window, or a Balcony of the ſaid houſe.</p>
               <p>The ready way to prevent theſe miſtakes is thus: having appointed the place and the quantity of ground, according to the former directions; then lay a line upon one ſide thereof, as I told you, by a direct ſquare from the foundation of the houſe; then look how many yards you will have your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in length, ſo many yards meaſure out by the line ſide, beginning at the houſe: and when you are come to the end of the account of your meaſure, there ſtick down a ſtake; ſo done lay another line acroſs at that ſaid ſtake, which muſt be one corner of your Garden, in that corner place the ſquare, ſo that one part of it agree with the firſt line; then cauſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond line to come exactly ſtraight by the eye of the other part of the ſquare: this obſerved, meaſure out ſo many yards as you would have the Garden in breadth; and if it be to be laid at a full ſquare, then meaſure juſt as many as before: this done you are come where the next corner muſt be, there ſtick down a ſtake in all reſpects as you did at the firſt corner; then take up your firſt line, and lay it acroſs as you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, making of it agree with the ſquare. Do thus till you come to that place where you begun, leaving a ſtake at every corner, which will ſtand at a juſt ſquare, which is the firſt and chiefeſt part of modelizing of a Garden of pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:57633:10"/>
Secondly, Lay two lines from each corner croſs-wayes to the next corner oppoſite to it, and where theſe lines croſs, there is the center of the Garden-plat, and in that place ſet another ſtake; let this ſtake and the reſt be drove in ſtifly, ſo that they may not be eaſily pulled up; and alſo let theſe ſtakes be as ſtraight, and as long, and ſtand as upright as it may be poſſible; for if the Garden-plat be unlevell, you will have an occaſion to raiſe your lines by theſe ſtakes, as I ſhall ſhew you afterward in the levelling of a Garden.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A form for a Garden-plat thus laid out, what remains but that I make ſome queries, what kind of earth it is, and what air and ſhelter it hath, and what work may be intended to be amplified in this ſpace of ground: but I will firſt ſpeak of the improvement; ſo that in the future ages the Garden may be fruitfull, and then of draft-work.</p>
               <p>The improveing of a thing is to bring it from barrenneſs to fruitfulneſs; for barrenneſs is a diſeaſe, and improvement is a cure; therefore I muſt know the diſeaſe, before I can give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the cure. To be brief, if I know what earth it is, and what place and manner it lyeth in, reaſon telleth me the cauſe of barrenneſs, and experience teacheth me the cure. <hi>viz.</hi> If it be a cold wet and clayey ground, then contrive it with high walks, which in the making of them will make motes: but if the Garden ſhould be large and ſpacious, and ſprings lye in the middle, then dig trenches where the walks of the Garden are intended, and lay in thoſe trenches ſtones and wheat-ſtraw; it is no matter whether it be in any order yea or no; it will convey the ſmall ſprings and iſſues out of the earth, better than thoſe gutters which are laid by a Maſon with lime and ſand. Yet further obſerve, that ſtones thus laid in the ground, if they have not a vent for that water which it receiveth, they are of no uſe: therefore lay them ſo, that they may be ſomewhat falling from the center of the Garden, to thoſe motes afore-named, or to any other reſpective place.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cure which is more available for ſtubborn and barren earth is this: levell it about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> or <hi>Candlemas,</hi> when opportunity ſhall beſt ſerve: the next <hi>Midſummer</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing or thereabout dig the quarters at a ſpit depth, caſting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57633:11"/>
off the ſtones and roots out of it, breaking the clods; which will be then as dry as duſt. Now conſider what good this will do; and if you pleaſe I will name ſome of thoſe benefits to you. Firſt, The Sun by reaſon of the looſeneſs of the earth, killeth all the weeds that are diſplanted there, and it breaketh the heart of the ſtubbornneſs of the earth. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The rain mollifieth it, and maketh it to ſhiver; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before if it were digged in the wet time, it bindeth it and maketh it the ſtronger. Thirdly, The reaſon of this looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, the air hath recourſe and influence into it, whereby it purgeth it, and maketh it fruitfull: for let me premiſe a word or two; earth and water are that whereof bodies are made; but air is that which giveth life and vertue to all things that are ſenſible and inſenſible. I cannot ſtay here, but muſt inſiſt upon that promiſe which I made, touching the level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a Garden.</p>
               <p>I am come now to the levelling of a Garden, either by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents, or a true levell-fall, and that which is better than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a true water level: the laſt of theſe ſhall be the firſt I will ſpeak of before I give you the directions. If you pleaſe to look back into the ſecond Page, there you ſhall find that I ſpoke of modelizing, and I alſo gave directions for it; that is, to leave the ſtakes ſtanding at the corners and the centers thereof. This obſerved, here followeth the level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all find out the higheſt corner thereof by your eye; then go to that place with a water-levell, and they are placed like a levelled Canon, againſt that corner croſs-wayes oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite againſt you, which is generally the loweſt part of a piece of ground: your levell thus placed, fill it with water, ſo that it may ſtand at both ends alike; then lay your eye to the uppermoſt part of the levell, as if you were ſhooting at a mark; take your ſight exactly on the furthermoſt ſtake, and mark the place well: do ſo likewiſe of that in the center; then ſtrain a line from that place where your levell lyeth, to that place where you fixt your eye upon the lowermoſt ſtake; then conſider how many yards, foot or handfuls that is from the ground, juſt half ſo many ſet another line below that; again ſtrain it as far towards the upper corner at that height,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57633:11"/>
as the ground will give you leave, which if the ground be of a true fall, before it will be juſt at the center: be it more or be it leſs, take your gage from the uppermoſt line; then faſten it, and ſtick ſome pegs down as may be juſt as high as the line; ſo done, you may take away both lines, and do ſo croſs-wayes again, leaving pegs in like manner. Now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that earth which riſeth above the pegs being brought down, will make good what is wanting there, and abate what is too much in the other: ſo the Garden-plat will be levell, without bringing of any to it, or carrying any from it. I think this experiment would ſometimes have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many a Noblemans purſe, and a Gardners credit.</p>
               <p>Next for laying a Garden by a true fall: that is done with great eaſe, if you know how to levell it, or did obſerve what directions I gave you for it. You may remember what was ſaid for ſetting of lines, to make the Garden of a levell; then it is no more but to ſet the line at the lowermoſt ſtake, a foot or a yard, more or leſs under the levell-mark, according as you would have your Garden fall; and this bringeth it exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to paſs, if you obſerve to lay croſs lines, as was ſaid of the levell-work, for caſting the ground by.</p>
               <p>Next for laying Gardens in the aſcents, it muſt be done in the ſelfſame manner, one quarter after another levelled, as I preſcribed for a whole Garden, according as the ground will riſe, either one yard or two yards, more or leſs, with half pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or ſteps to walk up out of one part of the Garden into the other. I have more and greater things in hand for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Garden-plats, either for pleaſure, phyſicall or profitable, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, The ſeaſon for ſowing of it is in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> on this manner; we make a hot bed with horſe-dung, as we do for Purſlin; then we ſow a quantity of this ſeed upon that bed, ſetting glaſſes over it, covering the bed with Mats: this done, it cometh up the ſixth day, ſo ſoon as it is come up, you muſt give it a little air in the middle of the day, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of it again at night; water it moderately as you ſee occaſion: this carefully done, it will grow to be half a foot
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57633:47"/>
high by <hi>May;</hi> then you may tranſplant it from theſe hot beds into borders or pots, or other places wherein you take moſt delight, ſheltring of it for the firſt week, till it be well rooted again: this done, it will come to flower by the latter end of <hi>May.</hi> There is little or no experiment to be uſed about this plant, becauſe it dyeth yearly; therefore it is only propagated in its own nature as aforeſaid; ſo I leave the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of it to your care, and proceed to the next.</p>

Now followeth the ordering of it.</p>
                     <p>The ſeaſon fit for it is in <hi>March,</hi> in the encreaſe of the Moon; the place for it is to make a hot bed, covering of it pretty thick with mould; let this bed lyeten dayes, covering of it with a little ſtraw to keep in the heat, and at the third dayes end take off your ſtraw, and ſet ſome bended ſticks over the bed; then prick in your ſeeds at a handfull diſtance; then caſt a Mat on the top of your ſticks; this done you ſhall ſee your ſeed to come up the fifth day, as I told you before. Now take notice that you muſt give theſe plants ſome air once a day, if the weather be warm: this done, you may tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant them in the middle of <hi>May</hi> into the out-borders of your Garden of pleaſure, there ſetting of them at half a foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and one chaſe in a border: this done, it will flower, and the flower will keep freſh long on the ſtalk; it ſeldome beareth ſeed in <hi>England</hi> without great care and induſtry. I ſhould ſpeak much more of it, but that it is of a tickle nature, as to the alteration of it in germination, which I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by others, and being not well acquainted with it, I ſhall ceaſe to give any arguments to the contrary, and leave thoſe experiments with you which are ſet down.</p>

                     <p>It was never called by any other name: I'am not very well acquainted with this Flower, and therefore I ſhall not affirm any thing of experience; but take this deſcription, as I received it from a friend: he ſaith this Herb or Flower, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you pleaſe to call it, hath ſuch a property that there is none like it, <hi>viz.</hi> ſaith he, when this Flower hath its ſeed full ripe in its ſelf, then if you go to it and touch it with your hand, preſently the Cod that the ſeed lyeth in breaketh, whatever he be that toucheth it: from the nature of this Flower, <hi>viz.</hi> ſaith he, I have gone to one that hath been counted for a Maid, and I have deſired her to touch the Cod <note place="margin">A cunning invention.</note> wherein lay the ſeed of this Flower; what if I ſhould, ſaith ſhe, why then, ſaith he, if you have loſt your Maiden-head, then this Cod will break at your touching of it; ſhe cannot believe that, but boldly toucheth it, then it breaketh, and ſhe is convinced of her fault and confeſſeth, thinking the ſeed were ſenſible of her fact; by this ſaith the Author I have found out my deſire, as to the knowing whether a woman hath loſt her Maiden-head or not: this I thought worthy of the reciting. Now I will give you a deſcription of it.</p>
                     <p>It is much like your purple-<hi>valaren</hi> in ſhape, but in colour <note place="margin">Deſcrip.</note> of a whitiſh green, the Flower being of a blewiſh colour: it never groweth above a foot high, and it flowreth in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> and hath a hundred ſeeds in a Cod, and it is much like Roſe-campion ſeed.</p>
                     <p>It is raiſed of the ſeed in the Moneth <hi>April,</hi> in the ſame <note place="margin">Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> manner and place as you do your Clove-gilliflowers, as you may ſee hereafter, and at the Moneths end it will be fit to be tranſplanted into the borders amongſt orher Flowers, or you may let it ſtand in the ſame beds if you pleaſe: this done, it will grow up and flower as aforeſaid, and when the winter cometh the top-branches dye, and at the top of the root re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth a ſmall ſpring being well ſhelterd, but be as carefull as you will, the third year dyeth both root and branch, ſaith the ſame Author.</p>

                     <p>Now for the propagating of it; if you have it not already in your Garden, then you muſt procure ſlips of it, not that it hath ſlips from the branches which may be ſet to grow, but they muſt be ſuch ſlips as have both root and branch, and ſuch are eaſie to be had where they are growing, for they ſpread mightily in the ground; now having got ſuch ſlips as I told you of, prepare a border, either a border round a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of herbs, or an out-border of your Garden, as I told you in the former part of this Book, then ſet your line at the uppermoſt part of the border, then your ſlips a hands breadth aſunder only one chaſe in a border, for they encreaſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, this muſt be done in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>Auguſt,</hi> thoſe that were ſet in <hi>Auguſt</hi> will flower early, but thoſe that are ſet in the Spring will not flower till <hi>July</hi> or <hi>Auguſt,</hi> thoſe that are ſet in <hi>Auguſt</hi> will flower in <hi>May, June</hi> and <hi>July;</hi> now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that as ſoon as they have done flowering you muſt cut off the top-branches with a pair of Garden-ſhears, then it will ſpring preſently after; and take notice, this Flower never groweth out of a Garden being once planted, though the old ſtock dyeth yet it ſendeth forth young ſhoots in its ſtead, which cauſeth them to ſpread mightily; and therefore if you will keep them in uniform manner, you muſt tranſplant them once in two or three years, as I directed you before.</p>

                     <p>If you have a deſire to raiſe them, if you can procure the ſeed, it is eaſily done by ſowing of them in good mould in the Spring time, with other Flowers in borders or beds, ſetting a mark where you ſow them, you ſhall ſee them come up with a ſharp leaf, and in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi> they bring forth ſeed, and dye the ſame year: I have ſpoken with ſome which have been mightily taken with this Flower.</p>

                     <p>Now for the propagating, if you can procure the ſeed of it at the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> then ſow it, but with a great deal of care and curioſity, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt find out the warmeſt place in your Garden, and there make a bed of Barley-ſtraw and Bran, then cover it with fine mould three inches thick, then prick in your ſeeds half an inch deep, then ſhelter this bed a nights with a Mat, you ſhall have your ſeeds to come up the tenth day; you ſhall find that making of beds with Barley-ſtraw and Bran to be the excellenteſt way of raiſing of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that ever was invented, for why your beds that are made with horſe-dung forceth gemination too ſoon, and does not continue that height which the plant was forced up, for which cauſe the plant decayeth, and thoſe that are made only of earth they are too cold for outlandiſh plants; if you will take my counſell and ſowe it after this manner before deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, tranſplant it in <hi>May</hi> into a box of earth, and you ſhall have the balm of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to flouriſh in <hi>July,</hi> which is a great rarity to the beholders of this Nation: there are few experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more to be uſed than have been deſcribed; it will dye

                     <p>Now I will give you my own experience which I found true by my practice; Rickaluſes are encreaſed by ſeed and ſlip: firſt of the ſeed, if you can get the ſeed of the beſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, then ſowe it in a box in <hi>March</hi> or the beginning of <hi>April</hi> in ſpeciall good mould, you muſt be carefull to water the ſeed well for the firſt ſummer, the ſecond ſummer it will flower about that time as I told you before, you may let theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the box, ſo they ſtand not too thick where they will grow continually, you may take ſlips from them to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplant into other places: take notice that the putting of them inboxes is not becauſe they will not endure the cold winter, but to have them early.</p>
                     <p>There are ordinary means for raiſing of them by ſeed and ſlip, the ſeed you may raiſe in beds with other Flowers, the ſlip is to be ſet in <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>March</hi> in this manner; having gotten your ſlips prune them handſomely, and ſetting of them at a diſtance atop of a border, or by a borders ſide, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of them for the firſt ten moneths if the ſeaſon ſhould be dry, by that time they will be rooted and come to perfection, but they flower not that year.</p>

                     <p>The preſerving of them in their nature is thus; at any time after they are flowering you may tranſplant the root in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to new places, or ſet them again in the old; or if you have them not, then you may ſend for the root to ſome other place where they may be had, the place proper to ſet them in is in your intervails of herball or out-borders of Graſs-work in this manner; make holes in your ground with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber half a foot aſunder, put in each hole a root, be ſure you make not your holes too deep, for then it will keep back the Flower from coming early, it lying ſo low and ſo cold, otherwiſe you may get them early by putting of them in box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and houſing of them: laſtly take notice that you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant them every two year, or elſe the roots will grow thick and the Flower will be ſmall.</p>

                     <p>The chiefeſt way of propagating this is of the ſlip, in the Moneths <hi>March</hi> or <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the ſlip is taken partly from the root, for the branch dyeth every year, and the ſlip of ſuch branches will not take root.

                     <p>Of theſe there are two ſorts, the ſtriped Crokus and the Safforn Crokus, theſe are both winter Flowers, for they <note place="margin">Deſcrip.</note> flower at the beginning of <hi>February</hi> even to the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> they are a very pretty Flower, and they are ſo well known I need not ſtand to deſcribe them, only I'le tell you what properties they have; and though it be ſaid that all Herbs and Flowers bear ſeed, this I could never find to bear any, for flower, ſtalk and branches ſoon vaniſh after their firſt appearing, nothing remaineth but the root, and this root ought to be took up preſently after he is flowered, which is in <hi>April,</hi> and when you have taken them up, reſerve the ſuckers by themſelves and the bearers by themſelves, you may keep them in a box with a little earth a Moneth or two if you pleaſe, and plant them at your leiſure.</p>
                     <p>The manner and place of planting of them: the propereſt place to plant them is in borders where Tulips are planted, between every Tulip-root you ſhall ſet a Crokus-root, at what time the Crokus hath done flowering a little after the Tulips will begin; we uſually take up Crokus as well as Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips every other year, becauſe they ſhould not lye too deep in the earth, for they'le run downwards and encreaſe with ſo many ſuckers that they'le be hindered of their large growth; and by having too many ſuckers about them, and by lying ſo deep in the cold earth, they'le be hindered of their early flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering, for theſe reaſons we tranſplant them every year, or every other year: from the Qualon-Crokus you may ſave Safforn.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Some may enquire for experiment of moloration in the nature of the plant, in ingemination there can be none, for it is out of mans element, becauſe they are not produced of ſeed, but encreaſe of themſelves by the root in the earth: now if any man ſhould deſire to alter the colour of this Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

I think it a vanity, for no man can deviſe more rarity of colours than nature doth beſtow in flowers; but for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of the nature of this or any other which ſpringeth of a bullous-root, take theſe obſervations: Firſt, fill ſome boxes of the fineſt mould that may be had, and as dry as may be, then put it into boxes, then ſet theſe boxes in ſome gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, or room, or other, where it may have the Sunne and Wind, but no rain come at it, have ſo much patience as to let it ſtand for a twelve moneth, then get Sheeps-bloud, the juyce of a Laren, Camomile, Mallows and Lapeons tails, mix theſe juices and Sheeps-bloud together, then water this dry earth with this ſubſtance, then take your Bullous-roots, as crotus Tulips, crown Imperials, Lillies, Snow-drops and the like, then plant them in theſe boxes at the times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as I have directed you formerly, and anoint the roots with this ſubſtance at their planting, water them continually with the ſame, let them have no rain, or any kind of water elſe, but only this; beſure they have Sunne, Wind and Air enough, for otherwiſe your flowers will corrupt; this done, your flowers will ſpring out of an exceeding large growth, and produce them very early, and I can poſitively ſay, that it will make them differ from what they were formerly.

Thus much may ſerve for the ordinary ſort of Cullenbines.</p>

                     <p>Prepare ſome fine boxes of earth, and therein ſow your ſeed, or ſet your ſlip, having a diligent care over them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: by watering of the ſlip, and tranſplanting of the ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ſheltering of them from the froſt and ſnow, you ſhall have them to flower early in the Spring: I cannot ſtand to ſet down every particular; there may be many means uſed to ſet forward the nature of them, but no way to alter the form, ſetting forward of the nature is but a watery ſubſtance, which I ſhall not ſpeak of here, but refer it to that place where I treat concerning Cornation Gilli-flowers.</p>

                     <p>Crown-Imperial, or Imperial-Crown, counted the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt of Spring-flowers, for it flowreth at the beginning of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57633:56"/>
                        <hi>April;</hi> now underſtand that there are two or three ſorts, as the great Imperial, the <hi>Italian</hi> Imperial: they differ not ſo much, but if you know one you may know the other.</p>
                     <p>Imperials at the firſt coming up are ſo like Lillies that they <note place="margin">Deſcrip.</note> have been took for Lillies by ſome; they riſe to three foot high, and at the very top ſhouteth out ſix flowers, hanging directly downward, above them riſes ſharp leaves, eight in number, ſharp and ſmall, and a handfull long, ſtanding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upright, which reſembleth an Imperial-Crown: this flower keepeth freſh three weeks off the ſtalk; in the middle of the flower ſtandeth ſix blewiſh pearls; the ſtalk of this flower periſheth every year after it hath born its ſeed, which is about the middle of <hi>June,</hi> the root remaineth in the ground, which is as big as a mans fiſt, yellow and round, it ſtinketh mightily: I need not give you any farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
                     <p>The propagating of them is either by ſeed or ſlip: Firſt, The ſeed that is raiſed as are Tulips (of which I treat hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) in the ſame time and place ſetting of the ſlip, is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his flowering, then if you have them not, you may procure them, and ſet them in your borders with your Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips, betwixt every Tulip an Imperial root, ſo by that time your Imperials have done flowering, your Tulips will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, ſo you ſhall have your borders to flouriſh all the Spring.</p>
                     <p>And not to be troubleſome to you, the Imperial-roots muſt be removed every year, and the ſuckers took from the old mother, and planted in a bed by themſelves at a handfull diſtance, and the next year you may replant them into the borders amongſt your bearers, they flower the ſecond year.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, To produce any thing by Art from this flower con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Nature, if it may be done upon any, it may be done upon this; for you may take the root out of the ground for a moneths ſpace, and in that time you may water it, or anoint it with ſuch contrary colours as you deſire moſt to have the flower of, then this root is forc'd to participate this watery ſubſtance of contrary colours into its nature; and ſome think that this muſt force the root to bring forth a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

                     <p>This is a flower which ſpringeth of a bullous-root, riſing with many leaves two foot high in the ſhape of a ſword, in <note place="margin">Deſcrip.</note> the middle of thoſe riſe in the branch with ſhorter leaves, one in the ſame forme as the other; this beareth a flower reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Flowerdeluce in ſhape, a matter of ſix leaves, and every leaf is of three fingers breadth, purple at the top, and blew towards the bottome; this flower is in his prime in <hi>May,</hi> and the ſeed is ripe in <hi>June,</hi> then dieth the branch, the root remaineth in the ground, and ſpringeth yearly.</p>
                     <p>The ordering of them I ſhall ſet down in few words: Firſt, If you have them not, you ſhall procure the ſeed in the moneth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> then you ſhall ſow it in this manner; Prepare a border of good mould under ſome wall, where it may be ſheltered from the cold Winter, your bed being finely raked, caſt your ſeed on it of ſuch a thickneſs, as reaſon ſhall beſt direct you, then riddle a quantity of fine mould, and caſt upon theſe ſeeds, ſo that they may be covered half an inch deep; this done, you ſhall ſee your ſeed ſpring up a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of three weeks after with a ſingle blade, ſhelter theſe all the Winter there, and in the latter end of <hi>March</hi> replant them into the out-borders of your garden of pleaſure at a foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, one range in a border, the ſecond year they will

flower: the fourth year you ſhall replant them again, for otherwiſe they will grow ſo thick that it will ſpoil their flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering: and for planting of them, take ſlips which are took from the root in the moneth of <hi>March,</hi> and ſet them one chaſe in a border, as I told you of ſeedlings.

                     <p>There is alſo the <hi>Indean</hi> Corn-flag, which is of a more ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier growth, a curiouſer colour, and tenderer in nature, but it flowereth at the ſame times, and is ſown and planted at the ſame ſeaſons as the former, only with a great deal more care, for the ſeed, root or branch will not endure the cold Winter, therefore we ſow it in boxes, tranſplant it into others, and by putting theſe boxes into houſes in the Winter, giving of them air in ſeaſonable dayes, we raiſe and preſerve this <hi>Italian</hi> Corn-flag: now concerning any experiment of alteration, I never could find any man of ſuch an ambitious deſire as to do any ſuch thing, but for the ſetting forward of the nature of it, water it with ſuch a water wherein hath been Sheeps-dung and Pigeons-dung: So I ceaſe and proceed to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt of flowers, which is</p>

                     <head>Cornation Gilliflowers.</head>
                     <p>Of Gilliflowers there are divers kinds, as the Cornation-Gilliflower, <note place="margin">Of Kinds.</note> the Clove-gilliflower, the Wall-Gilliflower; theſe I ſhall referre to another place, and ſpeak here only of the Cornation-Gilliflower, which for beauty and delicious ſmels, and excellent properties deſerves letters of gold. I wonder that <hi>Solomon</hi> did not write of this Flower, when he compared his Spouſe to <hi>the Lilly of the valley:</hi> but whether there were any of theſe flowers in thoſe dayes, or in thoſe places we will not enquire, but proceed to the flower it ſelf. To give a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it were vanity, being ſo generally known by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, yet few know the nature of it; therefore I ſhall only ſpeak of the titles of them, and proceed to the ordering of them.</p>
                     <p>They are only tituled and diſtinguiſhed by their colours, <note place="margin">Names.</note> chiefly thus; the Cryſtaline, the Granado, the fair maid of <hi>Kent,</hi> the Fools-coat, the <hi>Dover,</hi> the Bandeleer, the mixt Clove, the painted Lady, the old Mans Head, the <hi>London-</hi>white
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57633:58"/>
the Emperors-robes, the Patern of Nature, the Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, the Wine-colour, the Widdow, the Peach-colour, the Purple: theſe and all theſe are intermixt, which doth make ſo many mixt colours that I will not ſtand to name, but will proceed to ſowing, planting and replanting. Firſt, Of theſe I'll begin with ſowing, and therein are matters of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; firſt, it is the way to have plenty and ſtore of theſe flowers; Secondly, it is the chiefeſt art in the practice indou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and redoubling of them.</p>
                     <p>For ſowing of them you ought to conſider what ground is <note place="margin">Sowing.</note> fit for them; it muſt be a well tempered ground, by no means too rank, and in a convenient place, where it may be warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the reflection of the Sun: the place appointed, dig it and cleanſe it from ſtones, then lay it out into ſmall beds of two foot and a half in breadth, then rake them finely, take a quantity of ſeed and ſow it of a thickneſs, as you think beſt, then get a little fine mould and riddle through a riddle, cover theſe ſeeds with it a matter of three quarters of an inch thick; theſe ſeeds will come up the ſixteenth day with two ſpindles like graſſe. Now I have ſhown you the manner of ſowing of them; now you muſt conſider the times and the ſeaſons for them.</p>
                     <p>The ſeaſon fit for it is the firſt full Moon in <hi>April,</hi> and the <note place="margin">Seaſon.</note> firſt full Moon in <hi>May,</hi> and likewiſe in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I told you.</p>
                     <p>Now obſerve thoſe that are ſown in <hi>April</hi> ought to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the dry weather, and in the firſt full Moon of <hi>Auguſt</hi> they ought to be replanted to a better earth in ſome border by a wall-ſide where they may be ſheltered from the cold the Winter following.</p>
                     <p>The planting of them is done thus; when your border is digged and evenly raked, then go to your place where your ſeedlings grew, then take them up with a ſetting ſtick, which is the fitteſt inſtrument for that purpoſe; ſo done, prune them, which is to cut off all the ſuperfluous groſſe top blades, ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off ſome of the under blades, then go to your place, as before mentioned; and by a direct line ſet the one from the other ſix inches diſtance, and ſo let them ſtand while the next <hi>March,</hi> covering of them from froſt and ſnow a nights then
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57633:58"/>
in <hi>March</hi> you may remove them into knots or pots, or any other proper place where you ſhall have a deſire, or ſhall ſtand for the beauty of your Garden; theſe plants being ſet in a better mould than before, and diligently watered, will come to flower by the next <hi>July</hi> following. Thus much of the ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ſown in <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for thoſe that are ſown in the Spring, being ordered in like manner as the other, preſerved with the ſame care, will come to flower the ſecond Summer.</p>
                     <p>Next for the ſetting of the ſlips, the time for it is in <hi>April,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Of ſlips.</note> 
                        <hi>May, June</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Moon being three dayes before the full; in this manner, we go to ſuch ſtocks, and ſlip off ſuch ſlips as we can conveniently; theſe ſlips we clip off the tops praiſe with a knife, and under we ſlip quite off, then ſlit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the lower moſt part of the ſlip that we put in the ground; this done, ſet them in a convenient place, as I told you of the ſeedlings, at a hand-breadth aſunder, the next Spring or fall following tranſplant them into borders, three chaſe in a border at a foot difference. Thus farre of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means for ordering of the common ſort of Cornation-Gilliflowers.</p>
                     <p>Now followeth extraordinary means for the propagating of the rareſt ſort of theſe flowers, with ſome anſwers to ſuch vain opinions, as ſome men affirm to be true by words, but never proved to be true by actions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, For altering the colour by inciſions; it hath been <note place="margin">Colour.</note> given out by ſome that Aris, and Biſſe, and Verdigreaſe; theſe and ſuch like may be diſſolved betwixt the bark and the body of the Cornation, and that theſe mixt colours will cauſe a mixture in the flower. To this I anſwer, That this will never cauſe the effect, upon ſeveral trials that I have made; for any thing diſſolved betwixt the bark and wood of a tree, cauſeth that part of the bark to die, which is of a ſtronger nature than any flower whatſoever: I could ſhew you many more of theſe arguments, but I will only propound this one Queſtion to you: Do you think that you can any way give ſullenance either to man or beaſt, any way but at the mouth, ſo that it may be concoctedin the man, and diſſolved into the ſeveral parts of a man? Nothing can be applied to any
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57633:59"/>
part of man to cauſe it to grow as aforeſaid: in like caſe it is with flowers, for the root is the place where ſuſtenance muſt be had for the maintaining of the branch, then if any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be made, it muſt be a watery ſubſtance applied to the root, and not to the branch, but it is not Aris nor Bis that the plant will participate of, but it muſt be the corruption of itſelf, or the corruption of ſome other: Now I will inſtance to you, what I have done, <hi>viz.</hi> I took Camomil, Valaren, Flag-roots, Solendine-leaves, theſe beaten together into a ſalve, and applied to the roots of the flowers when they are planted or removed, and watering of them with the ſame, hath propagated the flower in bigneſs, ſo that it hath made it as big again as any of the ordinary natural flowers, but I could never find that I could alter the form of them; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the colour of them will alter that are thus ordered, but the alteration or mixtures of colours is a law in nature more than experiment in art.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There have been certain wayes given for graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inoculating of theſe flowers.</p>
                     <p>But I wonder whether they mean the root or the branch; if inoculating in the branch there is no bud, and to inoculate without a bud that is impoſſible to me: now we'll enquire about their grafting, what manner of grafting they did mean, whether it be clift-grafting, or whip grafting, or grafting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the bark and the wood? If they meant any of theſe, or all theſe; if clift-grafting, I could never get any ſuch thing as a ſcience, for that purpoſe, and for any of the reſt I think it more ſtrange.</p>
                     <p>But what grafting may be done is by addition, grafting, <note place="margin">Grafting.</note> and addition grafting is done thus; take two young plants of four moneths growth, take a part of the bark of the root of each of them alike, then join them artificially together, then bind them with a little ſoft flax, and anoint it with the juice of Valeran, which is of a healing nature, then commit them to the ground, thoſe will incorporate into one body, which will bring forth a very large flower if they be both of one kind; if of two ſeveral kinds, then there will be two ſeveral kinds of one ſtock, which is rare; but ſome have told me this will make a mixt colour, but I could not give any credit to their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57633:59"/>
words, as to believe them, for why, each of them keeps their own nature: For example, the leaſt bud of an Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock inoculated upon a plum-ſtock, keepeth his own nature, and bringeth forth an Apricock, then of neceſſity we muſt needs think, that if this keep his nature where there was no ſubſtance, that the Gilliflower grafted (as before ſpoken of) where there was body and ſubſtance, muſt needs bring forth flowers according to their kinds. I can keep you a long time upon theſe like things, but ſo much for this point.</p>
                     <p>Now for altering the ſent of theſe flowers, there be divers <note place="margin">Of Sent.</note> things they ſay will cauſe this effect, which I think altogether needleſſe, becauſe it hath a paſſing ſmell of it ſelf; therefore if you have any deſire to make uſe of what Authors have ſaid for altering of the ſent of flowers, make trial upon ſuch as have little or no ſent, as Fowerdeluces, Scarlet-beans, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe or Tulips, becauſe they are flowers that Ladies love to have ſo nigh their noſes, which have little or no ſent, and it would be a rare art to cauſe them to have a ſent, as Authors ſay; and it is a great wonder, that if they could alter the ſent of them, that they do not produce ſome of thoſe flowers; now if you will make uſe of this experiment, I can tell you what will follow, you ſhall loſe your labour; and I give you my reaſon; the ſweeteſt and luſhiouſeſt meat turns into the fouleſt and ſtinkingſt excrement; ſo it is with theſe infuſions and molerations which man doth imagine may infuſe a ſweetneſſe to any flower; for the flower doth not draw the ſubſtance as it is, but converts it into its own nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terciſial form that it hath.</p>

1. For the firſt of theſe, you muſt underſtand that every thing bringeth forth fruit according to its mother; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here is the earth, therefore if poor earth then poor flowers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the ſecond, Pots are neceſſary for the keeping of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worms from the roots, and ſheltering of them from the ſtorms in the cold weather, and from too much moiſture and too much drithe, for too much wet doth keep the plant cold, and too much drithe doth famiſh the plant: now theſe pots do preſerve them from both, and if they are made of a ſtately faſhion they do beautifie the Garden. And laſtly, you may have your flowers at ſuch times in the year by removing of them from place to place, as cannot be effected by thoſe that grow out of Pots.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Cradles are neceſſary; you muſt underſtand to keep the wind from breaking and beating of them to and fro, and keeping of them in uniform manner; theſe cradles are made of white rods, ſix ſtanding, and two woven round about, and the lower end ſharp to put into the earth, and theſe keep the flowers up.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourthly, If flowers be kanker-eaten it will deſtroy them, for it is a worm that eateth the root; this you ſhall diſcern by the branches, when they look of a dead colour, then ſearch the root, when you have found this kanker, take tarr and the yelk of an egg, and mans ordure, and apply this to the kanker-eaten, and that will cure it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Fifthly, If your flowers ſtand too long unremoved, or the ground ſtirred about them, and freſh mould put to them, the ground will be bound ſtiff about the root, which muſt be remedied by opening the earth about them, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in of freſh mould; this muſt be done early in the Spring, or otherwiſe you will hinder it more than far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Sixthly, If you let too many flowers grow upon a ſtock, they will be very ſmall, and in danger to kill the ſtock; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt when you ſee there is like to be great ſtore of flowers, cut the moſt of them away, for the preſervation of the ſtock, and the enlarging of your flower, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of ſeed; for if you would have good ſeed, you muſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57633:60"/>
not ſuffer above five or ſix Flowers to be upon a ſtock, theſe muſt be of the top Flowers, at the firſt flowering, the ſeed will come to perfection by the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and when you ſee the ſeed black in the cod, then cut off the branch and hang it up in the houſe till it be thorow dry, then you may rub it out, this ſeed you muſt ſow in your own Garden for two years, and afterwards you muſt change it, or elſe your Flowers will degenerate and grow ſingle.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Seventhly, Houſing of the Plants is neceſſary for preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them from froſt and ſnow which would kill them; and for getting of them to flower early, obſerve that you are to give them ſun and air on ſuch dayes as it is to be had, and to ſet them forth in rainy dayes, for rain water is much better than conduit for them, but if rain-water may not be had, water them with ſtanding water, and be ſure that they have it often, for all vegetable creatures do partake more of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment water more than the element earth; to prove this, take any plant and burn it, look how much aſhes ſo much earth, and all the reſt which vapour'd away was a watery ſubſtance which vapoured up out of the earth, then watering often is needfull.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Eighthly, To get Laires is very needfull, and it is done thus; you may buy ſmall pots for the purpoſe, which are like a tunnell, with a hole at the bottom to let out the water if there ſhould be too much, it hath a ſlit of one ſide, theſe pots we fill full of earth, and ſet it by Cornation-Gilliflowers ſide, and bring one of the choiceſt ſlips that we can ſee in at the ſlit, ſo that the top of it ſhall be above the top of the ſmall Laire-pot, and the lower part of it is in the pot and in the earth, ſo this putteth forth root, this muſt be done in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> and next <hi>March</hi> you ſhall cut off the ſlip that is ſo root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and plant it in another pot, that Laire-pot which the ſlip came out of will ſerve for the like uſe again.</p>
                     <p>Further queries and obſervations there are concerning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing <note place="margin">Various things.</note> of theſe Flowers contrary to nature and ſeaſons:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt diſpute is, whether Cornation ſeed bringeth forth a ſingle Pink, I anſwer ſome do and the moſt do not, for thoſe that comes ſingle were of the under-ſeed, therefore if there were diligence and care in the ſaving the ſeed, (as I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57633:61"/>
told you before) there would be very few ſingle Pinks, but thoſe that are by diligence replanted may be made double, but if you will not beſtow the pains, you may plant them in ſome border or bank-ſide, there to remain for ſtrowing Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: another curioſity is to have Cornations almoſt while <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and it is very probable this might be done if you will take theſe directions.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Many other vain things I have been told concerning alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which are very uncertain truths which I ſhall not beſtow the pains to ſet down, but ſhall proceed with laudable and creditable and profitable things for him that is employed therein: I do not intend to pleaſe any man in writing of this Treatiſe, unleſs he will be pleaſed with the bare truth and no more: ſo I'le ſpeak a word or two of the continuance of this Flower.</p>

                     <p>Some men are of opinion when they ſee this beautifull Flower, as to think it is of an art of their own or others, but

they are miſtaken, all the art of man is to find out the art of nature it ſelf, for if any thing be not uſed in its own nature <note place="margin">Nature.</note> and ſeaſon it will come to no effect, therefore what I have diſcovered of the nature of this or any other Flower (as far as my capacity can truly underſtand) I give it to all men; yet I know (Reader) that it may be contrary to your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for ſo many men as there are ſo many minds, but the truth that I have here ſet down, I ſhall diſpute it face to face with as many as have an objection againſt it.</p>
                     <p>One thing more I give you and then I have done: if you <note place="margin">The laſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> ſhall have any of theſe Flowers ſtolen, and if you would be revenged on the party, or would put a jeſt or a jeer, you ſhall accompliſh your deſire thus; take an Elecompane root dry and beaten to powder, then ſprinkle it upon your Gilli-flowers, or put it into the midſt, then give your Flowers to the party that you deſire to be revenged of, let it be a he or ſhe they will delight in ſmelling to it, then they will draw this powder into their noſtrils which will make them fall a ſneezing, and a great trouble to the eyes, and by your leave will make the tears run down their thighs: other things there are which may be bought at the Apothecaries, which I will not give you the receit of, for fear it ſhould come to a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mans hands, then the effect would be evil.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57633:63"/>
this flower challengeth the title of praiſe: Firſt, for its early flowering; for in warm places ſome begin to flower preſently after Chriſtmas, and then others begin; ſo ſome are continually flowering while <hi>June;</hi> others by art and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture flower twice a year, as in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>September.</hi> Now to give you a deſcription of them, they are of a ſet colour ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never ſpeckled, the ordinary colour is red, blew and purple; the Emroſes held moſt in eſtimation are, the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, the <hi>London</hi> white and the black; theſe colours being of large kinds, I have known a root of each ſold for ten ſhillings; others have told me they have known them ſold for three pound a root.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe flowers there are double and ſingle; the root is <note place="margin">2.</note> like a Ginger-race in ſhape and bigneſſe; this flower beareth a weak ſeed ſomething like ſweet Madeling-ſeed, and that will ſeldome grow; and I ſuppoſe that Emroſe-ſeed never grew, though it be commonly ſold for that purpoſe; yet I have found by experience that it will not grow; and as many Gardeners as ever I had conference with, did ever affirm ſuch a thing to be true: therefore if you will have Emroſe, you muſt ſet them of the root, and I will be brief and willing to ſhow you where and how.</p>
                     <p>The fitteſt ſeaſon for ſetting of them is in <hi>June,</hi> the Moon being at the full; but if opportunity doth not then ſerve, you <note place="margin">Of plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> may plant them any time betwixt that and the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> but (as I ſaid before) it is beſt to remove them in <hi>June,</hi> for then there will be the ſtalks above ground, and ſome flowers, and afterwards there will be none; ſo that in the taking of them up you may cut them with a ſpade, but that's not all, you'll never find all your roots, unleſs you will ſift the earth, and that is a great deal of trouble.</p>
                     <p>The fitteſt place in planting of theſe roots is in beds amongſt <note place="margin">Of place.</note> your Cloves, or elſe at the edge of your borders where you plant Tulips, and ſometimes in beds by themſelves, for the common ſort make a little trail of an inch deep, then break the roots into a many ſmall peeces, and lay them into this trail at a hands breadth diſtance, the leaſt peece will grow and flower the next year following.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, Whether there might be any alteration in the colour by any skill or care that may be uſed. Many men have <note place="margin">2.</note> ſaid this may be done, and they have given ſome blind reaſons for it, which I ſhall wave, and tell you how you may propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the natural growth, <hi>viz.</hi> Take Tulip-roots, Lettice, Sheeps-dung, Strong-waters, mix theſe together into a ſalve and apply it to the root, and ſo commit the root to the earth, and it will cauſe this root to ſend forth a large flower, and more ſpeedilier than thoſe that are not ſo ordered: thoſe roots ought to be planted in a box for to have them come time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not but that any Emroſe-roots will endure any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, To produce Emroſe at all times in the year, is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily done, if the Winter be not too violent: Firſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice <note place="margin">3.</note> that you may take up Emroſe-roots at any time, and keep them in your houſe, though for a year, then ſet them again, and they will grow. Having this advantage, if you have a deſire to have them in Harveſt, you muſt plant them in the later end of <hi>May,</hi> and they will flower at that time; and to have them flower later, plant them at the later end of <hi>July.</hi> Now obſerve that there is ſuch a Law and Nature, that any Herb being deprived of its natural ſeaſon, yet it will bud forth its flower afterwards having liberty, alwayes provided it be ſheltered from the cold: ſo it is plain, that a man may put ſuch flowers as have bullous roots, you may put them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or backward by keeping of them in ſeaſon or out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out of the earth.</p>

                     <p>I have diſcourſed with many Gardeners, and one amongſt <note place="margin">Of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering at certain Seaſons.</note> the reſt told me, that he could have them to flower in any moneth in the Summer time: I demanded of him how? He told me it was by houſing of the root in boxes of earth in the Winter time, giving of them the benefit of the Sunne, when opportunity did ſerve, and by watering of them now and then with warm water, and this will cauſe them to ſpring forth preſently, and flower by the later end of <hi>April</hi> (ſaith he.) Now reaſon told me that it could not be ſo ſoon, yet it may cauſe it to flower a moneth before its natural ſeaſon, as any man of natural reaſon may underſtand.</p>
                     <p>Now to have the flower late, you muſt nip off the ſprings as faſt as they begin to ſpindle to flower till the middle of <hi>June,</hi> and then forbear; this will cauſe them to flower about about <hi>Michalmas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next thing is, to know the right manner of planting <note place="margin">Of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> and replanting of them for the increaſe of their number, and the perfecting of their nature.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The time for planting and replanting of them is in the <note place="margin">The time.</note> later end of <hi>July,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> preſently after they are flowering: the place fit for it, for the preheminence of your Garden, is in the intervals of your Herb-work, or in the trails of Graſſe-work.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:57633:66"/>
The manner is as followeth; when you have taken up <note place="margin">The place</note> your roots, ſlip the ſmall ſuckers from the old bearers, and ſet them in a border by themſelves at a hand breadth diſtance, there let them ſtand while that time twelve moneth, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant them into thoſe places where you do your old bearers: ſome of them will flower the firſt year, others not till the ſecond after their planting.</p>
                     <p>The manner of planting the great bearers, is to make <note place="margin">How.</note> holes at a foot diſtance in thoſe reſpective places as I told you, putting of them no deeper in the earth than they may be juſt covered.</p>
                     <p>Now we will enquire of colours, and colouring of this Flower; the natural colour is the blew; the colours held <note place="margin">Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> moſt in eſtimation is the white and blew, the yellow and white, the blew and purple; there is another colour that I have been told of, that is the red and white.</p>
                     <p>Experiments of force of nature may be as eaſily acted on this Flower, as any other whatſoever. The firſt experiment <note place="margin">Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> is, you may take them out of the earth, and keep them in a room in ſand two moneths, in which ſpace you may ſteep them in morical ſubſtances, whereby you may make ſome infuſions and alterations, and croſſe the nature and the ſeaſons of the plant, whereby you may bring about pretty fancies.</p>
                     <p>Other experiments may be made by grafting of them, <note place="margin">2.</note> which is ſubtil, <hi>viz.</hi> take the root of this, and the Foxes-glove, cut a part on the ſide of each of theſe roots off with a ſharp knife of each part alike, letting the ſtrings of the bottom of the root alone, then join them together, and tie them with a little ſoft flax, and ſo plant them in a box of earth, theſe two roots will unite into one body, and the effect will be pretty, for there will be two ſeveral Flowers in one body.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, This Flower is a great ornament to a Garden, and for beautifying of rooms, being placed in Flower-pots, and an excellent ſhape it hath, which my artleſſe pen cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe in writing, but in draught work, my Pen, Rule and Compaſſe hath walked a ſtation, and ſet it forth in its own ſhape and faſhion, and ſo I leave this worthy Flower to your care.</p>

                     <p>It is well known to thoſe that have it, and ſo is any other Flower; therefore I ſhall give a ſhort deſcription of it, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thoſe that are not acquainted with it. This Flower, when it is at its full growth, is at the height of a man, onely with one ſtalk, and that is as big at the nether end of a mans hand-riſt; upon the ſtalk are many leaves ſomething like Mallow-leaves, in colour and in bigneſs, but they are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided: this one plant beareth but one Flower, and that is at the very top of all, and is of a great bigneſs, ſo that ſome of them are thirty inches about, and of a black and yellow colour, bending it ſelf down, and inclining after the Sunne; it flowereth in <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſeaſon fit for ſowing of them is in <hi>April,</hi> on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Prepare a border, then prick in theſe ſeeds with your finger at half afoot aſunder; they come up ſuddenly after their ſetting, they ought to be replanted after they are half afoot high into a rich earth, where they may have good ſtore of rotten dung under them, to the end they may grow large; you muſt water them often, for it is a plant requireth much moiſture, ſo it will grow up and flower, and bring forth ſeed which you may ſave and ſow again: the root and branch of this Flower dieth every year.</p>

                     <p>Laſtly, Remember that you cut the leaves and dead branches off after they have done flowering, then they will ſpring again freſh; where they are once planted they alwaies continue and ſpread mightily, ſo that they will run out upon your walls; to prevent this, and keep them in uniforme order, ſtrain a line at the bottome of your border, and cut them off with a ſpade by that line; thoſe ſlips you may ſet again, or pleaſure your friends with them, which you pleaſe.</p>

                     <p>Now for the further care of the plant, be ſure that your bed <note place="margin">2.</note> be not too hot, for if it be it will ſpend the ſpirit of the ſeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath taken root, and then it will fade immediately: to prevent the bed for being too hot, you ſhall make a hole with a ſtick of one ſide, or both, to let out the ſteme; theſe things obſerved, the plant will come up moderately the ſixth day, and afterward you muſt give it a little air, by raiſing of the glaſs up on one ſide, for without air your plant will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to any colour or perfection; if the plant ſtand at a ſtay by reaſon of the coldneſs of the bed, then ſtir the ſtick of the middle of the glaſs to let up the ſteme and the heat which is at the bottome to the plants, with this care I have raiſed them up in five weeks time, fit to be tranſplanted into boxes of freckell earth, and then I left them, they left not me.</p>

                     <p>Although that all theſe are generally known by the ſight, yet the nature and the properties are not ſo well known, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall deſcribe them to you; this Lillie beareth a ſeed in four quarters, being but a ſmall ſeed, and ſmall in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and if you ſow it, it will be long before it come to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and ſeeing the root is ſo common, I think it needleſſe to beſtow the pains to ſhew you the difficulty of the raiſing of them from the ſeed.</p>
                     <p>In planting of them, take notice that the root ſeems to be <note place="margin">Planting.</note> ſet with leaves like a Hartichoke, and brittle, therefore you muſt be carefull in the taking of them up, and planting of them again, for fear of breaking of them; the place fit for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57633:71"/>
the planting of them is under ſome ſtone or brick wall which incloſeth your Garden on the Sunnie part thereof, for of all Flowers this delighteth moſt in heat and drithe: When you have provided your ground in ſuch a fit place, the manner of planting of them is thus, lay a line upon your border in the midſt thereof, ſo that you may plant but one row in a border, then the way is to make a trench with your planting hoe a matter of four inches deep, then ſet your great Lilly-roots, ſuch as bore Lillies the laſt year in this drill, a matter of ſix inches difference one from another, the ſuckers are beſt plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by themſelves at four inches diſtance in another place, thoſe you may ſet with a Diber; the time for this is in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> for that is preſently after they have done flowering: ſome will plant them in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> but they will proſper no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo well as thoſe that were planted as aforeſaid, it may be a reaſon, becauſe they ſpring in <hi>February,</hi> and the removing of them in the Spring will hinder their growth.</p>
                     <p>Some would have Lillies to be coloured by art, and they <note place="margin">A queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> have ſet down directions for it, and that is, you ſhall take them up out of the ground about <hi>Michalmas,</hi> and hang them up in the ſmoke for the ſpace of a moneth, and then ſteep them in Claret-wine two daies and two nights, then commit them to the earth again, and this they ſay will alter the colour: <hi>Gravos Marcombe</hi> is the Author of this.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer to the firſt of theſe, for the keeping of the root <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> ſo long in the ſmoke, I have not the faith to believe that ever they will grow when they are committed to the earth, for ſure in that time they will be dried up ſo, that they will have no more moiſture than a dried chip; for if you be pleaſed to take notice of this root, there is no ſubſtance in it, as in others, no ſooner is it out of the earth, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently it withereth and falleth aſunder: I thought good to give you theſe reaſons, that you might not loſe your labour about what Authors have ſaid concerning the alteration of Lillies.</p>

with the white Lillie, nor no Lillie that there is any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of altering of the colour but it, and why ſhould you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beſt to make it the worſt?</p>
                     <p>Red Lillies, and yellow Lillies, or cur Lillies, theſe differ <note place="margin">Other ſorts.</note> not from the white, but that they are of a contrary colour and growth, not to half the ſtature; they differ not in nature, as the one is propagated, ſo is the other.</p>

                     <p>This Flower hath the preheminency of a Garden for ority of colour, delicious ſmell, and for continuance of flowering, for they flower almoſt all the year: and again they caſt ſuch a pleaſant ſight afar off or nigh, and are ſuch a pleaſant orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as cannot be better expreſſed than they expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for ſome of them are of a crimſon and a purple die, others of a ſcarlet, and ſome have intermixt colours, as white and red, purple and blew, ſo overſpreading the buſh with a paſſing beauty, ſome double, and ſome ſingle: but the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of my work ſhall be to ſhow the ordering of the double ſtock.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I muſt make ſome queries, what is meant by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Double ſorts.</note> ſtock, whether the double and ſingle are two diſtinct kinds or no? I anſwer, they are, and they are not, for the double is made by art of nature, the ſingle comes naturally: now you muſt underſtand there is two ſorts of nature, the one voluntary, the other of induſtry, for naturally every creature liveth, but by nature and induſtry every creature cometh to the fulneſs of perfection, and ſo man by nature and <note place="margin">Of nature.</note> induſtry cometh to the fulneſs of wiſdome, whereas naturally he is a fool.</p>
                     <p>Well then I hope you confeſs it is truth (and this fits my diſcourſe) that we muſt uſe induſtry in the propagation of Gilliflowers, wherein there is ſome art in doubling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling of them.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing needfull to know in this art is, the diſtinct <note place="margin">The art of doubling.</note> times and ſeaſons for the ſowing of them: true it is you may ſow them betwixt <hi>March</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and they will grow very well ſo that the earth be fixt for the ſeed, but yet they will prove ſingle if you do not take the right times and ſeaſons for them: the right ſeaſon is the firſt new Moon in <hi>April,</hi> when it is about fifteen dayes old, and in <hi>May</hi> alſo obſerving the Moon, theſe are the fit ſeaſons: now I will ſhow you what earth the ſeeds require, that is a dry, looſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57633:80"/>
ſtony, but by no means barren: the fitteſt place for it is in a border by ſome wall, where they may have the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſun, and a ſhelter from the ſtorm: ſuch a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place prepared, ſow your ſeeds as you think fit accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the quantity of it, then cover it with a little fine mould as thin as you can poſſible, forget not to water it if the ſeaſon be dry: all this done you ſhall ſee your plants come up the eighteenth or the twentieth day: let theſe plants be weed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo ſtand while that day two moneths that they were ſown, then remove them into a richer earth of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but one thing you muſt obſerve, ſuch plants as have crumpled heads, them reſerve by themſelves, for thoſe will be double if you will order them as followeth: in the next <hi>September</hi> following remove them again at the full Moon, and that will keep them back from flowering untill the next Spring: be ſure theſe plants be ſheltered from the froſt and ſnow the winter following, for we found by experience, that the laſt winter killed all the Stock-Gilliflowers, both old and young, unleſs it were ſuch as were ſheltered.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Replant theſe plants the firſt full Moon in <hi>March</hi> following, and be ſure that they be tranſplanted into a better earth which is as rich as it may be poſſible, to that place where you have a deſire they ſhall be, and the moſt of theſe will be double, if in their farther growth, before they come to flower, you guild off ſome of the leaves, and cut off ſome of the branches that would deprive the Flower of its ſap.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There are ſubtle wayes of grafting of them, the effect of it is to have two ſeverall colours of one ſtock, it is done in manner as I told you of the Cornation-Gilliflowers, ſo of theſe, and with a great deal more eaſe you may obtain your deſire.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The ordinary ſowing for ordinary and ſingle Flowers is at any time you pleaſe, for they uſually grow beſt to be ſingle Flowers when they have leaſt care took of them.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Means for ſetting of ſlips of double ſtocks that they may not degenerate but be double and large, ſtill the time for it is the firſt full Moon in <hi>May,</hi> the Flower is ricked

in the branch, then ſlip off as many ſlips of the under leaves as you can conveniently, then plant them in ſuch earth, and in ſuch a place as you replanted the ſeedlings in: Let theſe ſlips be often watered with ſuch water wherein have been ſteeped Sheeps-dung; theſe plants thus planted, and thoſe raiſed of the ſeed, will continue three or four years before they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, and then they muſt be ſupplied with younger in the room.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, To plant ſeedlings for pleaſure, and that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the border of a high walk (where there is no hedge) ſet by a direct line, each plant ſeven inches one from another, and ſo to grow up in a frame made with ſmall ſticks, and to be kept clipt with a pair of ſheers on each ſide, and on the top where a plant riſeth higher than ordinary, ſo that they may ſtand like a hedge, and a pleaſant hedge indeed: but if ſuch a convenient place is not to be had, then you may plant them in uniform order inſome out-border.</p>

                     <p>I am come now to that Flower which Authors have left a large deſcription of to poſterity, and alſo vain diſputes, how Tulips are made by art into thoſe ſeveral colours that they are in. To give an anſwer to thoſe things I ſhall omit the pains, and not raiſe my diſcourſe out of other mens words: ſo I'll ſet down what I have found by experience, and what the nature of them is.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In nature: Here is a wonderfull work, and many rare and excellent things to be obſerved from this work in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Firſt, conſider how beautifull it is, and of what a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy nature it is of; other Flowers that are beautifull are of a tender nature, it is not ſo with this, conſidering what a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly form it hath: but this I ſhall wave; I will ſpeak how Tulips are tituled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:57633:82"/>
Tulips are diſtinguiſhed and called in the oraty of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour each Tulip hath; that which is held moſt in eſtimation <note place="margin">Of names.</note> is the Scarlet, the Princes-robes, and the Fools-coat, the Chimney-ſweeper, and the black and yellow, eſpecially if they have the ſhape of the Crown Tulip. The ordinary ſort of Tulips are theſe, the Wind colour, the <hi>London-</hi>white, the yellow, the purple, the peach colour, the Maiden-bluſh, the red, the white, the Cinamon, the Widow-Tulip. Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mixt colours are theſe, the Lords-livery, the Prieſts-ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, the red and white, the yellow and red, the orange and damask, the purple and red, and many more, which I cannot ſtand to name. All theſe colours, or any other, doth ſometimes alter their colour by nature as well as by induſtry of themſelves; and foraſmuch as the colour of Tulips do differ one from another, is of an apt nature, and not of a forced na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and ſeeing that they are apt to alter of themſelves, I will endeavour to ſhew you how you ſhall find the nature of this Flower.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If you have Tulips already in your Garden, when they are flowering, take notice of what colour they are, then ſtick a ſmall ſtick by each particular Flower, and write upon the ſtick what colour each Flower is; now by the ſetting down of this ſtick, you ſhall know what colour they were when the Flower is faded, and nothing remaineth but the root in the earth: Let theſe ſticks or marks ſtand till ſuch time as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them; the time of removing them is preſently after they have done flowering, and that is about the beginning of <hi>June:</hi> in the removing of them, all the art and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge conſiſts, either for the enlarging of them, or to have them flower at contrary ſeaſons, or to alter the colour.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, For altering the colour: Having ſet the marks to know what colour they were, take up your roots, and lay <note place="margin">Colour.</note> each colour by themſelves, ſo done prepare your ground to ſet them in; if you ſet them in the ſame place where they were taken up, ſome freſh mould muſt be gotten and well ridled, ſo lay it upon the border where you have a deſire to ſet them.</p>
                     <p>But happily you may ſet them in a wrong place for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57633:83"/>
therefore I will give ſome directions for the place; if the Garden be croſſe-work, then it is proper to ſet them in a border round it; if Herb-work, then Tulips muſt be ſet in a quarter caſt out into beds, in ſuch a manner as is in the draft-work of this Book.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Theſe Tulip-roots thus taken up, you muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prrate the young ſuckers from the old bearers, and plant them <note place="margin">Suckers.</note> in a bed by themſelves, at a hands breadth one from another, the old bearers muſt be planted at eight inches difference either in bed or border, no deeper than that there be half an inch of earth above the root, for if you do, they lie cold in the ground, and cannot get the benefit of the Sun and air to cauſe them to ſpring timely.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Concerning the altering of colour, having taken <note place="margin">Colour altered.</note> notice of what colour they were before, ſet the red Tulips by themſelves, and the white Tulips by themſelves after theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections; take a quantity of wild or Garden-herbs, and Sheeps-dung, and Pigeons-dung, beat theſe Herbs and the dung to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo done put ſome of this into the holes where you ſet your Tulip-roots, anoint the roots with the ſame, and ſet them into the holes, and put in more atop of them, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them with earth; this done, upon ſeveral trials it hath altered the colour, ſome after one manner, and ſome after another, but ſtill the red and the white carrieth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſway.</p>
                     <p>Again, I have been told, and I have conceited it to be true, that is in the planting of a red Tulip, to alter the colour, I ſhould take a white Tulip-root, Lettice-leaves, Solendine leaves, Camomile, and the white Thiſtle and Peas-flower, and beat all theſe together, and ſo I did, and committed them to the earth, as I did the former, and I did imagine that the root would partake of thoſe ſeveral coloured juices, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it into its own nature, which ſhould cauſe ſo many orites of colours as was mixt in the juices, but I found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that it was nothing ſo, for I found no more alteration in thoſe than I did in the former, which was only the enriching of the earth with the ſtrength of the ſubſtance of the Herbs and dung; ſo Flowers do not convert any colours as they are, but into its own colour and interciſial form as every one hath.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57633:83"/>
Some think that there is ſeveral juices in the earth which is the cauſe of it, as is ſaid, that if Garlick be ſet by Gilliflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they will be the ſweeter, becauſe that they think that the Garlick doth draw away the ſtrongeſt juice; this is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creditable as the ſtories of <hi>Robinhood;</hi> for ſure if Flowers draw juice, ſo does the Crab-tree, I mean drawing or receiving of <note place="margin">Diſputes of Nature.</note> it, as it is; then mark, an Apple grafted upon a Crab-tree muſt needs turn a Crab, for it receiveth its juice from the Crab-ſtock; and as they ſay the Crab-ſtock draweth ſower juice, and if it be ſo, from whence ſhould the Apple receive its ſweet juice? Why then it is plain, that the Apple graft converts the ſower juice of the Crab-ſtock into its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and becometh of a pleaſant taſte, and ſo it is with all plants elſe: ſo it is not Garlick by Roſes can make them the ſweeter, nor contrary colours applied to Tulips that will alter the colour, and ſeeing there are divers colours it is an art of nature, and thoſe things which I direct you to apply to them in the former page, is that which doth agree with their nature, for it inlargeth the Flower, and altereth the colour as ſoon as any thing whatſoever applied unto them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There is certain wayes of grafting of them to <note place="margin">Grafting</note> have two Flowers ſpring from one root, and that is done thus; Take two Tulip-roots of two ſeveral colours, one as big as the other, and cut off a part from the ſide of each, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably alike, ſo that you cut not the ſtrings at the bottom, then joyn them together, and bind them with a little flax, and ſet them in the earth, and the next year, according to what they are grafted, they will bring forth Flowers of two ſeveral kinds, ſeeming to ſpring from one root; ſome are ſo ſimple to think that they will be mixt colours; but that is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where I treat of Flower-deluce-roots, and prove to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, To have Tulips of the ſeed, is to ſow it in the later <note place="margin">Of Seed.</note> end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in a fine fertile earth, for it is a very tender feed, though when it is come to perfection the plant is the hardieſt of all others. The plants that come of ſeed will be very ſmall the firſt year, and beareth no Flower while the fourth year; and ſeeing Mr. <hi>Purchas</hi> and others have took up their time to ſtudy curioſities about ordering this ſeed; and that this Flower
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57633:84"/>
is grown ſo common that the roots may be had almoſt any where, I ſhall not inſiſt any more upon ordering this ſeed.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Tulips muſt be removed every year, or every <note place="margin">Removing</note> other year; the time fit for it is in the later end of <hi>June,</hi> in manner as aforeſaid; the reaſon is, if they be not removed, they grow too deep in the ground, and the ground groweth ſtiff about them, and they ſend forth ſuckers from the old bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; theſe things hinder the timely bearing, and maketh the Flower the leſs.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Concerning ſent. In the former Treatiſe of Gilliflowers I had an occaſion to ſpeak of the alteration of the <note place="margin">Ofſent.</note> ſent of Flowers, and if it could be done on this, as I know it is impoſſible, it would make this Flower exceed all Flowers, for here is nothing wanting in this Flower that nature did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow in any other, except ſent; and what may be done in altering the ſent, Authors ſay it is thus: Take two or three Cloves, as much Mace, and a ſtick of Oinamon, two grains of Musk, and a little Amber-greaſe, theſe beaten together, adde unto it a few drops of Damask-roſe-water, then take a fine Camebrick rag, and ſpread this upon it; lay this to a Tulip-root, then commit it to the earth; this done, water them now and then with Damask roſe-water, and ſome other ſweet drugs this coſt with diligence performed, ſay they, the Tulip that ſpringeth from that root will be as ſweet as any Flower whatſoever. This you may believe if you pleaſe; but I can aſſure you that you will loſe your labour and coſt: My reaſon is, as I ſaid before, plants do not contract any ſubſtance, as it is either ſweet or ſowr, black or white, but into its own ſent, colour and for me that God and Nature gave it.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Some things may be done in croſſing of the nature <note place="margin">Croſſing of Nature.</note> of this Flower, by keeping of the root out of the earth to put it backward for flowering at contrary ſeaſons, for you may keep it out of the earth a quarter of a year and ſet it again, and it will grow and flower; thus you may keep them back from flowering one Summer, and the next Summer they will flower the timelier, and the Flowers will be much the larger. I cannot inſiſt upon every particular, but I hope I have ſhewed you the principal things of concernment, and I

have anſwered ſome of the groundleſſe opinions that men have took up upon truſt concerning the ordering of this Flower.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Obſerve the time, and that is about the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> when the plant is full of ſap: now followeth the manner; Go to a Province-Roſe tree, and cut off one of the likelieſt young ſhouts that you can ſee, then go to a young damask-Roſe ſtock, which muſt not be above a year old; this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, take off a bud from off the cutting which you brought from the Province-roſe; the bud took off evenly and ſquare, then lay it upon the damask-roſe ſtock, a matter of a foot from the ground let it be, ſo mark out juſt ſuch a proportion of bark by that, then take it out with the point of your knife, then ſet the other in its room, which if you did it artificially, will juſt fill up the place, or elſe it is worth nothing; but if it do joyn right then it is very likely if will grow, then bind it with a little flax, leaving the middle open for the bud to grow out; ſet two or three of theſe buds of one ſtock, but if one grow it is enough. Now when you ſee the bud incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated with the ſtock, then unbind them for the band will do them hurt; after the bud is ſhotten forth an handfull length, then cut the ſtock off above it: theſe are certain and eaſie wayes of inoculation of Roſes, but if you are not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with theſe ſhort directions, ſee the Treatiſe of inoculation for fruit trees.</p>

                     <head>Vines.</head>
                     <p>Of Vines there are many kinds, and many Authors have given large deſcriptions, praiſes and directions for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of Vines, whoſe large and hiſtorical Diſcourſes have drowned the ſenſe or the method of it to the Reader: This Diſcourſe I ſhall omit, and ſpeak a few words in brief, how Vines are propagated of ſuch ordinary ſorts as grow in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, I will give you an account of them: There is the white Muskadine, the red Muskadine, the ſmall ſugar Grape, the Murcot, the ordinary <hi>French</hi> white and red Grapes, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> white and wild Grape: In the raiſing and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of theſe, I find but four things requiſite, and that is, Planting, Pruning, Gelding, and Cures for hurtfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, Before you plant, get ſuch plants as are root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though ſome ſay, that cuttings will root very well, but I have found by experience, that one in ten will hardly come to any thing; and if they do ſhoot out the firſt year, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay afterward: The way to get rooted plants is thus; Go to an old Vine, and bring moſt of the young Vines that grow nigh the root, and bring them under the earth, and bring the tops up to the wall again; this ought to be done in <hi>September,</hi> and thoſe Vines let lie under the earth while that time twelve moneth, and by that time they will have taken root, then they may be cut from the old mother, and planted againſt walls, houſes, bowers, or cloſe walk frames; and in ſetting of them, obſerve that they ſtand not too nigh the wall, and not above a foot deep, and that you put about them ſome Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous-dung and good mould, and that the plant be cut off a yard above the ground: theſe are certain and ſure wayes of planting of Vines.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is Pruning, and that is one of the neceſſarieſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57633:91"/>
things that belongeth unto them, for if they be not pruned they will ſoon decay and give over bearing of fruit, and grow out of all ſhape and form. The time for pruning of them is in <hi>February,</hi> for if it ſhould be done before, the cold would nip the cuttings and kill them, and if it ſhould be done after, the Vine would bleed out moſt of its ſap, which will hinder its growth, and keep it from bearing that year. Now the pruning is thus; cut off all ſuch as were of the laſt years growth, ſave ſuch as are leaders, and thoſe muſt be left to ſpread further againſt the wall, and in cutting the branches off cut them ſo that you leave one joint or eye from whence ſpringeth the Grape.</p>
                     <p>For the third, Gelding of the Vine is requiſite for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of the Flowers and the Grape: Firſt Underſtand that gelding is to pluck away the ſprouts where they grow thick, and the leaves which deprive the grape of its ſap, and keep the benefit of the Sun from it, which the Vine loveth above all plants.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Hurtfull Diſtempers which annoy Vines is can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker eaten earth, bound and barrenneſſe of the ſoil: Firſt, for canker eaten, that is uſually at the root, which is eaten by worms; the cure is to anoint it with tar and Herb-graſſe, and pouring ſome Chamber-lie on it, which will cure the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and keep the worm from eating of the root any more. Secondly, If they be earth bound, then open the earth from about the root in <hi>September,</hi> and lay a little chaff or bran about it, and ſo let it lie till <hi>February,</hi> and then take the chaff away, and put good mould in the room. Barrenneſſe in a Vine is ſometimes the cauſe of its too deep planting, and in the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe of the earth; if the cauſe be in the earth, it is ſoon remedied with the taking that away, and bringing better in its ſtead; if it be too deep and an old Vine, there is little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: I am forc'd to end here.</p>

                  <p>This plant is ſown of the ſeed, or ſet of the ſlip; the ſlip is that which ſpringeth from the old mother-root, which may be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called young plants: the time for the getting and ſetting of theſe is in the beginning of <hi>March</hi> at the firſt ſpringing, or in <hi>September</hi> after the old branch decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. The place of ſetting of them (if you have a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity) is in beds by themſelves laid out at two foot and an half in breadth, two rows on a bed, each plant afoot aſunder; the earth would be very rich, becauſe the plant is of a ſpeedy growth, and where it is once ſet it alwayes continues, yet the old plant dieth being ſix years old, and ſendeth young ſuckers from its ſides, which keepeth the bed alwayes flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing; and (as I ſaid before) if the earth be not made rich at the firſt planting, it cannot be eaſily hope afterward, becauſe the plant ought not to be removed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve that the branches of Angelica dieth

every year, and beareth a ſeed in like manner as the Parſnip doth, and the ſeed is much like it, but that it is thicker and weightier, it hath a ſtronger ſent than the herb, and as much vertue, and ſo it is great profit to ſow or plant Angelica near any Market Towns where there live any Apothecaries or ſtrong Water men, for it is the excellenteſt of all Herbs for Waters or Cordials, and commonly ſold at a dear rate.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In ſowing of it, it is to be noted, that it hath a peeviſh nature, for if you take never ſo much pains and care with it it will not grow, and yet ſometimes as it ſhades na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally of it ſelf, ſo it will come up if the plants grow in a moiſt place; therefore I adviſe you to caſt the ſeed in a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty moiſt place in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> raking of it lightly, and by the next Spring ſome of this ſeed will come up, and ſome the next year after; every <hi>Michaelmas</hi> take theſe plants out of that place, and ſet them in beds, the firſt year they will be worth little, the ſecond year they may be cut, and the third year it beareth ſeed: This is as much as need to be done or underſtood in the ordering of Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica.</p>

                  <p>This Herb is to be ſown only in the Spring, not in beds in a quarter where pot-herbs are ſown, but in a bed by it ſelf; and if the ground be good the ſeed cometh up the ſixth day, and by <hi>Auguſt</hi> it cometh to flower, according to the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and when the Winter cometh on it periſheth, but whileſt it is young it is very good in Sallets, and it is a good pot-herb at all times, whilſt it is green.</p>

                  <head>Herb graſſe.</head>
                  <p>Herb-graſs or Rue: It is a common Herb, yet there is great difficulty in the planting of it, for it will not grow in any place, let the earth be never ſo good, for where it doth like it groweth very ſlowly, and ſo doth all ſorts of Herbs and trees that have moſt vertue in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is to be obſerved, that this Herb is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated of the ſlip only, for it never beareth any ſeed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take the obſervations in the planting of it, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>September</hi> get the ſlips of this Herb, which muſt be ſlipt from the body, and not from the branches; this obſerved, then look out a convenient border, either under a wall, a hedge or a pale, to the end that it may have ſhadow, and if it be poſſible under the ſhadow of a Bay-tree; for this Herb
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57633:99"/>
is an hot Herb, and delighteth leaſt in the Sunne of all others; as for example, Pulſe which is cold, as Muſmilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Cucumbers, theſe are cooler, and deſire the benefit of the Sun, and heat of manure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You ſee it is plain, that Herb-graſs requireth a ſhady place, where it may have the Sunne only ſome ſmall part of the day, then ſer it (as I told you) in a ſhady border, and let the earth be very good, though Authors have ſaid that it abhorreth dung, yet I have found by continual expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that dung well qualified maketh it proſper mightily, ſo nothing remains but that you ſet it ſo, and it will proſper very well; but the firſt year and the ſecond it will grow but very ſlowly, till it be well rooted, and afterward it will flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for nine or ten years, if no accident befall it (as ſome ſuppoſe) that if an evil woman break any of it, that it will ſoon fade and die preſently after; if it be ſo, my judgement is, that there be few or no women can break off this Herb, but it muſt of neceſſity die: To prove whether it be ſo or no, it would take up an extraordinary Diſcourſe, which I ſhall wave, and leave this vertuous Herb to be propagated by your care for your uſe and profit.</p>

                  <p>The way of propagating of it is of the ſlip, which hath part of the root; the time for doing of it is either in the Spring, or in the fall, according as opportunity ſhall beſt ſerve: The manner of it is without any difficulty, even as I told of Betony, and ſo done, it proſpereth very well, and ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every year after.</p>

                  <p>There is only two ſorts, that is, the yellow and the green; they differ not in nature, though in vertue: one direction will ſerve for both in the propagating of it, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57633:100"/>
therein I ſhall be very brief. The beſt and the eaſieſt way for raiſing Hiſlop is of the ſeed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The ordinary way of raiſing of it of the ſeed, is in the later end of <hi>April;</hi> the place fit for it is in beds two foot and an half in breadth, in the quarter with the ſweet Herbs, in that form, as you may ſee in the draft-work in the beginning of this Treatiſe: I ſhall ſave the labour to write the manner of ſowing of it, but ſo as Baſil is ſown, ſo is this.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond way of ſowing of it is in drils, round beds, wherein is Tulips, and other Flowers of bullous-roots; the ſeed in like manner is ſown in drils, for the diſtinguiſhing of knots, either diviſion-work, or running-drafts. Now take notice, that Hiſſop-ſeed thus ſown, or any other way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thinly covered; it cometh up ſuddenly, and by the later end of the Summer it will come to ſeed, if you cut it not; but I adviſe you to cut it every fortnight, after it is grown to a handfull high, for it is for profit, pleaſure, and for the preſervation of the Herb; for that which is kept from ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will flouriſh ſeven or eight years, and the other not half ſo long.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This Herb may be ſet of the ſlip, at that time, manner and place, as was ſaid of the ſeed, and it will flouriſh accordingly; if it be well watered at the firſt planting, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward if the ſeaſon be dry.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Hiſſop is the beſt of ſtrowing Herbs, both for ſent and for growth, and being diſtilled the water of it is very precious.</p>

                  <p>The way of planting of it for profit, as many do now plant three or four Acres of it (more or leſſe according to their opportunities and abilities) would take up a large Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and very probable I might outrun my judgement in ſome particulars: Thoſe that are Plantaginers of it differ in the way and judgement of planting of it; ſo I will wave the quantity, and ſpeak of the nature and quality.

becauſe I think that thoſe need not my judgment that plant ſuch great quantities, ſo take the way of planting of a bed for a houſhold uſe as followeth:</p>

                  <p>This herb which is known ſo well to be planted of the ſlip only, with little labour but it yeeldeth more profit: the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt time for the planting of it, is in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> ſo that it may take root before the dry weather cometh; and it is alſo obſerved, that the ſooner of the year it is planted, the longer it will continue before it decayeth.</p>
                  <p>For the planting of it, though it be ſuch an ordinary thing, yet I have ſeen errors in it, that is, they plant it too thick, for ſome I have ſeen plant three rows in a border, of two foot and a half in breadth, when one is enough, therefore I adviſe thoſe that ſet it, to ſet but one, each ſlip near half a foot aſunder, and alſo obſerve to twiſt the nether end of the ſlip.</p>

                  <p>Now for the ordering of it I will be ſhort; it is thus: In the Spring or the fall get ſome ſuckers of this Herb, and ſet in a place that you ſee convenient for ſuch a purpoſe; let it be but well watered at firſt, it proſpereth and continueth alwayes with you in that place, and ſpreadeth and encreaſeth very much.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, For the propagating of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Roſemary, I will ſpeak of that briefly: Of ſeed and ſlip this Herb is raiſed, and I think I may very well wave the Diſcourſe of the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it of the ſeed, ſeeing the Herb is ſo plentifull, and ſlips any where may be had where there are any Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>

Now followeth the manner of ſetting of it thus: Prepare borders of good earth, either round a quarter of Herbs, or in ſtrait borders in quarters; if the earth be barren it muſt have good ſtore of rotten dung: This obſerved, lay it into two foot and an half beds or borders, and ſet three chaſe of the ſlips, each chafe eight inches diſtance, and the ſlips half a foot aſunder; in ſetting of them twiſt the nether end of the ſlip, and thruſt it down ſo deep that there be but three inches appear above the earth. The time for this is almoſt betwixt <hi>January</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> but that which is ſet after the middle of <hi>March,</hi> muſt be continually watered, or elſe it will never take root, and that which does by induſtry, will decay ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than that which is ſet in <hi>February,</hi> and will not endure the Winter half ſo well: we have experience that cold Winters will kill Roſemary by this laſt paſt, as many Gardeners about <hi>London</hi> can witneſs by wofull experience.</p>

Firſt, <hi>China</hi> Rubarb which Phyſicians make ſuch divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in names, and quoil about the nature of it; ſo that they ſay, it is unpoſſible to produce any plants in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> clymate, to be ſo vertuous, as that which comes out of its naturall Countrey: But I will not diſpute this, but proſecute the raiſing of it as briefly as may be.</p>
                  <p>The ſeaſon fit for the ſowing of it is in the beginning of <hi>April;</hi> the place muſt be where it may have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Sunne, and a ſhelter from the cold, the earth as looſe, and as fat as may be; ſuch a place provided, caſt it up into a bed, and prick in the ſeeds half an inch deep; ſo done, let the bed be ſheltered with a mat at nights, and in three weeks ſpace the ſeed will come up by the latter end of <hi>May;</hi> the plants need not be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered till the next Winter following, and then it muſt be ſheltered likewiſe, and in the Spring following it would be tranſplanted into a like earth, and that Summer ſome of it will ſpindle to ſeed, and the third year it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to its full growth; the fifth year it hath its whole vertue; the vertue is in the root chiefly, and then it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up.</p>
                  <p>Monks Rubarb, and baſtard Rubarb, may be raiſed of the ſeed at that time as I told you of the <hi>China</hi> Rubarb, with leſſe curioſity and trouble, eſpecially the baſtard Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb. True it is, I ſhould inſiſt upon ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars further in the ordering of this, but that I have been ſomething large in the information, ſo that I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any more time about it, but muſt ſpeak ſomething of others.</p>

                  <p>Of Spare-mints there are two ſorts, that is, ſmooth Mint, and crudled Mint, or crumpled Mint.</p>
                  <p>The way of propagating of them both, is of the root, and in this manner, for the ſaving of labour, and the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the work for to have the roots to grow, that is
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57633:107"/>
thus; when you have prepared a bed or a border where you have a deſire they ſhall grow, then make three or four drils in the bed with a planting Hoe, then lay your roots into thoſe drils with the Spire end upward; ſo done, fill up the drils again with the head of your rake; let this be done either in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> and thoſe roots will ſpring without any further care, and never leave you nor forſake you.</p>

                  <p>If you pleaſe to look into the Alphabetical Table, there is Crokus named, and in the page Saffron-Crokus expreſt; Now what is to be underſtood by this is, that Saffron-Crokus, or Crokus, differeth not in ſhape from this, but in colours, as blew Crokus and yellow, which are ſometimes called Saffron-Crokus, becauſe they differ not in form, but in vertue.</p>

                  <p>This Herb or Flower is planted of the ſucker from the root, for it never beareth ſeed: The time that it is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly planted in is preſently after its flowering, which is in <hi>April;</hi> the manner is without any difficulty; for if the root be committed to the earth it will grow ſo, therefore there needeth nothing, but to ſet every plant decently in order, ſo that every plant may have its proportion of ground which would be four inches.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Obſerve that in the gathering of the Saffron that you muſt be carefull to ſee to it every morning, for the Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron cometh up in the middle of the Flower like horns as it were, and the Sunne cauſeth them to periſh two or three dayes, therefore it is that I counſell you to be watchfull over it.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, There is two ſeaſons for it, the one is in mid-<hi>April,</hi> and the other at the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> that which you ſow or ſet in <hi>April,</hi> eſpecially that which is ſown, will not come to flower that ſummer, and ought not to be cut till the latter end thereof, becauſe it ſhould ſpread the ground and keep the Sun from ſcorching of it, at the latter end of the next ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer following it will come to flower and ſeed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For ſowing or ſetting of it in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> I hold this the beſt ſeaſon, for it will endure the winter, and will have taken good root againſt the ſummer, and be fit to be cut for the ſeverall uſes when the other is ſown; now obſerve

that this be ſown and ſet in a decent manner, and I ſhall ſpare the ink and paper to ſet it down, but ſee as Hyſop is done ſo is this.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing that is to be taken notice of is, that it be kept clipt, ſo that it bring forth neither Flower nor ſeed, for if it does it will not continue half ſo long, and this you may know to be true by the Garden knots that are ſown or planted with it, and that being clipt alwayes to make it ſhow pleaſant, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth freſh ſeven or eight years, when that which is ſown in beds and let run to ſeed continueth not above half ſo long.</p>

take your ſuckers from your Currant trees, and if you have not ground ready for them to tranſplant them where they ſhould alwayes grow, then plant them in a piece of ground by themſelves at a foot diſtance, which may be fitly called a nurſery, let them ſtand there while that time twelve moneth, then plant them into the middle of Strawberry beds at a yard diſtance, each tree bound to a ſtake, ſo that the wind may not break them, and put them out of uniform order.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly obſerve, let theſe ſuckers be taken yearly from the roots of the old bearers, or otherwiſe they hinder them from being fruitfull, they muſt be pruned alſo, which is to cut away the ſuperfluous branches which run above the reſt and never bear fruit.</p>

                  <head>Roſes.</head>
                  <p>Omitting thoſe that I ſpoke of in the Garden of pleaſure, the reſt are theſe, the Roſe of Monday, the damask Roſe, the red Roſe, and the white Roſe, and ſome tell me of a monethly Roſe, but I was never ſatisfied whether there is ſuch a one yea or no neither by experience nor theoditary, therefore I muſt wave it and ſpeak of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Of the Roſe of Monday; this Roſe is in all parts like the damask Roſe, only the colour maketh the difference, for this Roſe is damask and red ſtriped, the propagating of it is by ſlip or inoculation: if you are not experienced in inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then be pleaſed to turn back to the place where it treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the province Roſe, and there is a guide ſet down for it, and for the directions for ſetting the ſlip, I hope I may omit the pains for to ſet it down, for a wiſe man may well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand one thing by another.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ordering of the damask Roſe, I will give a few plain directions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If you have them already and would willingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe them, in the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> cut off all the young ſprouts as come from the body, and pluck up all ſuch as ſhoot from the root, then cut them all at a foot in length; now in the planting of theſe ſlips I ſhall omit that curioſity of caſting up of beds for them, as I and others have done, ſo I will give you an eaſie and a profitable way, which is to lay a piece of ground levell well raked, then ſet in thoſe ſaid ſlips in that ground by a direct line at fifteen inches aſunder, a moneth after, you may caſt ſome Turnip-ſeed upon that ground, and it will not be only profitable for the table, but alſo ſhadow the face of the ground, and keep it from being too dry.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Theſe ſlips thus planted will have taken root by that time twelve moneth, and be grown to a greater ſtature, and may be tranſplanted into borders round quarters of herbe, or elſe a whole quarter or quarters of them, and Strawberries caſt into beds, ſo that the Strawberries may grow under the Roſes, and the Roſe-trees to ſtand at three foot diſtance one way and five foot the other, that the Strawberry beds may
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57633:113"/>
be three foot broad and two foot paths between, and the Roſe-trees ſupported with ſtakes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Roſes may be raiſed of the ſeed, but this Roſe with more caſe than any of the reſt, many Authors have ſet down certain wayes for it which are contrary to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; if I thought that any man were ſo undiſcreet to put it in practice, I would lay down ſome arguments for to prevent ſuch errors.</p>
                  <p>Next for the propagating of the red Roſe, which is by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the youngeſt ſhoots from the oldeſt ſtanders, which cuttings ought to be a foot long, and if they be leſſe they may grow very well; before I ſhow you how to ſet them, prepare borders of two foot and a half in breadth, and paths of two foot between; the beds being laid a foot high, then ſet a line upon the border, ſo that there may be three rows of ſlips ſet in the border proportionably, then prick in the cuttings by the line ſide eight inches one from another, and ſo deep that one half be in the ground and the other above, let them ſtand ſlope-wayes in this bed or border, they may alwayes remain, for they are not to be removed without great hinderance of the bearing of them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Some directions for the cauſing of Roſes to flower plentifully, that is to cut them with a pair of ſhears the firſt full Moon after <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day; what is to be obſerved in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is, that ſuch ſprouts that were of the laſt years growth, be cut off at the heighth of the old bearers; whereunto I adde, that if Roſes be planted in wet ground, that they will never flower plentifully, therefore obſerve to ſet them in the dryeſt ſoyl.</p>

                  <p>This plant riſeth near to five yards in heighth, ſpreading with many branches toward the top, which maketh it to <note place="margin">Deſcrip.</note> ſtand in a ſtately form, the leaves of this tree are green as the Bay-trees, and keep ſo all the year, they are alſo of the ſame ſhape though not half ſo big, the ribs of them are ſomething reddiſh, and the bark of the body of the tree is of a reddiſh green colour ſomething rough and dented, the middle of the tree as to ſay amongſt the branches are bare and without ſprouts or leaves, at the top ſpringeth berries upon ſtalks, when they are ripe they are abſolutely like Strawberries, and may be eaten though not half ſo good, yet they are uſually eaten.</p>
                  <p>There is no way that I could find of propagating of this tree, but by ſlips taken from the branches and ſet in good mould, to the end that they may take root and become trees, but moſt of them thus done ſeldome take root.

               <head>Artichokes.</head>
               <p>By their diſtinct kinds, form and vertue, are called thus; the Protector head, the Rabits head and the Dogs head; or otherwiſe, red, white, and brown Artichokes; the red and the brown are propagated by art and care to a huge greatneſs in reference to thoſe that are and grow naturally.</p>
               <p>The way of propagating of Artichokes is of the ſlip in an extraordinary rich ſoyl, not as it is naturally rich but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved with dung, for they delight in any ſtiff clayey ground ſo that it hath but dung enough.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The time and manner of ſetting of them is thus, when the ground is digged and laid levell or even, then ſet the ſlips in half a foot deep by a line, ſo that they ſtand two foot and a half aſunder: the ſeaſon that is beſt for it ſome ſuppoſe it to be in <hi>September,</hi> but experience tells us, that the laſt winter moſt or all of thoſe ſlips thus ſet were killed, therefore I think it beſt to ſet them in <hi>March,</hi> in that manner as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The preſervation of them from periſhing in the winter, is to ſhelter them from froſt and ſnow, and that is done by trenching of them and laying of new dung about them which will not freez, but will keep the plant from the froſt.</p>
            </div>

               <p>If I ſhould enter upon an hiſtoricall diſcourſe of this herb I ſhould never have done, I will only acquaint you that this herb is raiſed of the ſeed, and uſually after this manner; they prepare beds of good earth of three foot a breadth, and two foot path between in breadth likewiſe, then caſt in the ſeed thinly thereon, this is done in the latter end of <hi>March;</hi> the next <hi>September</hi> they tranſplant theſe plants, the ſeedlings into beds of the ſame breadth of extraordinary rich ſandy ground, the next ſummer following it ſpindleth into ſmall ſpindles which are worth little, but the third Spring after its ſowing riſeth good Sparrow-graſs: now note, that every <hi>September</hi> rotten dung muſt be laid upon the beds, and in the beginning of <hi>March</hi> to be raked off, and the ground looſened
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57633:115"/>
with a forkabout the plant, for if they ſhould do it with a ſpade it would cut the roots.</p>
               <p>The way of producing of it early is done by raiſing of it upon hot beds; I will permit a little time to ſhow you how and when, in the latter end of <hi>February</hi> make a hot bed of horſe-dung, of three foot high and three foot broad, and of a length according to your Sparrow-graſs you intend to ſow; the bed thus made, then lay-fine mould atop of it ſo that it may raiſe it two inches higher, ſo done take up the oldeſt Sparrow-graſs roots that you have, that are like to decay where they ſtand, and lay them one by one as thick as you can upon this hot bed, lay as much more earth upon the roots as is under them, cover the bed with ſome litter, the fourth day the roots will ſprout up young Sparrow-graſs, by reaſon of the heat of the dung, and the ſteme being kept in with the litter which cauſeth this haſty growth: now obſerve, that when theſe ſprouts are thus ſhot up, the litter muſt be took away, and pent-houſes of rods made over the beds, whereon you ſhall lay Mats to preſerve them from the froſt and cold; remember to give the bed air once a day if the weather be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable: ſo done you may pull good Sparrow-graſs from the bed at the fortnights end.</p>

               <p>Are long and ſhort, the long are counted the beſt both for ſalleting and pickleing: the raiſing of them is both alike, all the art that I ſhall endeavour to lay down in few words here is, the raiſing of them timely for ſalleting, for thoſe that come late in the ſummer are only uſed for Gerkings: to inſiſt upon the raiſing of them early, about the middle of <hi>March,</hi> make beds of new horſe-dung of two foot and a half high, and near that breadth, then make a band of ſtraw or hay and pin it upon the uppermoſt part thereof, then lay ſome fine ridled mould atop near three fingers thick, then cover this bed with ſome litter or ſtraw, and make a pent-houſe over it as I told you of the Sparrow-graſs bed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt lye Mats, then ſteep your Cucumber-ſeed in milk and ſuet for four and twenty hours, by that time the bed will be hot, then prick in your ſeeds at two fingers diſtance upon the bed, and lay on the litter again; be carefull afterward for once or twice a day to ſee that the bed be not too hot, for then it will force gemination too ſoon and the plants will never hold it: now obſerve, that if the ſeed appeareth before the third day, then that bed is too hot and too haſty a geminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but if they appear not before the fourth or fifth day, then thoſe plants are like to come to good, if they be carefully looked after for the future, and that is to ſet glaſſes over them all night and in boiſterous dayes till towards the middle of <hi>April,</hi> then tranſplant them from that bed, into holes or trenches wherein is laid new horſe-dung, and Pigeons-dung if it may be had, with four inches of good mould atop of it, then ſet four Cucumber plants in the compaſs of a Muſmilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-glaſs, and with a glaſs over each four plants; let theſe plants be watered with ſuch water as hath ſtood in the Sun, wherein hath been ſteeped horſe-dung; by theſe directions, if you had any knowledge or inſight in it before, you may have Cucumbers fit for a ſallet by mid-<hi>May</hi> if the Spring be any thing favourable, and that is counted great rarities.</p>
               <p>The ſecond and the ordinary way of raiſing Cucumbers for ſallet to have them about mid-ſummer, is to raiſe them in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57633:116"/>
mid-<hi>April</hi> upon a hot bed, not ſo hot as the former, only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Mats, and the firſt week in <hi>May</hi> tranſplanted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to holes, as was ſaid before: you need not go to the charge to cover them with glaſſes, for any thing elſe will ſerve that will only keep the froſt from them anights; let theſe be watered as the former every evening or every other evening if it rain not, I cannot ſtay to treat upon every particular.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The ready way of planting or ſowing of Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-ſeed is, to prepare holes which will hold a Wheelbarrow of good rotten dung or more, let each hole be four foot aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and earth atop of the dung, and then half a ſcore ſeeds pricked in each hole, but if four of them come up it is enough, and what more cometh up, pull them away or elſe they will hinder one another and come to nothing: note that the time of ſowing is about <hi>May</hi> day, let theſe be well watered the ſummer following and gelded, and by <hi>Auguſt</hi> their fruit will come to perfection.</p>

               <p>The ſecond ſeaſon of the ſowing of Colliflower-ſeed, is in the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> in beds of very good mould; being ſown there and come up, at a moneths end tranſplant them into another bed of three abreadth, ſetting each plant at a hands breadth aſunder in ranges by a line, then make a ſhelter over them with ſticks and mats, to ſhelter the plants from the froſty nights the winter following, the next Spring tranſplant them in like manner as I told you of the other, and by mid-ſummer or ſoon after they will come to flower.</p>

               <p>Firſt of all obſerve the ſeaſon, that is, if you ſow ſeed for winter plants to be planted out of the Spring, do it at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in a light earth, the Moon being at the full, five or ſix weeks after tranſplant them into another earth, laying or ſetting them at half a foot diſtance, to the end that each plant may have its proportion of ground and be reſtrained of its high growth; at the latter end of <hi>February,</hi> and in <hi>March</hi> at the full Moon, theſe may be planted into quarters of earth, where they may ſtand at a yard diſtance: now note, the beſt ground for theſe to be planted in, is the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt clay or mawm earth, that is, with this proviſoe, that there be abundance of dung under it; theſe Cabidges muſt be kept whole with earth about the ſtalks as the weeds riſe, and the under leaves ſtripped off to cauſe the Cabidges to grow the greater.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, You may ſow this ſeed in <hi>March</hi> for winter Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts, for they may be tranſplanted about the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> or in the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> in manner as aforeſaid. I cannot go farther, I have ſpoken more than I intended.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:57633:119"/>
And about theſe Muſmillions here is ſuch a deal of charge, care, quoil and trouble, ſuch a multitude of arguments, and ſuch abundance of vain conceits, ſo that if I could have made an Almanack of my pate, and ſet down all that I have heard of them, it would be a ſufficient ſubject of it ſelf; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if I ſhould ſet down all that I have known to be put in practice, I believe that twenty pages would not contain it, ſo I ſhall paſſe it having no time nor liberty, neither deſire to inſiſt upon it for the preſent; but in the future I hope I ſhall: So only take theſe few Experiments, whereby I have raiſed Muſmillions, and ſometimes miſt, as the proudeſt, and the greateſt conceitedſt man hath done, which hath been actual in this thing.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing conſiderable in the propagating of Millions is the ſeaſon, and thereabout men differ in their judgments; for ſome would have them raiſed at the latter end of <hi>February,</hi> or at the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> ſome at the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and others not till the latter end thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this hath been put in practice, and every one of them have had good ſucceſs at one time, and bad at another. Now my experience and my judgement is this, that is, it is beſt to raiſe them at the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> or about the beginning of <hi>April.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The wayes for it are various and ſtrange, and one mans judgment differeth from another, in this more than any other thing which is practical in a Garden. I cannot ſtand to diſpute, but take my following experience for your dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>At that time as I told it is beſt to raiſe them, then make a hot bed of horſ dung, in manner (as I told you) for Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers, but let it be ſomething higher, and ſomething thicker, at the top thereof if you lay ſome bran it would be much the better; ſo done, get the fineſt earth that may be, and cover the bed with it two inches thick or more, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of it from tumbling down (as I told you of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber beds) then get your glaſſes, and ſee how many of them will ſtand conveniently upon the bed, then clap them down, the rim of them makes a mark, within that circle put a dozen or more of ſeeds, after the bed hath ſtood a day and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57633:120"/>
been covered with litter, and in the meantime the ſeeds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſteeped in milk, then ſet the glaſſes over them, lay litter between them, and over them, and round the bed, and mats upon bended poles over that, be watchfull the ſecond and third day that the bed be not too hot, and if it be, then take away the litter from the ſides, and make holes alſo in the ſides to let out the ſteem, and when it is qualified that it be not over-hot, then lay the litter there again, about the fourth day, if it be ſo ordered, the ſeed cometh up, which if it come up ſooner it ſeldom holdeth, and if it lieth much longer it ſeldom cometh up at all; but I will paſſe that the ſeed come up (as was ſaid) give the plants a little air once a day, not by taking of the glaſſes clean away, but by lifting up of one ſide of them for an hour or two, or ſuch a matter, which will give them a green colour, and ſtay them for ſpending of their ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Secondly, After the plants have been a fortnight ſprung up, it is very probable that they may ſeem to decay or ſtand at a ſtay, the reaſon is, becauſe they want that ſupply of heat which the bed did afford to them before, becauſe it hath ſtood long, and the heat is qualified; the cure is to get new horſ-dung and litter one amongſt another, and lay very thick againſt the ſides of the bed, then under every glaſſe thruſt down a ſmall ſtick to the bottom of the bed, the uſe of it is to let up the heat and ſteem which is at the bottom, and that which the new laid dung and litter have infuſed in up, at thoſe holes into the glaſſes, which doth warm, moiſten and revive the plants.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The plants having ſtood here a moneth, and preſerved with this care, then prepare beds or ridges to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplant them in, as followeth. Firſt, Let the place be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary warm, ſheltered from all winds; then make your beds thus; Get hay and litter, and make a trench ſome half a foot deep and a yard wide, then lay the litter or hay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſo that it may be half a foot thick; this done, get new horſ-dung, ſo much of it, that it may raiſe it two foot in height above the litter ridg faſhion; that done, get ſticks of a yard long or thereabouts, as big as a walking cudgel, drive them into the middle of the bed at a yard diſtance, ſo low
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57633:120"/>
that there be but a hands breadth appear above the dung; this obſerved, caſt the earth that licth by againſt the ſides of the bed, then riddle fine mould, and lay it atop at a hands breadth in thickneſs, lay a little ſtraw thinly upon this bed, and the next evening after tranſplant your Million plants four and four together thereon, and obſerve that they be ſet round thoſe ſticks, as I told you of, and a glaſs over each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of plants, upon your glaſſes lay ſtraw or mats made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The plants thus planted out, they are there to remain, and not to be ſtirred any more; and in this, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the governing of them afterwards, you are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der three things; the firſt is, That they have air once a day, and covered again at nights; let not the glaſſes be took quite away, but be moved up on one ſide, while ſuch time as the Million vines grow too great for the glaſs, then you may take them away in ſome part of the day, and ſet them over the fruit in the night. Secondly, Watering is not the leaſt thing to be conſidered in it, both as for the time, manner, and for the ſubſtance of it; the beſt time to do it in, is in the morning ſoon after the Suns approaching; the manner of it is not to pour it all over the plant with a watering pot, as ſome do, but to put it in a hole, or holes by the root, ſo that it may ſoak leiſurely carrying an earthly ſubſtance with it; the water alſo muſt have the ſubſtance of Pigeons-dung, and horſ-dung in it, and ſtanding in tubs in the ground, ſo that the Sun may have power upon it to qualifie the coolneſs of it, and to clarifie that unnatural property that it hath in it for the advancing of ſuch a pulſe as Millions, that delight on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heat and moiſture. The third is, That they be gelded, and that is to nip off the leaves and fruit that ſpring very thick leaving but half as much as Nature commonly putteth forth upon every vine; the end that this is done for, is to cauſe the fruit to come to perfection the ſooner which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, and alſo to have it the larger and ripe the ſooner.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ordinary wayes of raiſing Muſmillions, or as I may more fitly ſay, the principle things to be obſerved, yet there remains in each principle many particulars, which
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57633:121"/>
when time ſhall ſerve I ſhall treat of at large: in the mean ſpace take theſe plain and ſerious truths, as you ſhall find them if they be put in practice.</p>

For the firſt, conſider the quantity of ſeed, and the quality of the ground, if it be ſtiff it requireth the more ſeed, and to be ſown the ſooner; if it be light, the latter and the leſſer quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſeed will ſerve: to guide you the better therein, ten pound ſoweth an acre for large Onions, which are to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with hoes of three inches in breadth, ſo that every Onion may have ſix inches compaſs to grow in: The ſeaſon for ſowing of them in, is the firſt full Moon in <hi>March;</hi> another ſeaſon is to ſow them the firſt full Moon in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> ſo that they may be Scalions by the next <hi>Eaſter,</hi> but they never ſerve for dry Onions.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, To cleanſe theſe Parſnips from weeds after they be come up, it is better to do it with a hoe than to weed it by womens hands, for when they are hoed it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the Parſnips where they be too thick, which doth as much hurt as weeds, conſidering they have not room to grow one by another, it alſo looſeneth the earth, when weeders would beat it down, and make it the harder; and that which is more, an acre of Parſnips will be hoed three times for the price that it will be weeded once.</p>

               <p>It were needleſs for me to ſet down the order of planting of them, ſeeing it is not generally to be put in practice, for I have not ſeen of them but in thoſe places which I named, and it were vanity for me to give them directions.</p>

               <p>Are known of moſt Countrey people, and I may ſay that there are few of them but would have great and ſound Pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins if they took this advice; about <hi>May</hi> day or a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, make a bed of Cow dung and Swines-dung, of a foot high and three or four foot in breadth, and as long as you pleaſe, lay thereon ſo much earth as will raiſe it an inch higher, then prick in your ſeeds afoot one from another, ſo that they may have room to grow, then lay a little chaff atop of the bed for keeping of the ground and the plants moiſt, and when the plants are come up, water them with ſuch water as ſtandeth by a dunghill once or twice a week, this done I hope by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas</hi> that you will have Pumpkins as big as a Kilderkin of Beer, and being baked and well buttered is good chear.</p>

            <head>The Concluſion.</head>
            <p>I Shall (as it fits the Work and the place) conclude my Treatiſe upon the working of Nature and the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſeed Royall.</p>
            <p>In the workings of Nature (as God hath created and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed it to ſtand) Man is in reſpect of properties and motions no leſs than a little World, I may not write down thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and motions, for if I did then my Concluſion would be larger than my Book; but to be ſhort, I find that if a man could rightly know himſelf he might comprehend all things elſe in the Creation, yea the Creator himſelf; all wiſe men witneſs this truth againſt ſuch as are Atheiſts either in opinion or practice, who hold ſuch a ſleepy-headed conceit, that the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57633:124"/>
Creation was from eternity, and that all things comes from the courſe of Nature. For the firſt of theſe, the Scriptures make known to the weakneſs of our capacity how it was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but they that are Atheiſts believe not the Bible, then let them learn how to confute or confirm theſe obſervations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Canſt thou behold any building or artificial work ſo rare,</l>
               <l>But preſently conclude that the band of an Artificer was there?</l>
               <l>Canſt thou ſee the Earth ſo great, the Firmament ſo wide,</l>
               <l>The Ocean Seas how they ebb and flow by time and tide?</l>
               <l>But preſently in thy faithleſs heart confeſs and ſay,</l>
               <l>That this great work was undone on one day;</l>
               <l>Till one by Wiſdom, Glory, Power and Strength</l>
               <l>Formed the Heavens, and the Earth at the length,</l>
               <l>And by his Wiſdom and Love created each living creature,</l>
               <l>He is the true God, or the principal of Nature:</l>
               <l>And ſo canſt thou change the nature of the Cornation-ſeed</l>
               <l>Into a hurtfull, ſtinking Hemlock weed?</l>
               <l>Then herein Gods Laws thou maiſt plainly ſee,</l>
               <l>That his work muſt be acknowledg'd in each Herb, Flower and Tree:</l>
               <l>Thus God that was and is, by his Creation we him know;</l>
               <l>And man that was his work him ſtill doth ſhow.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Secondly, They ſay, that all things come by the courſe of Nature: True, But by whom had Nature its beginning? I anſwered you that before; yet to know this better, look on the greateſt Oak-tree, and on the Acorn, ſuch as the Acorn is, ſo was once the Oak, and how an Acorn did contract the ſubſtance of the earth into its nature to bring it into ſo great a growth man knoweth not, but man knows it is ſo: ſo by the beginning of the nature of one plant and the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereof, I eaſily conceive the whole univerſal world had a beginning by a higher principle than man, which is God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They cannot be convinc'd what keepeth Nature ſtill awork: To underſtand this conſider, when once the ſimple Atheiſts eyes firſt ſaw the witty inventions of man in making of Clocks and Engines, thou couldſt not tell the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57633:124"/>
cauſe of their going, till thou waſt ſhewed the weights that went in a privy place by opening of the door unto thee, then thou diddeſt underſtand the cauſe: ſo it would be with thee, if the God of wiſdom would draw the Curtains of the skies, then the door would be opened where thou maiſt plainly ſee Gods weight of eternal glory, which ſetteth the whole courſe of Nature awork: Thus wiſe men diſcern one thing by another: then thou dull ſpirited man, humble thy ſelf for thy lack of wiſdom and reaſon, and for thy too much ignorance, and lay thy mouth in the very duſt.</p>

               <p>I know all ſenſible and unſenſible creatures doth increaſe by that ſeed which is in it ſelf: Now the Seed-Royal is mans ſeed only, by reaſon of that union which is in election to be partaker of with the Godhead: But firſt underſtand, there is a natural body, and there is a ſpiritual body, which maketh but one man, they being united together, for the ſpiritual body muſt dwell in the natural body, then it is fit the Spirit ſhould rule Nature its dwelling place: But on the contrary, the natural body keepeth the ſpiritual a priſoner in one corner of the houſe, for fear he ſhould bring him to the ſtudy and obedience of heavenly principles, then he ſhould be took off the caring and coveting for the corrupt things of this life, then Satans kingdom would be deſtroyed. There is alſo a natural ſeed, and a ſpiritual; the ſeed of the body is that which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture breedeth in the ſecret members, and it is propagated by the ſowing of it in the ſecret womb of its mother the fleſh, and when it entereth into the troubleſom world, it is nurſed up with the fruits of its mother Nature: Now the ſeed of the Spirit is that which is given a man to improve in the mind, and it is bred in the ſoul and underſtanding, and it is propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſowing of it in the treaſure of the heart, and nurſed up with the fruits of its Mother the Church, then a man muſt fence it with faith, plant it with reaſon, dreſſing of it with diligence, watering of it with grace, watching of it with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, ſheltering of it with care, weeding of it with the ſword of the Spirit, protecting of it with prayer, looking
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57633:125"/>
for the increaſe thereof with a lively hope; this done, the ſeed of the Spirit will grow up and bring forth fruit to perfection, then he might gather it with the hand of truth, diſpoſe of it with the eye of charity, ſet forth the goodneſſe of it with the tongue of praiſe; this mans perſon is cloathed with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and adorned with holineſs, his heart is full of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his lips utter knowledge, his ears encline to underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, his deſires and his deſerts are the fullneſs of love, his feet walketh in the way of peace, and at his end he ſhall be tranſlated into the Heaven of Heavens, before the bleſſed and beatifical ſight of the glorious Trinity, and there receive an immortal Crown, with power to rule in unity and love, and to reſt with Saints and Angels in joy and glory to all eternity.</p>
