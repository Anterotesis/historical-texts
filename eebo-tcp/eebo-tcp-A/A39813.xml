            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

very profitable, so for this (namely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute mans blessedness) they are wholely useless, and uneffectual, and therefore (in that respect) sheer vanity. And when a man will wring, and wrest the creatures to a wrong end, and thinks to make up his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness in them, it is but as <hi>wringing his nose, which brings forth blood,</hi> Prov. 30.33. they do but grieve his Spirit, and fill it with vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and anguish.</p>
               <p>Thus while <hi>Solomon</hi> was rifling the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (<hi>riches, pleasures,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>to find out the good of man,</hi> he solemnly protesteth to all the World, that in all his search he found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vanity, and vexation of spirit, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2.3, 11. In which respect so vain are the creatures, that he who enjoyes them at the full, may not only be weary of them, but even <hi>hate his life for the vanity, and vexation he finds in them,</hi> Eccles. 2.17. How then should that (in the fulness of it) make our life blessed, which by emptiness, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes it bitter, and loathsome? which when we have in all abundance, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, yet our selves may be altogether <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> (Psal. 39.5.) <hi>and lighter than vanity?</hi> Psal. 62.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly there is something in man which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>avours of <hi>Infiniteness</hi>; something which cannot be satisfied, or rest in any
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29514:8"/>
thing which is finite. <hi>The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing,</hi> Eccles. 1.8. Cast into the heart of man Silver as dust, heap up Gold into mountains, yet <hi>He that loveth Silver is not satisfied with Silver, nor he that loveth abundance, with increase,</hi> Eccl. 5.10. Advance an ambitious man to great honours, set him in the Throne, load his head with many Diadems, fill both hands with Scepters; let him drink down all the Kingdoms of the Earth, he will still be as thirsty as that <hi>Macedonian Monarch.</hi> Now every Nature longs for things of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with it self; hence this <hi>Infiniteness in man</hi> cannot rest till it have sound out some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which suits with it self, some infinite <hi>Good,</hi> which may satiate the longing spirit. But neither any one, nor all Creatures can exhibit an <hi>infinite good:</hi> even the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and all (in all their excellency) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned have their limits, and stints of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; Hence as the Taste in diversity of dish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es runs through many, but stayes only upon that which fully aggrates the Pallate, so the spirit of man finding defects in every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cannot settle, nor rest upon any.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, as we call not that body healthy which is one day in good temper, but many dayes sick; or that Steward wealthy, who having a rich office for a year,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29514:8"/>
at the years end is turned out into perpetual beggary; so cannot we esteem him blessed who enjoying some momentany comforts, yet himself, with them, soon perisheth in an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting curse, and misery. Happiness if it last not, is the more unhappy. Now all the things of the world are transitory, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish with the using, but the soul of man is an immortal substance. And this spirit not only survives, but re-assumes the body, so that after the moment of this present life is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, another ensues without end, or change. <hi>The spirit of a beast indeed goes downward, but the spirit of a man upward,</hi> Eccl. 3.21. <hi>It returns to God that gave it,</hi> Eccl. 12.7. These things therefore which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold way with us, but leave us in the midst, nay indeed in the first step of our journey, how can they be our inheritance, or make us blessed?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, it is not possible a man should be happy in enjoying those things, which the more he enjoyes, the less he esteems: for (as excellently that most learned Father) <hi>He cannot be called blessed who hath not what he loves, whatsoever it be, or he, who hath what he loves, if it be evil which he hath, or who loves not what he hath, be it never so good,</hi> (<hi>August. De morib. eccl. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2.) And who is so ignorant but knoweth that thus it is with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29514:9"/>
the heart of man, and all creatures. Before we enjoy them, how dearly, how highly do we prize them? what refuse we to do, or suffer that we may gain them? we long, we pine for them; we ride, we run for them; sweat, and toyl for them; venter limb, and life for them; but no sooner we obtain, but finding their emptiness, our heart goes off from them to some other object, at least nauseating what we possess, we burn in desire of what we suppose is wanting. It is with us in these adulterous lusts, as with incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Amnon,</hi> whose heart being inflamed with the beauty of <hi>Tamar,</hi> before enjoying could think of no other heaven but her eyes, and arms; but in cooler blood he more loaths than formerly he loved, as was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so sick for her, as after sick of her, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifthly, the Creatures were ever infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to us. In our first Covenant they were given to us as servants, and we to them as Lords (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.6.) In the second<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th, things present, and to come, all are ours,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21, 22. And when the <hi>Lord</hi> of all the World in his wonderful love, and special favour chose, and espoused us to himself, he endowed us with all his goods, and gave all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29514:9"/>
his servants to wait upon us in several of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; some as Caterers, to provide our diet, some as Cooks, to dress it; some as Taylers, Weavers, to cloath us; some as <hi>Physitians,</hi> to cure us; some as <hi>Musicians</hi> to refresh, and delight us; the very Heavens, as Torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers to light us; yea, even the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels of Heaven as our Guard to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us. How then can the creature possibly advance us, whose advancement is to serve us? how should that put the highest excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency (for so is blessedness) upon us, which is so far inferiour to us?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Lastly the creature is made unto us as instruments, and means of action, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (in the abundance of it) is not only burdensome, but dangerous. It is like the <hi>Spartan</hi> Iron-Money; as much as would buy one horse, would load three; As a great sayl to a little boat in rough weather, and so is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cumbersome, and makes our way heavy, or dangerous, and unwarily sinks us in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.

Nay in respect of blessedness they are so needless, that we are never so blessed as when we have least of them, and least need them. It is our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29514:10"/>
highest happiness in Heaven, that we shall neither need, nor possess food, apparel, wives, husbands, land, money, Sun, Moon, but <hi>God shall be all in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.28. Rev. 22.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But do not the creatures conferr something, and help forward our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? Who can (at least comfortably) be without them?</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a possibility (even in this life) of consisting (being, and well-being) without them. <hi>Moses</hi> was never here more blessed, than when enjoying the presence of God in the Mount, he neither had, or want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when the Apostles had nothing, neither money, shooes, nor scrip, they <hi>want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing,</hi> Luk. 22.35. <hi>Man lives not by bread but by every word of God:</hi> a lesson long since taught Gods people, when in the Wilderness they neither had nor wanted Corn, Wine, Oyle, or any supply of cloathing, <hi>&amp;c. Deut.</hi> 8.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though in this life we cannot (in an ordinary course) be without them, yet do they not make up any part of our happiness; seeing neither it, nor any part of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth either of this life, or any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it. <hi>Blessed are they</hi> (none more) <hi>that dye in the Lord,</hi> Rev. 14.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nothing in the Creature but only Gods

word, and blessing upon them is that which either fits them for us, or us to them, and so gives us some comfort from them: as being <hi>all his servants</hi> (Psal. 119.91.) <hi>going and coming at his Word,</hi> (Luk. 7.8.) They are all in his hand as instruments, which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth to good, or evil as he pleaseth. (The <hi>Assyrian</hi> was but the Axe, or Staff in his hand to chastise his rebellious Subjects, <hi>Isa.</hi> 10.5, 15.) when we have it, it works not, moves not, but by his hand. If he use not the Axe, it cannot hew; if he lift not up the staff, it cannot stirr.</p>
               <p>In a word it is with all Creatures (even the greatest rebells) as with that <hi>Balaam,</hi> Numb. 22.20. God may say Go, but <hi>that which I say, and will, that shalt thou do.</hi> And therefore they are all ready to say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, as that <hi>Prophet</hi> to <hi>Balak: If thou wouldst give me thy house full of Gold, and Silver, I cannot go beyond the Word of the Lord to do either good, or bad of mine own mind,</hi> Numb. 24.13. Thy meat will tell thee, I cannot nourish thee; thy cloaths, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not warm thee if he command not. When the <hi>Lord</hi> sayes to a <hi>Crown, Go</hi> to <hi>Sauls</hi> head, and from <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> it goeth. When he adds, <hi>Go</hi> to <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> to <hi>Ahab,</hi> &amp;c. fill them with trouble, sweep them and all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity from the face of the earth as dung:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29514:11"/>
so it doth. When he sayes, <hi>Go</hi> to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and girt him with power, peace, honour, it fails not to do it. When he sayes to the Quails, Go to those murmurers, cover their tables, nay cover the ground two cubits high, go, and fill their mouths, but not their bellies, feed them not, so it comes to pass, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.31, 32. And when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Air, neither sow, nor Reap, yet rain down bread upon my people, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish them forty years in the Wilderness, it executes his charge.</p>
               <p>Seeing then the creature is full of nothing but of emptiness, vanity, and vexation: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfying; of short continuance; least esteemed, where most enjoyed; far beneath us; and even needless; yea in their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance burthensome, and dangerous, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible they should constitute any part of mans happiness. Now Religion, Reason, nay even Sense will tell us; All this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly true, and therefore will conclude, that it is irreligious, unreasonable, sensless to rest, or build upon the creature.</p>
               <p>And therefore when in searching our hearts we find too much of this Harlotry in them, thus let us correct, and direct them.</p>

                  <p> Neither can Blessedness consist in honour, and worldly advancement.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>EArthly Honour, and Greatness in the world is like a ponderous leaden weight in an earthly vessel; it breaks out the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom: As too great a charge in a Musket, either bursting the barrel, or recoyling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the discharger. Great <hi>Babel</hi> had so blown up, and bladdered the heart of great <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> that swelling beyond the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions of man, he burst. His vast thoughts shattered his brain-pan, so that not only his Crown, but his senses fell from his head. While he soars above the pitch of man unto a God, he falls beneath the lowest degree of man into a beast, eats <hi>grass like an Oxe,</hi> his Hairs metamorphosed into Feathers; and his Nails into Claws; (<hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30, 33.) so he exemplified that infallible truth (which is therefore doubled by God) <hi>Man that is in honour abideth not, but is like beasts that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,</hi> Psal. 49.12, 20.</p>

not our own. Riches are ours rather in the dispensation, than possession. They are <hi>anothers,</hi> (Luk. 16.12.) The state in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in <hi>God:</hi> and the benefit for others, for our Brethren. God is the true Owner, Psal. 24.1. <hi>The earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.</hi> Rich men are but his Stewards. He gives substance, and takes it away at his pleasure (<hi>Iob</hi> 1.21.) and we receive to give, and distribute. As God fills the clouds to empty them upon the earth, so he poures in to the rich, to poure out to the poor, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11.1, 2, 3. And therefore a righteous Steward thus dispenseth them; <hi>He disperseth and giveth to the poor,</hi> Psal. 112.9. Even thus is it with honour. It is not our own. It is in him that gives it, not in him that receives it: and we receive it not for our selves, but for others. <hi>Promotion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from God,</hi> Psal. 75.6, 7. and ends in his people; see 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.12. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.9. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.11.

                  <p>Where lies the Portion of Man?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE <hi>Portion,</hi> or <hi>Inheritance</hi> of man, which makes him blessed, lies not so low as the highest creature. His Treasure is not buried in earth, but bagg'd up in Heaven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.33. Heaven indeed is his Store-house, but not his <hi>Portion.</hi> He that is infinitely higher than the Heavens, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26.) he <hi>whom the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain,</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.18.) he, and he alone is mans <hi>Inheritance.</hi> Man is the great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Heaven, and of the <hi>King of Heaven:</hi> and though he were made a <hi>little lower than the Angels,</hi> yet his <hi>Lord</hi> most highly advanced him, set the <hi>Crown</hi> upon his head, <hi>crowned him with glory, and honour</hi> (Psal. 8.5, 6.) <hi>and gave him dominion over the works of his hands.</hi> The gift was very great, but not proportionable to the love, or person, of the Giver. Therefore our gracious <hi>Lord,</hi> after he had bestowed all his creatures upon us to be our servants, gave us himself to be our <hi>Lord:</hi> (a gift fully, and only answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29514:24"/>
to his love) Some service is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than some command: A greater dignity to serve the <hi>King,</hi> than to command sheep. Whosoever hath tasted <hi>how good this Lord is,</hi> (Psal. 34.8.) <hi>counts all things dung, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They prefer his livery, and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est place in his house before their Princely Robes, or any earthly honour? <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.10. Even in our Creation, when he gave himself to <hi>Adam,</hi> to be his <hi>Lord,</hi> he took <hi>Adam</hi> unto himself to be his Son, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.38. therefore formed him after his own Image, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. And to what higher dignity can the most vast ambition of the Creature aspire, than to be like his <hi>Creator,</hi> his Son, and Heir?</p>
               <p>Now that our gracious <hi>Lord</hi> offers himself to be our <hi>Portion,</hi> himself frequently testifies. He often takes upon himself this title, the <hi>Portion</hi> of his people, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 51.19. <hi>their exceeding great Reward,</hi> Gen. 15.1.

He is persecuted in his Members, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4. All the wrongs all the stripes, scoffs, derisions, abuses fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his people lite upon him. For he is the shield that bears off all. The Sun is the fountain of light: and not the Ayer on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and every sublunary creature, but even those <hi>Luminaries</hi> of Heaven have no other Tapers, but what they kindle at his fire. How freely, and plentifully doth that great <hi>Light</hi> shed his beams not only through the skies, and ayer, but down to the earth, and every earthly Creature; It gilds every weed, and dung-hill: and though it lends so bountifully to all, yet it is self still as full as ever.

Hath God never made more Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants with man than one? <hi>Answ.</hi> God hath made divers <hi>Covenants</hi>; (as <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but specially two, <hi>the Old, and New,</hi> (Jer. 31.31.) or the <hi>first, and second Covenant,</hi> (Heb. 8.7.) <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. With whom did <hi>God</hi> make these <hi>Covenants? Answ.</hi> With the two <hi>Adams:</hi> the first with the <hi>first Adam,</hi> and his seed: the second with the <hi>second Adam,</hi> and his seed: the first made with a servant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29514:31"/>
a <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> in this tenure, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> (Gal. 3.12.) The second made with the <hi>Son,</hi> and therefore a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> wherein God giveth what he asketh, and worketh, what he commandeth: bids us, <hi>Live,</hi> and so gives us life, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6.) <hi>commands his Covenant,</hi> (Psal. 111.9.) and so <hi>writes it in our hearts,</hi> Jer. 31.33. Thus our new <hi>Covenant</hi> is made first, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and mediately with us through him our <hi>Mediatour,</hi> See <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.20, 21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. Was then that first <hi>Covenant</hi> broken? <hi>Answ.</hi> By the first <hi>Adam</hi> it was utterly broken, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.) and so by all mankind, (<hi>Ier.</hi> 31.32.) And hence with the root dyed all the branches, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.) And certainly never can we suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently admire, or bless that miracle of Gods mercy, in which, after that by our treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous revolture, and rebellion, we had broken Covenant, and were utterly fallen into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, and misery, he hath taken advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage (by our breach of <hi>Covenant</hi>) to make a better Covenant with us, and by our sin, and rebellion to glorifie his grace, in doing us more good than ever: that seeing we so waveringly fell in the first, we migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What is our new <hi>Covenant?</hi> and the matter of it? <hi>Answ.</hi> In a word, as <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Head,</hi> so is he also the matter of our <hi>Covenant.</hi> For whatsoever <hi>God</hi> bestows on us is in <hi>Christ,</hi> and we receive it in him; and whatsoever he requireth of us, <hi>Christ</hi> doth it in us, and we perform it in him: so he <hi>all in all,</hi> Col. 3.11. Hence he is often called <hi>our Covenant,</hi> Isa. 42.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 49.8. Observe it in some particulars: 1. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to <hi>save us from all our enemies,</hi> (Luk. 1.74.) and gives <hi>Christ</hi> to be <hi>our Salvation,</hi> Act. 13.47. He Covenants to make us bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and gives him to be what he promiseth to give, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. 2. He sees that we are filthy, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 14.3.) and therefore demands of us that we wash, (<hi>Ier.</hi> 4.14.) and be <hi>pure as he is pure,</hi> (Levit. 11.45.) He knows how unable we are to do it: For though we wash us with <hi>nitre, and take much sope, yet our

iniquity is marked before him,</hi> (Jer. 2.22.) As well can the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> change his <hi>skin, or the Leopard his spots,</hi> (Jer. 13.23.)

The great need of a thing, when he cannot subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. 2. The extream want, when he hath nothing of it. Both here meet, and that in the highest degree. First, We are, in our nature, wholly without him. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ, without God in the world, strangers to the Covenant of Promise,</hi> (and therefore) <hi>without hope,</hi> Ephes. 2.12. we have utterly lost him. As the <hi>Gileadites</hi> dealt with <hi>Iepthah,</hi> (Judg. 11.2.) we have driven him from us, thrust him out of our doors, shut our gates upon him, and even defied him: as they (Job 21.14.) <hi>Depart from us</hi>; or those in the <hi>Gosp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l, We will not have this man reign over us,</hi> Luk. 19.14. we have compelled him by our sins to forsake us, and to separate from us, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.2. <hi>We have broken him with our whorish hearts in departing from him,</hi> Ezek. 6.9. and so <hi>forced him to leave us,</hi> Isa. 2.6. 2. Our need of him is palpable. <hi>We can have nothing, do nothing, be nothing without him</hi>; for, <hi>In him we live, move, and have our being,</hi> Act. 17.28. Our wants are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, and he the only <hi>Fountain</hi> that supplies them: Our enemies also number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, strong, subtile, malicious, and he our

only <hi>Sheild</hi> that defends us. Our weakness noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: <hi>Of no strength,</hi> Rom. 5.6. All our strength, hope, comfort lies only in him. Get him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must, or perish; and seek him we must, or never get him. But wherein consists this seeking of God? In all seeking. 1. The heart seeks in the desires, and longings of it. 2. That sets it self, and the whole man on work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, and diligently to use all means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may attain what we may desire, and seek. The root is in the heart, that blades in the desire, (mark 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.12, 15.) ears, and grows fruitful in the actions, and earnest endeavours. <hi>David</hi> seeks <hi>God,</hi> How? 1. His soul thirsted, <hi>his flesh longed for God.</hi> 2. <hi>He follows hard after him,</hi> Psal. 63.1, 8. so those Saints (Isa. 26.8, 9.) <hi>in the night desire him with their soul, seek him early in the morning, waiting for him in the way of his judgements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, that which we seek must be the end of our seeking: whatsoever we seek not for it self, but for some other, we seek not it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but that other, for which we desire, and seek it. God must be sought for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; we must not in seeking him look to any thing beyond him: when we seek our <hi>Lord</hi> as the <hi>Iews</hi> sought <hi>Christ,</hi> not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

How should men seek, and find God in the wayes of ungodliness? the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Lord</hi> in all unrighteousness?

But if we seek him after our own devices, and, <hi>though we walk after the imagination of our own wicked hearts, yet dream we shall have peace</hi> (Deut. 29.19.) <hi>he will meet us, not as a man,</hi> (Isa. 47.3.) but as a Lion to tear us in pieces, where <hi>none can deliver,</hi> Psal. 50.22.</p>
               <p>And yet further (that we deceive not our selves in a matter of such consequence) we must know that this seeking of God may be considered in divers periods of it. 1.

Some perhaps will think, All this is needless: what necessity of seeking him, when he first seeks us? (<hi>Luk.</hi> 15.4, 8.) nay finds us before we seek him, (<hi>Isa.</hi> 65.1.) God indeed loveth us first, (1 Ioh. 4.19.) <hi>and in his love draws us,</hi> (Jer. 31.3.) In infinite love he gives us his Son, (Joh. 3.16.)

               <p>Thirdly, He is the <hi>Truth,</hi> Joh. 14.6. How frequently hath he promised, that if we seek we shall find (as before) and faithful is he that promiseth, <hi>who will also do it,</hi> 1 Thes. 5.24.

And observe that when for their rebellion the <hi>Lord</hi> had scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his revolting people among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and given them up to their whorish hearts, <hi>to serve wood, and stone,</hi> yet even from thence when they shall seek the <hi>Lord,</hi> they shall find him. And what is the reason that after such bitter provocations he will be found of them in their deepest misery? 1. His mercy: <hi>for the Lord thy God is a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God, he will not destroy thee.</hi> 2. His truth, and faithfulness; (<hi>nor forget the Covenant of thy Fathers which he swore unto them,</hi> ver. 31.) How then should any poor soul that seeks with lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ging miss in finding. Thou lovest him; he more (infinitely) loveth thee:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29514:43"/>
Thou seekest him, he first seeketh thee. Thou wouldst find him, he will surely find thee: thou desirest to meet him, doth not he promise to meet thee? (<hi>Isa.</hi> 64.5.) nay thou <hi>goest to meet him, but he runneth to meet thee,</hi> Luk. 15.18, 20.</p>
               <p>But that cunning, and lying Serpent, and our own unbelieving hearts will put in a barr, and lay a notable stumbling block in our way concerning this truth. They will object, It is not only apparent that many have not found the <hi>Lord,</hi> who yet have ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly sought, but the <hi>Lord</hi> himself plainly testifies, that many shall seek, and not find, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.24. <hi>They shall go with their heards, and with their flocks to seek the Lord, and shall not find him,</hi> Hos. 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. but we must know that as in other actions, so in this, that which is not right, indeed is not. It may seem to be, but is not what it seems: A lip-love is indeed no love (1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.17, 18.) A dead faith, no faith: so that seeking which is not right, is indeed no seeking.</p>
               <p>What then is that right seeking, to which God hath annexed this promise of finding? Three things are necessarily required in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make it right, and prosperous. 1. That the place, <hi>Where.</hi> 2. That the time, <hi>when.</hi> 3. That the manner, <hi>how,</hi> be all right. He that seeks Grapes of Thorns, or Figgs of

He that seeks Grapes of the Vine, and Figgs of the Figg-tree, but out of season (in Winter) seeks not in due time, and finds nothing but his own folly. He that observes time, and place, but neglects the right manner of seeking, is still out of the way of finding. <hi>The soul of the sluggard desireth, and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Where then must we seek? Not in our selves; not in our Righteousness, or works; we are meer Thorns, and Bryars, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.6.

               <p>But where shall we seek <hi>Christ?</hi> who shall ascend into heaven, to bring down the fruit of <hi>Christs</hi> resurrection, and ascention for life unto us? who shall go down to the deep to fetch thence the death of the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> and apply the vertue of it to our souls? The <hi>Apostle</hi> answers: <hi>The word is nigh unto thee in thy mouth, and in thy heart. This is the Word of faith, which we Preach. For if thou confess with thy mouth, and believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved,</hi> Rom. 10.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Christ</hi> therefore is offered thee in the Word, given by faith: the Word brings him to thee, thy faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him, holds him, leads him into the chamber of thy heart, and there he dwells with thee, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.17.

For though God never excluded a repentant, humbled, and softned heart, yet when men have despised his patience, forbearance, and offers of grace, God may justly, and doth frequently give men up to hardness, and leave them to their impenitency, to <hi>treasure up wrath against the day of wrath,</hi> Ezek. 24.13.

                  <item>1. A Sabbath is nothing else but <hi>a day of rest,</hi> separated from the labours of our earthly, and consecrated to the labours of our Heavenly callings. This (I take it) is apparent, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.10. where not only a cessation from our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vocations is required, but the <hi>sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (or keeping that day holy) is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined.</item>
                  <item>2. A Sabbath instantly after the <hi>Creation</hi> was instituted, blessed, and sanctified by God himself; and therefore (as far as I can discern) was born with the world, hath lived with it to this present, and shall never dye, but be changed into that eternal Sabbath; yea even our heavenly <hi>Father himself,</hi> thus far kept a Sabbath, that he rested that day from all his works which he made, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2.) and propounds his practice as a kind of precept to his Children, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.11.</item>
                  <item>3. By vertue of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> (and that fourth commandment in it) a Sabbath is of moral obligation to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and bound them to a necessary, and religious observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</item>
                  <item>4. A moral equity of the 4 <hi>Commandment</hi> is generally by all confessed, obliging all men to a sufficient, and convenient time for Gods Worship. Now that a Seventh-dayes

Sabbath was (in the <hi>Iewish Church</hi>) this suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and convenient time I conceive will not be denyed, neither can any (I think) yield any good reason, why a seventh day should be the equity of the Sabbath (a time sufficient, and convenient) <hi>then,</hi> and <hi>now</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient.</item>
                  <item>5. We no where find this statute of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth dayes Sabbath abrogated by the Law-giver, (who then can repeal it?) but only translated to the first day of the week: which that it is done, is apparent, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther done by <hi>Christ</hi> himself in person, or (which is equivalent) by his <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Apostles, appears not. And therefore that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of the <hi>Lords day</hi> used by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> (Apocal. 1.10.) is the fittest title which <hi>Christians</hi> can give it.</item>

unto us,</hi> (Heb. 12.7.) and so by his quickning <hi>Spirit</hi> moves, and stirs our secure, and sluggish spirits. As when the waters in that pool were troubled, healing followed, (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.4.) so when the Messengers of God have by his word stirred, and troubled us, if then we instantly step in, and take hold of his grace, health, and salvation will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly follow. But take great heed of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes (see <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.60.) If it be inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity to say unto a neighbour, it is most impious to say unto <hi>God, Go, and come again to morrow,</hi> Prov. 3.28. Saints seek early: (<hi>Isa.</hi> 26.9.) and then the promises meet them. <hi>They that seek me early shall find me,</hi> Prov. 8.17.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But some may seek <hi>early,</hi> and not find, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Answ.</hi> There is Gods day, and our day. The <hi>Lord</hi> himself <hi>riseth early, and calls,</hi> Jer. 7.25. Then if we stirr up our selves to seek, we shall find him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.1, 5. but if we let pass his day, and seek in our day, our early will prove too late. <hi>When he slew them, they sought him, and enquired ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after God,</hi> Psal. 78.34. But then he <hi>had sworn in his wrath that they should not enter into his rest,</hi> Psal. 95.11. They lived long after, but never entred.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Lastly how, or after what manner must we seek? 1. As famisht persons, with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

Thus accepted. <hi>I will give to him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely,</hi> Rev. 21.6. Now <hi>hunger,</hi> and <hi>thirst</hi> are those natural, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affections of the body, rising from a sense, and grief of want, whereby it vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, and constantly desires the food wherewith it is nourished, and grows. But as there is an inappetence, so is there also an inordinate desire of meats and drinks, rising from distemper; a disease; not hunger, but the hungry evil; not thirst, but dropsie-thirst, coveting excess, devouring rather than eating, and then vomiting, but never satisfied: Thus is it with our spirits: The true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A constancy; that is an ordinate, and seasonable return of this desire, rising not from distemper, but empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and such an emptiness as proceeds from the right use of this food, well digested into the inward man for growth. Some are full gorged with lusts, and so loath this honey comb, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.7. some very empty, but not at all hungry, as those that are dead, or deadly sick. Those <hi>Laodiceans were poor, empty, naked,</hi> but not hungry, as dreaming that <hi>they

                  </gap>y; as that Ruler (<hi>Mark</hi> 10.17, 22.) who had he been as empty of temporal living, as he was greedy of eternal life, would have willingly accepted that easie condition, to have bartered earthly for heavenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
               <p>When all these meet together in the heart, and make it hungry, they fail not to satisfie, and make us blessed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. But when they are severed, and single, they prevail nothing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We must seek with the <hi>whole heart,</hi> not divided, nor double: so if we seek, we shall surely find him, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 4.29.) And blessedness with, and in him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.2.

               <p>Thirdly, With a <hi>Washed heart,</hi> purged from the love, and dominion of sin: For as all Sacrifices (and even our prayers) are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Those Paramours of <hi>Rome</hi> will deeply swear that their Mistress is the Queen of the World, that the Sun (even the Scriptures) borrows all his beams from her eyes, that there is no Paradice but in her arms, no Heaven but in her embraces, no hope but in her anchour, no faith but in her breast, no truth but in her mouth: that <hi>if she commands Vices, and prohibits Vertues, you were bound to believe that Vices were good, and Virtues evil.</hi> So <hi>Bellarm.

               <p>Stay here awhile, and wonder. Let us take a better view of this strange love, and dealing of our <hi>Lord:</hi> let us ravish our hearts with admiration of his goodness.

                  <p> What kind of service it is which his Spouse gives unto Christ.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe hand is the bodies Steward, and Faith the souls hand. Both have a double office, either to take in, or give out, to <hi>receive, or distribute</hi> what <hi>God</hi> offers, faith takes; and gives what he <hi>demands.</hi> There is a bargain driven betwixt <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> when <hi>God</hi> himself, and his Kingdom is assured <hi>upon man</hi>; and <hi>man,</hi> and all his is passed, and made over to <hi>God</hi> by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, or sale. Our <hi>Lord</hi> hath not only laid down a price for us, even himself, (<hi>Tit.</hi> 3.14.) and bought us (as we say) out, and out (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20.) but hath also set a price upon himself, and we must come up to his full price, or never have him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We must</hi> buy <hi>that milk, hony, and feast of fat things, the sure mercies of David,</hi> Isa. 55.1. <hi>&amp;c. That gold tried by the fire, whereby we are made rich, that white raiment, that ey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> salve (the riches of the Gentils, the robe of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, the light of the world) the Lord Iesus must be bought,</hi> Rom. 3.18. <hi>We must buy the truth,</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:29514:80"/>
Prov. 23.23. The <hi>treasure in the field is bought, and that Merchant sells all that he hath to buy the goodly pearl,</hi> Matth. 13.44, 46. Hence there is a <hi>mutual vouching.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> openly <hi>voucheth us for his people,</hi> and we <hi>vouch him</hi> for our <hi>Lord, Deut.</hi> 26.17, 18. And to make the bargain sure, and infallible, large, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; <hi>Earnest</hi> is given, even that blessed, and <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> (2 Cor. 1.22. Eph. 1.14.) which binds both seller and buyer to stand to the bargain.</p>
               <p>But what is the price at which <hi>God</hi> rates himself to us. 1. He challengeth the soul. <hi>All souls are his, Ezek.</hi> 18.4. he must have the heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. <hi>all the soul, all the heart, all the might,</hi> Deut. 6.5. The whole body must <hi>be presented to him as a living sacrifice, Rom.</hi> 12.1. He hath payd for all, and so (now) we are no more our own, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20. If he call for health, wealth, life, all must be given him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. else we (as that Ruler <hi>Mar.</hi> 10) goe away empty, sad, and hopeless.</p>
               <p>But this seems to imply a contradiction: for to sell for a price, and to give freely are contraries. Now <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>given us, Ioh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>eternal life is the gift of grace, Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is by gift, and grace,</hi> Eph. 2.8. <hi>We are freely loved,</hi> Hos. 14.4. <hi>freely justified, Rom.</hi> 3.23. Certain is it, and cannot be denied, that never any thing was more freely, or
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:29514:81"/>
bountifully given. We were poor (<hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17.) able to give nothing, unable to pay due debts; and our debts infinite, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.24, 25. The <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> our Surety, hath purchased this whole possession for us, and us for <hi>God,</hi> but he also most freely given us, and all things with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. Nay even that which hereafter <hi>God demands</hi> of us, (of which only here we speak) our trust in him, love to him, fear of him, working for him, all these his most free gifts. He works all in us, and for us (<hi>Isa.</hi> 26.12.) Will, and deed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. That therefore which we give him is his own, and we cannot but confess (with that holy <hi>Prophet</hi>) <hi>All things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee,</hi> 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29.14. Indeed he commands us to buy, yet asks he neither mony, nor mony-worth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1. Our righteousness bringeth him neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, nor pleasure, <hi>Iob</hi> 22.2, 3. and 35.7. <hi>No good we can do reacheth to him, Psal.</hi> 16.2. when we give our selves, what give we but vanitie, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 39.5.) <hi>and nothing,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.11. The truth is <hi>God</hi> receives no benefit from us, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they (if we speak properly) gifts to him from us, but rather from him to us: not only because we first receive what after we give, but specially because it is a great grace, and next to himself the greatest gift he can bestow on us, that he will receive us, or any
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:29514:81"/>
thing from us. It is our infinite blessedness, and his infinite goodness, that he is ours, and how much less is it (certainly next to that) that <hi>we are his, Cant.</hi> 2.16. He calls for our bodies, and spirits: and are they out filthy, polluted, abominable? how unworthy of him? But he calls for them to wash, and <hi>cleanse them from all filthiness, Ezek.</hi> 36.26. they are dead in <hi>sins,</hi> he would have them to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them, to put his <hi>Spirit into them, Ezek.</hi> 36.27. they are old, corrupt in lusts, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22.) he would have them to renew them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. where can they be safe but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his wings? and how secure under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection? How miserable, and wretched when banished from his sight? but in his house how infinitely blessed? <hi>Psal.</hi> 65.4. How empty in his absence? but in his presence is <hi>fulness of joy, and everlasting pleasures, Psal.</hi> 16.11. And yet <hi>God</hi> calls it <hi>buying,</hi> as well because he is pleased not only to demand it, but accept it as our <hi>reasonable service,</hi> and testimonie of our thankfulness. As great persons lease out to some special servant, or favorite a fair land for the annual payment of a pepper-corn; so deals our most gracious <hi>God</hi> with us, gives us Heaven, and Earth, and himself the <hi>Lord</hi> of both, (because we have found favour in his eyes) and desires no other rent but our poor selves, and service, whose only riches
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:29514:82"/>
it is to be his inheritance, and servants.</p>
               <p>Thus the same hand of faith receives from our <hi>Lord</hi> himself, and his grace, and gives to him our selves, and service, takes from him what he graciously offers, and works for him (by love) what he justly commands. Now our work, and service to our <hi>Lord</hi> is by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self sometime contracted into one head, or body, sometime parted into three members. That which in one word comprizes our whole service to <hi>God,</hi> is <hi>holiness.</hi> This he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and straitly charges upon us, <hi>Be holy, as I am holy,</hi> (Lev. 44.45.) <hi>As obedient children not fashioning your selves according to your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer lusts in your ignorance: But as he is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.14, 15. It must be our daily work, set work, which we must continually ply, and follow, until it be perfect, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</p>
               <p>Much I desire (if it please <hi>God</hi> to furnish me with <hi>means,</hi> and you with parts) to see you bred up in all humane literature, that you may not be (as too many) a burthen only to others, meer cyphars in the world, to fill it up with idle numbers: but much more do I longue to see you trained up in the School of <hi>Christ,</hi> to be <hi>taught of him, as the truth is in Iesus. To put off the old man corrupt in lusts, and to be renewed in the Spirit of your mind, and that ye put on the new man, which is created in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:29514:82"/>
and true holiness.</hi> Eph. 4.21, 22, 23, 24. Reason gives you a formal difference from other creatures, and the polishing of it by humane learning will distinguish you from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (almost brutish) men, but religion, and pietie only maketh you <hi>Christians,</hi> perfect, and blessed.</p>
               <p>Should I say, you cannot be complete men without holiness, it might seem a <hi>paradox</hi> to carnal wisdom, but is a sure truth of <hi>Gods wisdom.</hi> For if <hi>Philosophie</hi> will teach you that a man is a reasonable creature, <hi>Theologie</hi> will assure you that man was an holy creature, <hi>framed after the likeness of God,</hi> without which likeness he is not perfect according to his creation. It is an amiable sight to behold a mind beautified with all the lovely Ideas of humane knowledg, and framed into a pleasant Garden, where all the various flowers of earthly literature are planted, rooted, and fairly flourish. But oh what a glorious <hi>Parad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

men, the spiritual from the carnal; And as in that gold with was dedicated for the work of the Temple, the form, or shape of the golden <hi>Cherubims</hi> was essential to that piece, distinguishing it from the <hi>Candlestick, snuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, &amp;c.</hi> framed of the same matter, so this <hi>renewing of the Spirit of our mind, which after God is created in righteousness, and true holiness,</hi> howsoever it be not of the substance either of body, or soul, yet is it essential to the new man, or faithful <hi>Christian,</hi> and of his being, by which he is a new creature.</p>
               <p>Secondly this purity or divine nature of man consists of an averse, nay adverse dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to sinful uncleanness. <hi>It flieth the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which is in the world through lust,</hi> (2 Pet. 1.4.) <hi>hating it,</hi> (Rom. 7.15.) <hi>loathing the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment stained with it,</hi> (Jude 23.) nay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves polluted with it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.43. And no sooner is this new life brought forth in man, but instantly it stands as adverse to sin as life to death, accounting it to be (as indeed it is, nay so feeling, and accordingly hating it) as death, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24.) a most cursed, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, divelish, hellish death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, the excellencie of holiness will clearly appear in this, that it is <hi>in man Gods likeness.</hi> To be like the <hi>Creatour</hi> is the highest pitch of honour, to which the most aspiring ambition of the creature can look.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:29514:84"/>
To be above <hi>God</hi> cannot enter into a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thought. As that excellent Father (<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust.</hi>) so reason will testifie, that <hi>every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will contend for the excellencie of God, and ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And surely if any thing in <hi>God</hi> could be more excellent than other, <hi>holiness</hi> were it. For <hi>man verily swears by the greater,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>God could not swear by a greater, he swore by himself,</hi> Heb. 6.13, 16. but when he chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out any particular Attribute in himself to swear by it, it is constantly his <hi>holiness.</hi> See, <hi>Psal.</hi> 60.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.35. <hi>Amo.</hi> 4.2. Holiness in <hi>God</hi> is his face, and beautie, frequently ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>the beautie of holiness,</hi> (Psal. 110.3.) which the faithful soul most longues after (<hi>Psal.</hi> 90.17.) and <hi>God</hi> stamps upon his beloved, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.14. And as in excellent substances their excellence consists in their puritie, when they are simple, and unmixt with ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:29514:84"/>
natures; (Thus in corporal substances gold the more pure, the more precious, and in spiritual only the pure Angels, not the impure, are glorious) so certainly in <hi>God</hi> his <hi>holiness,</hi> being the puritie of the divine es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, is the glory of it. He is <hi>glorious in holiness</hi>: (Exo. 15.11.) a glory farr surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all thought, or possibilitie of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in which regard those blessed Spirits, which stand in his presence, omitting other excellencies, but ravished with the glorious beautie of his holiness, cry out in heavenly ecsta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Herein then consists the eminency of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness above all other qualities <hi>in man,</hi> that he is not only by it, (and by it only) like unto <hi>God,</hi> but like him in that, in which <hi>God</hi> is most excellent, even in his <hi>glory.</hi> The Heathens themselves could discern a ravishing beautie in virtue, if men had but eyes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, but oh if <hi>God</hi> open to us an eye to discern these heavenly features of the divine nature, and the bright beams of his <hi>holiness,</hi>

eye, and winn unto it a carnal heart: But were the mind cleered to behold a spirit (man, or Angel) shining in the divine beautie of <hi>Gods</hi> own Image, how would that sight at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the soul, and strike it with amazement, and wonder of that glorious luster?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, as there is nothing in man, or Angel so excellent, so nothing so necessary as holiness. For 1. This only gives us pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency above other creatures. Consider it well, and you shall easily find, that every creature will justly challeng precedence, and outgo man without holiness. There is no qualitie in us, this only excepted, but other creatures in it farr surpass us. If we boast of longer time, and durance than some other, the very stones in this outgo us: If we plead, but with age we have life; even plants, and trees outlive us: If we say we have sense also; how many beasts, &amp;c. in hearing, seeing, smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, &amp;c. go farr beyond us? Some perhaps will object, we have understanding, and discourse of reason, of which these are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable: but in this (alas!) the worst of all creatures (the Divels) claym a large superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie, and wonderfully exceed us. Know it certainly without holiness, you are inferiour to every creature, even the most abject, and miserable.</p>

                     </gap>odliness,</hi> Tit. 2.12. Sobrietie, or Temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, may be thus described. It is that fruit of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> whereby we are enabled to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate our selves, our affections, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the use of the creature. 1. It is wrought in us by the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> and is his <hi>fruit,</hi> Gal. 5.22, 23. It is ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ght us by the word of grace, the <hi>Gospel,</hi> Tit. 2.11, 12. And thus it differs from that moral virtue, with which we may observe many heathens fairly to glister. Have ye never seen dishes of fruit stand out upon some shops, composed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> wax, and curiously painted? How much more fair, and lovely do they seem to the eye, than the same natural fruit, which you pluck from the tree? But if you weigh them in your hand, or (much more) if you ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> them, what a palpable difference do ye find between these made, artificial apples, and the natural? Pictures may be fairer than the substance, but they want the life, and use
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:29514:90"/>
of the substance. I have seen a crab more pleasant to the eye than the apple, which sprung from a noble graft, planted on the same stock; but to the tast how hateful the crab? the apple how delightful? Till we are cut off from the <hi>first Adam,</hi> and grafted into the <hi>Second,</hi> all our fruits are as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> abominable, and loathsome. 2. Secondly, whereas our <hi>Lord</hi> hath bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his creatures upon us, the act, and exercise of Temperance is so to moderate our minds in receiving, our affections in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring, and our actions in using them, that <hi>we abuse them not,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.31. Let me more cleer it by instancing in some particulars.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A special inward gift to man is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, which is (as the object) more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in things spiritual. Here Sobrietie will bridle, and rein in the understanding when it is spurred on by <hi>Curiosity</hi> to pry into the Ark, and not suffer it <hi>to break through to the Lord, lest we perish,</hi> Exo. 19.21. There are <hi>things secret, and revealed,</hi> Deut. 29.29. as therefore it will not palliate defects, but put us on diligently to search the scriptur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and to find out the things which belong to us; so in the excesse it will stop us, when our itching eyes, and ears would carry us beyond those bounds, (<hi>Exo.</hi> 19.12.) which our <hi>Lord</hi> hath set us. It will curb the thoughts,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:29514:91"/>
and hold them in, that they shall <hi>not think more highly than they ought, but think soberly,</hi> Rom. 12.3.</item>
                  <item>2. Whereas every member hath his place, and proportion in the body of <hi>Christ,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral duties allotted them (every one in his calling,) Sobrietie will so temper our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that it will keep us in our rank; and not suffer us either to boast of a false gift, lest we prove (as those <hi>spots in love-feasts</hi>) <hi>clouds without rain</hi>; (See, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.14. <hi>Iude</hi> 12.) nor yet under a mask of voluntary <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie to intrude our selves in things which we have not seen, vainly puft up in our fleshly mind,</hi> Col. 2.18. Thus it moderated that great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,</hi> and kept him as we say in his tedder; that he <hi>should not exceed the compass of his own measure,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.13, 14, 15. And for want of this virtue, many in these times (which bear a great hulk, and <hi>seem great ones in</hi> the eyes of deluded, and bewitched professours, ever <hi>learning, and never able to come to the knowledg of the truth</hi>) breaking out of their rank, are neither sheep, nor dogs of the flock, but wolves <hi>deceiving, and being deceived,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.13.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But much more apparent is the exercise of this grace in things without. As. 1. It em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pales a man in his proper calling, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades him with <hi>quietness to work, and eat his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:29514:91"/>
own bread</hi>; and suffers him not to live idly, or disorderly, as a <hi>busy-body,</hi> (2 Thes. 3. vers. 11, 12.) and yet keeps off the shackles of earthly cares; it empales, but imprisons not in his calling; nor so enslaves him to worldly affairs, but that he may have all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite libertie, and enlargement to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly. He serves not his calling, but <hi>God</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in his <hi>estate</hi> it settles the heart in a quiet contentation. Emptiness shall not breed greediness, nor fulness pride. It tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth him to want without grudging, and to abound without swelling, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12. 3. In recreations it keeps a middle way, equally distant from sullenness, and mad mirth. It will suffer the heart sometime to be drenched in sorrow, never drowned, to swim some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, never to sink in pleasure. It will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the spirit to be sometime thoughtful, sometime joyful, never cheerful. Lastly, for things indifferent it moderates our desires, and practice, to use them with comfort, without sin. In food it teacheth us tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and measure; to eat in season, to refreshing, and not to surfeting, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.17. to quicken, not damp our spirits; to whet not dull them for our work. It apparrels us neither garishly, nor gaudily; not slovenly, nor curiously; but fitts the matter, and manner to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, sex and calling. In marriage it teaches
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:29514:92"/>
them that <hi>have wives to be as if they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> 5.19, 20. In sleep it allowes renewing, not slugging; recovering of strength, not mispending <hi>time.</hi> It is the special direction of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> to keep in the middle way, and <hi>not to turn to the right hand, or to the left,</hi> Deut. 5.32.

                  <p> What is the last branch?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe last branch is <hi>Godliness</hi>: which is nothing but the true worship of the <hi>true God.</hi> And how should I more briefly, and yet more fully express it, than that wise Father to his wisest Son? <hi>And thou Solomon my Son know the God of thy Father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and willing mind,</hi> 1 Chro. 28.9. where he comprizes all the inward worship in <hi>knowledg,</hi> and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in service. Now this <hi>knowledg</hi> is not here (as properly it is) confined to the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> but generally extended to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very facultie of the soul. As our senses are
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:29514:98"/>
said to know when, employing their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their several objects, they do their office. (The eye knows the colour it sees, the ear the voice it hears.) So every facultie of our spirit is said to know, when exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it self in its proper office, it executes its own dutie. In the understanding when the Apprehension discerns, and conceives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, it knows, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. when the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment highly prizes things that are of high esteem, it is said to know, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.12. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the choice of the <hi>will</hi> is called knowledg, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. Thus the affections are said to know what they love, and delight in, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 144.3. expounded, <hi>Iob</hi> 7.17.) And this is that excellent knowledg preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sacrifice, (<hi>Hos.</hi> 6.6.) in which consists our eternal life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.3.</p>
               <p>First therefore you must <hi>know God</hi> by an act of the understanding, that is, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him, as himself in his word, not <hi>in mens</hi> dreams, hath pictured out himself unto you: which is a spiritual, and the only war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Image allowed by <hi>God</hi>: This you must hang up, not in your Hall, or parlour, but in that true <hi>Oratorie,</hi> the <hi>Closet of your hearts.</hi> There you shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ind him pencil'd, 1. As he is simply in himself: 2. Relatively to us. In himself he is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> (Joh. 4.24.) <hi>Incomprehensible, glorious, merciful, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:29514:99"/>
strong, long-suffering, pardoning sin, and iniquitie, &amp;c,</hi> (See, <hi>Exo.</hi> 34.6, 7. &amp;c.) In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to us <hi>our Creatour,</hi> (Isa. 64.8.) our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> (Deut. 32.6. Psal. 19.14.) our <hi>Lord,</hi> (Psal. 8.1.) in whose service is all our happiness, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 144.18.) our <hi>Portion, and Inheritance,</hi> Psal. 16.5, 6. <hi>the strength of our heart, our only, and full comfort,</hi> Psal. 73. vers. 25, 26. The heathens were not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of <hi>God,</hi> his eternal power, and <hi>Godhead,</hi> (Rom. 1.19, 20.) but our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his <hi>Son,</hi> our communion with him by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and consequently our salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and blessedness by our union with him, was wholly hid from them.</p>
               <p>The necessity of this knowledg appears. 1. By the miserie of ignorance: without it the wisest are fools, very Sots, of no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.22. All sin, and disobedience flows from want of this knowledg, (<hi>Ier.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.1, 2, &amp;c.) 2. By the happiness that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it: All grace attends it; Faith, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 9.10.) the whole new man, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2, 3. and all blessedness, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.3. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if the studie of <hi>men</hi> be above other natural studies, oh what is the studie of <hi>God</hi>? how pleasant? how profitable? <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.10. when sin affrights us how sweet the knowledg of his pardoning mercie? <hi>Psal.</hi> 86.4, 5. &amp; 103.11. when <hi>men</hi> are oppressed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:29514:99"/>
by tyrants, how sweet the knowledg of his Justice? <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. &amp; 16.5. nay even in our humiliations for sin how doth the knowledg of his Justice, and faithfulness refresh us? (1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.9.) upon all occasions how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ortable the knowledg of his power? In tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral distresses, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 3.17.) in spiritual, as pardon, (<hi>Num.</hi> 14.17.) <hi>subduing iniquities,</hi> (Mic. 7.18, 19.) in protecting from all evil, and keeping us to eternitie, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.29. 1 Pet. 1.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, we must know him in our Judgments, to prize him as he is, even all things less than nothing in comparison of him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.17. For him <hi>Abraham</hi> despises his Country: Moses the treasures, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of <hi>Egypt; David</hi> regards nothing in Heaven, or earth with him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.25, 26. <hi>Paul esteems</hi> all things dung, and loss for the excellent <hi>knowledg of Christ,</hi> Phil. 3.8.</p>
               <p>Hence all the Saints deny themselves, and all for him, and exalt him by their own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement: Kings will be vile to honour him, 2 Sam. 6.22. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> contented to wane, that he may appear in fulness, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Paul</hi> will be <hi>a servant to every man</hi> for his sake, who is <hi>Lord</hi> of all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. They make their honour wait upon his, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.8. For they know, <hi>He is their praise,</hi> Deut. 10.21. They will cheerfully buy him with loss of all,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:29514:100"/>
buy him at any price, sell him at none, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.44. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.23. If he calls for their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, profits, credit, life, they part with all. If he will have body, and soul, they will give him all, and when they have done all, and given all, look upon this all as a very nothing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>will</hi> also must know him to chuse, take, embrace him as he offers himself to us. He proffers himself to be our <hi>Lord,</hi> (Exo. 6.6.) to redeem us from all Usurpers, to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75.) to be our King, (<hi>Hos.</hi> 13.10.) to govern us under his holy, and wholesome laws. He offers himself to be all to us, our portion, inheritance, shield, our exceeding great reward, (<hi>Ier.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1.) More particularly he offers himself in his persons to be to us, 1. A Father, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, 18.) 2. An Husband, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.19, 20.) the Saviour of his Spouse, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23.) 3. To be our <hi>Quickner, and Comforter,</hi> Joh. 16.13. 1 Cor. 15.45. Thus he offers himself to us, and thus must we receive him, as a child the Father, to obey him, as a wife her Husband to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto him, as a Body the Soul to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him, and in all things conformed to him.</p>
               <p>Chuse him therefore as your support: without him you can do nothing, (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.5.)
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:29514:100"/>
without him we are nothing, at our best sheer vanitie, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.5. The very plants will teach us. The weak Ivie, and wood-bine, &amp;c. conscious of their infirmitie, clasp about the strong, which may bear them up, even dint the trees with their close embraces. He is a <hi>Lord</hi> that in our service looks not to his own, but his servants profit. He needs not us, but we him. But why then doth he call, and draw us to his service? To make us blessed. He taketh pleasure in the prosperitie of his servants, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 35.27.) he delights to do us good, (<hi>Ier.</hi> 32.40.) and to <hi>give us the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> Luk. 12.32. Men grosly ignorant fouly misconceive of his service: they look on it as cords, and bonds: but indeed there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so blessed as it, no blessedness but it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.4.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Affections also are said to know that which they love, in which they delight, and for which they longue: we therefore must know <hi>God</hi> to love, fear him, delight in him, and longue after him. Frequently in every page of scripture me meet not only with <hi>Gods</hi> precepts (in these duties) but the Saints practice. To provoke our hearts to love, we must consider him, 1. In himself: He is <hi>good,</hi> (Psal. 100.5.) <hi>only good,</hi> (Matth. 19.17.) <hi>abundant in goodness,</hi> (Exo. 34.6.) he is <hi>Love,</hi> (1 Joh. 4.16.) <hi>altogether lovely,</hi> (Cant. 5.16.) 2. In relation to us. He is our <hi>Father, Husband, Life, &amp;c.</hi> (as before.) 3. in his dealing with us. He hath manifested his love to us above all the <hi>works</hi> of his hands. In our creation advanced us above all, <hi>crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with glory,</hi> (Psal. 8.5, 6.) In our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preferred us above the Angels, assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:29514:101"/>
ours, and refusing their nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16.</p>
               <p>Now then take great heed that your love be true. Relative affection is not right if the measure be not right. An Husband lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as another <hi>man</hi> is not loved as an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Admit no rival, or partner in his love; no creature not our selves must be preferred before him, or equal'd to him: we must love him more than life, for his <hi>love is better than life,</hi> Psal. 63.3. He our quickning <hi>Spirit,</hi> we his body; he our head, we his members: why should not the hand prefer the head, or the body the soul before it self? As we may love him for his gifts, so much more for himself. Stir up your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful nature to this great dutie. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why you love any creature, why more one than another; why you should love the world, riches, pleasures as <hi>God,</hi> a drop as the fountain. It is even here too true, <hi>Love descends</hi>; Get your hearts baptized <hi>with fire, and the holy Ghost,</hi> buried with <hi>Christ</hi> into his death, and raised in his resurrection, that your affections may be set, and settled on things not on earth, but on things above, even on him who is infinitly above all things, who is blessed for ever, and your eternal blessedness.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, the outward worship con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:29514:102"/>
either in his speaking to us, or our speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him: He speaks to us either to our ears in his word, or to our eyes in his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, we to him either in prayers, or vows.

Not only virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the fruit lies in the seed, or root, but in some kind actually.

(in a kind) are they quickened, who are yet unborn. As a wife, or child takes possession of that land in the husband, or Father, which he hath purchased in their name.</p>
               <p>Hence we evidently see, first that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life of <hi>man</hi> by which he is a <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(<hi>begotten by God,</hi> Jam. 1.18.) <hi>the life of Christ,</hi> (2 Cor. 4.10.) he our life, (Col. 3.4.) <hi>and liveth in us,</hi> (Gal. 2.20.) <hi>and the life of the Spirit:</hi> he gives it, (2 Cor. 3.6.) And as the vegetative life of plants, the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive life of beasts, the rational life of <hi>man</hi> is nothing elss but the <hi>Act</hi> of such a soul, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the creature such a being, and enabling it unto such actions; so the <hi>divine,</hi> and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life is nothing else, but that <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> of <hi>Gods Spirit dwelling in man,</hi> and giving him a <hi>spiritual being, a divine nature,</hi> and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to spiritual, and <hi>Godly</hi> actions; or (to use the Scripture phrase) <hi>to live, and walk in the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.25.) whereby <hi>we live in God, and to God</hi> (see, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. 1 Joh. 5.11, 12.)</p>
               <p>For without question the true life of <hi>man</hi> differs from all other life in inferiour, or contrary creatures: but in this natural life,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:29514:115"/>
the faculties, and actions of it) man differs not from plants in growth, from beasts in sense, from wicked spirits in reason.

                  </gap>ed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, here we may easily observe, that howsoever a carnal <hi>man</hi> glisters in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eyes, honoured, admired, yet is he a very Abject, and the skumm of the creatures: so a spiritual man (contrary) though he seem a base thing in the eye of the world, and more base in his own, a reproch of <hi>men, and scorn of the people,</hi> (Psal. 22.6.) yet is he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the most noble, and excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the world, and next the great <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</hi> Hence the Saints (in terms) are called <hi>the Excellent,</hi> (Psal. 16.3.) preferred in their excellencie before others, whatsoever are their earthly advancements. <hi>The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour,</hi> Prov. 12.26. &amp; 28.6. This is Heavens, this is <hi>Gods</hi> Heral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry. <hi>Now are they Sons of God, and Heirs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:29514:115"/>But because their pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rogatives are such, as never eye saw, <hi>ear heard, or entred into the heart of man,</hi> (1 Cor. 2.9.) such as infinitely transcends our vastest thoughts, therefore are they veiled under many similitudes, and compared to those things which are most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and highest in the eyes of man. <hi>They are Kings,</hi> (Rev. 1.6.) and their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>not fading, but unshaken,</hi> (Heb. 12.28.) not earthly, but heavenly, (2 Pet. 1.11.) they have their sceptres, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8.) their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,</hi> (Psal. 45.8.) their thrones, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21.) their <hi>crowns,</hi> (2 Tim. 4.8.) <hi>God</hi> himself their <hi>diademe,</hi> (Isa. 28.5.) they have their <hi>glory,</hi> even the <hi>glory of God,</hi> (1 Thes. 2.12.) <hi>Christ</hi> himself their <hi>glory,</hi> (Luk. 2.32.) and they the glory of <hi>Christ,</hi> Isa. 46.13.</p>
               <p>This <hi>eminencie</hi> of Saints may be cleerly shewed in an evident demonstration. For no creature can stand in competition with them, but only other <hi>men,</hi> and Angels. For the first their <hi>eminencie</hi> will easily appear by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, even in those things, wherein <hi>men</hi> challenge precedencie before others.</p>
               <p>Men are counted more honourable, as they go before others in birth, estate, or end. Look then first to that broad difference betwixt the birth of the spiritual, and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal creature. <hi>Flesh is born of flesh,</hi> Joh. 3.3. The <hi>natural man is of earth earthy,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.47.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:29514:116"/>
nay of <hi>hell,</hi> and therefore <hi>hellish.</hi> His Father in the flesh is a sinful <hi>man,</hi> his spiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those spiritual <hi>wickednesses,</hi> even Satan, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.44. But <hi>Spirit is born of Spirit. The new man is not born of flesh, and blood, not of the will of man, but of God,</hi> Joh. 1.13. <hi>God</hi> his <hi>Father, who hath begotten him,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. <hi>God</hi> his <hi>Mother</hi> also, who (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>conceiving hath brought himforth,</hi> Jam. 1.18. In their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or birth there is no comparison.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For their estate, what infinite dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie? 1. in life. 2. In things belonging to life. The life of Saints is the <hi>life of God,</hi> (Eph. 4.18.) their nature the <hi>divine</hi> nature, (2 Pet. 1.4.) the blessed <hi>Spirit</hi> the soul of this life, which animates him, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 10.) Carnal <hi>men</hi> have a filthy spirit, informing, and working in <hi>the children of disobedience,</hi> Eph. 2.2. In the <hi>one God works all their works,</hi> (Isa. 26.12.) <hi>will, and deed,</hi> (Philip. 2.13.) in the other Satan, and Sin. Things belonging to life are (as the life) temporal, or spiritual. The Saints spiritual portion in one word is <hi>God. Christ his Bread and meat,</hi> Joh. 6.35, 55. he the <hi>portion of his cup,</hi> (Psal. 16.5.) the <hi>cup of salvation,</hi> (Psal. 116.13.) the <hi>drink indeed,</hi> (Joh. 6.55. 1 Cor. 10.4.) <hi>Christ</hi> his garment; (a most royal robe.)
