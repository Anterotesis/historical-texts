            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>Remarks</hi> UPON THE VINDICATION OF THE New Version OF THE PSALMS.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Vindicator</hi> of the <hi>new Version</hi> of the <hi>Psalms</hi> in <hi>Metre,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Brady</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tate,</hi> presuming in such an insolent manner to impose the Use of it upon the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>People</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and so saucily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on those who will not comply with the <hi>proud, imposing Humour,</hi> and pay an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate voluntary Obedience to it; I beg
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63627:3"/>
leave to animadvert a little upon some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of his unaccountable Boldness, and supercilious Arrogance, in these following <hi>Remarks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, first of all, I cannot but observe, That it is inconsistent with good Manners, and the Deference which we owe to Antiquity, and the <hi>Authors</hi> of the <hi>old Version</hi> of the <hi>Psalms</hi> in <hi>Metre,</hi> which has been universally receiv'd and us'd throughout this Kingdom since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and which, by the <hi>Vindicator's</hi> own Confession, has administred singular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and Consolation, and unspeakable Benefit to those who have piously and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly us'd it, to cast such an awkard and disingenuous Reflection on the Authors of it, who have been the happy Instruments of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating the Praises of our <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> in the House of Prayer, of bringing so much Glory to God, and doing so much good in the World.</p>
            <p>And though the <hi>old Version</hi> of the <hi>Psalms</hi> in <hi>Metre</hi> was compos'd by its <hi>Authors</hi> in a plain and humble Style, sutable to the Age they liv'd in, wherein there are some obsolete and uncouth Expressions, which have a harsh and jarring Sound in the delicate and musical Ears of the ingenious, and unsutable to the Modes of Speaking in this refined, this politer Age; yet 'tis very undecent to ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule and expose it, and as unpardonable a Rudeness, as for a converted <hi>Jew</hi> to scoff at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63627:3"/>
the Stammering of <hi>Moses,</hi> or ridicule the old Service of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> because we have now a more Spiritual Worship, sutable to Gospel-times, a better and more perfect <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by his own Example, taught his new Proselytes to pay Respect and Reverence to Circumcision, and the Rites of the abolish'd Law, though dead with <hi>Christ,</hi> and nailed to his Cross, and to give it an honourable and a decent Burial. And the like Respect is due to the <hi>old Version,</hi> when abolish'd by <hi>Convocation,</hi> and silenc'd in a lawful Assembly.</p>
            <p>But for this bold Imposer to attempt to recommend his <hi>new Version</hi> by railing at the <hi>old one,</hi> and the <hi>Authors</hi> of it, and impose the Reception and Use of his new Composure upon the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> before it has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Stamp of Lawful Authority, that of a <hi>Convocation</hi> I mean, who, as the proper Judges in Sacred Things, are to inspect, consider <note place="margin">As for occasional Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices upon extraordinary Days, whether Fasts or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals, it has been custom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary for the King to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point some of the Bishops to compose them.</note> of, and recommend all the Branches of publick Worship that is fixed and settled, of constant and perpetual Use, (which when confirm'd by the <hi>Royal Allowance</hi> and Injunction, is then, and not before, to be impos'd and generally us'd with a <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> both by the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63627:4"/>
               <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>People</hi>) is unaccountable Insolence, and unpardonable Presumption.</p>
            <p>But to enter into the Merits of the Cause, and to do the <hi>Vindicator</hi> Justice, let us examin the Validity of his Arguments, by which he labours to promote a general Reception of his new Translation, and evince it to be the Duty both of the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the former, to receive and use it in all Churches and Chappels throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Which I am apt to think, upon a strict Enquiry, and close Examination, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the impartial Reader to be very vain and tristing, illogical and inconclusive.</p>
            <p>There are Three Arguments which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and chiefly insists upon to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; <hi>viz. The Agreeableness of this Design with Reason; the Conformity of it with the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Church, and the Authority of Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and its Subserviency to the Advancement and Increase of Piety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He insists on</hi> the Agreeableness of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign with Reason. And both this, <hi>he tell us,</hi> and the other Arguments, <hi>which he has chosen to insist upon,</hi> are plainly intimated in the Letter of the Bishops, which, <hi>he says,</hi> is this.</p>
            <p>P. 13. His Majesty having allowed and permitted the Use of a new Version of the Psalms of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Brady</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tate,</hi> in all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63627:4"/>
Churches, Chappels, and Congregations; I cannot do less than wish a good success to this Royal Indulgence — And I do heartily recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Use of this Version to all my Brethren within my Diocess.</p>
            <p>So that here the <hi>Vindicator</hi> argues from Two Things; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Royal Allowance,</hi> and the <hi>Bishop's Recommendation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. He argues from the <hi>Royal Allowance,</hi> which he would make tantamount to an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,</hi> at least a <hi>Recommendation;</hi> whereas it is neither the one, nor the other.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not an <hi>Injunction,</hi> neither expresly, nor by implication. The <hi>Royal Allowance,</hi> in this Instance, is of the same Force and Validity with an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> prefixt to a Book or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which barely permits the Printing and Publishing of it, the Licenser being satisfied that nothing is contained in it contrary to the Government, the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and good Manners; but does not ingage any one to buy or read it. The <hi>Royal Stamp</hi> upon the Title-page of a Sermon preached at <hi>Court, — Published by his Majesty's special Command</hi> — carries with it no more than the Force of a Licence, though of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Nature, for the Printing and Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; but does not injoin all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>England, Clergy</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> to pay an
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63627:5"/>
universal Respect to it, or to receive and use it as they do the Book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Bible.</hi> They that are dispos'd to buy, and read, and use such a Sermon, that is honoured with the <hi>Royal Licence</hi> or <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,</hi> may, if they please, if not they may refuse so to do; and, I hope, there is no Disobedience in the Refusal. And so much, with submission, I think is intimated in the <hi>Terms</hi> of the <hi>Royal Allowance</hi> prefixt to the new New Version of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> which the <hi>Vindicator</hi> recites; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. 7. — <hi>His Majesty taking the same into his Royal Consideration, is pleased to order in Council, That the said new Version of the</hi> Psalms <hi>in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Metre be, and the same is hereby Allowed and Permitted to be used, in all Churches, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, and Congregations, as shall think fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that they that think fit to receive and use it, may; and they that do not, may let it alone, and consequently may use the <hi>old Version</hi> if they please: Which, by the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's</hi> Leave, is not forbid to be used by the <hi>Royal Allowance,</hi> though very illogically he concludes it is, p. 22, <hi>&amp;</hi> 27. of his <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where then, <hi>Good Mr. Vindicator,</hi> is the <hi>Royal Injunction,</hi> or any Thing like it? And consequently, where is the <hi>Disobedience</hi> upon a Non-compliance, which you so magisterial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and insultingly Charge the <hi>Clergy</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63627:5"/>
               <hi>People</hi> with, who refuse to receive and use the <hi>new Version?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed I cannot but wonder, That the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> and his <hi>Authors,</hi> (who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps are the same) should expect more than they themselves desired. For it may be observ'd, That the <hi>Royal Order</hi> and <hi>Allowance,</hi> in that Instance of Indifferency before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, is conform to the Prayer of the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; P. 7. — <hi>And humbly praying his Majesty's Royal Allowance, That the said Version may be used in such Congregations as shall think fit to receive it.</hi> And perhaps the Petitioners could obtain no more, the <hi>King</hi> probably not thinking it practicable to make his <hi>Order absolute,</hi> and injoyn the Reception and Use of the <hi>new Version,</hi> until it had received the Censure and Approbation of a <hi>Convocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Interim, the Petitioners having paid the Secretary's Fees for the <hi>Order,</hi> the <hi>new Version</hi> with the <hi>Royal Allowance</hi> was to take its Fate; and 'twas rude and unreasonable for the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> and his <hi>Authors,</hi> to rail, and strom, and grow angry, and scatter their Invectives, because it was no more success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and did not meet with an universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and consequently answer the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, perhaps of a <hi>Lusty Sum,</hi> for obtaining the <hi>Royal Instrument,</hi> and the <hi>Impression.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Add to this, in the next Place, That there is not one Word in the <hi>Royal Allowance</hi> that amounts to a <hi>Recommendation,</hi> or looks like it;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63627:6"/>
but rather the contrary may be inferr'd from the <hi>Coldness</hi> and <hi>Indifferency</hi> which are legible in the <hi>Terms</hi> of the <hi>Royal Allowance.</hi> And yet the <hi>Vindicator</hi> has the Confidence to affirm, That the <hi>new Version</hi> has not only the <hi>Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> but the <hi>Recommendation</hi> of <hi>Authority.</hi> P. 3.</p>
            <p>Well, but though the <hi>King</hi> neither injoyns nor <hi>recommends,</hi> yet perhaps the <hi>Bishops</hi> do; from whence the <hi>Vindicator</hi> would infer, That 'tis the Duty both of the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> to pay an universal Compliance and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>And this is the next Topick from which he argues; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Bishop's Recommendation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Against the Validity of which, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the <hi>Vindicator</hi> to evince what he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for, I have these Exceptions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It does not appear that either the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> or any other <hi>Bishop,</hi> is the Author of it, there being no Name subscrib'd, as there is to the <hi>Royal Allowance,</hi> and is usual in such Cases. It may be a <hi>Recommendation</hi> from <hi>Tom Thumb,</hi> or <hi>John a Styles,</hi> for any Thing that appears to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>King's Allowance</hi> being the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which the <hi>Recommendation</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be built, It cannot be suppos'd, That either the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> or any other <hi>Bishop,</hi> would be guilty of so great a <hi>Prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>

as to misrepresent, falsely report, and partially and imperfectly recite the <hi>Royall Allowance,</hi> on which they found their <hi>Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that the <hi>Royal Allowance</hi> is misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, falsely reported, and partially and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly recited in the aforesaid <hi>Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sdation</hi> is evident. The Words are these,</p>
            <p>P. 13. <hi>His Majesty having allowed and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the use of a new Version of the Psalms of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>by Mr.</hi> Brady <hi>and Mr.</hi> Tate, <hi>in all Churches, Chappels and Congregations —.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So runs the Preamble of the <hi>Recommendation;</hi> so far it goes and no farther, omitting what follows in the <hi>Royal Allowance,</hi> viz. — <hi>As shall think fit to receive the same.</hi> Which is a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation and Restriction, and a Signification, That the <hi>King</hi> did not intend to impose or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join the reception and use of this <hi>new Version</hi> upon any, but intirely left it to the discretion and pleasure of the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> whether they would receive it, and use it or no; but the <hi>Recommendation</hi> by that Misreprentation and false recital of the <hi>Royal Allowance</hi> looks <hi>Trickish</hi> and <hi>Designing,</hi> as if the intent of it was to insinuate, That the <hi>Royal Order</hi> was <hi>positive</hi> and <hi>absolute,</hi> and did tantamount to an <hi>Injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for the universal Reception and use of this <hi>new Version.</hi>

            <p>

But <hi>3dly,</hi> Supposing, tho' not granting, that this <hi>Recommendation</hi> was really, and <hi>bona fide</hi> the Bishops, and Subscribed by one or more of them; in which 'tis possible, That through haste, an hurry of Business, or the pressing of their more weighty Affairs, they may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon, and prevail'd with to Subscribe a Paper purporting a <hi>Recommendation,</hi> drawn up ready to their Hands, either by the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> or his <hi>Authors,</hi> without critically exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the <hi>Royal Allowance;</hi> yet the <hi>King's</hi> Order and Allowance, which is the <hi>Postula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> the <hi>Basis,</hi> the <hi>Foundation</hi> on which the <hi>Recommendation</hi> is founded, being misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and falsely and imperfectly recited, the <hi>Recommendation</hi> is invalid, and signifies just nothing: For a <hi>false Recital</hi> is no <hi>Recital</hi> at all, and consequently all the <hi>Arguments, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences</hi> and <hi>Conclusions,</hi> which the <hi>Vindicator</hi> builds upon, or deduces from it, fall to the Ground, and are meer impertinence. And so much for his First general Argument; which is drawn from the <hi>Agreeableness of this Design with Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now examine the <hi>Second,</hi> and see whether any better Fate will attend it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>Second Argument</hi> to evince what he contends for, he deduces from the <hi>Conformity of it to the Constitution of our Church, and the Authority of Convocations. And so,</hi> says
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63627:7"/>
he, p. 21. <hi>it plainly appears in as much as it</hi> (i. e. the new Version) <hi>is allow'd of by the King, and recommended by the Bishops.</hi> And for this he quotes the <hi>Rubrick</hi> before the Sentences at the <hi>Offertory.</hi> — <hi>And nothing shall be proclaimed or published in the Church during the time of Divine Service, but by the Minister: Nor by him any thing but what is prescribed in the Rules of this Book, or injoined vy the King, or by the Ordinary of the place.</hi> Thus far the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick.</hi> Then follows the <hi>Vindicator's</hi> Comment, Observations, Arguments and Conclusions from it. <hi>Where, by the way,</hi> says he, <hi>thus much we may Observe, That no Clerk of a Parish can Sing in the Church but as he is directed by his Minister, and as he acts as his Deputy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very well Argued Mr. <hi>Vindicator!</hi> a very natural Inference and logical Conclusion from the Premisses! — <hi>Nothing shall be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or published in the Church, during the time of Divine Service, but by the Minister.</hi> Ergo, <hi>No Parish Clerk can Sing in the Church but as he is directed by his Minister, and as he acts as his Deputy.</hi> Whereas the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference lay quite on the other side; and it would have been more naturally Inferr'd, and logically Concluded from the Premisses as he quotes and applies them. Therefore no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Clerk can Sing in the Church at all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing is to be proclaim'd or published
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63627:8"/>
in the Church during the time of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but by the Minister.</p>
            <p>And here by the way, I must observe Two Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What a horrid Blunder the <hi>Vindicator</hi> is guilty of, in calling the <hi>Parish Clerk the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Deputy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That he misapplies the <hi>Rubrick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Vindicator</hi> is guilty of a horrid Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in calling the <hi>Parish Clerk</hi> the <hi>Ministers Deputy.</hi> A <hi>Deputy</hi> is one who is to execute the Office of his <hi>Chief,</hi> and to do the same thing which the principal Person is to do, to whom he is a <hi>Deputy.</hi> So that if the <hi>Parish Clerk</hi> is <hi>the Ministers Deputy,</hi> he may <hi>read Prayers, Preach, and administer the Sacraments, and Marry, and Bury the Dead;</hi> as a certain <hi>Parish Clerk</hi> in a Country Town did, who fancied himself to be the <hi>Ministers Deputy,</hi> his Master being Sick, and actually read the Burial Service from time to time at the Graves of the Deceased; until he was severely reprimanded by the Bishop himself, and threatned to be turned out of his Place if ever he presumed to do so any more.</p>
            <p>Nor can the <hi>Vindicator</hi> excuse himself by saying, That the <hi>Parish Clerk</hi> is the <hi>Ministers Deputy</hi> only in <hi>Singing.</hi> For <hi>Singing,</hi> i. e. to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63627:8"/>
Tune Psalms, and lead the Congregation in singing, is not, strictly speaking, the Office of the <hi>Minister.</hi> The <hi>Parish Clerk</hi> is to Name and Tune the Psalm, and to Dictate or Read the Verses and Lines of it. He is to be the <hi>Præ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centor</hi> in a Parochial Congregation; as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in the 91 <hi>Canon,</hi> where it is decreed amongst other Qualifications of a <hi>Parish Clerk,</hi> That he shall be skill'd <hi>legendi &amp; cantandi scientiâ,</hi> in Reading and Singing.</p>
            <p>But <hi>2ly.</hi> The <hi>Vindicator</hi> is guilty of a very great Mistake, in misapplying the <hi>Rubrick.</hi> The <hi>Rubrick</hi> which he quotes, which is before the Sentences at the <hi>Offertory,</hi> does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern any part of <hi>Divine Service,</hi> or <hi>Singing of Psalms,</hi> or the <hi>Sermon,</hi> but the publishing of of Occcsianal Things; as the giving Notice of Holy Days, the Celebration of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, publishing the Banns of Matrimony, Briefs, Proclamations, Declarations, Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Excommunications, as appears by the Words of the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> which immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, which are these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the Curate shall declare unto the People what Holy-days, or Fasting-days are in the Week following to be observed, and then also (if occasion be) shall notice be given of the Communion; and the Banns of Matrimony published, and</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:63627:9"/>
               <hi>Briefs, Citations and Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions read.</hi> It follows. — <hi>And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing shall be proclaimed or published in the Church, during the time of Divine Service, but by the Minister: Nor by him any thing, but what is prescribed in the Rules of this Book, or enjoined by the King, or by the Ordinary of the place.</hi> Which last Words the <hi>Vindicator</hi> quotes, omitting the former Words of this <hi>Rubrick,</hi> because I presume they made against him.</p>
            <p>Besides the natural import of the Words of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> which the <hi>Vindicator</hi> quotes, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently shews that it does not, cannot concern any part of the solemn Worship, either reading Divine Service or singing of the Psalms. 'Tis an incongruity of Speech to call either the one or the other <hi>Proclaiming</hi> or <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing.</hi> And that which he lays the greatest stress upon, is nothing to his purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> those Words of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> which he quotes. — <hi>Nor by him any thing, but what is prescribed in the Rules of this Book, or enjoined by the King, or by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of the place.</hi> Which does plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect what is Prohibited by the 72 <hi>Canon,</hi> viz. That no <note place="margin">Vide 72 Can. cui Tit. Ministri publica Jejun. Prophetias, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> privato usu cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brare prohibiti.</note> 
               <hi>Minister</hi> shall presume to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>private Fasts, Exercises, Lectures, Prophecies, Exorcisms,</hi> &amp;c. without a lawful Command

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:63627:10"/>
               <hi>Inferences</hi> and <hi>Conclusions,</hi> which he builds upon, or deduces from it; And how bold and rude, and unaccountable, are his base <hi>Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which without any Modesty or Respect or deference to their Character he casts upon the <hi>reverend Clergy</hi> of this fam'd <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> as well as the rest of the vast Body of the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the Two <hi>Provinces;</hi> who, generally speaking, refuse to receive and use this <hi>new Version;</hi> who indeed are very much oblig'd to the <hi>modest Vindicator,</hi> for that <hi>honourable Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> which he is pleas'd to bestow upon them, representing them as <hi>Stubborn, contumatious Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olators of the Oath of Canonical Obedience, and their solemn Ingagement</hi> at their <hi>Ordination; Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers of the Authority of Convocations and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Enemies to their Rights and Privileges; Despisers of Government, and disobedient to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours both in Church and State; Proud, Disdainful, Self conceited, Envious, Malicious,</hi> what not <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I refer the <hi>Reader</hi> to his Book, and only beg leave to select a few Passages, which are Instances of his great <hi>Complement</hi> and <hi>Respect</hi> to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who are non Compliers, and refuse to receive and use this <hi>new Version.</hi> In the 23 p. are these Words,</p>
            <p>— <hi>And he seems to vacate both their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,</hi> i. e. of Convocation and Parliament, <hi>who opposes that encouragement which it has already received from his Majesty and the Bishops, and endeavors</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:63627:10"/>
               <hi>to enervate all their Efficacy and Strength by rendring them useless and insignificant.</hi> And a little after, in the same Page. — <hi>Whoever therefore it is that contradicts this Authority which they have freely consented should be vested in the King, and the Bishops seems directly to oppose the Power of that sacred Body, and to be a direct Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Rights and Privileges of a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And again, p. 25. <hi>Whoever therefore it is that opposes that Authority which the New Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation has obtained, seems plainly to deprive the Convocation of those signal Honours and Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus appertaining to them, which the Parliament has been pleas'd to confirm, and the King and the Bishops are pleas'd to act by, who have the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power,</hi> &amp;c. And again, p. 27, 28. — <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any one reject this New Translation of the Psalms, recommended to him by his Bishop, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see how he will avoid the Censure of casting a Scandalous Reproach upon the goldly Judgment of his Ordinary, and palpably violating that religious Obligation which he solemnly entered into at the time of his Ordination before the Bishop, the Priests, and the Congregation. But I fancy the Persons will be but few, who will be so hardy against their own Consciences, and cancel all the veneration which is due both to their Diocesan and themselves, if they hope that God should be their Helper.</hi> And again, p. 28, 29. — <hi>It cannot be invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately opposed by any, unless it be by some few Persons who may envy the Production, because it is not their own, or because it has met with such good</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:63627:11"/>
Success, or those that are prejudic'd against the Royal Allowance, because <hi>William R.</hi> is on the front of it, or such as look upon the Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Letter of a Diocesan as only, a meer Matter of Form; or lastly, those who are such zealous. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of Antiquity, that they will object against any thing, barely for its being New.</p>
            <p>These are some of the Instances of his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement</hi> and <hi>Respect</hi> to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> at whom the Reflection is directly aim'd, though oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by consequence at the <hi>People</hi> too, who are not reconcil'd to the use of the new Psalms, as I hear very few in this City are. All which consider'd, I leave it to the Reader to judge how justly the <hi>Vindicator's</hi> Book deserves the Title of <hi>A modest Vindication of the new Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Psalms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Word or Two of his <hi>3d Argument</hi> and I have done. And this is drawn from <hi>the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviency of the new Psalms to the Advancement of Piety and Devotion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how does it appear that they are more <hi>Subservient</hi> to this end than the old <hi>Version?</hi> What, is it because of the venerable Names of Mr. <hi>Brady</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tate,</hi> the <hi>celebrated Authors</hi> of the <hi>new Performance?</hi> who seem to be very <hi>unluckily coupled</hi> in this Enterprize, <hi>a Divine</hi> and a <hi>Player,</hi> a <hi>Christian Priest</hi> and a <hi>Stage Poet,</hi> as unequally yokt as the <hi>Ox</hi> and the <hi>Ass,</hi> which were forbid by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> to draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the same Yoke. But perhaps none

was so fit for the Undertaking, to give it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, especially amongst <hi>Pretenders to Wit, as a Comic-Divine,</hi> and a <hi>Poet Laureat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps Mr. <hi>Sternold</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hopkins</hi> (the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> I hope, will not be offended that I give them the usual Complement of Respect, though he denies it them, having I <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

And if I am not mis-inform'd, they were so, if not by many Degrees beyond them.</p>
            <p>Let their <hi>Work</hi> praise 'em in the Gate: The Thing speaks it self: The <hi>Performance</hi> discovers them to be acted by a <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> and breaths a Celestial Sweetness like the droppings of <hi>Myrrbe,</hi> and the Perfumes of <hi>Alloes</hi> and <hi>Cassia,</hi> the fragrant Odours of the Sanctuary, of which the <hi>Garments</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Bridegroom</hi> smell.</p>
            <p>Such an <hi>Air</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion, Rapture</hi> and <hi>Extacy, Spiritual Life and Vigour, holy Flames and heavenly Transports</hi> appears through the whole Performance, (making allowances for some obsolete and uncouth Expressions) that it speaks the <hi>Authors</hi> to be no contemptible Men, that they studied not only the Psalmists Words, but his Mind and Practice too, and were Transform'd into a sort of likeness to the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>

               <hi>Author,</hi> and were perfect <hi>Masters</hi> of <hi>Divine Musick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They had truly learnt to tune <hi>David's Harp</hi> with agreeable <hi>Notes</hi> and <hi>Accents,</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Nature of that <hi>Divine Poem;</hi> and that in all the Instances of <hi>humble Penitence</hi> and <hi>holy Vows, godly Sorrow</hi> and <hi>transporting Joy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Supplications,</hi> and <hi>heavenly Praises</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujahs.</hi> They bent their Minds to the Study of a <hi>Divine Poem,</hi> which was compos'd with an <hi>Air</hi> sutable to <hi>Spiritual Psalmody,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Subject,</hi> and was not polluted with the <hi>wanton Strains</hi> of <hi>prophane Poetry;</hi> they did not mingle the <hi>unhallowed Fires</hi> of the <hi>Stage,</hi> with the <hi>holy Sparks</hi> of the <hi>Altar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the <hi>Performance</hi> favours of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> to the Unskilful in the <hi>Airs</hi> of the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Text,</hi> or the <hi>Translation</hi> In <hi>Prose,</hi> which is sung in <hi>Cathedrals</hi> with sutable <hi>Notes</hi> and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing <hi>Accents,</hi> bearing some Resemblance to the <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> above; which the <hi>Vulgar</hi> may stare at, and admire, but cannot join, or bear a part in that kind of <hi>Psalmody.</hi> So that <hi>Thousands,</hi> and <hi>Ten thousands,</hi> since the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> had been depriv'd of the Benefit, and Pleasure, and Solace, and Comfort of singing the Praises of God in the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>sweet Singer of Israel,</hi> had not those <hi>charitable Anthors</hi> condescended to their Capacities, by composing a <hi>plain and familiar Metre.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:63627:12"/>
So that 'twill be a hard Task for the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator</hi> to prove, That the <hi>new</hi> are more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to the <hi>Advancement of Piety and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> than the <hi>old Psalms,</hi> and that upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>genuine Excellence and Composure of the new Version, which,</hi> he says, <hi>by many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees surpasses the old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is objected, The <hi>old Psalms</hi> are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a plain and familiar Style.</p>
            <p>So much the better, being sutable to <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Language,</hi> which for the most part, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting some Philosophical Discourses in <hi>Job,</hi> and the Lofty Flights of the Prophet <hi>Isaiab,</hi> and the Ænigmatical Passages in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is delivered in a plain and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Style, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> delighting to express it self in plain and intelligible Words, condescending to the meanest Capacity; and withal most agreeable to the <hi>holy Text,</hi> most of the <hi>Psalms</hi> being <hi>Prayers,</hi> which are wont to be deliver'd in plain and familiar Terms, (though there are not wanting Rhetorical Flourishes in <hi>Eucharistical Psalms</hi>) and more sutable to the Capacities of <hi>Parochtal Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi> where plain and unlearned <hi>Auditors</hi> are the most numerous.</p>

wherein a <hi>Lamb may wade,</hi> but <hi>Depths</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an <hi>Elephant may swim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the <hi>old Version</hi> there are many <hi>obso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete</hi> and <hi>uncouth Expressions,</hi> which offend the Ears of the Ingenious, <hi>Who,</hi> it seems, p. 36. <hi>are well-disposed to the Liturgy of our Church, yet frequently absent themselves from it,</hi> (a very good Evidence indeed of their Respect and Affection to it!) <hi>and that in Honour to Almighty God; because it is rather a Contempt,</hi> they say, <hi>than a Respect, to pay their Homage directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what his holy Word prescribes, both in</hi> Psal. 47. 7. <hi>Sing ye Praises with Understanding. And</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 15. <hi>I will sing with the Spirit, and I will sing with the Understanding also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the way, let me ask the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Unlearned</hi> (who are the more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous) may not make the same Objection against hard, and to them unintelligible, Words in our politer Modes of Speaking, that the Learned and Ingenious do against those <hi>obso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete</hi> and <hi>uncouth Expressions</hi> which are in the <hi>old Translation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But admit it, That there are many <hi>obso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete</hi> and <hi>uncouth</hi> Expressions in the <hi>old Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation;</hi> yet there are <hi>Psalms</hi> enough that may be selected for publick and private Use that are <hi>unexceptionable,</hi> and perhaps by many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and in divers Instances, <hi>preferable</hi> to the <hi>new Composure.</hi> But I think this Objection is, or may be, silenc'd by the Care that has been taken in the late <hi>Editions</hi> of the <hi>Psalms</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:63627:13"/>
to expunge those <hi>obsolete</hi> and <hi>uncouth</hi> Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, so much complain'd of, and exchange 'em for others that are more agreeable to the modern <hi>Phraseology,</hi> and the present Modes of Speaking and Writing. There is a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between repairing a House, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it down; between amending the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and destroying the Fabrick. There are perhaps some Passages in the <hi>English Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> which might be better render'd. What then? Must we destroy the <hi>old Frame,</hi> and have a <hi>new Bible?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>old Version</hi> had never the Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Convocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then? Though perhaps it never past the Censure of a <hi>Convocation,</hi> or had a <hi>formal Approbation,</hi> yet it had a <hi>virtual one;</hi> the <hi>old Psalms</hi> being received and us'd, not only in <hi>vulgar Auditories</hi> and <hi>Parochial Congregations,</hi> but in <hi>learned Assemblies;</hi> as the <hi>Two Universities,</hi> the Nurseries of Learning, from whence proceed the Members of that Learned and Sacred Body of a <hi>Convocation;</hi> the Convention of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> at the <hi>Epistopal</hi> and <hi>Archi-diaconal Visitations,</hi> which are wont to be held in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Churches; yea, even in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the <hi>Convocation-men,</hi> at their Solemn Meeting, when a Psalm is sung before the Sermon; which speaks at least their tacit Approbation. And the Silence of <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which the <hi>Vindicator</hi> makes an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against, I think an Argument for the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63627:14"/>
Approbation of the <hi>old Psalms,</hi> and the Use and Continuance of them; in regard our <hi>Convocations,</hi> who are the <hi>Church-Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> never mov'd against, or censur'd, and condemn'd the <hi>old Version.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Custom</hi> has hallowed and consecrated the Use of the <hi>old Psalms,</hi> and entitle 'em to a sort of <hi>Prescription.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why should the <hi>Vindicator</hi> think that the <hi>new Version</hi> is more <hi>subservient to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Piety and Devotion</hi> than the <hi>old?</hi> Is it because it has occasion'd such <hi>Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi> in those <hi>few Congregations</hi> where it has been receiv'd and us'd: Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the <hi>Church-wardens</hi> of St. <hi>Catherine Creed-Church, London,</hi> (where Mr. <hi>Brady</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was lately <hi>Minister</hi>) observing what a <hi>great Confusion</hi> the singing of the <hi>new Psalms</hi> occasion'd in that Church, (where, it seems, by Mr. <hi>Brady's</hi> Influence they were receiv'd and us'd) made an Order of <hi>Vestry</hi> for the laying of 'em aside, and that the <hi>old Psalms</hi> should be us'd again.</p>
            <p>But though the <hi>new Version</hi> is not <hi>subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the Advancement of Piety and Devotion,</hi> yet it may to the <hi>Advancement of Money, and and the Getting of an Estate;</hi> which perhaps the <hi>Undertakers</hi> had in view, and a promising Prospect of upon this <hi>Performance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let 'em wait with Patience until a <hi>Convocation</hi> shall think fit to silence the <hi>old Version,</hi> and approve of, recommend, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63627:14"/>
the Use of the <hi>new one,</hi> and then they may have their End. And I am perswaded, That the whole <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> (whom now the <hi>Vindicator</hi> is so angry with, for not complying wirh the <hi>proud, imposing Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>) will pay as ready a Compliance and Obedience, as the most <hi>zealous Promoters</hi> and <hi>Abettors</hi> of the <hi>present Undertaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, let the <hi>Performance</hi> be never so <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>laudable,</hi> to attempt to impose it on the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> in such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances as the <hi>modest Vindication</hi> does, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable <hi>Rudeness</hi> and <hi>Presumption,</hi> which the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> or his <hi>Authors,</hi> ought to retract, and beg pardon for.</p>
            <trailer>THE END.</trailer>
