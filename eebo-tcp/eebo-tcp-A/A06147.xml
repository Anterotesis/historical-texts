            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

conqueſts of the noble and vertuous Duke
IOSVA.</head>
            <l>
               <hi>I</hi> Am the worthie conquerour Duke <hi>Ioſua</hi> the great,</l>
            <l>Whom God did ordeine and appoint to raigne in <hi>Moiſes</hi> ſeate:</l>
            <l>To lead his people Iſrael to the land of beheſt,</l>
            <l>Which God to <hi>Moiſes</hi> promiſed, as ſcriptures haue expreſt.</l>
            <l>When he dwelt in the wilderneſſe, and had miraculouſlie</l>
            <l>Eſcaped through the great red ſea, from <hi>Pharaos</hi> tyrannie.</l>
            <l>Two thouſand and two hundreth yéeres, with fiue and thirtie more:</l>
            <l>After God had made the world I raigned: and before</l>
            <l>The daie that Ieſus Chriſt was borne, in bookes as plaine appeeres.</l>
            <l>One thouſand and ſeauen hundreth and ſeuen and twentie yeeres.</l>
            <l>A Iewe I am by due diſcent, of ſuch exceeding fame:</l>
            <l>As through the world ſhall floriſh ay the honor of my name.</l>
            <l>Much fauour with the Lord I found, whoſe thundering voice full oft,</l>
            <l>Appeared vnto me on earth from ſcarlet ſkies aloft:</l>
            <l>Commanding me nothing to dread, but boldlie on to fight:</l>
            <l>Aſſuring me the vpper hand of euerie liuing wight.</l>
            <l>And not to part form me, where ſo I did my armie lead:</l>
            <l>Yea, and to giue me all the lands whereon my feete ſhould tread.</l>
            <l>The great floud Iordan he dried vp for me and all my power:</l>
            <l>And brought vs ſafelie through the ſame, and all within an hower.</l>
            <l>Diuiding with his mightie arme the waues moſt woonderfullie:</l>
            <l>On either ſide as we did paſſe, like hils or mountains hie.</l>
            <l>The loftie walles of <hi>Ierico</hi> fell at my praiers downe:</l>
            <l>Through which I entred valiantly, and quite deſtroid the towne.</l>
            <l>I put ech woman, man, and child, therein vnto the ſword:</l>
            <l>As I had incommandement by Gods moſt holie word.</l>
            <l>No liuing ſoule eſcapt awaie out of that bloodie ſtrife:</l>
            <l>But <hi>Rahab</hi> and hir familie, to whom I graunted life.</l>
            <l>For that ſhe in hir houſe did hide the men I ſent to view</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:20330:6"/>
The Citie: and did them conuey from thoſe that did purſue.</l>
            <l>I ſackt the citie of <hi>Ay</hi> eke, <hi>Bethoron</hi> and <hi>Bethell:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And manie mightie cities more: which now were long to tell.</l>
            <l>I ſlew there people more and leſſe, with famine, ſword, and fire:</l>
            <l>For God appointed me his ſcourge, to accompliſh his iuſt ire.</l>
            <l>The Lord at my requeſt did ſtay the ſun amid the ſkie:</l>
            <l>While I cauſd manie hundereths and thouſands for to die.</l>
            <l>Whoſe numbers were ſo infinite, that God did alſo raine</l>
            <l>Great ſtones from heauen on their heads, and ſlue them on the plaine,</l>
            <l>As they did flie before my face euen from <hi>Bethoron,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Vntill they to <hi>Eſaka</hi> came, that few eſcapt or none.</l>
            <l>I chaſed great and mightie kings to hide them on the earth</l>
            <l>In caues: and there to curſe the time of their vnhappie birth.</l>
            <l>And burnt their cities, townes, and towers vnto the verie ground:</l>
            <l>And they themſelues I hangd on trées, in place where I them found.</l>
            <l>And after threw their carcaſes into the caues againe:</l>
            <l>And rouled thereunto great ſtones, where yet their bones remaine.</l>
            <l>And at the water of <hi>Merom</hi> I killed with my hands,</l>
            <l>Thouſands of mine enimies, whoſe number as the ſands</l>
            <l>Were gathered againſt Iſraell: but God the Lord of might,</l>
            <l>Deliuered them all vnto me, not one but died in fight.</l>
            <l>Their horſes and their chariots eke I burned and deſtroide:</l>
            <l>Their countries, townes, and cities all, which latelie they enioide.</l>
            <l>Wherein were one and thirtie kings, all which with one accord,</l>

            <l>King <hi>Phillis</hi> and King <hi>Octamen,</hi> I ſtrake ſo mortallie:</l>

With deadlie ſpeare, that therewithall they died preſentlie.</l>
            <l>The mightie <hi>Agamemnon</hi> king I threw vnto the ground:</l>
            <l>And ſtrong <hi>Achilles</hi> felled oft with manie a mortall wound.</l>
            <l>Proud <hi>Diomed</hi> and <hi>Aiax</hi> fierce, I met oft in this broile:</l>
            <l>With manie Gréekiſh captaines more, and gaue them all the foile.</l>
            <l>And ſo continued ſix yéeres ſpace amongſt my mortall foes,</l>
            <l>Moſt like a valiant conquerour, ſtill dealing deadlie bloes:</l>
            <l>And chaſing them with bloodie blade vnto the verie ſtrand:</l>
            <l>Where, ſome did leape into the ſeas, to ſhun my heauie hand.</l>
            <l>And there were drenched in the waues moſt miſerablie:</l>
            <l>Wherefore the Gréeks among themſelues complained ſecretlie,</l>
            <l>What ſlaughter and occiſion I made vpon their men:</l>
            <l>And for redreſſe thereof, they held a priuie counſell then.</l>
            <l>Wherein they did conſpire my death in this vnknightly wiſe:</l>
            <l>That when I came into the field againſt mine enimies,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> ſhould with manie knights awaite me to oppreſſe:</l>
            <l>When I were occupied in fight to bring me to diſtreſſe.</l>
            <l>Affirming otherwiſe, while I in <hi>Troie</hi> aliue did raigne,</l>
            <l>Vnpoſſible it were for them the victorie to attaine.</l>
            <l>Yet ſerud their treaſon, for a while to ſmall effect or none:</l>
            <l>I did diſtreſſe them (as before) and killed manie a one:</l>
            <l>Till caſually vpon a day I marched to the field</l>
            <l>In former wonted guiſe: to proue my force with ſpeare and ſhield:</l>
            <l>Although forewarned by my wife, who by a dreame did ſée,</l>
            <l>That if I that day went to field, my life ſhould ended be:</l>
            <l>Where I like mightie <hi>Mars</hi> himſelfe ſlew downe on euerie ſide,</l>
            <l>And brake their raies and renges all where I did go or ride:</l>
            <l>And kild anone two mightie kings before <hi>Achilles</hi> face,</l>
            <l>Who: ſéeking to reuenge their death, I wounded in that place:</l>
            <l>And forced him to withdraw himſelfe to bind his mortall ſore:</l>
            <l>By this the fight with fierce aſſault increaſed more and more.</l>
            <l>At laſt by chaunce I flew a King, whoſe armour for the nones</l>
            <l>Was richly en brodred and ſet foorth with pearls and pretious ſtones.</l>
            <l>The ſight whereof did ſo inflame my hart with couetouſneſſe,</l>
            <l>That for to ſpoile him of the ſame my ſelfe I did addreſſe:</l>
            <l>Forecaſting naught what might befall, nor hauing no regard</l>
            <l>To ſhun the traine of my miſchaunce, which was for me prepard:</l>
            <l>Nor fearing thouſands of my foes, nor waying anie frend,</l>

            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:20330:9"/>
But hent him vp vpon my ſtéede, and rode out of the throng:</l>
            <l>And for my better eaſe my ſhield vpon my backe I flong,</l>
            <l>While I did ſpoile him of his wéedes, careleſſe of anie wight,</l>
            <l>My naked breſt diſarmed then, <hi>Achilles</hi> had a ſight</l>

            <l>He came vnwares behind my backe, and ſtroke me to the hart.</l>
            <l>Thus died I through auarice, whom thouſands could not kill,</l>

            </l>
            <l>By <hi>Samuel</hi> the prophet great annointed there to dwell.</l>
            <l>A Iew I am in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> borne, and by Gods onelie grace</l>
            <l>Promoted vp to regall rowme, though come but of meane race.</l>
            <l>Next to <hi>Saule</hi> I ware the crowne, I had continually</l>
            <l>Seuen and thirtie mightie men as captaines vnder me.</l>
            <l>Whoſe names in the old teſtament in the bookes of the Kings</l>
            <l>At large are written, and ſet foorth with manie other things.</l>
            <l>Peruſe well the old teſtament, and marke the text aright:</l>
            <l>Then thou ſhalt find that I am he in whom God did delight:</l>
            <l>Of whom in pleaſed him to ſay, Behold in euerie part,</l>
            <l>At laſt I haue found out a man according to my hart.</l>
            <l>No prophet euer raignd on earth more greater than was I,</l>
            <l>To whom the Lord did deigne to giue ſuch ſpirit of propheſie:</l>

            <l>Such ioifull promiſes: nor found more fauour in Gods ſight.</l>
            <l>Firſt, in my childiſh yéeres when I a ſhepheard was,</l>
            <l>I ſlew a Lion with my hands, as he my ſhéepe did chaſe:</l>
            <l>And kild a great and vglie Beare, which came in rauenous wiſe</l>
            <l>Out of the wilderneſſe to ſpoile my flocke before mine eies.</l>
            <l>And béeing by my father ſent my brothers food to bring,</l>
            <l>Who ſerued then as ſoldiours in field with <hi>Saule</hi> the King,</l>
            <l>I ſlew the Giant <hi>Goliath,</hi> moſt lothlie to behold,</l>
            <l>Who was from the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> ſent on <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to ſcold:</l>

            <l>Which thing, when <hi>Saule</hi> the King beheld, he highlie eſtéemed me:</l>
            <l>And brought me home vnto his houſe his ſeruant for to be:</l>
            <l>And gaue me his daughter to wife, for whom I paid in fight</l>
            <l>Two hundred foreſkins of my foes, whom I ſlew through my might:</l>

            <l>Wherefore, the King was woonderous wroth, that I did ſo attaine</l>
            <l>To worthie honour and renowne: and for this did conſpire</l>
            <l>My death, by all the meanes he could in his outragious ire:</l>

            <l>And vexed with the euill ſpirit, to ſlay me in the place:</l>
            <l>But then I plaid vpon my harpe, and ſo I did expell</l>

            <l>And yet, as ſoone as I did ceaſe, the ſpirit would him torment,</l>
            <l>And then, to ſlay me as before againe he would attempt.</l>
            <l>At laſt, to ſhun his wicked hand, by helpe of <hi>Ionathas,</hi>
            </l>

            <l>Vnhappie <hi>Abſalon</hi> my ſonne, who thought ambitiouſlie</l>

            <l>Example take: and learne by him their parents to obay.</l>
            <l>For as he through the woods did flie my ſoldiours force to ſhun,</l>
            <l>Who fierſly him purſued behind the field when they had wun,</l>
            <l>His locks béeing long, the trées being low, the boughs crauld in his haire,</l>
            <l>And pluckt him from his foming ſtéed, and hangd him in the aire:</l>
            <l>Where finally <hi>Ioab</hi> him found, and piteouſlie him ſlew</l>
            <l>With manie of his confederates, whoſe death I much did rue.</l>
            <l>This wofull ſlaughter brought to end, I raigned quietly</l>
            <l>Amongſt my people manie a day, and found no enemie:</l>
            <l>For God my Lord was on my ſide, whoſe force than ſhould I feare?</l>
            <l>Thus raigned I in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Hebron</hi> fortie yeare.</l>

               <l>For patience commeth of the Lord, euen as the prophet doth record.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In Eccleſiaſticus alſo the firſt chapter, the text doth ſay,</l>
               <l>The patient will endure ech wo vntill the verie appointed day:</l>
               <l>And then for him ſhall be prepard, for his meekenes, a due reward.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Saint Paule in his epiſtles writes of patience and humilitie,</l>
               <l>And Iames thereof likewiſe endites in manie a text apparantlie:</l>
               <l>Our ſauiour Chriſt did patience teach, when he himſelfe on earth did preach.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Saieng (in Matthew as I find) Learne ye of me humilitie,</l>
               <l>Bicauſe I humble am of mind, and ſuffer ech thing patientlie:</l>
               <l>Againe he ſaith, The humble wight, ſhal be exalted to much might.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And in Saint Luke is written eeke, He hath plucked the mightie low,</l>
               <l>And exalted the humble and meeke, what neede I more hereof to ſhow,</l>
               <l>Since Chriſt himſelfe hath left behind, examples of a patient mind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Whoſe patience and humilitie ech chriſtian ought to imitate,</l>
               <l>For patience bringeth victorie, as proofe doth tell to euerie eſtate:</l>

            <l>The wide renowned conquerour which <hi>Alexander</hi> hight:</l>
            <l>Sonne to the prince of <hi>Macedon,</hi> a man of noble fame,</l>
            <l>Whom famous <hi>Phillip</hi> men did call, <hi>Olympias</hi> was my dame.</l>
            <l>I was but twentie yéeres of age when firſt I ware the crowne,</l>
            <l>And conquered the <hi>Athenians</hi> vnto my high renowne:</l>
            <l>The <hi>Getes</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> the <hi>Argeans</hi> ſterne and ſtout,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Thaulants</hi> and <hi>Anterians</hi> ſtrong on manie a hideous rout.</l>

            <l>And thence I went to <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> beginning warres of new</l>
            <l>In <hi>Aſia,</hi> where I did preuaile, and at one time did ſlay</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Perſians</hi> twentie thouſand and two hundreth in one day:</l>
            <l>There got I cities manie a one, as <hi>Sardes</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi>

            <l>Thence paſt I to <hi>Cilicia,</hi> a countrie large and wide,</l>
            <l>Where I ſubdued <hi>Darius</hi> King for all his pompe and pride,</l>
            <l>Tooke both his mother and his wife, put him to ſhamefull flight,</l>
            <l>A hundreth thouſand <hi>Perſians</hi> and mo, I ſlew in fight.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Strato</hi> King of <hi>Arade</hi> I forſt on bewed knée</l>

            <l>The citie of <hi>Tyre</hi> I put to ſacke, the ſtrongeſt vnder ſunne,</l>
            <l>Which neuer to this day was got ſince firſt the world begunne.</l>
            <l>Then into <hi>Egypt</hi> forth I ſaild, from <hi>Egypt</hi> ouer <hi>Nyle:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>From <hi>Nyle</hi> to <hi>Affricke,</hi> where I wan by conqueſt manie a mile.</l>
            <l>I marched then to <hi>Araby</hi> a fertill ſoile in ſight,</l>
            <l>Where great <hi>Darius</hi> tooke his death with manie a worthie Knight:</l>
            <l>So paſſing ouer <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tiger</hi> ſpéedilie,</l>

            <l>From thence into the <hi>Mardons</hi> land I entred: where at length</l>
            <l>That monſterous nation I ſubdude, &amp; conquered through ſtrength</l>
            <l>The <hi>Medes:</hi> the <hi>Partthians</hi> and <hi>Spartans,</hi> the <hi>Thracians</hi> I ſubdude,</l>

            <l>I conquered through force of armes, quite to the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſeas.</l>
            <l>And when at length I had atchieud <hi>Lyrcanias</hi> furtheſt band,</l>

            <l>From thence to <hi>Dranga</hi> foorth I went, which countrie I deſtroid,</l>
            <l>Compelling ſtrong <hi>Nabarzanes</hi> to <hi>India</hi> thence to void.</l>
            <l>The land of <hi>Aracoſia</hi> I cauſd to yéeld to me,</l>
            <l>Rude <hi>Acadera</hi> and <hi>Bactria</hi> I ſacked valiantly</l>
            <l>The citie of <hi>Cyropoſis,</hi> all <hi>Scithia</hi> and <hi>Bub acen,</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>Baſarians: Dahanes</hi> and <hi>Maurians,</hi> all theſe became my men.</l>
            <l>To <hi>India</hi> then I tooke the waie, which erſt was woon by none,</l>
            <l>Nor entred in by any: but by <hi>Hercules</hi> alone.</l>
            <l>Thence went I to mount <hi>Meroe,</hi> and thence to <hi>Dedala,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Which countries all I brought to wracke, with rich <hi>Amzaga.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Mount <hi>Arum</hi> I beſieged long, and wan it with much fame,</l>
            <l>Yet <hi>Hercules</hi> aſſaulted it, and could not ſacke the ſame.</l>
            <l>King <hi>Omphis, Abiaſares,</hi> and <hi>Gamaxus</hi> kings of <hi>Inde</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Did humbly yéeld themſelues and theirs to do what I aſſignde.</l>
            <l>Then paſſed I <hi>Hydaſpis</hi> ſtreames, where <hi>Porus</hi> king did raigne,</l>
            <l>Who through my force was ouercome, and all his power ſlaine.</l>
            <l>From thence: through deſarts foorth I went vnto the <hi>Sobians</hi> land,</l>
            <l>To <hi>Sugdrians</hi> and <hi>Mallians:</hi> whom I conquerd with my hand.</l>
            <l>And thence vnto the <hi>Oxidricans,</hi> where: at a ſiege alone</l>
            <l>My ſelfe the citie entred in, and ſlue there manie one.</l>
            <l>From thence vnto the <hi>Muſicanes,</hi> and thence to <hi>Preſtia</hi> coſt:</l>
            <l>From thence vnto <hi>Pathalia</hi> I did conuay mine hoſt.</l>
            <l>Thus when I had the furtheſt bonds in all the <hi>Orient</hi> kend,</l>
            <l>And ſawe my ſelfe a conquerer vnto the worlds end,</l>
            <l>I ſailed on the <hi>Ocean</hi> ſea, where no man erſt had béene:</l>
            <l>There manie ſtrange &amp; wonderous things by me were heard &amp; ſéene.</l>
            <l>Some countries ſtrange there I did find, with nations rude to ſée,</l>
            <l>All which I forſt through dent of ſword, to yéeld themſelues to mée.</l>
            <l>And when at laſt the raging ſea, my paſſage did denie:</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:20330:14"/>
And marched backe to <hi>Babylon,</hi> triumphing as a God,</l>
            <l>Where all the princes of the eaſt for me made their abod.</l>
            <l>There did I hold a paleament, almoſt of all the world:</l>
            <l>For ouer all the orient I was the ſoueraigne Lord.</l>
            <l>Wherefore I was ſo proud in hart, ſo pompous and elate,</l>

            <l>Onely attributing the fame of all my good ſucceſſe,</l>
            <l>And conqueſts in ſo ſhort a ſpace, to mine owne worthineſſe,</l>
            <l>And not contented yet therewith, did take preſumptuouſlie</l>
            <l>Vpon my ſelfe the ſonne of mightie <hi>Ioue</hi> to be.</l>
            <l>But in my moſt proſperitie I had a ſoddaine fall,</l>
            <l>I was by them betraied, whom I truſted beſt of all.</l>

            <l>Thus died I through treaſons traine of thoſe I loued moſt:</l>
            <l>Thus were my conqueſts latelie wonne within a moment loſt.</l>
            <l>Thus ſpiteful enuie threw me downe from fortunes ſtatelie ſtage</l>
            <l>Bereft of life, béeing but two and thirtie yéeres of age:</l>
            <l>My bodie was from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Memphis</hi> forth conuaide,</l>

            <l>I tooke all <hi>Lumbardie</hi> by force with famous victorée,</l>
            <l>And placed officers therein to gouerne vnder mée.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Taſsilo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Baiarland,</hi> I conquered in fight,</l>
            <l>His men of wars I ouerthrew: his ſonne (a noble knight)</l>

            <l>All <hi>Italie</hi> I brought perforce to my obeiſiance,</l>

Where I ſlew manie doughtie knights, with dent of deadlie launce.</l>
            <l>Eight yéeres I warred in <hi>Hungarie</hi> againſt thoſe nations ſtout,</l>
            <l>And ceaſed not till finallie I rooted them all out.</l>
            <l>From whence I brought abundance great of gold and ſiluer bright:</l>
            <l>And therewith highlie did aduance and prefer manie a knight,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Lecho</hi> king of <hi>Behemie,</hi> I vanquiſhed in field</l>
            <l>Both he, and all his ſubiects did to my ſubiection yéeld.</l>

            <l>And all the countries that doelie vpon the riuer <hi>Rhyne.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In <hi>France</hi> I held long wars and great againſt foure kings of fame,</l>
            <l>Who were the Duke of <hi>Dordons</hi> ſonnes, at laſt I did them tame.</l>
            <l>In <hi>Rome</hi> I was crownd Emperour, whereby the monarchie</l>
            <l>Tranſlated was from <hi>Rome</hi> vnto my countrey <hi>Germanie.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I was both King and Emperour of all the weſt empire,</l>

            <l>All the kings through Chriſtendome I might command at will:</l>
            <l>It laie in me as ſouereigne Lord to pardon or to ſpill.</l>
            <l>When I had thus triumphantlie obtained what I would:</l>
            <l>I was content to liue at reſt, bicauſe I waxed old.</l>
            <l>And then I led in quietneſſe the laſt part of my life,</l>
            <l>Redreſſing wrong, maintaining peace, ſuppreſſing euerie ſtrife.</l>
            <l>In which time I did build and found thrée Vniuerſities</l>

GVY.</head>
            <l>
               <hi>I</hi> Am <hi>Guy</hi> the Barron bold, of déede the doughtieſt knight</l>
            <l>That in my daies in <hi>England</hi> was, with ſhield or ſpeare in fight.</l>
            <l>An Engliſh man I am by birth, in faith a Chriſtian true:</l>
            <l>The wicked lawes of Infidels I vtterlie eſchue.</l>
            <l>Nine hundreth twentie yéeres and one after Chriſt his birth,</l>
            <l>When King <hi>Athelſtone</hi> ware the crowne, I liued vpon earth.</l>
            <l>Sometime I was of <hi>Warwicke</hi> Earle, and (for to ſay the truth)</l>
            <l>A Ladies loue did me conſtraine to trauell in my youth</l>
            <l>To win me fame in feats of armes, in ſtrange and ſundrie lands,</l>
            <l>Where I atchieued for hir ſake great conqueſts with my hands.</l>
            <l>Firſt I ſaid to <hi>Normandie,</hi> and there I wan in fight</l>
            <l>The Emperours daughter of <hi>Almaine</hi> from manie a worthie knight.</l>
            <l>Alſo in <hi>Lumbardie</hi> my ſelfe, with thrée knights and no more,</l>
            <l>Slew ſixtéene <hi>Lumbards</hi> beeing ambuſht to murder me before,</l>
            <l>Through falſe Duke <hi>Ottons</hi> trecherie, who bare me mortall hate,</l>
            <l>Cauſe of the wound I gaue to him in <hi>Normandie</hi> of late.</l>
            <l>Then paſſed I the ſeas to <hi>Greece,</hi> to helpe the Emperour right</l>
            <l>Againſt the mightie <hi>Souldans</hi> hoſt of <hi>Perſia</hi> to fight:</l>
            <l>Where I did kill of <hi>Sarracens</hi> and <hi>Painims</hi> manie a man,</l>
            <l>And ſlew the <hi>Souldans</hi> couſin eke, who had to name <hi>Coldran.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And <hi>Eſkeldart</hi> a famous knight to death I did purſew:</l>
            <l>And <hi>Elman</hi> King of <hi>Tire</hi> alſo, moſt horrible to vew.</l>
            <l>I went vnto the <hi>Souldans</hi> hoſt, vpon ambaſſage ſent,</l>
            <l>And brought his head away with me, hauing kild him in his tent.</l>
            <l>There was a Dragon in that land, which alſo I did ſlay,</l>
            <l>As he a Lion did purſue moſt fiercely by the way.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Almaine</hi> thence I did retire, and thence to <hi>Loraine</hi> right,</l>
            <l>Where I the Duke of <hi>Painie</hi> kild, his treaſon to requight.</l>
            <l>Then into <hi>England</hi> I did ſaile to wed <hi>Phelis</hi> the bright,</l>
            <l>For loue of whom I trauelled ſo far, to trie my might.</l>
            <l>And when I had eſpouſed hir, I ſtaide but fortie daies,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:20330:26"/>
Vntill I left the Ladie faire, and went from hir my waies,</l>
            <l>Vnto the ſeas in pilgrime ſort my voyage for to take,</l>
            <l>Euen vnto the holie land for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake.</l>
            <l>Where I Earle <hi>Ionas</hi> did redéeme, and all his ſonnes fiftéene:</l>
            <l>Who with the cruell <hi>Sariſins</hi> in priſon long had béene.</l>
            <l>I ſlew the Giant <hi>Amerant,</hi> in battell hand to hand:</l>
            <l>And doughtie <hi>Barnard</hi> killed eke, and Duke of <hi>Painie</hi> land.</l>
            <l>And ſithens came into <hi>England,</hi> and there with <hi>Colbrand</hi> fought:</l>
            <l>An vglie Giant whom the <hi>Danes,</hi> had for their champion ſought,</l>
            <l>And ouercame him in the field, and ſiue him valiantlie:</l>
            <l>And thereby did releaſe the land from tribute vtterlie.</l>
            <l>And afterwards did offer vp the weapon ſolemnlie</l>
            <l>In <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> wherewith I fought in ſight of manie an eie.</l>
            <l>In <hi>Windſor</hi> forreſt I did kill a <hi>Bore</hi> of paſſing ſtrength,</l>
            <l>Whoſe like in <hi>England</hi> neuer was for highnes, breadth, and length.</l>
            <l>Some of his bones in <hi>Warwicke</hi> yet, within the caſtle lie:</l>
            <l>One of his ſhields vnto this daie doth hang in <hi>Couentrie.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I ſlew alſo in <hi>Dunſmore</hi> heath a monſterous wild beaſt,</l>
            <l>Cald the Dun cow of <hi>Dunſmore,</hi> which manie men oppreſt:</l>
            <l>Hir bones alſo in <hi>Warwicke</hi> lie yet, for a monument,</l>
            <l>Which vnto euerie looker on a woonder may preſent.</l>
            <l>And in <hi>Northumberland</hi> I did a Dragon fell deſtroie,</l>
            <l>Which did both men and beaſts oppreſſe and countrey ſore annoie.</l>
            <l>And then to <hi>Warwicke</hi> came againe, but there I was not knowne:</l>
            <l>Wherefore I led an Hermits life, a mile out of the towne.</l>
            <l>Where with my hands I hewed a houſe, out of a rocke of ſtone,</l>
            <l>And liued as a Palmer poore within that caue alone:</l>
            <l>And dailie came to ſeeke my food vnto my caſtell gate,</l>
            <l>Not knowne of my louing wife, which mourned for hir mate,</l>
            <l>Till at the laſt I fell ſore ſicke, and found that I muſt die,</l>
            <l>I ſent to hir a ring, by which ſhe knew me preſentlie:</l>
            <l>And ſo repairing to the caue, before I gaue the ghoſt,</l>
            <l>She cloſed vp my dieng eies, whom once I loued moſt.</l>
            <l>Thus dreadfull death did me arreſt, and laid my corps in graue,</l>
            <l>Thus as a Pilgrime died I, and all my ſoule to ſaue.</l>
            <l>My bodie in <hi>Warwicke</hi> lieth yet, though now conſumed to mould:</l>
            <l>My ſtature there engrand in ſtone this day you may behould.</l>
