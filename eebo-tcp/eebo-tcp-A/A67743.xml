            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>First, So long as you are in your naturall condition; you have <hi>eyes and see not, eares and heare not, hearts and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not</hi> spirituall things:<note place="margin">1 Their ignorance of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things.</note> As <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe plainly affirmes <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.15. and his Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.27. and before them both the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:63051:11"/>
chap. 6.9.10. And the reason of that is, you have a vaile or curtaine <hi>drawne over your hearts: which is</hi> never <hi>taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> untill ye <hi>turne to the Lord</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: at which time <hi>it is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> as you may reade, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monnesse of this sin hath taken away the sense of it.</note>Secondly long custome, and the commonnesse of this sinne; hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the sense of it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. Yea, quite turned it from a sin (and that the greatest) to a vertue. As how many in this land, for all they are <hi>Traytors</hi> to God; and <hi>take up armes against</hi> all that worship him in spirit &amp; in truth: would yet be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (and are so by the blind world) not onely honest men; but good <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>?

custome had not bleered mens minds:<note place="margin">This counted no sin and yet worse then all his fellows</note> it would bee counted no better than open rebellion, and blasphemy against <hi>God</hi>: &amp; so it is counted, by all but them that use it.

Yea, <hi>you so hate the light</hi> of the Gospell; that you shun it all you can <hi>least your deeds should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved,</hi> John 3.19, 10. Or else you <hi>stop your eares, and shut your eyes; least you should see with your eyes, and heare with your eares, and should understand with your hearts; and should he converted, and Christ should heale you,</hi> as himselfe affirmes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.15.

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Here upon; because you <hi>will not receive the truth in love, that you might be saved: for this cause, God gives you up to strong delusions; that you should beleeve a lye. That all of you might be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:63051:12"/>

            <p>And because hee cannot force men against their wills;<note place="margin">Satan pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes most by descep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our reason.</note> (which leaves us without excuse) for though that old <hi>Sheba,</hi> blowes many an inticing blast, to carry us away from our true allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to <hi>Christ Iesus our King</hi>: yet the minde of man is not capable of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation, either from man or Sathan: therefore he useth his utmost pollicy to perswade us.

If they in the state of innocency, when they had wisdome at wil, and reason at command; found him too hard for them; when they fell once to argue the case with him; how much more too weake shall wee finde our selves, that are as wee are; and when our owne flesh is become our Enemy, and his cunning Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>My brethren! be no longer deceived, but hearken more to what <hi>God</hi> speaks in his word; lesse to the Tempter: for hee will set a faire coulour, upon the foulest sinne that ever was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb facs="tcp:63051:13"/>
witnesse his words to <hi>Eve,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He will put a faire coulour upon the foulest sin and make the best action o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</note> when shee eate the forbidden fruite, at the price of death eternall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.

Yea, through Sathans subtilty, Christ was made the greatest offender; that offended not once in all his life, which would make a wise man suspect his owne judgement or the common fame, &amp; to examin things throughly, before they condemne one, whom they know no evill by. But not to weary you with instances, If hee can perswade men (as

               <p>And experience proves, that not a few amongst us doe steep their words in hate and curses against the good, carrying this deadly poyson, these arrows, swords, knives, razors in their mouthes, wherewith to interlace their discourse, whether in reviling the present, or backbiting the absent.</p>
               <p>There is a generation (pity they should be called Christians) all whose <hi>Prayers</hi> are <hi>Curses,</hi> and all their relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lyes: Or if sometimes they lend the truth their voice,<note place="margin">Wicked men lye when they speake the truth.</note> they are but false witnesses in speaking of it; for their hearts are of another judgement.

               <p>Prosperous successe hides many a false heart, as a drift of snow covers a heape of dung: but when that white mantle melts, the filthy rottennesse will soon appeare.</p>

                  <hi>That the causelesse curse shall not come, Prov</hi> 26.2. or at least, it shall not come where the curser meant it. Yea, the Psalmist tells us plainly, That <hi>though they curse, yet God will blesse, Psalm.</hi> 109.28. And his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing shall doe us good, while their curses hurt none but themselves: for what saith the Holy Ghost in the same Psalme, speaking of the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked, whose brand is, that <hi>they love cursing.</hi> The words are these, <hi>As he loved cursing,</hi>

Let it be unto him, as a garment to cover him, and for a girdle, wherewith he shall be alwayes girded,</hi> ver. 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Heare this all yee whose tongues run so fast on the Devils errand, Yee loved cursing, you shall have it, both upon you, about you, and in you, and that everlastingly, if you persevere and goe on. For if Christians be charged
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63051:77"/>
to blesse their enemies; what will bee their case, that curse their friends? Yea, if he which but curseth Satan curseth his owne soule, as it is, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 21.27.

               <p>Cursing mouthes are like ill made Peeces, which while men discharge at others, recoile in splinters upon their owne faces.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63051:118"/>
for upon the same ground, they even crucified <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, <hi>Father forgive them,</hi> saith he of his murtherers, <hi>for they know not what they doe.</hi> And why have <hi>the Kings of the earth, in all ages banded themselves together against the Lord, and against his Christ,</hi> Psal. 22.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63051:119"/>
Sin indeed at the first was the cause of ignorance, but now ignorance is the cause of sin: <hi>Swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and whoring abound,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>because there is no knowledge of God in the land,</hi> Hos. 4.1.2. <hi>It is a people that doe erre in their hearts.</hi> saith God, <hi>why? because they have not knowne my wayes,</hi> Psal. 95.10.</p>

Or if they knew God, they would keep his commandments, <hi>for hereby,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iohn, is it knowne that wee know God, if we keep his Commandements,</hi> 1 John 2.3. <hi>but he that saith I know him, and yet keepeth not his Commandements, is a lyar, and there is no truth in him,</hi> Ver. 4.

               <p>Alas!

               <p>The Devil makes large promises, and perswades his, they shall have what they desire; yet ever disappoints them of their hopes, as he did our first Parents: <hi>Diabolus mentitur, ut fallet; vitam polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetur, ut perimat,</hi>

neither. Yea, this makes it plain, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they believe there is no God at all, or else that God is not just, and true, nor speakes as he meanes in his word; which is worse:<note place="margin">Carnall men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the promises but not the precepts nor threats</note> or if they do believe that he is a just and true God, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve also that they shall be punished (as he threatens) for their provoking of him; and they provoke him, that they may be punished; which is worst of all.
