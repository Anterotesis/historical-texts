            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Happened to come into the Houſe of Lords at the
time when your Lordſhips were Hearing Council
againſt the Bill, for the Prohibiting the Exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Woollen Manufactures from <hi>Ireland</hi> to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Parts; and altho' I was of the Opinion, that
the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> was fo nearly concern'd in that
Matter, as that it would appear at firſt ſight to all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſſed
Perſons, that there was an abſolute Neceſſity
of putting a ſtop to the growth of ſuch a Manufactury
there, which muſt in its Natural Conſequences raviſh
from us our Principal Trade, anticipate and divert the
Source of our Wealth and Power, and by eaſie and (at
firſt) imperceptible degrees, exhauſt the very Life and
Soul of <hi>England,</hi> by drawing away the Working People
and Trading Stock: Yet when I came to Obſerve, that
even the Committing the Bill did admit of a long argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in your Honourable Houſe, and was not carried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much Oppoſition, it brought me to Conſider, that
how clear ſoever it may ſeem to Men that have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
in the Practice of Trade, yet it muſt be a Matter
of great Difficulty for your Lordſhips to determine in ſuch
things, where the Judgment is directed from Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103578:3"/>
only, ſince thoſe Informations are generally given
with the greateſt partiality: And I know by my own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that any Impreſſions receiv'd from Perſons for
whom we have ſome Favour or Compaſſion, are apt to
create ſo ſtrong a prejudging of the Caſe, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſo eaſily diſcern the reaſonableneſs of the contrary
Arguments, or ſuffer our ſelves to be Convinc'd without
the cleareſt Demonſtrations poſſible. 'Tis therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I have thought the Well-being of my Countrey to
depend very much upon this Caſe, and that I believe it
capable of ſo plain a Demonſtration, that I have thought
it my Duty to endeavour to ſet this Controverſie in ſo
true a Light, as that it might not be difficult for your
Lordſhips to make a right Judgment therein.</p>
            <p>I have indeed been ſo far from concerning my ſelf in
this Matter hitherto, as that I have not ſo much as ſeen
the Bill, and therefore I ſhall not pretend to meddle with
the Methods taken therein; my Deſign being only to
ſhew the Neceſſity there is upon us to ſtop the progreſs of
ſuch Manufacturys in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which directly interfere
with thoſe of <hi>England;</hi> to evince which, I ſhall offer a
few Propoſitions, which I take to be ſo evident, as that
they will admit of no Controverſie.</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>England</hi> hath no other means of procuring Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
than by vending a greater Value of her Commodities in
Forreign Markets, than what ſhe expends in Merchandiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
imported from abroad.</p>
            <p>2. That the far greater Value of the Exportations of
<hi>England</hi> ariſes from her Woollen Manufactures.</p>
            <p>3. That <hi>England</hi> hath always been able to ſend as much
of her Woollen Manufacturies abroad, as could be vended
in Forreign Markets.</p>
            <p>4. That whatſoever Countrey can afford their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturies
cheapeſt, muſt infallibly gain the Trade from
that Countrey that cannot work ſo cheap.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:103578:3"/>
            <p>5. That <hi>Ireland</hi> is able to make many of the ſame kinds
of Woollen Manufactures cheaper than <hi>England,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will never want a Vent for them in Forreign Markets.</p>
            <p>6. That the whole Quantity of ſuch Manufactures
which <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhall ſupply in Forreign Markets, will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Sale of ſo much from <hi>England,</hi> and conſequently
the whole Value thereof will be ſo much clear Loſs to
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. That whatſoever Number of People ſhall be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Trade in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the ſame Number of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers
muſt ſit ſtill in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. That ſuch People to avoid ſtarving at home, will
go to <hi>Ireland</hi> for Work, by which Means the Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactury
in <hi>Ireland</hi> may ſoon come to be greater than
that in <hi>England,</hi> and in time the whole Trade would moſt
probably be Eſtabliſht there, and loſt here.</p>
            <p>The fatal Conſequences that flow from theſe Premiſes,
are too obvious to need further Illuſtration here; but the
matter will yet appear more plain, when I come to anſwer
the Arguments which have been offered againſt the Bill;
To which I proceed,</p>
            <p>1ſt. <hi>That the Government of</hi> England <hi>have at ſeveral
times given Encouragement to the ſettling a Woolen Manuf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and therefore 'twould be very unreaſonable, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have with great Charge and Difficulty brought the
ſame to ſome Perfection, to deſtroy it at once, and ruine the
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, That (ſuppoſing this to be true) former times
might not ſee through all the Inconveniencies that might
accrew to <hi>England</hi> by ſettling a Woollen Manufactury in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or perhaps they intended that encouragement only to
capacitate them to make Clothing for themſelves, but not to
enable them to interfere with <hi>England</hi> in its Forreign Trade;
for certainly our Anceſtors who prohibited the ſending
their Woolls to Forreign Parts, never intended to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103578:4"/>
them to ſend the Manufactures made thereof,
which would do us a far greater Damage. But as
<hi>England</hi> hath always ſhewn her Parental Care over
all her Colonies, in being ready to give them all the
Encouragement neceſſary to their Well Being; ſo
She ought alſo to Exert her Power in reſtraining
them, when She finds them Enterprizing any thing
that may prove Injurious to her ſelf; and in this She
is juſtifi'd as well by Reaſon, as by the Practice of all
Nations that have Planted Colonies. As to the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
the leaſt Compaſſion poſſible is due to them, becauſe
(as they are thought to be Engliſh-men) they ought not
to have deſigned their own Intereſt, ſo much to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England,</hi> and they may find out ways enough to
employ their Stocks, without iniuring the Publick.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That 'tis the Intereſt of</hi> England <hi>to Encourage the
increaſe of Riches in</hi> Ireland, <hi>that it may be in the better
Condition to contribute to its own Support upon any Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,
and leſſen the Charge of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>This is a very true Argument, and will run on all four
when rightly apply'd; but there is an unhappy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
that makes it downright Lame in this Caſe;
for there is a vaſt Difference between <hi>Ireland</hi>'s gaining
wealth, by any way of Induſtry peculiar to themſelves
and inoffenſive to <hi>England;</hi> and their incroaching upon
that Trade, which is the only way by which <hi>England</hi>
can attract Riches; for 'tis plain that all they ſhall
gain thereby, will be a clear Loſs to us, and that 'twere
better for us to Maintain them in ſitting ſtill, than
to ſuffer them to work in ſuch a way as muſt nndo us.
This would diſable us to give them the neceſſary Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
in time of need, and they would hereby cut the
Prop that Supports them.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>That by putting down this Manufactury, the Poor of</hi>
Ireland <hi>will be Deſtitute of Work, many Familys would be</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:103578:4"/>
               <hi>Ruined, and an unreaſonable Hardſhip put upon a Counsry, but
juſt recovering it ſelf after a Deſtructive War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis Anſwer enough, ſince this is but the Beginning
of a new Buſineſs, to ask how they lived before? But
'tis certain, that the Poor of <hi>Ireland</hi> do ſubſiſt very
eaſily: Lands are very Cheap (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not one<note n="*" place="margin">A Gentleman who liv'd in the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> told me, that for about 13. <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> Rack-Rent, he had Land enough to keep 50 Head of Black Cattle, and breed more Corn than his Family could ſpend.</note> eighth part of the
Value of ours, generally ſpeaking)
and Proviſions of all Kinds in
great plenty. A Cow or two of
ten Shillings Price, and a Potatoe
Garden, will Support a Family,
meaning of ſuch as are next to Poverty; but he
that can Rent ten Pound <hi>Per Annum,</hi> may keep
two Diſhes of Meat at his Table the Year round; ſo
that no Body can want a livelyhood there, that will
but exert the leaſt Induſtry; whereas in <hi>England,</hi> the
Working People are very numerous, Land and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
extreamly dearer: Many thouſands Depend who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the Manufacturies, and cannot live of themſelves
when they are not employ'd. This Manufactury, (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that for Tranſportation) is yet but growing in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and few Hands (in Compariſon to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
that live by it in <hi>England</hi>) are yet employed in
it; ſo that the Diſappointment cannot at this time
be great to them; but if we ſhould Suffer it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
longer, the great Encouragement will make it
grow ſo conſiderably, as that the effects will ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſo viſible in <hi>England,</hi> that neceſſity will compel
us to put a ſtop to it, and then the Hardſhip will
ſeem ſo much the more to the People of <hi>Ireland;</hi> by
how much the greater numbers have brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Depend upon that way of Living. 'Tis
true indeed, that the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> have endured
great Hardſhips by the War; but 'tis as certain, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103578:5"/>
they have been reeſtabliſht in the quiet enjoyment of their
Lands and Poſſeſſions, at a great Expence of the Blood
and Treaſure of <hi>England;</hi> and I believe, if thoſe very Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that are now ſo zealous in ſolliciting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this Bill, had been told, when they were under the
extremity of the War, that there would be a neceſſity upon
us, for the ſecuring that Trade from whence we deriv'd our
principal Subſiſtence, and the Capacity to help them in time
of need, to Prohibit their Interfereing with us in our Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Manufactures; they would then have aſſented to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs
of it, as a Reſpect juſtly due to their Protectors.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>That the quantities they make are ſo inconſiderable, as
that it cannot hurt</hi> England; <hi>that there is no Probability
of their increaſing the Trade to any great Degree, and that a
great part of the Workmanſhip there is ſo dear, as that they
cannot make their Goods much cheaper there than in</hi> England.</p>
            <p>Every one knows that the greateſt Undertakings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from ſmall Beginnings, but that when the firſt Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
are overcome they eaſily go on, and increaſe in a
much greater Proportion than the firſt appearance. Before
the War, they came in four Years, to export in the laſt Year
11360 pieces, and ſince the Reduction of <hi>Ireland</hi> they are in
four Years come to above 4000 pieces, notwithſtanding
the Hindrances of the War; and it may be remarkt, that
they advanced from 2000 and upward in the Year 1695.
to above 4000 in 1696. Thus much they acknowledge; and
theſe are not ſhort Steps. They can never want a ready Sale
for all they can make, becauſe they Sell cheaper than we;
Plenty of Work will attract Plenty of Workmen, theſe will
take as many Apprentices as they can Employ; in ſeven
Years the Apprentices will become Maſters, and in three
Years more even their Apprentices will become able Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
who can doubt but by that time (or a little longer)
their increaſe (with thoſe alſo that come to them from
<hi>England</hi>) will be enough to Manufacture all the Woolls
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103578:5"/>
of <hi>Ireland.</hi> But I'll ſuppoſe for Argument ſake, that
they make but to the value of One Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds yearly, and that they would not Sell for
more than Ten Pounds <hi>Per Cent.</hi> cheaper rhan <hi>England</hi>
uſually doth: Suppoſing alſo, that <hi>England</hi> ſends abroad
the value but of one Million yearly, of Goods of the
like Kinde; 'twill be eaſily granted me, that if any
one Offers his Goods cheaper than the uſual Price,
that will then become the Market-Price, and every one
elſe muſt Sell at the ſame or Keep his Goods: By this
'tis plain, that <hi>England</hi> muſt abate 100000 <hi>l.</hi> out of the
the former value of her Million, for the ſake of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s
100000 <hi>l.</hi> and then ſhe looſes another 100000 <hi>l.</hi>
by <hi>Ireland</hi>'s taking that Money in the Markets, which
<hi>England</hi> ſhould otherwiſe ſolely Furniſh: So that 'tis
clear from this Conſideration, if no more were to be
ſaid to it; That 'twere more advantagious to <hi>England</hi>
by the one half, to Buy theſe Goods and Throw them
into the Sea, than to Suffer <hi>Ireland</hi> to Sell cheaper
than we can in Forreign Markets. But the arguing,
that Weaving and ſome other Parts of the Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is as dear as in <hi>England,</hi> is a perfect Fallacy; for
beſides that, they only Suggeſt it without Proof, yet
if it were ſo at the firſt attempting ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactury,
that could only be occaſioned through the
ſcarcity of Workmen, but would every Year grow
cheaper as thoſe Workmen ſhould encreaſe, and enough
is ſaid above, to ſhew that that will be the Infallible
Conſequences of an Encouraging Trade; and ſince I
may modeſtly affirm that Proviſions are not (gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſpeaking) at above half the Price there, to what
they are in <hi>England,</hi> and labour holding always in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereto, 'tis not unreaſonable to expect that they will
in time come to work at leaſt one third cheaper than we
can, and if they ſhould make as much as they can then
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103578:6"/>
Sell for 200000 <hi>l,</hi> that will be equal in Quantity to
our 300000 <hi>l.</hi> and abate ſo much out of the Sale of our
Million, and then by the Fall in Price, the remaining
700000 <hi>l.</hi> would yield but 466666⅔ <hi>l.</hi> So that 'tis plain,
that if <hi>Ireland</hi> gains Riches by this Trade, 'twill be
at the Expence of impoveriſhing <hi>England.</hi> I cannot
but Remark here, that the main Body of the Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
againſt this Bill, conſiſted in Gentlemen, Poſſeſſors
of Lands in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who though they may be excuſed
from having any nice Underſtanding in a matter of
Trade (as this properly is) yet it ſeems they have ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
learnt, that the flouriſhing of their new Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
would cauſe the Lands of <hi>Ireland</hi> to riſe, to
which without Doubt, 'tis their Intereſt to have more
reguard, than to the keeping up the value of the
Lands of <hi>England,</hi> which by this Method of inticeing
away its Mouths, would certainly Fall in value as faſt
as thoſe in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould riſe.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>That the high Duties payable upon all Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
brought into</hi> England, <hi>amount to a prohibition of the</hi>
Iriſh; <hi>and that if it were intended that theirs ſhould be
brought hither, the Dutises ought to be moderated ſo, as to
bear but a juſt proportion to what they can work cheaper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will be ſo free as to acknowledge, that I beleive
the Houſe of Commons intended no leſs by this Bill,
than the ſuppreſſing all Exporation of Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the utter diſcouraging the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of that Trade there; but to lay ſuch a Duty as
might at preſent ſeem equal to the difference of Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
would utterly defeat that intent: For, as I have
noted before, they may ſoon come to work ſo much lower
than they now do, as that they may be able to bring
their Goods into <hi>England</hi> at ſo ſmall a Duty, and be
encourag'd to keep on their Manufactury there, which
though by this means it may not ſo much prejudice our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103578:6"/>
Forreign Trade, by beating down the Prices; yet it
will have its full effect in taking away the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Manufacturers, and drawing them into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and, as was truly ſaid by their own Council, would
indeed lower the value of the Woollen Goods on the
Makers here: Though by the way, I think that could be
no argument in their Favour. Moreover, what aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
can we have, but that if they are ſuffered to
make ſuch Goods there, they may ſhip them for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Parts by ſtealth, without paying any Duty at all?
The Manufacture being of much leſs bulk than the Wools,
which they tell us plainly, will be apt to be ſent for
<hi>France,</hi> if they be debarr'd from working it up there;
though I doubt not but that if our Legiſlature will exert
its Power, it may be ſmart enough with them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
both.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>That their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking doth not interfere with the
main Branch of our Manufactuary, the Cloathing-Trade,
but that they do yet continue to buy great Quantities of Cloth
from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed is true at preſent, but when they ſhall
have conſiderably encreas'd the number of their Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and brought their People into the way of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Wools, who can doubt but that they will be
at that alſo? their Conteſt indeed now is only in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to what we commonly call the New Drapery, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of Bays, Serges and Stuffs, which makes up a
mighty part of our Exportations, and the Injury they
will come to do us therein cannot be leſs than what I
have before noted; to which I might add, that <hi>Ireland</hi>
affords us great Quantities of that ſort we call long
Wool for Combing, of which thoſe Goods are made,
and if they ſhall work it up themſelves, the wanting of
that Supply will be very ſenſible to us.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the moſt mateaial Objections againſt the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103578:7"/>
Bill that occur to my Memory, and I hope I have fairly
anſwer'd them: But that I may give a full View of
the whole Controverſie in its true ſhape, I will (after
the old way of arguing) repreſent it by a Simile.</p>
            <p>A good old Gentleman, Poſſeſſor of great Tracts of
Land abounding in plenty of all things fit for life, but
especially in the greateſt Quantity of Sheep of any in
his whole Country, happily fell into the way of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſacturing
his Wools, in which he became ſo ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as to be able to out do all other People, and furniſh
all his Neighbours with the greateſt part of what they
us'd; by which means he was not only capacitated to
ſupport a very numerous Family, but alſo attracted to
himſelf great Riches, and became equal in Power to
moſt of his Neighbours; he had ſetled his eldeſt Son
in a very conſiderable part of his Eſtate at a diſtance
from him, which he had formerly gain'd by Conqueſt,
giving him the full Liberty of enjoying all the Product of
an abundant Soyl, only reſerving this advantage to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that what Wool the Son ſhould have to ſpare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Quantity which he ſhould need for the cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own Family, he ſhould be oblig'd to ſell to the
Father, and not to any other Perſon, becauſe that would
extreamly injure him in his Woollen Manufactury Buſineſs,
which was the main Support of his Eſtate. The Son
liv'd plentifully, and flouriſht greatly, only the ancient
Poſſeſſors of the Eſtate (who were a very numerous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily)
being compell'd by the Power of the Father to live
in ſubjection under him, were apt to take frequent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
to give him great diſturbance, and by reaſon of
their numbers ſometimes prevail'd againſt him; yet he
was always readily aſſiſted by the Father, who never
fail'd by the ſtrength of his Purſe and Power, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
his Enemies, and to reſettle him in the quiet Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Eſtate. The laſt Inſurrection they made
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103578:7"/>
was by far the greateſt, becauſe they were aſſiſted by
a very potent Neighbour, and it coſt the Father a mighty
Sum to quell it. But the Son was no ſooner ſettled in
quiet, but he ſets his People to work upon making the
ſame kinds of Woollen Manufacturies which was the
Father's Trade, and ſends them to the ſame Markets
for Sale; the Father is juſtly offended at this, and
foreſeeing the great Injury which the Son's going on
in ſuch a Trade would prove to him, reſolves to put
a ſtop to it; the Son complains mightily againſt
this; alledging, that 'tis unreaſonable to deprive him
of ſuch means to enrich himſelf, and that if he be
denied this way, 'twould become a Temptation to
his Tenants and People to ſell the Wools to others;
upon which the Father beſpeaks him after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
Son, Thou knoweſt well that my Charge and
Expence is very great, having many other Children to
provide for beſides thy ſelf, and that it hath coſt me
vaſt Summs to protect thee in the Poſſeſſion of the Eſtate
which I have given thee, which is ſufficient to give
thee a very abundant Subſiſtence without thy interfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with me in my peculiar Trade, which thou ſeeſt
is the only way I have to gain Wealth, and to enable
me to ſupport all my Children, of which thou haſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been the moſt chargeable to me, and yet thou
haſt often been ready to make uſe of the advantages
which thy profitable Portion hath given thee to encroach
upon me, not only in my Woollen, but alſo in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of my Trade, which I could not ſpare thee;
and therefore if thou wilt not have a due Sence of my
Intereſt, and conſider how much thy own is concern'd
in it, aſſure thy ſelf that I will take that care of my
own Affairs, as to uſe my paternal Power to reſtrain
thee in all ſuch matters of Trade, which I ſhall find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with my well-being. And although I ſhall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103578:8"/>
always be willing to encourage thee in any thing that
tends not to my own hurt; yet if thou ſhalt not deſiſt
from ſending thy Woollen Goods to the Markets, which
I have of long time been us'd to furniſh, I will by my
Authority take from thee all thy Woool combers, and
prohibit that any ſuch Trade ſhall be exercis'd in thy
Family for the future, thereby to incapacitate thee from
making thoſe Commodities, with which thou canſt do
me ſo much hurt: And if thou ſhalt not be careful
to keep thy People from ſelling their Wool to Strangers,
I will ſend Officers to keep an Exact Regiſtry of all
thy Sheep, and ſecure thy Wool in Ware-houſes as it
is ſhorn, that it may not be in thy Power to deal fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently
by me in an Affair which ſo nearly concerns
me.</p>
            <p>I am yet no Enemy to the People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
wiſh them all the Proſperity that can Conſiſt with the
Well Being of <hi>England:</hi> I own 'tis our Intereſt, that
they ſhould grow Rich, but not by ſuch Means as
will ſooner Impoveriſh us than Advance them. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it would be a uſeful Policy, and worth the
Care of <hi>England,</hi> to Promote any ſuch Manufacturies
in <hi>Ireland</hi> as may not Jar with ours, whereby the
People there may not only Gain Wealth, but even the
multitude of <hi>Iriſh</hi> be drawn into a more civilized way
of Liveing, which would tame them faſter than any
Severities we can uſe; for a People brought into a
ſettled and profitable way of Living, would ſoon come
to a better Underſtanding, than to be apt to quit
their Eaſe and Profit at every Call of the Turblent
Gentry and their Prieſts. The Country is every way
ſit for a Linnen Manufactury, and wants nothing but
a Stock to eſtabliſh it: Private Undertakers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
too weak to ſtrugle with the Difficulties that
attend the Beginnings of great Undertakings, but the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103578:8"/>
mighty Publick would eaſily go through with it: It
would be Money well employed, if the Government
of <hi>England</hi> lent them 100,000 <hi>l.</hi> to eſtabliſh it, and
though we may not be in a Condition to do it at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
yet I hope ſuch a thought may not be forgotten
when we can better ſpare it. The Objection, that our
Neighbour Nations of whom we now buy our Linnen
would be offended at it, and refuſe to take our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
I take to be a wrong Notion: The Alterations
and Charges of Trade are not uncommon, and move
by degrees not ſoon to be obſerv'd: If we again buy Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
in <hi>France</hi> as before the War, <hi>Germany</hi> muſt take leſs of
our Money, yet, as many other Nations deal with them
for it, their Trade will go on, and the many diſtant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
from whence 'tis brought to the Markets at <hi>Hamburgh</hi>
and <hi>Bremen,</hi> if they are ſenſible of ſome leſſening of their
Vent, will ſcarce reflect directly upon the Cauſe, or if
they ſhould, ſuch Reſentments are not apt to be of any
conſequence; the People muſt have Woollen Cloaths,
and no Body can furniſh them with our ſorts upon equal
Terms with us, if we do but manage our Trade as we
are able; and 'tis evident that People will not eaſily be
diverted from what they have been us'd to and like,
witneſs our continuing in the full uſe of <hi>French</hi> Goods
before the War, when they had as it were prohibited
ours. And though this Caution hath been often urg'd
in Diſcourſes of Trade, yet I never knew one inſtance of
any Nations being piqued at another to ſuch a degree,
as to break off their Commerce; though I have known
ſeveral inſtances of ſuch Occaſions given. Some prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reguard, either to the Benefit of the Cuſtoms, the
Profit of the Merchants, or the like, is always had; ſo
that Governments ſeem to be ſteer'd by this Principle,
That if they cannot Vend in Trade as much as they
would, they will yet continue to ſell what they can, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103578:9"/>
acquieſce with the Shop-keepers Rule, That Cuſtom is
no Inheritance, if they looſe one Chap man, they get
another, and meaſure not their Trade by Particulars, but
in the general. I have enlarg'd upon this point even
to a Digreſſion, becauſe I was willing to take this
Opportunity to offer my Sentiments upon it, for that
I have upon divers occaſions thought that Argument
to have been us'd rather to ſerve a turn, than for any
real Weight there was in it, and that I think we ough<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <head>REMARKS
Upon a BOOK, Entituled,
<hi>Some Thoughts on the BILL depending,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Had written the foregoing Papers in the Country,
and coming to Town to put them in the Preſs, I
met with a Book, Entituled, <hi>Some Thoughts on a Bill
depending before the Honourable Houſe of Lords,</hi> &amp;c. And
although I am cut ſhort in time, yet I will beſtow a
few Remarks upon it; notwithſtanding that I think
the main points in Controverſie, are ſufficiently argu'd
in the fore-going Diſcourſe. I will acknowledge that
the Author hath a pretty inſinuating way of Writing
and a good turn of Thought, but his Skill ſeems ill
beſtow'd upon ſo wrong a Subject, it looks like fine
drawing upon a Thred-bare Coat, the Wool is worn
off and the Rent won't be covered.</p>
            <p>If the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſpend good part
of their Eſtates in <hi>England</hi> tis their own choice, and the
Product of their Butter, Leather, Raw-hides, Tallow,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they ſend to the Neighbouring Countries
of <hi>Europe,</hi> and of the vaſt Quantities of Proviſions ſent
to the Plantations, their Wool, Flax, Skins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is ſufficient, to bear that Expence, and moreover to
pay for all the mighty value of Commodities which he
ſays they buy from us; and this is largely prov'd by
the current of Exchange between us, a Guinea paſſes
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103578:10"/>
there for 26 <hi>s.</hi> which is near 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> difference in
the <hi>par</hi> of the Money; but as the <hi>Proemio</hi> of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
hath of late been under, that ſhews that the
Ballance of the Trade muſt be in their Favour. If much
of their Trade be carried on by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stocks, yet the
People are paid for their Commodities, and the Profit
they receive thereby may be Encouragement enough for
them, if they can be content when they are well.</p>
            <p>His Computation of the great profit they are to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
is at random, do we not deſerve the utmoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
they can yield? and all too little in conſideration of
the vaſt charge we have been at to protect them in the
poſſeſſion of ſuch mighty Landed Eſtates which they
enjoy.</p>
            <p>God be thanked, that the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> is <gap reason="illegible: damage" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently
repleniſht with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inhabitants, and they
are again in a flouriſhing Condition, notwithſtanding
the Deſolations of the late War; but to perſwade us to
encourage the ſending of more numbers of People thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than we can well ſpare, will ſcarce take with us;
for if their Strengthning that Country would be of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to them, their remaining here is much more ſo
to us, and 'tis better for us to have People to ſpare to
ſend to their Aſſiſtance upon Occaſion, than for us to
need help from them. As for their leaving the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
if we ſhall lay difficulties upon them, (as he calls it)
or of their joining with any other Intereſt than that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
how extravagant is it to imagine, that thoſe People
ſhould be ſo eaſily picqu'd into a leaving their Settlements
there? when 'tis certain that he that hath 100 l. <hi>per Annum</hi>
there, can live more plentifully than upon 500 l. <hi>per
Annum</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and yet his 100 l. <hi>per Annum</hi> would
yield him but 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, and that will buy him
but 50 l. <hi>per Annum</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> a fine Exchange: Such
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103578:10"/>
another 'twould be, to quit the Government of <hi>England</hi>
to put themſelves under that of <hi>France,</hi> (for no Body
elſe can protect them). But theſe Thoughts are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
and the inſinuation is a Crime againſt, and
a moſt unreaſonably Reflection upon the worthy <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Gentlemen of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for whom 'twould be impoſſible
to degenerate into ſo much <hi>Iriſh</hi> Underſtanding, and ſo
little love to their Mother Country: But 'tis a ſufficient
indication of a hard cauſe when Men are put to their
Shifts for Arguments, and forc't to hall them in by the
Neck and Shoulders, as hath been this Gentleman's caſe
in almoſt all he hath us'd.</p>
            <p>They are not contending for Power or great Riches,
they neither trade to <hi>Eaſt Indies, Turky</hi> or <hi>Africa,</hi> they
have neither <hi>Hamborough, Hudſons Bay, Greenland</hi> or <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi>
Company; very fine, and have not the Subjects of
<hi>England</hi> been debarr'd from the ſame Trades, except
they would buy Stocks in the Companies? and might
not the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> if they had Money to ſpare,
come in upon the ſame Terms? Let them ſay no more
of this, their Merchants are no way reſtrain'd more than
the People of <hi>England,</hi> they may ſend Ships from thence
to all parts of the World, or concern themſelves in any
Adventures in Trade with as much freedom as our
ſelves, they cannot indeed bring ſome kinds of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
directly for <hi>Ireland</hi> no more can we.</p>
            <p>They have no Fleets or Plantations: What Colonys
ever had? What an Exclamation follows next? as if
they were forbid the Benefit of Earth and Air, and the
Libertys allow'd by the Law of Nature, which have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been denyed by the greateſt Conquerors: Do they
not freely enjoy Earth and Air? have th<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> not liberty
to ſend abroad their Native Commodities? May they
not Manufacture what they have Occaſion for of their
own Product? yet becauſe they muſt not bring their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103578:11"/>
Cattel or Proviſions to <hi>England,</hi> (though they may
ſend as much as they can ſpare to our Plantations) and
underſell the Staple Commodities of <hi>England</hi> in Forreign
Markets, they are undone. 'Tis evident that <hi>England</hi>
hath been ſufficiently put to it to ſupport her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not Withſtanding all the Advantages ſhe can
raiſe by her Trade and otherwiſe, ſhe is involv'd in a
very great Debt; and for her to ſuffer <hi>Ireland</hi> to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
the Trade of her Manufactures, would indeed be
the ready way to undoe her.</p>
            <p>His diſtinction of Colonies for Trade and Colonies
for Empire, is contriv'd on purpoſe to fit <hi>Ireland;</hi> but
by his good leave, are not all Colonies upon the ſame
foot of keeping the Natives in Subjection, where there
are any under their Juriſdiction? to ſay nothing of ours
on the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> where altho' we treat the
<hi>Indians</hi> more civilly than as a conquer'd People, yet
there's reaſon enough to ſay that we are oblig'd to
keep them in Subjection; the <hi>Dutch</hi> have many Colonies
in <hi>India,</hi> where they keep the <hi>Incolae</hi> in Subjection, and
yet they don't give them Liberty to ſend their Spices
and other natural Product to what Markets they pleaſe,
but they do reſtrain their whole Trade to their Mother
Country, and not only they, but all other Countries
that have had Colonies (ſince the Encreaſe and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of Trade) do (as far as I have ever heard) in
Fact contradict this Aſſertion of his, and I beleive <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
hath the greateſt Liberty in that reſpect of any
Colony in the World.</p>
            <p>He inſinuates, that if <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be debarr'd from
making Woollen Manufactures, yet <hi>England</hi> muſt not
expect to reap the whole Benefit, <hi>Holland, Scotland, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,
Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> pretend alſo to the Woollen
Manufacture and will vye with us. I ſay theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
do not interfere with us any thing conſiderably in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103578:11"/>
greateſt part of our ſorts of Goods, and if we do
but come to ſo good a management of our Trade as we
are capable, we ſhall be able to maintain it beyond
them, and none but <hi>Ireland,</hi> by her having Wools and Work
cheaper, can ſpoil us. But I wonder the Gentleman hath
never heard of any Nations beſides <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi>
with whom <hi>Ireland</hi> hath dealt for Manufactures; it
ſeems as if neither himſelf, nor thoſe that inſtructed
him, were acquainted with the practice of Trade; for
'tis certain that <hi>Ireland</hi> ſends more Woollen Goods to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Flanders,</hi> than to any other Countries.</p>
            <p>In all that he ſays, to cloud the Buſineſs of their Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cheaper, he is as ill employ'd as if he were blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Feathers againſt the Wind, his Arguments flye back
in his Face. 'Tis not worth my while to trace his long
Inſinuations, I have ſaid enough to that Point in the
former Diſcourſe; if he Diſputes againſt Principles, I
have done with him: Nothing leſs can be offer'd in
this Caſe, than to prove, that Proviſions are not cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in <hi>Ireland</hi> than in <hi>England;</hi> that plenty of Work, and
good Pay in one Countrey, will not draw Work-men
from a Neighbour Countrey where they are very plenty,
and Work is ſcarce, that thoſe very Work men will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be perſwaded to abate of the high Wages which
was at firſt given them, although their Numbers ſhould
increaſe to ever ſo many, and Proviſſons be ſo cheap,
that they could live very well at Half Wages. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all, to Clench it, he ought to demonſtrate to us
plainly, that 'tis not becauſe <hi>Ireland</hi> ſells cheaper than
<hi>England,</hi> that Merchants leave us, and come to them
to buy other Woollen Goods beſides their Stockings,
Stuffs and Frizes, but 'tis for ſome pretty charm which
they have to attract them, though the incident Charges
be a little higher there than here. But who can forbear
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103578:12"/>
his pretty compariſon of the Labour of the Blacks and
the Artificers in the <hi>Weſt-Indies?</hi> can the Labour of a
Slave bear any proportion but to that of another Slave,
but he may be aſſured that the proportion between
the Labour of the common Labourer, that is a Freeman,
and the Artificer, is much the ſame in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi>
as it is in other Countries.</p>
            <p>To tell us of driving away the People from <hi>Ireland</hi>
is but a Bugbear, the very profits of the Lands in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is Encouragement enough, not only to keep the People
that are there, but to draw more to them; and where's
a Tradeſman to be found in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who after he hath
rais'd any Stock to ſpare, doth not fall to buying or
renting Lands, in which they find their Improvements
as eaſie as in other ways?</p>
            <p>We need not be ſcar'd from making ſuch Laws as we
think requiſite for reſtraining <hi>Ireland</hi> in matters of Trade,
for fear of their Remiſsneſs to execute them, or their
ſmuggling with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as he ſuggeſts; but
he might have let that alone, if we can't enforce the
Execution of our own Laws, or make what further
Laws they may give us occaſion, for the keeping <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in a due Decorum, 'tis our own Faults. And for
their agreeing to ſpend none but their own Manufactures
at home; we know they are a very Genteel People,
and perhaps can't hold long in ſo moody a Temper, but
if they ſhould, that were a Trifle in compariſon, to their
ſpoiling our whole Trade with the reſt of the World;
neither could they do even that, if we ſhould in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
manner tell them and the whole World, that they
ſhall not Manufacture any of their own Product. ('tis
his own Words) And his ſuggeſting that we may be
as ready to daſh the Linnen-Manufacture, or any other
Improvements which they may bring to perfection, is
a Reflection which <hi>England</hi> doth not deſerve from them,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103578:12"/>
for though ſhe muſt always retain her Authority, to deal
with her Colonies in all ſuch matters as her own Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ſhall direct; yet ſhe hath always had an eaſie
Rein upon them, and given ſuch Liberties which ought
not to be ſleighted to the degree this Gentleman does;
and may be a ſufficient aſſurance to them, that ſo kind
a Mother will never put any unneceſſary difficulties
upon them, but will always promote them in every thing
that is not unreaſonably injurious to her ſelf; eſpecially
ſince 'tis her Intereſt as well as Delight, to ſee them
flouriſh under her Care and Protection. His gentle
way of deſtroying their Manufactures by ſecret Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
and to let it decline by degrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> looks
more like a Wheedle than a practical Project.</p>
            <p>After all I muſt acknowledge, that the Author hath
ſhewn abundance of Ingenuity in the penning thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and whoſoever ſhall obſerve how he hath manag'd
ſo bad a Subject to the higheſt advantage, it was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, will believe that in this I don't flatter him; and
if he ſhould think fit to employ his Ability in framing
ſome practicable Scheme, for the incorporating, <hi>Ireland,</hi>
(and if he could take in <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo) with <hi>England,</hi>
ſo as that the whole Empire might as far as poſſible,
be conjoin'd in one entire Intereſt, and be ſteer'd by
one United <hi>Grand-Council;</hi> I believe his performance
therein would be much more agreeable. And when he
ſhall have conſidered that matter throughly, I doubt not but
that he may come to be of the ſame Opinion with me, that
even under ſuch an Union, the well-being of the whole
could not be conſerv'd, without the laying ſome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Reſtrictions upon the Parts, according to his own
Inſtance of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> where he acknowledges that
'tis the Intereſt of the whole Kingdom beſides, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
their Wool from going to <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:103578:13"/>
            <p>To Conclude, as this Gentleman hath given us his
Definition and Diſtinction of Colonies, I'll take the
Freedom to offer my Opinion, under what predicaments
all Colonies whatſoever, without any diſtinction, are
to be conſidered; which if it may be admitted, will
perpetually determine this Controverſie in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all reaſonable Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the planting of all Colonies is by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and in ſubſervience to the Conveniencies of
the Mother Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That all the free Planters go by their own
Conſent, and muſt be ſubject to the Conditions of
their Settlement, as long as they remain in the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but that themſelves or their Poſterity may return
at their pleaſure, and enjoy all the Priviledges of their
Native Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That for their Encogragement, Lands and
Priviledges are granted them upon very eaſie terms,
whereby they may be enabled to ſubſiſt more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
than their Circumſtances could admit them in
their own Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That their proper Buſineſs is to cultivate the
Lands, and raiſe the Product which that Country will
yield.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That no permiſſion is granted them for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Trade, but ſuch as their Mother Country ſhall
from time to time ſee fit, becauſe as the Care and
Charge of protecting them in the Enjoyment of their
Poſſeſſions, is always incumbent upon her, 'tis not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
that ſhe ſhould diveſt her ſelf from the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of reaping ſuch advantages by them therein, as
their Condition can afford.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:103578:13"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That they may never look upon themſelves to
be out of the Power of the Legiſlature of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Country, but that they ought to pay an entire
Obedience to all ſuch Laws as ſhe ſhall make reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them.</p>
            <p>'Tis for want of theſe Conſiderations, that Men take
the Liberty to argue ſo paſſionately (not to ſay inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently)
upon the Caſe now depending; but if it will
not be granted, that it muſt always be of the Eſſence
of a Colony, to be under ſuch Regulations, I ſee no
room to diſtinguiſh between the Mother Country and
its Colony, which were abſurd to think. And ſince I
ſee they are ſo apt to be forgetful of their Duty upon
all ſuch Occaſions, I could wiſh our Government would
think fit, <hi>In perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi> to ordain, that an
Inſcription of the purport following, ſhould be always
ſet up in the Parliament Houſe in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in the
Houſes of Aſſembly in all our other Colonies, to be
read the firſt thing every Day of their Seſſions:</p>
            <q>Let us always remember, that this Island
(or Province) is a Colony; that <hi>England</hi> is
our Mother Countrey; that we are ever to
expect Protection from her in the Poſſeſſion
of our Lands; which we are to cultivate
and improve for our own Subſiſtence and
Advantage, but not to Trade to or with any
other Nation without her Permiſſion; and
that 'tis our incumbent Duty to pay Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to all ſuch Laws as ſhe ſhall Enact
concerning Us.</q>
