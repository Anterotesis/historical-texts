            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

They onely respect the externall face of the Church, as it

which is indeede very new. Hence commeth it, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a wonder to consider, how the late
Bishops of Rome haue aspyred to their
super-lordly Primacie, and chiefest so
supposed Soueraigntie in the Christian
world. Popery with our Iesuits, &amp; Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suited-Papists,
must needes be the Old Religion, and
that selfe same Doctrine, which S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paule</hi>
deliuered to the Church of Rome. This is their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Bulwarke, which (as they boast) all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the faithfull and good Christians can neuer
batter downe. And this they neuer cease to inculcate
into the eares, and to instill it into the harts, of the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vulgar people; telling them forsooth, that Popery
is the Old Religion, and the fayth of their forefathers
in all ages. I therefore to take this stumbling blocke
out of the way, doe purpose in God (the fountaine of
all goodnes, and the chiefe workman of euery good
act) to set before the Readers eyes, in a very summary
&amp; succinct narration, that Popery is a new Religion,
by little and little crept into the Church, and patched
together as clout vpon clout in a Beggers cloake.</p>
            <p>Now, for this name (<hi>Pope,</hi>) which the silly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
admire (God-wote) as a most sacred thing; and
for all that know no more what it meaneth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> how

who euer ascribed the Headship, and Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall

Easter, which for all that he would &amp; must haue
<pb facs="tcp:1680:7"/>

and learned Bishops of <hi>Fra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nce</hi> ioyning with him,
reprooued <hi>Victor,</hi> then Bishop of Rome, very sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and roundly, as one that had not due respect to the
peace and vnitie of the Church: Which doubtlesse
those holy &amp; learned Bishops would not haue done,
if the Bishop of Rome had had in those dayes the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
Soueraigntie ouer them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, S. <hi>Polycrates,</hi> and many Bishops of <hi>Asia,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
did stoutly withstand the same <hi>Victor,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the Bishop
of Rome, in his presumpteous proceedings touching
Easter. Fourthly, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> roundly opposed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
against <hi>Stephanus</hi> then Bishop of Rome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning

the Apostles at Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Acts. 4. 17.</note> sent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

the Pope be not aboue <hi>Peter,</hi> but his supposed Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
he may be sent of the Bishops his Brethren, as
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was. But who is that Bishop, and where
dwelleth he, that at this day dareth doe to the novve
Pope, such supposed villany?</p>
            <p>Sixtly, the Fathers of the famous <hi>Affrican Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
(in which Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> that holy Father, and

to the great honour and credite thereof,) would
in no wise yeeld to <hi>Celestine</hi> then Bishop of Rome, in
the controuersie of Appeales concerning <hi>Appiarius.</hi>
And when Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> alledged for himselfe, and
his supposed Soueraigntie, that the auncient and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> gaue libertie to appeale to
Rome, the Fathers of the Councell answered round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the true copies of the Decree were otherwise.
<pb facs="tcp:1680:8"/>
Where I wish the Reader to obserue with me, these
two poynts seriously; First,<note place="margin">A woorthy note, not to be forgotten.</note> that the Pope could not,
(and therefore did not) alledge any better reason for
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his vsurped and falsely pretended Primacie, then the
authoritie and Decree of that famous Councell of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Nice.</hi> Secondly, that the Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> falsified the
canon and Decree of the Councell, so to gaine credit
and authority to himselfe, if it might be.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seauenthly, the famous Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
gaue the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> equall authoritie
with the Bishop of Rome, in all Ecclesiastical affaires.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eightly, the councell of <hi>Nice</hi> prescribed limits, as well
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to the Bishop of Rome, as to other Patriarkes. First
therefore, seeing the holy councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
the authoritie of the Bishop of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
to be equall with the Bishoppe of <hi>Rome;</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> seeing <hi>Celestine</hi> the Bishop of Rome, could
alledge neither Scripture, councell, Father, or reason
for his pretended Primacie, but one onely false alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
out of the councell of <hi>Nice;</hi> Thirdly, seeing
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Fathers of the <hi>Affrican councell,</hi> contradicted and
reproued the Pope, for his forgery of the <hi>Nicene coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> concerning <hi>Appiarius;</hi> Fourthly, seeing S. <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus,</hi>
S. <hi>Policrates,</hi> S. <hi>Iraeneus,</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> with

the Bishoppe of Rome, his Decrees, &amp; his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Supremacie; I cannot but conclude, with this
inevitable illation: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the late pretended Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie
of the Pope, is but a rotten ragge of the new
Religion; as which was neuer heard of in Christ his

            <p>Marriage (as the Apostle teacheth vs,<note place="margin">1, Cor, 7.</note>) was orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for a remedy against fornication, to be vsed of all

consequently, seeing that disease is as well incident to
persons Ecclesiasticall, as to persons secular, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
more, the Medicine is as necessary and as
lawfull for the one sort, as it is for the other. For this

to Gods word, that to forbid mariage to priests,

marriage is so honourable in all sorts of men.

the reason; Because experience (saith hee) tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs, that the Priests debarred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> marriage, liue
not spiritually, but are polluted in vnlawfull copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though they might liue chastly with their owne
wiues.</p>
            <p>For this respect was it, that the great Papist <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi>
could not containe himselfe, but pittifully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
<pb facs="tcp:1680:9"/>
against the wicked prohibition of Priests ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
affirming stoutly and resolutely, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
chastitie of vnmarried Priestes, was so far from
excelling chastitie in wedlocke, as no crime whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
hath brought greater shame to Priesthood, more
harme to Religion, or more griefe to all good men,
then the vnchast life of Priests. For this respect was
it, that Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the second of that name, (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Popedome was named <hi>Aeneus Syluius,</hi> a very
learned man, &amp; famous Writer, after he had repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
many vices in the Romish Church, concluded
very grauely; that though there had beene great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to debarre Priestes from marriage, yet was there
greater reason to restore marriage againe vnto them.
For this respect was it, that many holy and learned
Bishops were married men, in the auncient time, and
florishing state of the Church; viz. S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> Saint
<hi>Clement,</hi> S. <hi>Spiridian,</hi> S. <hi>Chereman,</hi> S. <hi>Philogonius,</hi> S.
<hi>Eupsichus,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>First therefore, seeing Priestes marriage is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
both by the Old and New Testament. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
seeing all Priests were alwayes married, (or at the

seeing Priestes marriage was holden for lawfull in
the famous Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> and that the holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe

            <p>THE famous Popish Writer <hi>Syluester,</hi> for

Popish Pardons are but a toy for Chyldren to play

(saith he) were neuer knowne to vs by the Scriptures,
although some alledge S. <hi>Paule</hi> for that purpose, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were they knowne by the auncient Fathers, but

Saint,<note place="margin">Page 1. tit. 10 Capit. 3.</note> and famous Archbishoppe, had the selfe

Maister of Sentences, (who collected with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
into one Volume, all the woorthy Sentences
of the auncient Fathers,) could neuer find the Popes
Pardons, or any mention thereof, in any of all theyr
writings. For as <hi>Syluester</hi> truly said; The olde Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were not acquainted with any such thing. Yea,
their famous Martyr and Bishop, Maister <hi>Fisher,</hi> in
his aunswere to Maister <hi>Luthers</hi> Articles, was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to admit the newnes of the Popes pardons:<note place="margin">Contra. Artic. Lutheri.</note> and
withall forsooth to yeeld this reason for the same, viz.
That Purgatory was not then so well knowne to the
Church, as it is now adayes. Peruse and note wel the
next Chapter, which is of Purgatorie so supposed
paynes.</p>
            <p>First therefore, seeing the great popish <hi>Syluester</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
confesseth plainly and boldly to the popes Holines,

            <p>COncerning the originall of Popish-purgatorie,
it shalbe enough to set down the words of <hi>Iohn
Fisher,</hi> the late Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> &amp; the popes

               <note place="margin">Cont. assert. Luth. art. 18</note>
Reade who will the Commentaries of the
auncient Graecians, and he shall finde either very sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
mention of Purgatory, or none at all. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did the Latine Church conceiue the veritie of
this matter at one time, but by leysure. Neither vvas
it without the great dispensation of the holy Ghost,
that after so many yeeres, Catholicks both beleeued
purgatory, &amp; receiued the vse of pardons generallie.
So long as there was no care of Purgatory, no man
sought for pardons. For of it dependeth all the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of pardons. If thou take away purgatory, to
what end shall wee neede pardons? for if there be no
<pb facs="tcp:1680:11"/>
Purgatory, we shall neede no pardons. Considering
therefore, how long Purgatory was vnknowne, then
that it was beleeued of some by little and little, partly
by reuelations, and partly by the Scriptures; and so
at the last beleeued generally of the whole Church,
we doe easily vnderstand the cause of pardons. Since
therefore purgatory was so lately known &amp; receiued
of the whole Church, who can admire pardons, that
there was no vse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> in the primatiue Church. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
therefore began, after the people stoode in some
feare of purgatory. Thus writeth the popish Bishop
<hi>Fisher.</hi> Whose words I hartily wish, that the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Reader may ponder seriously with me. For if he
so doe, hee cannot chuse but abhor late popery, and
know it to be the new Religion.</p>
            <p>This Bishop was a learned man, a great papist, &amp;
said for popery what possibly he could, yet he gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>teth
many things, (of such force is the truth,) which quite
ouerthrow popery, and turne it vpside downe. First <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
we see that the Greeke church neuer beleeued purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to his dayes,<note place="margin">An: Dom: 1517.</note> and so it was vnknown to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> 1517
yeres. Secondly, that the church of Rome belieued it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
not, for the space of 250. yeres, after which time it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by little and little. Thirdly, that the church of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Rome, did not beleeue purgatory all at once, but by
little and little. Fourthly, that the inuention of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
was the birth of Popish-pardons, as which could
haue no place, till purgatory was found out by fained
reuelations, and the people brought into some feare
thereof. Fiftly, that the primatiue Church was neuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
acquainted with the Popes pardons, nor yet with his
counterfeit and forged purgatory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1680:12"/>
Of which, (as the popish Bishop telleth vs,) the silly

               <hi>William Watson,</hi> in the name of all the rest.</p>
            <p>By this Doctrine thus plainly deliuered, (which is
a constant position in the Romish Church,) the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
giue vs to vnderstand, that execrable, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
enough detested fallacie, where-with the Pope &amp;
his popelings, haue a long time sedueed, the greater
part of the Christian World. viz. That the Pope
may Erre as a priuate man, but not as a publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
This is a great wonderment, obserue vvell the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sequell. First therefore, if wee meane to wring any
truth out of the Popes nose, wee must haue recourse
to his Holinesse, at such time as he is sober, not when
he is furious, least he become starke mad, and forget
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the knowledge of the Truth. Secondly, wee must
haue the Popes aduise, when he is a publique person,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not when, or as he is a priuate man. Thirdly, we must
goe vnto him, not as he is indeed, this or that pope,
but as he is Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that blessed Apostle of our
Lord Iesus.</p>
            <p>Thus much is necessarily gathered out of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
doctrine. Which beeing well marked, Poperie
will be the Newe Religion, and turne it selfe vpside
downe. For first it is a constant Maxine in all popish
doctrine, that the Pope, and none but the Pope, must
iudge in all Controuersi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>s of fayth &amp; doctrine. This
notwithstanding, we see by this popish doctrine, (so
contrary is popery to it selfe,) that if the Pope judge
of any matter, as he is furious, and not sober; as he is
a priuate man, and not a publique person; as hee is
<pb facs="tcp:1680:14"/>
               <hi>Clemens, Sixtus, Adrianus,</hi> or some other like Pope,
and not S. <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe; then he may Erre and so
both he deceiued, and deceiue others.</p>
            <p>O my s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>rable Papists, how are ye led headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
pernicious Fayth and Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and eyther doe
not, or will not see the same? Your Pope (say you,)
may Erre as a priuate m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>n, but not as pope or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
person. This distinction may fitly be termed a
tricke of fast and loose. For if the Pope define a truth,
they may say, he defined it as a publique person: but
if he define an error, then say they, he defined it as a
priuate man. Behold heere (gentle Reader,) vppon
what rotten stuffe,<note place="margin">In the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Foxe.</note> the Papists would haue vs to
ground our Fayth: when we proue (as I haue done
elswhere,) that pope <hi>Anastasius,</hi> pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> pope
<hi>Iohn,</hi> pope <hi>Celestine,</hi> and others, haue both holden
and taught false Doctrine; they tell vs, they did that
as priuate men, not as popes of Rome.</p>
            <p>That their pope cannot erre in fayth iudiciallie, it
is this day with papists an Article of their fayth. The
famous papist <hi>Dominicus Scoto,</hi> shalbe the spokesman
for the rest.<note place="margin">Scoto in 4. sent. D. 22. Qu. 2. Art. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Albeit</hi> (saith hee) <hi>the Pope as Pope cannot
Erre, that is to say, cannot set downe any Errour as an
Article of our Fayth, because the holy Ghost will not that
permit: neuerthelesse, as hee is a priuate person, so may
he Erre euen in fayth, as he may doe other sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how old is this Romish Doctrine? Of vvhat

            <p>TRue it is, I freely grant, that the holy Fathers

that it is the constant and vniforme fayth of all the
holy Doctors; that the best, and holiest mans works
vpon earth, neither are, nor possibly can be merrito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
or worthy of eternall life, if Gods holy &amp; free

words are these; (<hi>prorsus digna,</hi> wholy vnworthy.)
Where I with the Reader to obserue seriously with
me, this word (<hi>prorsus,</hi> which signifieth wholy;) for if
out best workes be wholy vnworthy of the reward or
glory, (as <hi>Iosep: Angles</hi> in the name of all the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
&amp; Doctors, telleth the Pope both grauely and
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>stantly,) then doubtles the best works of all, can no
way be meritorious. The case is cleere; for, to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious,
(as euery childe knoweth,) is to be worthy:
<pb facs="tcp:1680:16"/>
And consequently, seeing to be worthy, and to be
meritorious, is all one, our workes which are no way
worthy, but euery way (<hi>prorsus,</hi> vnworthy) can no
way be meritorious. When any Papist in the world
can truly disprooue this Illation, let me be his bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaue
for his reward. Againe, for the simple Readers
helpe and capacitie, this is the state of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie.

            </p>
            <p>Now, to take away all wrangling, true it is (I will

so after aboundant eating of flesh all the Winter sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
suddainly to abstaine wholy from the same, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be euill.</p>
            <p>This is confirmed vnto vs sundry wayes: first,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> because there is like proportion in cating fish sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after flesh, as there is in eating flesh suddainly after
fish. Which alteration how dangerous it is, the vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
infirmities in Easter-weeke doe witnes. Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> because the nourishment of fish is cold and moist, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> so very disproportionable to the Spring time. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because concoction is very strong, as well for the
ambrient restraint, termed <hi>Antiperistasis,</hi> as by reason
of long sleepe. And therefore since much meate is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
at that time, our popish Lent-fast prescribing
little meate, must needes be preiudiciall.</p>
            <p>Although there were in the auncient Church, a
free kinde of yeerely fast, whereof the Papists pretend
an Apish imitation; yet is their vsuall Popish Lent-fast,
not onely superstitious, but altogether different
from the same. Superstitious, because they intend
thereby to satisfie for their sinnes, and to merrite hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Different many wayes; First, because the annci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church, neuer intended any meirite by het fast.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because the saide fast, commonly called
<pb facs="tcp:1680:26"/>
Lent, was not vniformely practised in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and Sondai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

euery weeke.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, because the fast of the aunclent Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
was free, voluntary, and not commaunded by anie
Law. Fourthly, because as in the auncient Church,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
the time was variable, so was also the manner of their
diet. For, some ate nothing that liueth; some, of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

fish and also byrds; some ate onely herbs and egges;<note place="margin">Trip. hist. lib. 9. cap. 38. Soz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
