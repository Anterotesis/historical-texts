         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF this <hi>ſtriving</hi> work be unpleaſant to you, it muſt be much more ſo to me: It is not the leaſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that Satan getteth againſt the Church, that by other mens ſins he can occaſion that to become our duty, which elſe would be a ſinfull loſs of time, and againſt the peace of our ſelves and others. A multitude of hereſies make it our duty, to read abundance of Books, and ſtudy thoſe languages, and trifling Arts, which elſe were needleſs: And the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Erroneous, malignant, and other adverſaries, and the variety of their aſſaults, maketh many <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, Evidences, Witneſſes,</hi> and <hi>Confutations</hi> neceſſary, which elſe would ſignifie that evil Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which the aſſaulters manifeſt. Though the ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, yet muſt we contend
<pb facs="tcp:64641:3"/>
earneſtly for the Faith, and muſt not forſake and betray truth and innocency. And the neceſſitated De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender may do his duty, while the wilfull Aggreſſor doth ſinfully mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate againſt <hi>Truth, Charity,</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> And as we muſt love our Enemies, ſo we take our ſelves bound much more, to love our temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted envyous brethren; and if they uſe us as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> caſt us into the Pit and ſell us as ſlaves, we will call them brethren ſtill, and hope one day their repentance will render them more lovely than they are. And though ſome Preach Christ in <hi>Envy, Strife,</hi> and <hi>Contention,</hi> to add to our affliction, and not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, we rejoyce and will rejoyce that Chriſt is Preached: And though they would <hi>drive us out from the inheritance of the Lord, 1</hi> Sam. <hi>26. 19.</hi> We will not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with David to curſe them,
<pb facs="tcp:64641:3"/>
but ſay as he in another purſuit, <hi>2</hi> Sam. <hi>15. 25. 26. Carry back the Ark of God into the City: If I ſhall find favour in the Eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and ſhew me both it and his Habitation. But if he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee, behold, here am I, let him do to me as ſeemeth good to him.</hi> In my endeavours for peace theſe Thirty Four Years, as I have been put to publiſh many things which I had rather might have been ſpared, ſo I have written to ſatisfie others, the Quantity of many Volumes, which I caſt away as unneceſſary to the World. But ſome men that I have dealt with, will not give me and the Reader ſuch an indulgence.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> is one who ſhall have his anſwer by it ſelf. Mr. <hi>Hink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> is another, to whoſe laſt Letter I wrote an anſwer about Nine Years
<pb facs="tcp:64641:4"/>
ago: But he would not ſo bury his Talent, but hath printed my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Letters with his anſwer, and ſo called and conſtrained me to publiſh my laſt reply. Fame reporteth that the <hi>Impleader</hi> is Mr. <hi>Long</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who heretofore wrote an Accuſing Book, of which I gave him a private Epiſtolary Animadverſion. Who the <hi>Reflector</hi> or the Author of the <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> is I know not, the Subject calleth me to no particular Anſwer. He and Mr. <hi>Roger le ſtrange,</hi> who argue in the ſame Mood and Figure, make me little work: which concerneth others, They miſtook the queſtion, as if it had been, <hi>what the World ſhould think of me.</hi> In which I leave them to their Liberty without much contradiction.</p>
            <p>But our queſtion is Firſt, whether the Concord of Proteſtants being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed neceſſary, the <hi>ſilencing, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, fining,</hi> and <hi>baniſhing</hi> from <hi>Corporations,</hi> all Miniſters that take
<pb facs="tcp:64641:4"/>
Conformity to the preſent Impoſitions to be a ſin, be the way of Peace and Concord, either probable or poſſible to attain the end. Mr. <hi>John Cheny,</hi> I judge a godly ſerious man: who being neer me and familiar with me, never told me a word of his exceptions, nor gave me the leaſt touch of a private Admonition for all the <hi>Atheiſm, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, Wickedneſs, Abomination, deſtroying all Religion &amp;c.</hi> Which he accuſeth me of in print: And his <hi>Book</hi> is ſo diſmal a piece of work, in its extraordinary privation of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reaſon, Truth, Charity, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs</hi> and <hi>Modeſty,</hi> that I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to think that the honeſt man is diſeaſedly melancholly: And I have known ſome well meaning men in that diſeaſe, that are ſo tenacious of all their own Conceptions, that they are ſtill fiercely confident that the groſſeſt things that they hold and ſay are right, and paſſionately reject all that is ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:64641:5"/>
againſt them. Whom he hath reported to be his Inſtigator, I ſhall not here proclaim. The <hi>Dialogue</hi> between the <hi>Pope</hi> and a <hi>Phanatick,</hi> and <hi>Joh. Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>'s <hi>Propheſie,</hi> I leave the Reader to anſwer himſelf, as he findeth cauſe. If any man think it a ſervice to God to accuſe me and others, and justifie our ſilencing and the impoſed penalties, I intreat him to remember the Ninth Commandement, and that God and his Church need not Lies for their Service, but its he that is both the Father of them, and a Lyar from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. That was a lying Spirit in the Mouth of all <hi>Ahabs Prophets,</hi> (even of him that ſmote <hi>Mica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I Have peruſed yours, (I think <hi>Impartially)</hi> and to tell you my Judgment of it, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is like to offend you more. I find it is natural to men to deſire to be thought to be in <hi>the right,</hi> and to have <hi>ſaid well,</hi> and <hi>done well,</hi> be it <hi>never ſo ill.</hi> It is ſome Honour to <hi>Truth and Goodneſs,</hi> that the <hi>Names and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of them ſeem deſirable to thoſe that cannot endure the <hi>things;</hi> yea, that the <hi>Things</hi> are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loathed or oppoſed <hi>formally</hi> as ſuch, but for their oppoſition to <hi>ſomewhat,</hi> that is more loved. And it is ſome help to the <hi>depreſſion</hi> of <hi>Falſhood</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> that it is aſhamed of its <hi>own Name,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to ſee its own <hi>Face,</hi> which hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inclined it to break the <hi>Glaſs;</hi> though to its greater <hi>ſhame,</hi> when every <hi>piece</hi> will ſhew that <hi>uglineſs</hi> which was ſhewed but by the <hi>whole</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If nothing elſe had notified it to us, one might have <hi>ſtrongly ſuſpected</hi> that you are of that

               <hi>Tribe,</hi> who take themſelves to be <hi>perſecuted</hi> when they may not <hi>domineer,</hi> and when others may but <hi>Preach and live</hi> without their Conſent; by your <hi>exceſſive tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>impatience,</hi> calling it <hi>Poyſon, Hornets,</hi> and abundance of ſuch <hi>ſmarting angry Names,</hi> if a man that is caſt out of <hi>God's Vineyard</hi> as well as his <hi>Maintenance</hi> among many hundreds more, do but plainly in a <hi>private Letter</hi> ſpeak for himſelf, and ſhew the <hi>injuſtice</hi> of your <hi>Printed Accuſations.</hi> O! that you were all but the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth part as tender, (I will not ſay of your <hi>Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens ſufferings)</hi> but of the <hi>danger</hi> of many thouſand <hi>periſhing ſtarved Souls?</hi> I ſhall only tell you this much in general, that I now perceive you are uſed but for a <hi>Temptation to me,</hi> to loſe <hi>my time,</hi> by the neglect of <hi>better Work.</hi> And that you do ſo <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly bawk the Truth,</hi> and hide <hi>Untruth</hi> in a heap of <hi>Confident Rhetorical Flouriſhes;</hi> that while you are of this <hi>temperament,</hi> I will not undertake to prove to you that <hi>Two</hi> and <hi>Two</hi> are <hi>Four.</hi>

2.

Could you poſſibly forget, 1. That <hi>You</hi> were the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> and <hi>Accuſer</hi> in <hi>Print,</hi> not content that your <hi>Brethren</hi> were forbidden to <hi>Preach Chriſt,</hi> and that many of them live in great <hi>poverty</hi> and <hi>want?</hi> You wrote a Book of <hi>reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Oratory,</hi> with no ſtrength of <hi>Argument</hi> worthy an <hi>Anſwer,</hi> to make them ſeem the <hi>flagitious Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> of their own <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>ſufferings:</hi> Againſt which, they (that meddled not with you) had nothing to do but to <hi>juſtifie themſelves.</hi> 2.

That hereupon the <hi>Queſtion</hi> that I treated about with you, was, <hi>How I may have leave to do it.</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ingenious thus publickly to urge me to that which you know I cannot do. This was all the <hi>Controverſie</hi> I had with you. I tell you again, I would go on my knees to any Biſhop in <hi>England,</hi> to procure but Licenſe for my ſelf alone, (much more my <hi>Brethren)</hi> to <hi>Write</hi> and <hi>Print</hi> the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of our <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> after Nine years <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Suffering,</hi> and <hi>Accuſation;</hi> that the <hi>World</hi> and <hi>Poſterity</hi> may but once hear us ſpeak for our ſelves: And I would be engaged to leave out all ſuch <hi>plain expreſſions</hi> as now offend you.

            </p>
            <p>§. 1. Here firſt, you would have your Book go for <hi>Innocent;</hi> no wonder: <hi>Impenitence</hi> is no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, among <hi>thoſe</hi> whoſe office is to Preach <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi> And therefore ſo many of them go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Fruits</hi> of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22, 23.

You untruly ſuppoſe me not to have opened the faultineſs of any <hi>Page</hi> of your <hi>Book:</hi> Let the <hi>Impartial</hi> judge. 4. In all, you ſhew the ſtrange unacquaintedneſs with your <hi>Self,</hi> and your <hi>Own,</hi> which you cannot endure to be told of. A <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating Volume</hi> of yours is <hi>Innocent,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth no matter for blame or repentance: But to be told ſo, is to let fall <hi>ſuch Drops on you as make you ſmart</hi> (you ſay) <hi>as if there had been poyſon in them.</hi> If we that are forbidden to eat a <hi>Bit,</hi> or wear a Rag of the <hi>Levites Portion,</hi> or come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Five Miles of any <hi>Corporation,</hi> or Preach Chriſt to the moſt <hi>ignorant miſerable Souls;</hi> do but think

            <p>§. 3. Here you want Conviction ſtill! If ſo, I will not undertake to Convince you of any thing in the World which you are unwilling to know. Offer the caſe to an unintereſted Stranger, and take his Judgment. Tell him this <hi>Truth</hi> [Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred <hi>Miniſters</hi> are at once forbidden to <hi>Preach Chriſt</hi> according to their <hi>Ordination Vow:</hi> And when upon <hi>that Dedication</hi> they had aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated themſelves from all other ways of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Livelihood, they and their Families are caſt upon <hi>Alms</hi> in a time of <hi>extraordinary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,</hi> except ſome of them that had ſomewhat of their own: None of all theſe are put out for <hi>Ignorance, Inſufficiency,</hi> or any <hi>Crime</hi> or <hi>ſcandal</hi> at all; But for not <hi>ſubſcribing Aſſent</hi> and <hi>Conſens</hi> to all <hi>things</hi> (without exception) in Three Books written by men that profeſs that <hi>General Councils</hi>

But now <hi>ſeverity</hi> having encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their <hi>penalty,</hi> he knoweth not of one man that will venture ſo far: That if they would, it will do him no good, who hath ſo much to ſay againſt <hi>Conformity,</hi> as a few ſheets will not contain; and he knoweth not of that man living that would <hi>Print:</hi> And, that ſhould he do it, he muſt look for ſuch an <hi>Impriſonment</hi> as is likely to be his <hi>death:</hi> And therefore he thinketh that his <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> may be more uſefully employed; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when Experience aſſureth him, that ſuch a Writing would paſſionately diſpleaſe the <hi>Prelates</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſuch as call for it. And therefore that he did not ingenuouſly that clamoured thus for an account, when he knew that all theſe <hi>Manacles</hi> were on <hi>our Hands:</hi> Yet will not this man be convinced but his Clamour was reaſonable and innocent, becauſe in a few Sheets that accidentally had an advantage to <hi>ſee the light,</hi> (being both for the <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>Churches Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment)</hi> he met with a few words which he thought were not to be licenſed. And if this were publiſhed without Licenſe, it was moſt long of himſelf, ſince his foreſaid <hi>urgency,</hi> no ſuch thing being done before, nor do I know how to procure the like again.</p>

Do you not <hi>reproach</hi> all the <hi>ancient Councils</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> of thoſe times, as making ſuch a ſtir in the World about a <hi>brutum fulmen.</hi> 4. Do you not reproach <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and other Chriſtian Emperors, who for a conſiderable time adjoyned not the <hi>Sword</hi> at all to the <hi>Churches Keys,</hi> except to remove ſome great <hi>Patriarch</hi> that had influence on the <hi>State;</hi> and long after did only force them to a <hi>quiet ſubmiſſion</hi> to the <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> without the addition of another <hi>Penalty,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining any to ſay, <hi>they did repent.</hi> How long was it before the <hi>Church</hi> took a man to be <hi>meet for her Communion in the Lords Supper,</hi> that had but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay, <hi>that he repented,</hi> than have all taken from him, and lie in Priſon. 5.

tell us what you <hi>truſt</hi> to, even the <hi>Magiſtrates Sword</hi> alone: And do you not diſgrace your <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Function,</hi> in telling the World in plain Engliſh, that <hi>without the Sword, Prelatical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi> is but <hi>brutum fulmen?</hi> What then would your <hi>Church</hi> be, ſhould the <hi>King</hi> leave it only to an equal <hi>Toleration</hi> with all other <hi>Parties.</hi> 6.

            <p>§. 7. <hi>P.</hi> 9. Here you have many things to ſay, to prove that men that came into <hi>Sequeſtrations,</hi> either <hi>ſought not,</hi> or <hi>procured the good of Souls:</hi> But O! firſt remember, that if <hi>that</hi> were <hi>true,</hi> yet all thoſe (or neer all) were turned out of their <hi>Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> before the <hi>ſilencing Bartholomew Day,</hi> 1662.

2.

If our <hi>Preaching</hi> did no <hi>good to Souls,</hi> why ſhould you think that yours does any? If you preach the ſame <hi>Goſpel,</hi> why ſhould you think ſo well of your <hi>own works</hi> above <hi>other mens?</hi> And if yours alſo do <hi>no good,</hi> why do men pay their <hi>Tythes,</hi> and trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to hear ſuch as do but trouble the World. 4. Do you not Conſpire with the <hi>Quakers</hi> that falſly cried out that our Miniſtry did not profit men; and with the <hi>Levellers,</hi> that would have taken down the Miniſtry as unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. 5. But O! what an attempt you make to prove how little <hi>Hiſtory</hi> is credible, to teach men to ſay, How know we that <hi>Hegiſyppus,</hi> that <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> that <hi>Socrates,</hi> that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſay true, when ſuch men as ſhould be the <hi>Preachers of Truth,</hi> can ſay what they do of <hi>common</hi> or <hi>notorious matters of Fact;</hi> yea and confidently ſtand to it, to the face of that Age which knoweth that they ſpeak falſly. 1. Who are more <hi>competent Judges,</hi> whether men <hi>received any good by Chriſts Goſpel which we preached</hi> you or they. Do you know the Hearts and Lives of many hundred thouſands better than they do themſelves: I know many are deceived with <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flattery,</hi> but are you that are a <hi>ſtranger</hi> to their <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> the fitteſt <hi>Judges.</hi> Do you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know what <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> what <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> the <hi>Goſpel</hi> hath produced.

beſt. Ask the People of <hi>Kederminſter,</hi> whether in that time they received any good by the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> Know you not, that when ſome ſuch did but preach to them at the rates you now talk, it ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated their minds from <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Conformity,</hi> who before were not ſo averſe thereto, as that they have put it paſt my power to reconcile them ſo far to them as I am reconciled my ſelf; and were not my intereſt very great in them, and their Preacher very honeſt, I ſhould not get them to come to <hi>Church:</hi> Such good the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Faction</hi> doth in the World, while it pretendeth to heal the hurt that others do. 2. Let the effects that are viſible be <hi>judge;</hi> if places that abounded with <hi>Rioting, Drunkenneſs, Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs,</hi> do now ſearch the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate with <hi>delight in the Law of God,</hi> and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhip him, and their <hi>Families call upon his Name,</hi> if they live <hi>ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, forſaking the former luſts of their ignorance, and ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, and live in charity and peace;</hi> will it prove that theſe People are never the better, becauſe <hi>Faction</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a <hi>ſtranger</hi> to tell them ſo.

But that the <hi>great Towns</hi> (which commonly had leaſt <hi>Maintenance)</hi> ſhould be firſt provided for: That <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> ſhould not deny, who hold that none but <hi>Cities</hi> of old had <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> nor ſhould have <hi>Biſhops</hi> to this day.

In my great place (of <hi>Sequeſtration)</hi> mine was leſs, when I was elſewhere oft offered above <hi>Three hundred pounds;</hi> we preached twice or thrice a week, and rarely meddled with any

               <hi>Controverſies,</hi> except againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts,</hi> when they came to trouble the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi> We ſpent half two clays a week in Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with each Family, to <hi>Catechize</hi> them, and help them to underſtand the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for another World.

In the laſt Leaf of my <hi>[Uiverſal Concord]</hi> the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the <hi>Church</hi> where I lived is recited. This was the <hi>Part we acted for our ſelves.</hi> 2. But you add <hi>[What good was done to Souls by theſe Intruders, late Poſterity will find, &amp;c. Anſwer,</hi> 1. I think that the <hi>preſent Age</hi> that hath the Experience may better know than <hi>Poſterity,</hi> unleſs they have <hi>truer Hiſtorians</hi> than you. 2. Many <hi>thouſand Souls</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>many thouſand</hi> more yet on <hi>Earth,</hi> that were brought to the true knowledge of God and themſelves, by the <hi>Labours</hi> of ſuch <hi>Miniſters,</hi> will be their <hi>Witneſs</hi> what <hi>good</hi> they did. But the <hi>Stranger</hi> meddleth not with their <hi>Joys.</hi> 3. If you impute to them either the <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> or <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Sectaries,</hi> whom they were the principal means of ſuppreſſing, and whom they did much more againſt than you: Or yet the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Rebellious Souldiers,</hi> that pulled down <hi>Powers,</hi> and ſet up <hi>themſelves;</hi> you will but ſhew your <hi>malignity</hi> and <hi>unrighteouſneſs:</hi> If you do not, your <hi>Accuſation</hi> ſignifieth nothing. If you mean that the People will not be brought to like <hi>ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> of <hi>Prelats</hi> better than ſuch <hi>Preachers;</hi> and this is the breach which the skilfulleſt of you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not heal, I am of your mind: And the Names of <hi>Intruſion</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi> will not ſerve to change their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64641:25"/>
Minds. As for <hi>Intruſion,</hi> I knew very few ſuch in thoſe days that ever came to a place before they were ſought to and intreated; And I know very few now that are not <hi>Seekers.</hi> 3. Your next, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Preaching down Authority and Plundering other mens Livings to ſave Souls,</hi> ſheweth more what <hi>you are,</hi> than what <hi>they did:</hi> When you know that I have provoked you to name one of ten or twenty that ever preached down <hi>Authority,</hi> or meddled with Arms; Moſt coming out of the <hi>Univerſities</hi> after the Wars, and many never med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling with them (though ſeveral <hi>Conformiſts</hi> did.) And ſure the Party is not to be judged or denominated by a tenth or twentieth part. I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med many men to you in the former Paper, and in this: Enquire how few of all thoſe ever med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with Arms. 2. And thoſe few that did, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all did it before they came into <hi>Sequestrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and many never did ſo after; and thought it had been <hi>Authority</hi> which they had ſtood for: And as he that erreth in Medicine upon the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>Colledge of Phyſicians,</hi> ſo he that erreth in <hi>Law</hi> upon the judgment of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> is more pardonable than ſome other men, and may again be capable of Preaching the Goſpel, or elſe ſuch ſhould not now be readmitted. 3. And, if <hi>eating the Bread of Preachers be it you call plundring other mens livings,</hi> their <hi>Error</hi> if it were one, had theſe excuſes, that they thought that the Tythes had been firſt devoted to God, and that he was the firſt proprietor, and that they were determinately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to him for this uſe, to maintain a lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter there to officiate: and they thought that when the then Ruling Parliament had caſt out ſome
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64641:25"/>
under the Notion of <hi>Inſufficient</hi> and <hi>Scandalous,</hi> it was lawfull nevertheleſs for others to keep up a Church, and teaching, and Worſhip of God, and therefore to Eat the Dedicated Bread. And as for the turning out of any for the Kings Cauſe, that were not utterly <hi>Inſufficient</hi> or <hi>Drunkards,</hi> or ſuch like, we Printed our judgment againſt it; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would not ſucceed ſuch men, which gave advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to ſome that were Sectarians to ſucceed them? And what got the People by that ſcruple? As for the fifth part, you know it was ordinarily paid, (and now nothing) and, Mr. <hi>Lea</hi>'s Book made no alteration. Your talk of medling with Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> is a meer impertinency. But if you ask Biſhops, and Chancellors, whether it be lawfull to meddle with ſpiritual things, <hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine ad temporalia,</hi> (yea and Prieſts too) it will be a ſeaſonable queſtion, (if ſet home.) I am glad to read that they did but threaten to ſilence you. By which I perceived you were not then ſo ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as to loſe all, to eſcape Conformity to thoſe times. And I alſo was threatned to be ſilenced as well as you: and virtually ſequeſtred by an Ordor againſt ſuch as would not keep their Faſts, and Thanksgivings, and that ſpake againſt their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (which I openly did) and that would not take the Engagement: and yet I was never ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them, (but only as to one Aſſize Sermon,) that work being fitter for Men, whoſe proper Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it is, and that <hi>jure divino.</hi> And my life was frequently threatned by the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> as well as yours. But I muſt <hi>[tell you truly, ſhould I reaſſume my Chair, would I continue in this Courteous Mood.] Anſ.</hi> You have proved already, that a Queſtion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64641:26"/>
may be falſe, may you not as eaſily prove that it may be Malignant, 1. What is my Chair? Had I any but the Pulpit, or Reading place, at <hi>Keder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> 2. Why do you queſtion my Courteſie, when I both <hi>Printed my deſires and reaſons, againſt hindring any worthy Men from Preaching the Goſpel,</hi> upon pretence of the Cauſe of the King or Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy heretofore, and when I have in Three or Four Books this very Year, maintained the ſame Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and Principles. Yea moſt of all my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Preaching for 25 Years have been much againſt Faction: and for the Union, Concord, and Concurrence of all Miniſters and Chriſtians, who are agreed but in Chriſtianity it ſelf, and the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials of Church Communion, in carrying on Gods Work with mutual forbearance. And when I never had a hand in putting any ſuch men out, and have kept many of your Party in: What room after this for ſuch a Queſtion? Next you carp at me, for telling you (in reputation of your <hi>Calumnies</hi> by a <hi>Compariſon)</hi> what Miniſters were in my time, and in the Places where I lived: You <hi>[marvel at my</hi> Praecox ingenium, <hi>that could judge before I was ten years old, Who were ignorant, Who learned Preachers: You fear it is ſtill the greateſt part of ſome mens Devotion to cenſure the Parts and Gifts of the Preacher.] Anſwer,</hi> O what relief are poor Souls like to have from ſuch uncompaſſionate Shepherds! I conjecture you believe me not, I will do what I can to cure you. But remember, I open not my Fathers Nakedneſs, while I ſpeak nothing but what <hi>Congregations</hi> ſaw and heard; and that to you alone now in ſecret, and that upon your urgency. I was not bred in <hi>Wales</hi> nor <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

but firſt in <hi>Shropſhire.</hi> At ſix and ſeven years old my firſt Maſter was a <hi>Reader,</hi> never at <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi> and Preached once a Month: I name him not, becauſe he was aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

My next Maſter, Mr. <hi>Yale, B. D.</hi> Preached once a Month, and drank himſelf, Wife and Children, to be ſtark Beggars.

I then came to live at <hi>Eaton Conſtantine;</hi> the <hi>Vicar</hi> of the <hi>Pariſh,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Wolley,</hi> never Preached: The <hi>Parſon</hi> of the <hi>Town,</hi> Sir <hi>William Rogers,</hi> above fourſcore, had <hi>two Livings,</hi> and never Preached in his life, as was ſaid: When his Eye-ſight failed him, he ſaid <hi>Common Prayer</hi> by Memory; and <hi>John Colly</hi> a Day-labourer, one year, and <hi>Thomas Gaynam</hi> a Taylor, another year read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but none Preached. Having two Places, when he was abſent, his Curate was firſt, his Son <hi>Francis Rogers,</hi> rarely if ever Preached; a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Stage-player:</hi> (One of his Sports was on the open Stage, to let his <hi>Pudenda nudata per reſtem laceratam quaſi neglecta ſe oſtentare ad riſum populi movendum.</hi> His next <hi>Curate,</hi> my Maſter <hi>John Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> (his Grand-child) was unlearned and never Preached. His next <hi>Curate, Richard Bathoe,</hi> was a Lawyers Clerk, broken by drinking, who was wont, to our ſmart, to let us know when he was drunk; and never Preached there but once, which was in my hearing when he was drunk, as I told you: If he be not lately dead, he is yet a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

On the other ſide us, the next Church <hi>Creſſage</hi> had no Preaching. The next <hi>Kenley,</hi> had Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> a Reading Curate, that Preached not. Mr. <hi>Bent</hi> at <hi>Harley;</hi> my Kinſman Mr. <hi>Wood, B. D.</hi> at <hi>Cund,</hi> ſeldom: And the ſame I may ſay of too many other Places round about us.

2. I am aſhamed to Read a Preacher, a Writer, an Accuſer of the afflicted, to talk of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſubject of <hi>Oaths</hi> ſo poorly as you do. Though I tell you, I will not diſpute this Point with you without a Licenſe from Authority, I will ſay, 1. That when you ſay <hi>[Take an unlawfull Oath in what ſenſe you pleaſe, and will there be much need of abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.]</hi> You ſhould not ſo confuſedly have Named an <hi>Unlawfull Oath.</hi> Remember that you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt me, that a <hi>Question may be falſe.</hi> And that an Indefinite <hi>in reneceſſariâ,</hi> or thus unlimited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered, goeth for an Univerſal: an Oath is <hi>unlawfull,</hi> 1. <hi>Quoad actum imponendi,</hi> 2. <hi>Quoad act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um jurandi,</hi> 3. <hi>Quoad materiam juratam.</hi> If the <hi>Materia Jurata</hi> be Lawfull, do you think that the unlawfulneſs of the other two, do leave no need of an Abſolution? 1. What if a Thief force me to ſwear Allegiance to the King, or to ſwear to do ſome Duty, doth it not add a Second bond? Or what if I vowed without the Command of any power? 2. What if I ſinned in making a Vow, or Oath, by taking it from a Uſurper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or without juſt Cauſe, or unreaſonably, or to an ill end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Matter be good, doth it not then bind me. And <hi>de materiâ,</hi> what if one <hi>Article</hi> or <hi>many</hi> be bad and another good, doth the Neighbourhood of the bad, diſoblige me from the good. If ſo, it is but inſerting ſome bad Clauſes, and men may be bound by no <hi>Oaths</hi> or <hi>Vows,</hi> as in the former Caſe. It is but ſwearing ſinfully, to an ill end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and never be obliged.

that's all one as to ſay, that the World hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had one honeſt man, but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> a while.

            <p>§. 19. It is a troubleſom thing to diſpute on terms not explained or underſtood: I thought all this while that <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> had been terms whoſe <hi>ſenſe</hi> we had agreed of, but I was miſtaken; for now you let me know, that an <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop</hi> (who ſtrove hard for ſuch Preferment) who drew the reſt of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> into that high <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> for which ſome were impriſoned, who forſook the <hi>Parliament</hi> and went to the <hi>Kings Party;</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw that they would bring low the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who for ſelf-ſafety turned to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> when he ſaw all was almoſt gone on the other ſide; and this but in <hi>Wales</hi> to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his own houſe: this man with you was a <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bycerian Archbiſhop;</hi> I may underſtand ſhortly what a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> ſignifieth of late in <hi>England!</hi> As many <hi>Epiſcopal Non-conformiſts</hi> are ſilenced, and go now under the Name of <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> So take heed of <hi>ſtraining</hi> the word too high, leſt <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> at laſt be put down as <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> too.

               <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> and would continue an <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> becauſe he foreſaw that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> would pull down themſelves, and the <hi>Puritans</hi> would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. In this ſenſe I ſhould not have denied but that they were <hi>Presbyterians</hi> that firſt raiſed that War in <hi>England</hi> againſt the <hi>King:</hi> But your proof is out of <hi>Ruſhworth, p.</hi> 224. <hi>viz.</hi> No other than thoſe two famous men, Sir <hi>John Lamb,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sibthorpe</hi> importuned the <hi>Biſhop</hi> to proſecute the <hi>Puritans;</hi> the <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſaid, <hi>He knew of none, and asked what manner of people they be?</hi> It's anſwered by Sir <hi>John Lamb</hi> in Dr. <hi>Sibthorp</hi>'s preſence, <hi>That they ſeem to the World to be ſuch as would not Swear, Whore, nor Drink, but yet would Lye, Cheat, and Deceive. That they would frequently hear two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons a day, and repeat the ſame too, and afterwards Pray, and ſometimes faſt all day long. Then the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop asked, Whether thoſe places where thoſe Puritans were; did lend Money freely (to the</hi> King) <hi>upon the Loan.</hi> To which Sir <hi>John Lamb</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sybthorp</hi> replyed, <hi>That they did generally reſolve to lend free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Then ſaid the Biſhop <hi>No man of deſcretion can ſay, that that place is a place of</hi> Puritans: <hi>For my part I am not ſatisfied to give way to Proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</hi> At which Dr. <hi>Sibthorp</hi> ſaid, <hi>He was troubled to ſee that the</hi> Church <hi>was no better regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> Very good; A <hi>Presbyterian</hi> then is a <hi>Biſhop that is not ſatisfied to perſecute ſuch Puritans as thoſe.</hi> Add but what is ſaid by many old <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> how the word <hi>Puritan</hi> was uſed with the utmoſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice by <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>ungodly perſons,</hi> againſt thoſe who were firm <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and would not Drink, and Whore as they did; as Dr. <hi>Robert Abhot, Regius Profeſſor</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> of

               <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Downam,</hi> (one that I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought had been no <hi>Presbyterian)</hi> in his <hi>Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sermon,</hi> called <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Tryal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rob.

I ſay take in all this, and let Poſterity judge of an <hi>Engliſh Presbyterian</hi> by it, that he is one that will not perſecute and undo ſuch <hi>Puritans:</hi> We had divers ſuch Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Biſhops, <hi>Uſher, Bedle, Downam, Davenant, Hall, &amp;c.</hi> And before them <hi>Grindal, Abbots,</hi> and the moſt of our Biſhops for Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign.

may be, left it prove them to be <hi>Presbyterians</hi> that will not proſecute us:) Learn better whether ever Dr. <hi>Reignolds</hi> did ſubſcribe to the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> whether ever he took the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Canonical Obedience,</hi> or was not againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Prelacy?</hi> Whether he was for the <hi>Croſs</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm, &amp;c.</hi> But you verily think that were he now <hi>alive, he would be as hard a Màwl of the Schiſmaticks, and Non-conformiſts, &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> 1. Of the <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> no doubt, for he wrote againſt both <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Separation.</hi> 2. Wonderful!

Twice as much is now required of <hi>Conformiſts</hi> as was then. 2. And Dr. <hi>Reignolds</hi> was not a man to do what he did without ſuch Reaſon as would have made him conſtant. And to requite you with as ſtrong Confidence, Sir, I do not raſhly but ſoberly and deliberately profeſs, that were they <hi>all alive</hi> at this day (the old Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conformable Divines themſelves) ſuch as Dr. <hi>Io.

Burges, Forbes:</hi> yea the old <hi>Biſhops</hi> themſelves, <hi>Jewell, Sands, Grindall, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, Miles Smith, &amp;c.</hi> I do firmly believe without heſitation, that the generality of them would have been <hi>reſolved Non-conformiſts</hi> at this time, not changing their judgment, but becauſe of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64641:34"/>
great Change of Conformity: For I know that <hi>Cornelius Burges,</hi> the Learned <hi>Gataker,</hi> Dr. <hi>Robert Harris,</hi> and almoſt all the late <hi>Weſtminſter Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> were formerly ſuch kind of Conformiſts as theſe were: And I know the ſame Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts now (though not many) would have yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the old Conformity. Yea more, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that were <hi>Rogers, Bradford, Sanders, &amp;c.</hi> Yea Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Farrar,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Latimer</hi> alive now, they would all chooſe rather to burn at a Stake again, than to do what is required of us. Say not that I reproach the <hi>Laws,</hi> for I only ſpeak of the matter <hi>of Fact;</hi> whether they or the preſent Biſhops were the wiſer, I meddle not. Yea more, yet I much doubt, whether all the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> now would Conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as Miniſters do, if they were put to it? For I ſuppoſe you to know, that they are not put to the <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Subſcriptions,</hi> as the Miniſters were, nor to their <hi>Oaths:</hi> But in this I am not confident, but only doubt. But of ſuch old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts as <hi>Bolton, Whateley, &amp;c.</hi> I make no doubt at all. 3. But your Proof is, <hi>That he received Abſolution according to the Church of</hi> England. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi> Is this proving? So would I do: yea, I do receive the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> according to the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie.</hi> Am I therefore a Conformiſt? Doth it follow that he would ſwear, ſubſcribe, declare, uſe the <hi>Image of the Croſs</hi> as a <hi>ſymbole</hi> of Chriſtianity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>I thought all theſe ſet together, had been proof enough. 1.

6. That even to this day 1671. there are yet about threeſcore of them alive, beſides Lords, from whom the matter may be known. 7.

Middleton,</hi> Mr. <hi>G. Mitton,</hi> Sir <hi>John Gell, &amp;c.</hi> 12. That the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> at firſt were all <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> except about nine or ten, (As Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> telleth them in his <hi>Anſwer to the London Miniſters.)</hi> 13. That the <hi>Scots</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (as may be ſeen in a late <hi>Anſwer to the Biſhop of</hi> Dumblanes <hi>Accommodation)</hi> do profeſs, That as <hi>England</hi> never was <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> ſo they never ſuppoſed that they ſhould immediately be ſuch, but only put into the <hi>Covenant</hi> the general words of <hi>[Reforming according to the word of God, and the Example of the beſt Reformed Churches]</hi> That they might engage them further to enquire what is the <hi>Reformation</hi> which is moſt agreeable hereunto; that ſo in time they might attain it: So that when the ſaid Biſhop (now Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſgoe</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known to me) citeth my own words, and other mens, to prove that the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> or <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> never intended the Renunciation of <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> but of the <hi>Engliſh exorbitant Prelacy,</hi> the <hi>Scots Presbyterians</hi> deny it not, but anſwer as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid. 14. That it is a commonly known thing, that the Covenant came in, not only after the Wars were begun, but when the Parliament was brought ſo low as to ſeek to the <hi>Scots</hi> for aid. And that <hi>Presbytery</hi> was little known in <hi>England,</hi> till the <hi>Scots</hi> brought in the knowledge of it. 15. And it was a notorious thing that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment yielded to <hi>Presbytery</hi> and to exclude <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi> at laſt, not becauſe they thought that a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Epiſcopacy</hi> was not lawful and beſt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had no way to hold up their Wars, (without which they thought they had no way to uphold themſelves) but by the help of the

               <hi>Scots</hi> and ſuch as were againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had ſeen the <hi>Prelacy</hi> fly ſo high, and now to be ſo ſtrong againſt them that they had no hope of moderating it, but fear'd it would bear down all. Inſomuch that Mr. <hi>Thomas Coleman</hi> gave the <hi>Covenant</hi> to the <hi>Lords</hi> with this open profeſſion, That it ſignified not the Renunciation of <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> 16. And it is a notorious thing, that before the Parliament 1640, there were not ſo many Non-conformable Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> (Presbyterians, Independents, and Anabaptiſts altogether) as there were Counties in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And 17. It is known that few of thoſe few had any hand in raiſing or promoting the War: Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> in <hi>Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> Mr. <hi>Langley</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> poor Mr. <hi>Barnet</hi> of <hi>Uppington,</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oliver Thomas,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wrath</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> (that quickly died, as almoſt all the reſt did) Mr. <hi>Augier</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> Mr. <hi>Slater,</hi> Mr. <hi>Root,</hi> and a few more in all <hi>England.</hi> And 18. It is known, that when neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had drawn them to pleaſe the <hi>Scots,</hi> and take the Covenant, the Parliament would never be drawn (though they made Ordinances for it) to appoint any to ſettle <hi>Presbytery</hi> in the Counties in execution of their Ordinances. But purpoſely delayed, and never did it, except in <hi>London, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire, Warwickſhire,</hi> and a few more places. 19. And it is known, that the Miniſters of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> themſelves were but few of them indeed <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and therefore were the backwarder to ſet up that <hi>Diſcipline:</hi> And therefore our <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire</hi> Agreement (to concur in all that the three Parties are agreed in) did the more eaſily
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64641:37"/>
and generally take; and that the People them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were ſo generally againſt <hi>Presbytery</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome of the ſtricter ſort) that they never would ſubmit to it: And ſo <hi>de facto,</hi> it was never indeed ſet up, ſave in the few places forenamed. 20. Laſtly, It is viſible, that the Reaſons of the Parliament's War publiſhed in their <hi>Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Declarations,</hi> do ſuppoſe their Conſent to <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and mention nothing of a <hi>change:</hi> And that the <hi>Lawyers</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> (as Judge <hi>Brown, Selden, Glin, &amp;c.)</hi> were generally Epiſcopal <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> that thought <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> lawful, as being from the <hi>Soveraign Power,</hi> which they thought might appoint <hi>Church Government</hi> as he pleaſe: (As Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s <hi>Irenic.</hi> pleads; and as the <hi>Kings late Acts</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> intimate ſo far, as to determine that all the <hi>external Government belongs to the King:</hi> And I will not believe, though you ſhould ſwear it, that the <hi>King</hi> is a <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> I did think that theſe <hi>Twenty Evidences</hi> ſet together, would have proved to any <hi>ſober man,</hi> that on both ſides it was <hi>Epiſcopal men,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopal Eraſtians</hi> that raiſed the firſt War in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this <hi>Evidence</hi> notwithſtanding, this is <hi>to you the ſtrangeſt Paradox in Hiſtorical Tranſactions that ever ſaw the light:</hi> A <hi>ſerious Confutation of it would have ſhewed you to be in a delirium, &amp;c.</hi> Anſw. You have hit on the beſt <hi>Confutation</hi> of it in thoſe words that the Cauſe was capable of: For now ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ſtrangers and Poſterity may poſſibly think, that a man would not ſo confidently deny a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing, without ſome ground.

               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:64641:37"/>
or between <hi>Engliſh-men.)</hi> Why 1. you ſay, That <hi>[the Spirit of Presbytery and Non-conformity was ſtirring in thoſe Parliaments, though not known by thoſe Names.]</hi> Anſw.

            <p>As to your doubt, whether <hi>England</hi> infected not <hi>Scotland? Heylin</hi> in his Life of <hi>Land</hi> will tell you plainly.

And even then they ſaid nothing that I know of for <hi>Presbytery.</hi> 5. But the truth is, they ſaw

by that time, that they could not ſtand but by the help of thoſe that were againſt the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> the <hi>Scots,</hi> the <hi>Independents,</hi> and the <hi>unwilling Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> that deſired a <hi>Deliverance.</hi> But this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not that the Parliament was <hi>Presbyterians</hi> then, much leſs that they were ſo before the <hi>Wars:</hi> But you that <hi>meddle not with Lay-men,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Lay-men</hi> ſent thoſe <hi>Propaſitions.</hi>

            <p>You next tell me of Alderman <hi>Pennington,</hi> and the <hi>Apprentices.</hi> Anſw. 1.

And how inconſiderable a number in <hi>London</hi> were thoſe <hi>Apprentices.</hi> 2.

as no man muſt ſay, that the <hi>King</hi> had the <hi>Spirit of Popery,</hi> becauſe he was willing that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould help him: So no man can prove that the <hi>Epiſcopal Parliament</hi> had the Spirit of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or were againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> it ſelf, becauſe they were willing to be helped by all ſorts, who on a ſudden were fallen out with <hi>Biſhops.</hi> The truth is, the <hi>ſuſpending</hi> and <hi>ſilencing</hi> of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and the cropping the <hi>Ears,</hi> and ſtigmatizing <hi>Prin</hi> with <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> had ſuddenly raiſed in the <hi>London</hi> Apprentices and others, a great diſtate of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> though they knew little of any <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies</hi> about <hi>Church-Government</hi> at all. When you ſay, that <hi>[Epiſcopacy</hi> (or <hi>rather Biſhops Lands)</hi> was the <hi>Palladium, &amp;c.]</hi> 1. Epiſcopacy was not ſo till after the Army was raiſed: It was ſo, no doubt, in the private deſigns of ſome particular men, <hi>Apprentices</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> in the City and Kingdom; that is, all that were againſt it deſired it ſhould fall: And many that were <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that it ſhould rather fall, than the Abuſes of it continue by ſuch men as they thought would elſe ruine <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> thinking that there was no other way to ſave them: (ſo far did diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent apprehenſions about <hi>Propriety, Liberty, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> carry men from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, who were all for <hi>Epiſcopacy.)</hi> But forget not 1. <hi>That it is the major Vote of the Parliament,</hi> and not a few ſecret deſigners within or without doors, that is the <hi>Parliament.</hi> 2.

All this was done upon Inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they were not men to be truſted, being even then at the heart for the moſt part <hi>Epiſcopal.</hi> And if yet you are incredulous, and as diſtant as the other Pole, I will now but intreat you to fetch one <hi>Argument</hi> from the <hi>North,</hi> to draw you from your <hi>North-Pole</hi> diſtance; and tell your ſelf whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Major General <hi>Monk</hi> (and <hi>Morgan)</hi> and his Army which brought in the <hi>King,</hi> and ſet up the <hi>Biſhops</hi> again, was <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian?</hi> And yet their long abode in <hi>Scotland</hi> made that <hi>Army</hi> accounted to be more <hi>Presbyterian</hi> than any <hi>Army</hi> that was in <hi>England.</hi> But as <hi>King Charles</hi> ſaith in his Letter to Mr. <hi>Henderſon, No man can ſo hardly underſtand as he that would not know.</hi> That the <hi>War is ſo odious now as that neither ſide will own it,</hi> is no wonder, when they have learned by ſo much Experience: I would it had been ſo from the beginning.</p>

But its more ſtrange to me, that the Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Calvinian, Prelats</hi> and <hi>Prelatiſts,</hi> ſhould be talked of as ſo incredible; when your <hi>Goliah, Peter Heylin</hi> hath made it ſo much of the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Life</hi> of A.

            <p>As for <hi>Arrius,</hi> I had no acquaintance with him, nor have I any buſineſs with him: But if all my foreſaid <hi>twenty Evidences</hi> fail me, and I cannot know what a <hi>Parliament</hi> was? what a <hi>Synod</hi> was? what an <hi>Army</hi> was? when I was acquainted fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with ſo many of them all?

It's well that you are not out of hope of Preferment your ſelf, leſt you ſhould turn <hi>Presbyterian:</hi> for (pardon on my <hi>ſmarting ſharpneſs</hi> of ſpeech to you (as you account it) while I tell you that) I take you not for a better man than S. <hi>Jerom;</hi> and therefore think that want of Preferment would do more with you, than it did with him. But this is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary judgment of Worldlings, who meaſure other men by themſelves. When I am dead, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer for my ſelf, I doubt not but the ſame will be ſaid of me, though you were now forced to recede from that Cenſure.

            <p>§. 33. When our Queſtion was of the Cauſers of the late War, and we came to recite the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Leaders of the Prelatical party, what ſhould I do more than name the men and their Books. When the Biſhop ſilenced me, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid me to Preach in his Dioceſs, he commended for my Cure the reading of <hi>Bilſon</hi> and <hi>Hooker,</hi> and named no others. I now recited the words of <hi>Bilſon</hi> and <hi>Hooker,</hi> the firſt as aſſerting the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> the ſecond as going quite beyond them on the Principles of them that pull'd down the <hi>Parliament,</hi> I cited <hi>page</hi> and <hi>words</hi> at large. To all this I have nothing but that <hi>you will cover your Fathers nakedneſs, and not own all that they ſay:</hi> But doth not this yield that <hi>this was their doctrine?</hi> What need you diſown or cover it, if it were not ſo? Yet nothing will make ſome men confeſs. But ſtill Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> you <hi>admire,</hi> and ſo did <hi>Camden, Uſher, Morton, Hales, Gawden,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles.]</hi> I dare not joyn my ſelf to ſo great Names as one of his Admirers, leſt I ſeem too much to value my ſelf. I will come far behind them, ſuppoſing that a long tedious Diſcourſe in him hath as much ſubſtance, as one might put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Syllogiſm of ſix Lines. I ſaid, but that <hi>[it was

theirs and ſuch Prelatiſt's Principles that led me into what I did and wrote.]</hi> His <hi>Principles</hi> might do it, and <hi>not he,</hi> as they were managed by other men. But theſe are Niceties to men that heed not what they read or ſay. What is written <hi>Line</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 24. §. 10. you ſeem to defend: and 1. you ſay <hi>[What is this more, than ſome that writ for the Kings Cauſe in the late Wars profeſſed?] Anſw.</hi> And will you defend or own all that then was confeſſed by them? Have you read the Kings <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the 19 <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions?</hi> Do you know that the <hi>Parliaments</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents drew up a <hi>Catechiſm</hi> out of that <hi>Anſwer,</hi> as pretending to juſtifie all their Cauſe by it? Know you not that in <hi>Fountains</hi> Letter anſwered by Dr. <hi>Steward;</hi> and in Sir <hi>Francis Netherſole</hi>'s Writings for the <hi>King,</hi> and many others, thoſe things are ſuppoſed or aſſerted, which I would not counſel you now to aſſert. Your Inſtance is, <hi>[That as to making of Laws, our Kings have not challenged a Power without Parliaments.] Anſwer,</hi> God be thanked, but that's none of our Queſtion: But what you will not <hi>know,</hi> you cannot <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</hi> Seeing you ſeem to juſtifie <hi>Hooker</hi> here, who ſaith, <hi>That Laws they are not, which publick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation hath not made ſo:</hi> (Which I believe of thoſe Countries where ſuch publick Senates have part in the <hi>Legiſlation.)</hi> By this you muſt ſay, that in the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions, or any the like, there are no <hi>Laws.</hi> But if you ſay, that the Original Grant of the <hi>Legiſlative Power to one is equivalent to an Approbation of his Laws:</hi> I maintain that <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Principle is falſe, <hi>[That by the natural Law whereto God hath made all ſubject, the natural power of making Laws to command whole publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64641:45"/>
of men belongeth, ſo properly to the ſame entire Societies, that for any Prince or Potentate of what kindſoever upon earth, to exerciſe the ſame himſelf, and not either by expreſs Commiſſion immediately and perſonally received from God, or elſe by Authority derived at firſt from their Conſent, upon whoſe perſons they impoſe Laws, it is no better than meer Tyranny.</hi> How hard a task then do you put Kings upon to excuſe themſelves from Tyranny, when ever ſuch <hi>Prelatiſts</hi> will accuſe them of it. For 1. I hope you will not put them to prove <hi>[That they have their Power by an expreſs Commiſſion immediately and perſonally from God]</hi> (as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had) Shall we obey none but thoſe that fanatically can pretend to a Revelation, or <hi>immediate perſonal Commiſſion from Heaven.</hi> And 2. prove if you can, that the People have Regal power to <hi>uſe</hi> or to <hi>give.</hi> I grant that originally their Conſent may be neceſſary to the deſignation of the Perſon or Family that ſhall receive it from God: But it is God that giveth the power, though the people chooſe the Perſon or Family; no man giveth that which he hath not: The People have not legal or governing Power, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they cannot give it. The Wife chooſeth her Husband, but Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution giveth him his power. If that it be certain (as Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> hath proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>John Goodwin)</hi> that the Peoples conſent doth give no <hi>power,</hi> but onely let in the perſon that ſhall receive it from God, and not from them; how dare you thus conclude all Kings on earth to be but Tyrants, as <hi>Hooker</hi> plainly doth: For no King on Earth hath <hi>[an immediate perſonal Commiſſion from Heaven]</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:64641:45"/>
And no <hi>King</hi> (that I know of) can receive power from the People that never had it to give: <hi>Ergo,</hi> you make all Kings to be no Kings but Tyrants; but falſly. Will you defend this becauſe <hi>Hooker</hi> wrote it? Were not theſe the Levellers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratiſts Principles, higher than the old <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> owned? Muſt a <hi>Clergy</hi> of ſuch Principles put men upon <hi>baniſhing</hi> the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> five Miles from a <hi>Corporation,</hi> as men of ſeditious Principles.<hi>—Terras aſtraea reliquit.</hi> You tell me, <hi>I take what is for my purpoſe, and leave out the reſt.</hi> Anſ. <hi>Semper idem.</hi> Do I mai many Sentence? Do I pervert any? Is the reſt contradictory to this? What in the great <hi>Hooker?</hi> No, not at all. I ſuppoſe the reſt. Unrighteous man! If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire me to write out all his Book, when ever I tranſcribe a part? I own that which you tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe? What would you have more. But next you ſay, that I have found <hi>other Doctrine</hi> in <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> other Books. <hi>Anſw.</hi> A ſilly pretence, of which anon. You ask <hi>[Was you led aſide by</hi> Hooker, <hi>&amp;c. yet you quote paſſages out of the 8th Book, that came out ſince. Anſ.</hi> A man that would turn us to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi> muſt be able himſelf to heed what he read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; 1. I ſaid, not that <hi>Hooker,</hi> but <hi>ſuch Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> led me. 2. I never ſaid, that I was led by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very word that I now cite, but that theſe words contain the Principles which miſſed me (that is, ſo far and ſo long as I followed thoſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.) Do you not ſee that your heedleſneſs temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you to this Error; and yet your <hi>[Ex poſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minio]</hi> and <hi>[firſt building the Roof]</hi> ſeemed ſence to you, or you would have them ſeem ſuch at leaſt to me.</p>

But it's well that you diſown theſe <hi>three Book</hi> of <hi>Hookers</hi> alſo. But 1. is not this forecited in the firſt, the very ſum of all that you are afraid of 2. Will you ſo give away the <hi>ſixth</hi> and <hi>ſeventh</hi> which ſay far more for <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> than all the reſt 3. Will you thus reproach all Biſhop <hi>Gauden</hi>'s <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Vindication</hi> and <hi>Dedication</hi> to the <hi>King?</hi> 4. Did he not tell you that the Copy was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined with <hi>Hookers</hi> own hand, as approving it? What would you have more? 5. I again tell you, I can bring you proof of a <hi>Concordant Copy,</hi> (the <hi>Scribes Errates</hi> excepted). 6. Mr. <hi>Walton</hi> could not deny it. 7. Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> cited by you confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it. For to ſay, that a Sentence or two were left, doth intimate that the Book was his; and <hi>leaving out,</hi> is not <hi>putting in:</hi> And I cited nothing that was <hi>left out,</hi> nor any thing in it that is <hi>mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> for want of it. 8. Any man may ſee that the 8th Book was <hi>imperfect,</hi> and that is proved by the <hi>matter, manner,</hi> and <hi>end:</hi> But it was nevertheleſs <hi>Hooker</hi>'s, and concordant in <hi>ſtyle</hi> and <hi>matter</hi> with the firſt. And have you now vindicated the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of the chief <hi>Prelatiſts</hi> any better than by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning them? And do you take it as incredible, that many <hi>Epiſcopal men</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould think as <hi>Bilſon</hi> and <hi>Hooker</hi> thought, and as the great Speakers, Sir <hi>Dudley Digs, Cook, Philips, Eliot,</hi> and many ſuch in former <hi>Parliaments</hi> did ſeem to think.</p>
            <p>§. 35. Did you write againſt their <hi>Diſcipline</hi> with ſuch ugly Inſinuations of Treaſon, before you knew what their <hi>Diſcipline</hi> was, and then think you are excuſed by ſaying, <hi>It muſt not be touched.</hi> 2. Did you not know till now, that the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64641:46"/>
               <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are not in all things of one mind? They never pretended to it: How many men are ſo, whoſe Faith is their own? Are you after ſo many years to learn, that ſome that Conform not are <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> ſome <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> ſome <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> and ſome as we of <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> (and I think moſt of <hi>England)</hi> addicted to no Party; but think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that each of the three (and the <hi>Eraſtians</hi> too) have ſomewhat in which they excel the reſt, and ſomewhat in which they erre more than the reſt. This is our judgment: And will not old printed Writings make you know it, before you firſt write againſt it, and then wonder at it, and make a ſtir about that which you know not, when i'ts told you. You next think that by <hi>proving that they flie their Habitation, and refuſe the Oath, you ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prove—that the Chorus ſticks at renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing War againſt the King.</hi> Becauſe it is a ſerious buſineſs; I muſt profeſs that you here ſo croſs the common Principles of Reaſon, Humanity, or Chriſtianity, that you do not at all tempt me to Conform: When you know (if you are reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) that if they ſhould take <hi>all the Oath</hi> except the <hi>laſt Clauſe,</hi> they are nevertheleſs to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from Corporations? When you <hi>know</hi> (if you are reaſonable) that a man may judge the firſt part, or one part lawful, that thinketh otherwiſe of the <hi>laſt,</hi> and ſo that he muſt remove his Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation! To conclude, yet that the <hi>flying of their Habitations, and not taking the Oath is a proof that they are againſt the whole, or againſt that Clauſe that renounceth Arms againſt the King;</hi> and to take this for a <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> as <hi>going</hi> is, that there is <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> I tell you again, this reaſoning beſeemeth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64641:47"/>
not a Divine, or a man. Doth it not imply, that you will take an Oath your ſelf, if you judge but one part of it lawful? And yet before, that <hi>Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But by this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that <hi>quoad ſenſum</hi> you are of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts mind, though not as to the method of ſwearing: For if they could but ſtretch their Conſciences to put your ſenſe upon that Clauſe of the Oath, they would take it: And yet do you nauſeate their Principles and Diſcipline, becauſe they cannot interpret it as you, who would take it were it ſo interpreted? See then by how ſmall a matter (even the meer expoſition of the words.) <hi>Satan</hi> can tempt ſome men to nauſeate the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Principles of others that fear an Oath.

Why did you not name ſome one of thoſe Principles, and try by what Conſequence it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth all the <hi>Villanies</hi> which you name. Do not the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay the ſame of the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> 2. And
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64641:48"/>
next, why did you not prove that we <hi>hold thoſe rebellious Genevian Principles?</hi> Were it Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an dealing in me, if I ſhould ſay, <hi>[Becauſe</hi> Prins <hi>Hiſtory of Prelates Treaſons proveth that multitudes of Prelates have been Traytors therefore our preſent Prelates are ſuch too.]</hi> But we ſee what Inſtruments the Prince of Malice and Calumny uſeth. You tell me that you ſhall the leſs believe <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Parliaments Declarations</hi> ſo differed from their practice. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. But will you falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the part that is good for the part that is evil? Moſt Chriſtians live not according to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Profeſſion: Is the Chriſtian Profeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bad, and the cauſe of all their <hi>Villanies?</hi> Will you judge <hi>fidem ex homine?</hi> Will you charge all that upon a mans Religion objectively conſidered, which you find amiſs in his life. 2. Do you not know that our Queſtion now is not what the <hi>men are,</hi> but what their <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and that it is not the <hi>Profeſſio profitens,</hi> but the <hi>Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio profeſſa</hi> which is to be diſputed of. And by what means ſhall any Church or Party under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven defend their Religion againſt ſuch a Cenſurer and Diſputant as you are? They will ſay that they have the true Religion; you will ſay, no, for you are not true to your Religion: They will ſay, that their <hi>Articles</hi> are true; you will ſay, no, they are falſe, becauſe you live not according to them, (which implieth that they are true and good, or elſe what fault were it to contradict them in practice.) The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> will ſay, Our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is ſound and agreeable to Gods Word: you teach the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to anſwer, no, it's falſe, for there are vicious Livers among you. And I pray you,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64641:49"/>
what number of Sinners muſt go to prove a <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Creed,</hi> or <hi>Articles</hi> falſe? Muſt it be all, or the major part, or will any one ſerve? Muſt the <hi>Kingdom</hi> try by the <hi>Pole,</hi> or Vote whether the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> or the <hi>Vertuous</hi> are the greater number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, before they can prove their Religion true? Doth the Act go to the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject?</hi> 3. But if it muſt needs be ſo, I pray diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute no more againſt the <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt them better by your <hi>Lives,</hi> than you have done? Will you teach them to argue the <hi>XXXIX Articles,</hi> the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and Book of <hi>Ordination</hi> are not true, or to be ſubſcribed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> live thus or thus. You know Foreigners and Poſterity know not which of the Hiſtories of this Age are true or falſe: Suppoſe that they ſhould read Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies</hi> of <hi>Drunkards, &amp;c.</hi> ejected from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and the Records of the <hi>Country Committees,</hi> ſaying, So many and ſo many were upon Oath proved ſcandalous Drunkards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Ralph Wallis</hi> naming ſo many Drunkards and ſcandalous <hi>Conformiſts</hi> now. Would you have them queſtion the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> till they can prove theſe Hiſtories falſe. I profeſs to you reſolvedly, that if I muſt needs judge that Church or Party to have the ſoundeſt <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> who have the beſt lives; I ſhould far and very far prefer the <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> and much more the <hi>Conciliators,</hi> before the <hi>Prelatiſts,</hi> and yet not extenuate any of their Faults. But all this is nothing to you that go another way to work. <hi>[Why tell you of mens Profeſſions, when you ſee their contrary Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice?]</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:64641:49"/>
When as it is not the <hi>Practice</hi> only, but the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> that is the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> that you accuſed: And ſo when their <hi>Principles</hi> are in <hi>queſtion,</hi> why do we talk to you of their <hi>Principles?</hi> And how ſilly a ſhift is all this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with? Becauſe the <hi>Parliament promiſed to make the King the moſt glorious King, if he would return to them, &amp;c.</hi> But 1.

            <p>To your next; [If we muſt call none <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal men that are not faithful to their Principles]</hi> Then I know not indeed whom I may call ſuch: If Parties muſt be notified by their Fidelity, we ſhould have agreed thus to ſenſe the Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had diſputed, for other men ſpeak not thus. Did you think I cited <hi>Moulin</hi> againſt <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanax</hi> to prove that our Principles are better than the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> Have you read him all, and underſtand him no better? I cited him as fully proving hiſtorically that the Places now charged with <hi>Presbyterianiſm</hi> and Rebellion, <hi>Geneva, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp;c.</hi> had changed this <hi>Government</hi> before, or on other accounts; <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Holland</hi> in the change, the main Body

The Biſhop was fled eight Months before the Reformation, ſeeing his Conſpiracy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to oppreſs the Liberties of the City by the help of the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>for which his Secretary was hanged after he was gone; the ſaid Biſhop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hated before, for the Rape of a Virgin, and many Adulteries with Citizens Wives.

            <p>I ſhall recite no more out of this Epiſcopal Doctor, Prebend of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but deſire you

again to read <hi>page</hi> 23, 24. What changed <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s mind to own the Proteſtants Arms againſt the Emperour. And <hi>page</hi> 32, 33.

Becauſe I told you, that you ſhould not have ſet down the bare Names of <hi>T. C.</hi> and <hi>Travers,</hi> as a Charge, without citing what they ſay. And is not that true? Is that an unequal expectation? And what if I had added, That had you proved them guilty, it had not concerned any of us, or our <hi>Diſcipline</hi> or <hi>Principles,</hi> till you had proved that we had own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame? And is that <hi>unequal?</hi> O <hi>Juſtice!</hi> 2. Becauſe I ſaid, <hi>[I will no further believe</hi> Bancroft <hi>or Sir</hi> Th.

            <p>§. 37. It's tedious diſputing with a man that cannot or will not underſtand what is ſaid, no not the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> no not the <hi>Subject</hi> of it. You
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64641:51"/>
cite my words out of the <hi>Saints Reſt,</hi> that ſay not any thing to the <hi>Queſtion.</hi> The <hi>Queſtion</hi> is not, <hi>What were the final Motives of the War?</hi> But, <hi>what was the Controverſie of the warranting Cauſe and Foundation,</hi> that muſt decide the Caſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was <hi>lawful</hi> or <hi>unlawful.</hi> The <hi>Bonum publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>mens Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> are the <hi>great moving ends and Reaſons of a lawful War.</hi> But it is not theſe <hi>Ends</hi> that will ſerve to prove a <hi>War</hi> lawful? Could that be the <hi>Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Controverſie</hi> which they were both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in? Did not the King profeſs to be for <hi>Religion, Liberty, &amp;c.</hi> as well as they. See yet his <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> Half-crowns (if <hi>Coin</hi> be any evidence with you) private men may not raiſe War for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> but the <hi>King</hi> may. The <hi>Finis</hi> and the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum</hi> are not the ſame. I there talkt but of the <hi>Finis</hi> and <hi>Motives,</hi> I now ſpeak of the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum</hi> and <hi>Controverſie,</hi> which is well known to be, whether the <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Parliament</hi> then had the power of the <hi>Militia, rebus ſic ſtantibus;</hi> and whether the <hi>Parliament</hi> had <hi>true Authority</hi> to raiſe an <hi>Army</hi> againſt the <hi>Army</hi> Commiſſioned by the <hi>King</hi> for that Defence, and executing the <hi>Law</hi> upon <hi>Delinquents,</hi> which they then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64641:51"/>
in each Land. I reſiſt you not, but only confeſs my weakneſs, that ſo high a performance is beyond my power. Had you underſtood the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> you might have ſpared your Citation of my words.</p>
            <p>§. 41. You come again to our <hi>ſwearing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity;</hi> and you ſay, <hi>[That it muſt reaſonably be underſtood of a tumultuous and armed endeavour.] Anſw.</hi> 1. And it is publickly known that we are ready to <hi>ſwear</hi> againſt a <hi>tumultuous</hi> and <hi>armed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour</hi> (unleſs by the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Command.)</hi> If you would not endeavour it, even with Arms, if the <hi>King</hi> commanded you, accuſe us not of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty</hi> for being more <hi>Loyal</hi> than you. If you would, we are of the <hi>ſame judgment</hi> as to the <hi>thing:</hi> And ſo (while the thouſands of ignorant Souls are untaught) men of the ſame judgment (on our part openly profeſſed out) muſt ſome be <hi>Teachers,</hi> and ſome <hi>ſilenced,</hi> ſome <hi>preferred,</hi> and ſome in <hi>Priſon,</hi> and <hi>baniſhed</hi> from Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even while they hold the ſame thing. And why? Becauſe one part of them dare take an Oath in a more <hi>ſtretching ſence</hi> than the others dare: And that, 1. Becauſe they are taught (not only by <hi>Ameſius</hi> where you cite him) but by all conſciencious judicious Caſuiſts, That an Oath is to be taken <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and not <hi>ſtretchingly,</hi> in the common ſenſe of the words, unleſs the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers</hi> will otherwiſe explain themſelves. 2. And the words are univerſal <hi>[Not endeavour at any time]</hi> without the leaſt limitation or exception of <hi>any ſort of endeavour.</hi> (I ſhould have broke that Oath by this writing to you had I taken it.) <hi>Et non eſt diſtinguendum aut limitandum fine lege.</hi> 3. The <hi>Law-makers</hi> are to be ſuppoſed wiſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64641:52"/>
men, eſpecially the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and able to diſtinguiſh between an <hi>univerſal</hi> and a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> or <hi>limited enunciation,</hi> and to expreſs their minds in congruous words. 4. The <hi>Law-makers</hi> knew before and ſince that we would take the <hi>Oath,</hi> if <hi>(Endeavouring)</hi> had been limited as you do; and yet they never would limit it by one ſyllable. 5. The Reaſons uſed for that Clauſe, and our acquaintance with the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and other <hi>Authors</hi> of it, leave our Conſciences perſwaded, that <hi>their meaning was</hi> againſt <hi>all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,</hi> and not <hi>tumultuous, military,</hi> or <hi>illegal</hi> only; as in the <hi>Et caetera Oath</hi> 1640. It was that <hi>[I will not conſent]</hi> which is leſs than <hi>[Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring.]</hi> And we are not ignorant what rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this Oath hath to that: And we take it to be a ſin to deceive our <hi>Rulers,</hi> by taking an <hi>Oath</hi> in that ſence which we believe was not by them intended, and ſeeming to them to <hi>ſwear</hi> what we do not <hi>mean.</hi> 6. When twenty <hi>London Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> took the <hi>Oath,</hi> becauſe Doctor <hi>Bates</hi> told them, that the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> promiſed him at the giving it, to put in the words <hi>[Endeavour by any ſeditious or unlawful means]</hi> (or to that ſenſe) the ſaid limiting words were not only left out, but when old Mr. <hi>Sam. Clark</hi> ſaid, <hi>My Lord, we mean only unlawful endeavour:</hi> Judge <hi>Keeling</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Will you take the Oath as it is offered you,</hi> and refuſed to add any ſuch Explication; and told them when they had done, they had <hi>renounced the Covenant.</hi> 7. The Juſtices tell us when they offer us the <hi>Oath,</hi> That we muſt take it according to the plain ſenſe of the words. 8. The <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the <hi>Act for regulating Corporations,</hi> in the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64641:52"/>
               <hi>Declaration</hi> there impoſed, and the <hi>Oath,</hi> doth fully ſatisfie us what is their ſenſe about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 9. It is not true (as far as any <hi>London Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> can know) that ever the Judges declared their ſenſe as you ſay for that limitation: That is, that ever they did by any Conſultation and Concord give any judgment in the Caſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any ſingle Judge (as the <hi>Lord Keeper)</hi> might ſay privately, or any one alone, when another may ſay the contrary. 10. If they had, it's a known thing, whatever their judgment may do to make Caſes in the Common Law, yet as to Statute Law, only the <hi>Law-makers</hi> are the <hi>Law-Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> as to any Interpretation which ſhall be as the Law it ſelf, a Rule univerſally to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: And that Judges and Juſtices (who here are made the Judges) do only interpret the Law, for the deciſion of particular Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that come before them. And if all the Judges and Juſtices in <hi>England</hi> ſhould meet and agree of this Statute, it would only ſhew how they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in particular judgments to expound it, and not what is the true obliging ſenſe to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Conſcience: Otherwiſe the Judges would be equal to, if not above the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For he hath more power who determineth what <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> ſhall have, than they that only make the <hi>words</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> which others may put what ſenſe they pleaſe on. Nor can all the Judges make it lawful to take up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>King,</hi> if they ſo expounded any Law: They have a deciding <hi>Expoſitors judgment</hi> as to the Caſe before them, but not the <hi>regulating uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal expounding power</hi> at all. 11. We think
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64641:53"/>
that <hi>Divines</hi> that preach againſt ſin, above al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> men muſt not ſtretch their Conſciences in ſo <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a point</hi> as <hi>publick ſwearing.</hi> 12. And we think that if men be once taught to equivocate, and play faſt and looſe with the ſacred Bond of <hi>Oaths,</hi> Conſcience is quite debauched, no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Bar is left to keep out any the greateſt ſins; <hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>People</hi> become incredible; humane ſociety is endeavoured to be diſſolved, and the <hi>King</hi>'s Life (ſecured much by his Subjects Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Conſcience of an <hi>Oath)</hi> is expoſed to the wicked wills of men. We charge no others with all this, but we will avoid it our ſelves though it coſt us yet more. You may ſwear <hi>[not to endeavour]</hi> and mean particularly <hi>[not by Tumult or Arms, but by ſome other endeavour;]</hi> but ſo cannot we. Therefore do you enjoy your <hi>Liberty, Maintenance,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and we will be without them; and to morrow, at death, we ſhall be as free and as high as you.</p>
            <p>But fie, Sirs, why will you talk of <hi>[ſtraining Oaths, and turning plain Oaths into Snares, ana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What is the plain ſenſe, but an <hi>univerſal ſenſe</hi> of an <hi>univerſal enunciation?</hi> If by <hi>[All]</hi> or <hi>[None]</hi> I underſtand <hi>All</hi> or <hi>None,</hi> and you underſtand not <hi>All</hi> but <hi>Some,</hi> who is the <hi>Strainer</hi> of the <hi>Oath?</hi> And I pray you tell me, if once <hi>any endeavour</hi> ſhall be excepted, who ſhall determine how much it muſt be. The firſt part of the <hi>Oath</hi> ſaith <hi>[Not on any pretence whatever:]</hi> That is, we muſt not take up Arms againſt any Commiſſioned by the King. What if a bold li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Expoſitor will here come in, and ſay,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64641:53"/>
[Except King <hi>John</hi> deliver up the Kingdom to the <hi>Pope;</hi> Or except the King's Commiſſions through the Officers fault ſhould be contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry] Or ſuch Exceptions as <hi>Wil.

Never truſt the man that feareth not an Oath. 2. But why talk you of <hi>none being Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters?</hi> we cannot give the Power to whom we pleaſe: The Law-makers think it beſt as it is, and will not interpret as you do, when they can, and know all the Reaſons that you can give them. The Juſtices are made our Judges: I told you that the Juſtices when they ſent me to the Gaol, refuſed to Expound it, and told me I muſt take it according to the proper ſenſe of the words.

We do ſearch the Scripture to know what is <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi> as well as we can; And we are the leſs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be partial, when our judgment loſeth us the favour of ſo many, and our Maintenance, and Liberty, and in Priſons, hazardeth our Lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our Miniſtry, the moſt of all.

But call him how you will; 1. It is notorious that he giveth not the <hi>Chancellor</hi> his power at all. 2. And as <hi>notorious</hi> that he hath not, nor exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the power himſelf: But to <hi>judge any man to Excommunication</hi> or <hi>Abſolution,</hi> is the <hi>Chancellors</hi> part; and the preſent <hi>Prieſt</hi> is but like the Pariſh <hi>Prieſt,</hi> who readeth or ſpeaketh (as a Cryer) what the Chancellor judgeth and ordereth: And whether ſuch Prieſt be any Member of the <hi>Court,</hi> or conſtantly uſed, I leave to your Enquiry; but certainly he is no Judge at all, nor doth any thing but pronounce as he is bid. And ſtill my Arguing is unanſwered: For had this <hi>Presbyter</hi> the <hi>power,</hi> it would be either as a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> or as a <hi>Biſhop.</hi> Not as a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> ſay the <hi>Prelatiſts;</hi> for then it will ſet <hi>Presbyters</hi> too high, or rather take hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds from that which belongeth to their Office, whilſt one in the ſame Office exerciſeth the <hi>Keys</hi> upon all their people and themſelves that are his equals: <hi>Et par in parem non habet poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> Not as <hi>Biſhops,</hi> for they are not ſuch really, and the <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> cannot be delegated, as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

            <p>You ſay, <hi>I did not well to overlook what you ſaid about Chancellour's Skill in the Civil Law, &amp;c.] Anſw.</hi> I did not overlook it, but paſt it by as an Impertinency, ſuppoſing we had been agreed: 1.

And that Ability in Scriptures (much leſs in the Roman Laws) doth give no man authority to the exerciſe of the <hi>Spiritual Keys</hi> without a Call, being but his remote Capacity. 3. And that he that is called hereunto is called to be a <hi>Clergy-man,</hi> to whome the <hi>Keys</hi> are proper. I pray you, Sir, deny none of this: (Let Begging this once go inſtead of Arguing. 4. And he may be fit to Adviſe and Aſſiſt a <hi>Biſhop</hi> that is himſelf no <hi>Clergy man;</hi> but <hi>Adviſing</hi> and <hi>judicial Decreeing</hi> are ſeveral things. 5. And I am wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with ſaying, that we ſubmit to <hi>Chancellors</hi> as <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> doing that which belongeth to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,</hi> according to the ſenſe of the <hi>Oath of Supremacy.</hi> But what's all this to our Caſe in hand?] You add, <hi>[Tell me, Sir, may not a man be ſaid to do that virtually, which he doth not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.] Anſw.</hi> Yes, a man may pay a Debt by his Servant, or Deputy; but not Baptize or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Lords Supper, or Diſcipline by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, becauſe Chriſt hath annexed the <hi>Office</hi> to the <hi>Perſon,</hi> and the <hi>Office</hi> is an <hi>Obligation</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to do the work.</p>

You add, <hi>[The King doth neither Preach, nor Adminiſter Sacraments, yet hath a Supremacy of Power in all things belonging to the Church.] Anſw.</hi> Now I cannot follow you ſo far, as to believe that the King doth <hi>virtually Administer the Sacraments per alios:</hi> At leaſt I durſt not <hi>ſwear</hi> it. If you think it is but a <hi>Gorgons head that affrighteth me;</hi> hear and judge: 1.

Queen <hi>Elizabeth'</hi> K. <hi>Iames,</hi> and the <hi>Convocation</hi> have publickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed ſuch a ſenſe of the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> and taken it for the <hi>Papiſts ſlanders,</hi> and diſclaimed ſuch a Power of the <hi>Keys</hi> in the King, and ſo hath our preſent King (wiſely) in my hearing. 3. Some <hi>Scots</hi> are well charged with an injurious refuſal of the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> on the account of ſuch a falſe Expoſition; which is the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Caſe. 4.

But this <hi>proper Teaching</hi> (which God did
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64641:59"/>
not leave in common to others) no <hi>Prince</hi> can uſe, no <hi>Biſhop</hi> can do by <hi>Proxy;</hi> Nor can he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate to a <hi>Lay-man</hi> the power of the <hi>Keys</hi> and <hi>Sacraments.</hi> 2. And the <hi>King</hi> may no doubt command <hi>Paſtors</hi> to do their Duty as well as <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians</hi> to do theirs. I take none of this to be <hi>quarrelling,</hi> but <hi>plain truth:</hi> Your telling us that <hi>Chancellors may direct and adviſe the Surrogates,</hi> may ſignifie ſomething in another Land, but not with us: If we had never ſeen their <hi>Courts,</hi> nor read <hi>Travers, Of the difference between Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and theirs;</hi> yet <hi>Couſin</hi>'s <hi>Tables</hi> are in our <hi>Libraries.</hi>

            <p>You add, <hi>[We are all but the Biſhops Curates in the exerciſe of it.] Anſw.</hi> 1. I ventured to deny that to <hi>Bag ſhaw</hi> who made it the Reaſon of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration: And I will yet deny it of ſome others, though not of you. If we are all but the <hi>Biſhops Curates;</hi> the <hi>Italian Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> were not ſo abſurd as they were made in making the <hi>Biſhops</hi> the <hi>Popes Curates.</hi> How eaſie ſhould I be, were I a <hi>Curate,</hi> could I believe that I have no more to anſwer for, than the <hi>Biſhop</hi> impoſed on me, and that he muſt anſwer for all the reſt. I ſuppoſe that the Office of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> of Chriſt is immediately Inſtituted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Scriptures, and that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> doth but Inveſt them in it, and that their work is their own, as properly as the <hi>Biſhop's</hi> is his own, and that his Precminence, maketh not him the <hi>Communicator</hi> of the Power to them as from himſelf, nor them to be his <hi>Curates.</hi> 2. And while I think that I can prove this very eaſily,

cenſure us not too deeply for not <hi>ſwearing to the Biſhops,</hi> if the ſence of it be, to make us his <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</hi> Not that I think my ſelf too good to be a Servant to the <hi>Biſhop's</hi> Coach man, but that I dare not ſubvert Chriſt's eſtabliſhed <hi>Church Orders.</hi>

Or did we ſpring out of their Loins, and muſt be ſilenced for ſuch <hi>Original ſin,</hi> derived from them that were no kin to us? 2. But where did the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> ſay it? You cite no Book or Speech of his; but cite <hi>Ruſhworth, p.</hi> 218. Where is no ſyllable of any ſuch matter, nor any where elſe that I can yet find. 3.

Therefore neither the <hi>Paſtors</hi> nor <hi>Peoples Relation,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the <hi>Churches,</hi> is not of the ſame ſort. 3. Where there are diſtinct <hi>Fundamenta vel ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones fundandi,</hi> there are diſtinct <hi>Relations:</hi> But <hi>here are distinct fundamenta, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> is, 1.

            <p>Now your Reaſon to the contrary (for your Affirmative) is, that <hi>Gradus non variat ſpeciem.</hi> To which my Anſwer being, that <hi>Quando va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riat aut finem proximum, ſeu terminum, vel funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum, vel relatum correlatum, variat relationis ſpeciem.</hi> But frequently <hi>Gradus materiae, variat finem proximum fundamentum, &amp;c. Ergo, &amp; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> needeth no proof; the <hi>Minor</hi> I cleared by the inſtance of a Ship, a Church, a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64641:66"/>
Spoon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where magnitude or parvity can make this difference. You tell me <hi>Relatives</hi> do not <hi>ſuſcipere magis &amp; minus. Anſw.</hi> The clean contrary is an uſual <hi>Maxim</hi> with <hi>Logicians:</hi> But that is ſo plain that it needs no diſpute; <hi>viz. Quoad ſubjectum (&amp; fundamentum aliquando) &amp; materiam correlati;</hi> It may be found in divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but not in degrees of matter uncapable of the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Form:</hi> But the <hi>forma Relativa</hi> doth not ſo vary; one is not <hi>magis vel minus haec relatio,</hi> than another. But if you will extend this to the Matter of the Subject, which is our Caſe, you do but (though miſtakingly) give away your Cauſe: For then every new Member maketh a new Church <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> (when you ſay) <hi>[This is only in reſpect of quantity;]</hi> You know that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Quantity non ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit magis &amp; minus,</hi> and ſo his Interpreters ſay, ſpeaking ſtrictly and not laxly: Therefore it's this you muſt mean as I do, while you would ſay ſomething that we may ſeem to differ. I told you, that <hi>different quantities in the ſubject may change the relations,</hi> which I think never man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that underſtood what a <hi>Relation</hi> was. And you feign me to ſay ſimply [That <hi>Magis &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus variant ſpeciem in relatives:]</hi> That you may have occaſion to ſay as I ſaid, under pretence of contradicting the ſame thing. But to my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, you ſay, <hi>That it is enough for your purpoſe that there is not a ſpecifick difference between a little Spoon or Dioceſs, and a great one.] Anſw.</hi> Say you ſo; our <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, <hi>Whether different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the ſubject may vary the ſpecies of Relations?</hi> Either you deny it, or you do not: If you do,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64641:66"/>
common Experience and Reaſon will ſhame your denial. I inſtanced in a <hi>Spoon,</hi> a <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>Troop, Regiment, Army,</hi> a <hi>Ship, &amp;c.</hi> Whereſoever the <hi>finis proximus</hi> (as in all Offices and Societies) is eſſential to the Relation, there no man of Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal acquaintance can make a doubt of it, but that certain Quantities or Degrees in the Subject may be ſo over great or over ſmall, as to be uncapable of that <hi>End,</hi> and conſequently of the <hi>Relation.</hi> I will not cenſure you to be ſo ignorant as to doubt of it; and if I do not, you force me to judge you ſo heedleſs or partial as to ſay ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the hiding of that truth which you do not doubt of: I ſay, that Degrees in the Subject or Correlate vary not the Species, but when they vary the <hi>ſpecifying end:</hi> ſome <hi>Relations</hi> are founded only in Actions <hi>paſt;</hi> as <hi>Pater &amp; filius</hi> in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Creator &amp; creaturae</hi> in Creation: And there the end following is not eſſential. But it is otherwiſe with thoſe Relations which conſiſt in an <hi>Authority, Obligation, undertaking of a future work,</hi> (as a <hi>Teacher, Phyſician, &amp;c.)</hi> where the <hi>Work</hi> as <hi>undertaken</hi> is the <hi>eſſential end.</hi> And you had here no better a ſhift then to diſſemble in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the other <hi>Inſtances;</hi> and to tell me, that <hi>[a great Spoon and a little one differ not</hi> ſpecie:] But doth that prove, that it may be <hi>in ſpecie</hi> a <hi>Spoon,</hi> if if be as big as a <hi>Ship,</hi> or <hi>in ſpecie</hi> a <hi>Ship,</hi> if it be no bigger than a <hi>Spoon:</hi> Since you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your own deceit, which is by transferring the <hi>Queſtion, are ad nomen,</hi> and then by chooſing Inſtances <hi>de nomine,</hi> where the Name is never u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>generically,</hi> but only for one <hi>ſpecies.</hi> The name of a <hi>Spoon</hi> is never taken for a Ship, <hi>&amp; contra:</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:64641:67"/>
And therefore to ſay, that a little Spoon and a greater differ not <hi>ſpeeie,</hi> is but to ſay, that the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> is <hi>the ſame,</hi> as being found in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of ſubject. But a Society, a Church, yea a Dioceſs, are names (generical or analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous) which may be and are applyed to various Species. The univerſal Church headed by Chriſt, is no more of the ſame ſpecies with a particular Church, than a Kingdom, and a Corporation in that Kingdom are. I uſe not words to <hi>hide things,</hi> but to render them <hi>intelligible.</hi> A thouſand Schools combined under a general Schoolmaſter, or an hundred Colledges making up one <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> are not of the ſame ſpecies with one School, and one Colledge, though in the great remote end they both agree. But you fly to that poor ſhift of bidding me <hi>take heed of abſurd and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Suppoſitions, not argumentative, &amp;c.]</hi> As if you had ſhewed any abſurdity in theſe Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Or as if plain undeniable Inſtances had no place in Arguments or Anſwers, but were ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Suppoſitions; and he that would ſay, that a Kingdom is greater than a Family, and the King than a Maſter or Major, uſed a ridiculous Suppoſition. Juſt thus the poor <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are perſwaded by your <hi>Pithonalogy,</hi> to <hi>ſubſcribe, ſwear, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>I ſeem</hi> (you ſay) <hi>to aſſert this my ſelf,</hi> by ſaying, <hi>there is a ſmall difference between Biſhop</hi> Uſher's <hi>Model and the preſent.] Anſw.</hi> It's tedious diſputing with one that muſt have ſtill another Writing to help him to underſtand that which he will firſt confute, yea and ſeemeth not <hi>willing</hi> to underſtand. It is a fallacy, <hi>A dicte ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid ad dictum ſimpliciter:</hi> I only askt you,

               <hi>What Farthing doth it take from their Eſtates? What Title from their Honour, Power, Negative voice:</hi> (even their <hi>Lordſhips and Parliament places.)</hi> But is this the <hi>Queſtion?</hi> We then laboured to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>unſatisfied Miniſters,</hi> that not only Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi>'s Reduction, but even the King's Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration about <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Affairs,</hi> had changed the very <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Prelacy</hi> without any of thoſe Abatements. If you would know, it is by one word <hi>[Conſent]</hi> reſtoring the inferiour Paſtors and Churches, though not to their <hi>Integrals,</hi> yet to their <hi>Eſſentials.</hi> And we were ſo inclinable to Conformity, that on that <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> we had Conformed, had but that <hi>Declaration</hi> ſtood: (though ſome of the <hi>Sects</hi> are of another mind, whom you Arguments would confirm:) For we judge, that a <hi>Biſhop</hi> of one only Church conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of five hundred or a thouſand Chappels or Congregations that are ſtrictly no Churches (as having no <hi>Biſhops)</hi> doth <hi>ſpecifically</hi> differ from a <hi>Biſhop</hi> of a thouſand Churches, which have every one their proper <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and ſo he is truly an <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> or <hi>General Biſhop.</hi> But I am not to trouble you with this.</p>
            <p>And now how impertinent was it, to bid me <hi>[Rub up my Philoſophy</hi> about <hi>Maximum quod ſic &amp; minimum quod non.]</hi> Know you not, that the common uſe of thoſe <hi>Writers</hi> are to intimate the ſame thing that I am ſaying againſt you; That there is a ſubjective <hi>maximum &amp; minimum,</hi> which only are capable of the <hi>relative form?</hi> But I am next turned to <hi>Voſſius de invoc. ſanct.</hi> of which he hath there diſputed, and one <hi>Hiſtor.

I tell you, that ſo far as <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Chancellors</hi> are the Kings Officers to Govern the Church <hi>circa ſacra</hi> by the Sword, we will ſwear and perform Obedience to them under the <hi>King,</hi> in <hi>licitis &amp; honeſtis.</hi> But I told you, they that take them for the <hi>Uſurpers</hi> of <hi>Spiritual power,</hi> will eaſily prove it to be lawful to ſwear Obedience to Uſurpers <hi>in licitis &amp; honeſtis;</hi> will you deny that. 3. And I told you that it is another <hi>Oath</hi> that is <hi>impoſed</hi> on us to take. But did you well to ſay, <hi>You produced the words of Ignatius,</hi> to prove the antiquity of <hi>ſwearing</hi> to <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who ſaith not a ſyllable of any ſuch thing? And untruly ſay, <hi>I took no notice of it,</hi> when I told you that <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> mentioned not <hi>Oaths,</hi> but only <hi>actual Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:64641:69"/>
This is <hi>no notice</hi> with you: But do you not know how late it was before <hi>ſwearing Obedience</hi> to <hi>Biſhops</hi> came into the Church, and by what ſort of men, and to what end and effect.</p>
            <p>§. 52. Your talk of <hi>Cartwright</hi> confirmeth me of the vanity of the <hi>Hypocrites reward,</hi> the praiſe of men; there being nothing ſo falſe which may not by ſome men be ſaid of them with boldeſt confidence. If <hi>Cochleus</hi> or his like, do but ſay, That <hi>Luther</hi> learned of the <hi>Devil;</hi> that <hi>Calvin</hi> was a <hi>ſtigmatized Sodomite, &amp;c.</hi> all their Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers can ever after ſay, <hi>It is in Print.</hi> So Mr. <hi>S. P.</hi> (ſome body) <hi>Printed this</hi> you ſay. And <hi>Heylin</hi> ſaith, <hi>He promiſed.</hi> What? juſt the ſame, or to the ſame ſenſe, as I told you, I voluntarily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, when I might (by the <hi>Kings Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi> have choſen, meerly becauſe I would have them know our minds and peaceable reſolutions. I told you why he that can promiſe to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> and <hi>ſwear</hi> the <hi>Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation</hi> of all in that <hi>Liturgy, Government, &amp;c.</hi> which he liveth peaceably under. But this is nothing to you; if <hi>Cartwright</hi> Conformed, firſt, Prove it by <hi>credible History.</hi> 2. Why then could the great Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> procure no more liberty for him, than an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> in <hi>Warwick,</hi> and no Church. 3. I have lived in <hi>Coventry,</hi> and been oft in <hi>Warwick,</hi> and know by all credible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Neighbours, that it's falſe, and no ſuch thing as his Conformity was there dream'd of, any further than I Conform. 4. Why did he never declare it to the World, nor retract his Writings. 5. Your <hi>Heylin</hi>'s own words intimate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; (though I muſt tell you, I owe as little

               <p>§ 1. <hi>COntending</hi> though Defenſive, and made neceſſary by Accuſers, is an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant work: As I would chooſe a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before a Defenſive War, were it for no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter intereſt than my own; ſo I would chooſe to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64641:74"/>
be in Print proclaimed an Heretick, Schiſmatick, Atheiſt, or any thing, rather than be at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing labour of a Confutation of all Accuſers, were it not for a higher intereſt than mine: For though we <hi>muſt contend for the Faith,</hi> yet the <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord muſt not needleſly ſtrive,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 24, 25. And experience tells us, the good ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome anſwereth the bad effects.</p>
               <p>§ 2. And there are few that call me to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Account, that I anſwer leſs willingly than Mr. <hi>Cheney:</hi> becauſe his Accuſations are ſuch groſs Miſtakes, that I cannot Anſwer them in the gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt manner, according to truth, without opening that which will bring him lower in the Readers eſteem than I deſire; and I much fear, will be to himſelf a temptation which he will hardly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, as I ſee by this his 2d Book. Had he that was my familiar Neighbour thought meet to have ſpoken with me, before his Publications, I am paſt doubt that I could have convinced him of multitudes of Untruths and Errours, ſo as to have prevented ſuch a publication of them; for in private he would eaſilier have born the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of them, than in the hearing of the World, (which he has choſen.) But whereas ſome caſt away his Book, as a fardel of Dotage and ſhameleſs Lyes, I muſt remember ſuch, that I am confident he wrote no falſhoods with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe knowingly to deceive; and therefore they are not ſtrictly Lyes, but as <hi>raſh untruths</hi> are ſuch in a larger ſenſe, which <hi>ignorant men</hi> aſſert for want of due tryal. It is a great errour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value ſuch poor frail ignorant men as we all are: Mr. <hi>Ch.</hi> and I have both over-valued one another;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64641:74"/>
and this errour now we have both eſcaped, but not laid by our Chriſtian love. And as God will not take Mens Diſeaſes for their Sins, his bodily temper is to me a great excuſe of his <hi>ſtrong confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent miſtakes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 3. The very Introductory Preface of his Books diſowning Cruelty and uncharitable divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Impoſitions, enableth me to forgive him the multitude of raſh untruths and ſlanders: and inſtead of a <hi>Mentiris,</hi> I ſhall put but a <hi>Putares</hi> or <hi>Non-putares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have juſt ſuch a task in dealing with Mr. <hi>Ch.</hi> as with one that is hard of hearing: when I ſpeak to ſuch a one, that heareth but one half, and miſ-heareth the reſt, he anſwereth me as he heard: and when I tell him his miſtake, his laſt reply is <hi>[I thought you had ſaid thus and thus:]</hi> but if I ſhould diſpute a whole day with ſuch a man, I ſhould be ſharply cenſured if I printed the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and told the World how <hi>many hundred times</hi> the man miſ-heard, and ſo miſtook me. And I fear neither he himſelf, nor the Reader that valueth his time, would thank me for ſuch exerciſe of my Arithmetick with Mr. <hi>Cheney.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 4. For his Preface I thank him: It tells me, that all our Accuſers do it not in meer Malignity: and that he hath a few ſteps further to tumble, before he come to the bottom of the hill. His Book conſiſteth partly of a handſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcourſe for Prelacie, and other Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Humane Invention; and partly of a new &amp; ſingular Doctrine about Church-Forms; &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a critical diſcharge of his fancy, and unpack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his preparations againſt the Independant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,

and Church-Form; and partly in detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my many Atheiſtical, Infidel, Impious Errours, by which he ſuppoſeth I am deceiving the world; and partly n a multitude of falſhoods of me (and others) in matter of fact; and partly (I hope an ignorant) plea for the Pope.

               <p n="1">I. That Jeſus Chriſt is Head over all things to the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22, 23.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That the Moſaical Law, as ſuch, never bound other Kingdoms, and is ceaſed, with their Commonwealth, and is abrogated by Chriſt, and that he as King of the Church, hath eſtabliſhed a ſufficient Law for all that is univerſally neceſſary for Doctrine, Worſhip, and Church-order or Government: and was faithful in all his houſe as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and Commiſſioned his Apoſtles to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple Nations, Baptizing them and teaching them what Chriſt himſelf had commanded them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That he ſetled the Miniſtry and Church-Form before he made any Magiſtrate Chriſtian,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64641:75"/>
and that no Magiſtrate hath power to change them.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That what his Apoſtles did by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Spirit, he did by them.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That Church-Forms being ſo Inſtituted and Conſtituted, he hath not left them ſo much to the will of Man, as he hath done the Forms of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. That Chriſt hath <hi>One Univerſal Church,</hi> of which he is the onely Head and Law-giver, and no Vicar perſonal or collective, as <hi>one Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſon</hi> or power: of which profeſſed believers and conſenters in Baptiſm are the viſible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and ſincere Believers and Conſenters the Spiritual ſaved Members.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. That the <hi>World</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> are not all one; nor Heathens and Infidels the ſame with Chriſtians, nor any parts of the Church proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. That Chriſts Miniſters firſt work to which they were Commiſſioned, was not on the Church or any Member of it, but the Infidel world to gather them into a Church; and the firſt Baptized perſon was not Baptized into a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent Church; but the Church exiſting, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm entereth men into it.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. That the firſt Baptizer was no Paſtor of ſuch an exiſtent Church, but an Organical Miniſter to gather a Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p n="10">X. That though at Baptiſm one may enter into the Univerſal and a particular Church, yet Baptiſme <hi>qua talis</hi> entereth us onely into the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, being our Chriſtening or Covenant-uniting to the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64641:76"/>
XI. That a Paſtor in the Scripture and uſual ſenſe, is a Relate to <hi>Oves</hi> the Sheep or Flock, and not to Infidels: And a Miniſtry to Infidels, and an Epiſcopacy or Paſtorſhip of the flock, are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent notions: but if any will uſe the terms other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, we contend not <hi>de nomine,</hi> though you call him a Paſtor of Infidels, or what elſe you can deviſe.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. To explain my ſelf, when I mention a Biſhop or Paſtor, I mean the Biſhop or Paſtor of a Church: and I take not Heathens for the Church.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. I believe that in this Univerſal Church are thouſands of particular Churches, and this by Chriſts Inſtitution.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. I believe that there is no particular Church or Chriſtian on earth, who is not (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively as Viſible or Myſtical) a part of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Church.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. As every worſhipping Aſſembly is a Church in a larger ſenſe, ſo a Church in a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſenſe is eſſentially conſtituted of the Paſtor and People, or the Sacerdotal guiding and the guided parts: and of ſuch a Church it is that I am ſpeaking.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. As ſuch meeting <hi>in tranſitu</hi> are an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporate tranſient Church,</hi> ſo fixed <hi>Cohabitants</hi> ought to be a Church accordingly fixed, related to each others as ſuch for longer than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent meeting.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. Every ſuch Political fixed Church, ſhould conſiſt of a Paſtor (at leaſt) accordingly fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to a cohabiting people, and as <hi>their Paſtor</hi> more ſpecially related by obligation and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64641:76"/>
to them, than to ſtrangers or neighbour Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. He is not bound to do that for all, as he is for them, nor may go into other Paſtors Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with equal power, nor officiate where he pleaſe.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. If there be no Church but the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, than there is neither Parochial, Dioceſan, or National, nor are Aſſemblies Churches. Nor is our King the Royal Governour of any Church: for of the Univerſal he is not.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. Chriſtian Princes muſt do their beſt to ſettle faithful Paſtors in all Churches, that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of Chriſt, but not againſt them. But as they muſt do their beſt that all their Subjects may have good Phyciſians, School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, Wives, or Husbands, Servants, Dyet, Cloathing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but yet are not truſted by office to chooſe all theſe for every one, and impoſe them on Diſſenters, becauſe the ſame God that made <hi>Kingly power,</hi> did <hi>firſt make perſonal and paternal power,</hi> which Kings cannot diſſolve: ſo every man is ſo nearly concerned for his own Salvation, more than for Wife, Servant, Dyet, Phyciſian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that though he muſt thankfully accept of all the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers lawful help, he is ſtill the moſt obliged choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer. Nor is it any part of the office of a King, to chooſe and impoſe on every Subject a Guide or Paſtor, to whom only he ſhall truſt the Paſtoral conduct of his Soul, any more than a Phyſician or a Tutor for him.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. Pariſh-bounds are not of Primitive or Divine Inſtitution: but cohabitation or propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is a needful qualification of ſetled Members, <hi>gratia finis:</hi> And Pariſh-bounds are a uſeful hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64641:77"/>
determination, according to the general Rules, <hi>Do all to edification and in order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">XXI. No one is a Church-member merely becauſe he dwelleth in the Pariſh; for unbaptized Infidels, Heathens, Atheiſts, may dwell there.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. Nor is a ſtranger a Church-member for coming into the Aſſembly; for ſuch, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, or Jews, Mahometans, may come in.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. A Paſtor oweth more care and duty to his flock, than to the reſt of the world (as a Phyſician to his Hoſpital.) Therefore he muſt know who they are, better than by knowing that they dwell in the Pariſh; nor may he Baptize them, or give them the Lords Supper, only becauſe he ſeeth them in the Aſſembly or in the Pariſh: elſe Jews and Heathens muſt have it.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. Nor is he to give it to every one that demandeth it: for ſo may Jews and Heathens, that take it in ſcorn, or for by-ends.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. Yet a Chriſtian having a valid Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate that he is ſuch, hath right to tranſient Communion with any Church of Chriſt where he cometh: but for order, the antient Churches uſed not to receive them without ſome Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates from the Churches that they came from, leſt Hereticks and Excommunicates, unknown perſons, ſhould be every where received.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. No man can be an (adult) Chriſtian without ſignified conſent: nor a ſtated member of any particular Church, without ſuch conſent: no, nor a lawful tranſient Communicant without conſent. For ſo great benefits none but conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have right to, nor can ſuch relations be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe contracted.</p>
               <p n="27">
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64641:77"/>
XXVII. Conſent not ſignified nor known, is none to the Church.</p>
               <p n="28">XXVIII. A man may be obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that doth not: but that makes no man a Chriſtian or member of the Univerſal Church; elſe Millions of Infidels and Heathens are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; And ſo it maketh no one a member of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, that he is <hi>obliged</hi> to be one: nor am I a Paſtor over any men as a Church, becauſe they are obliged to take me for their Paſtor, no more than that is a Husband, Wife, Servant, who is obliged to be ſo, and will not. To ſay that I am a Paſtor to Heathens as a Church, is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: or that I am their Paſtor as my ſpecial Chriſtian flock, and particular Church-members that conſent not.</p>
               <p n="29">XXIX. But the ſame man that liveth among ſuch, may be to conſenting Chriſtians a Paſtor; and to Refuſers, Infidels, or Heathens, a Teacher. The Church ever diſtinguiſhed the <hi>Audientes</hi> and <hi>Catechumene Candidates,</hi> from the <hi>Fideles,</hi> who were the Members of the Church.</p>
               <p n="30">XXX. No Paſtor or people ſhould impoſe any Covenant on any adult to be Chriſtened, but conſent to be Chriſtians ſignified by Baptiſm; nor on any in order to tranſient Communion among ſtrangers, but juſt notice of their Chriſtianity and underſtanding conſent to that Communion: nor on any in order to their being the ſtated Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this or that flock and particular Church, but due notice of their Chriſtianity, and of their underſtanding conſent to what is eſſential to ſuch members; that is, to the relation as eſſentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the correlate and ends.</p>
               <p n="31">
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:64641:78"/>
XXXI. No one ſhould be obliged by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to continue one year or Month in the ſtation of that particular relation: becauſe they know not when Gods providence may oblige them to remove or change it.</p>
               <p n="32">XXXII. Though the Peoples conſent be neceſſary to their relation, their <hi>Election</hi> of the Paſtor (which ſignifieth the firſt determination who ſhall be the man) is not abſolutely neceſſary, though of old ſo thought. An <hi>after-Conſent</hi> may ſerve <hi>ad eſſe relationis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="33">XXXIII. Much leſs is it neceſſary that the people chooſe who ſhall be ordained a Miniſter unfixed, and only of the Univerſal Church.</p>
               <p n="34">XXXIV. 1. Mutual conſent of the duely qualified Ordained and Ordainer, determineth who ſhall be a Miniſter in the Church Univerſal; as conſent of the Colledge and the Candidate do who ſhall be the Licenſed Phyſician. 2. The Peoples conſent and the Miniſters inſtituted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine who ſhall be the Paſtor of this particular Flock or Church. 3. The King determineth whom he will tolerate, countenance and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p n="35">XXXV. Though a man may be Ordained but once to the Miniſtry unfixed in the Univerſal Church, (to which I ſaid the Peoples conſent is not neceſſary) yet may he be oft removed from one particular Church to another, on juſt cauſe, to which the peoples conſent (if not Election) is ſtill neceſſary. Though to avoid Ambition, the old Canons forbad Biſhops to remove.</p>
               <p n="36">XXXVI. It's lawful to be ordained <hi>ſine titulo</hi> only to the Miniſtry in general; but in ſettled
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64641:78"/>
Churches it is uſually inconvenient: And he that is ordained to a fixed Church, doth at once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Miniſter in the univerſal Church (and may act as a Miniſter, and not as a Layman, when called elſewhere) and alſo a fixed Miniſter of a particular Church; even as he that is baptized into a particular Church, is a member of both: Though Baptiſm and Ordination <hi>qua tales</hi> enter but into the Univerſal.</p>
               <p n="37">XXXVII. It is not this or that mode of ſignification of conſent that is neceſſary to either relation of Paſtor or Flock; but <hi>Conſent ſignified intelligibly:</hi> where Laws and Cuſtome order it that actual ordinary attendance in publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and communion, and ſubmiſſion to neceſſary miniſtration, ſhall be the ſignification, all that ſo do expreſs conſent by it. And therefore our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Pariſh-Aſſembling and Communion, being expreſs conſent to the mutual relation, have that which is neceſſary <hi>ad eſſe</hi> to true Churches; and they ſlander them that ſay, they are not ſuch. But <hi>ad melius eſſe</hi> more may oft-times be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; 1. Becauſe that is the beſt means, which is beſt fitted to the end: But the end of <hi>Signes</hi> being <hi>Notification,</hi> that is, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the beſt which is moſt notifying; as that is the beſt Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which is moſt ſignificant and intelligible. Why ſhould playing in the dark, or dealing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, be preferred in the greateſt things? 2. It oft falls out, that ſome that live in the Pariſh are known Church-Papiſts, Church-Atheiſts &amp; Infidels, &amp; will tell in their meetings to their companions, <hi>[I believe not the words of the Pariſh-Prieſt: It is his Trade to talk for gain: I will do what the Law
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64641:79"/>
requires of me, for my ſafety; but I will have no more to do with him, nor do I take him for a true Paſtor, that hath any Authority but by Law, nor for any Paſtor to me.]</hi> And 3. there are many Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Schiſmaticks, engaged Members of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches; who yet to avoid ſuffering, will do that in the Pariſh-Church, which the Law requireth. 4. And the Antient Churches uſed expreſs Conſent, yea and Election. So for the Miniſter; he is no Paſtor without his ſignified conſent: but actual Miniſtration may be ſuch a ſignification. This is enough to reconcile the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about Church-covenants.</p>
               <p n="38">XXXVIII. They that rail againſt a more expreſs conſent in caſes truly dubious, as if it were tyranny and deſtructive to Chriſtianity, do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that if the King and Law commanded ſuch a thing they commanded Tyrannically that which deſtroyeth Chriſtianity; and contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they ſay that Rulers may make vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous orders of Church-governours, and determine of undetermined Modes.</p>
               <p n="39">XXXIX. As it is not needful and uſual to ſet up a <hi>Coordinate Imperium artificum vel Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorum in Imperio Civili;</hi> ſo it ſeemeth alſo of an <hi>Imperium Religioſum.</hi> The firſt Queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt hath Inſtituted ſuch: The ſecond, whether he hath given power to Men to make it. There is not in any Kingdom that I hear of, (but ſomewhat towards it in <hi>China)</hi> ſuch a Society of Phyſicians, Aſtronomers, Navigators, Lawyers, Schoolmaſters, Philoſophers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who ſet up a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Empire or Government, that ſhall have all degrees of ſelf-governing power as a National
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64641:79"/>
Socity, with one Supreme, either Monarchical, Ariſtocratical, or Democratical Head, according to the order of Civil-government: Nor doth any reproach Schools, Colledges, Hoſpitals, or any tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Societies, that they are confuſed, Independent, and ungoverned, becauſe they have no common Governour but God and the King, nor any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Governour, but the Principal, or Maſter and Fellows of the Society; nor any National aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, beſides their ſubjection to one King, and their voluntary correſpondence for concord and mutual aſſiſtance with one another. And much leſs is there any Co-ordinate, Political Regiment of any of theſe through all the world, under one viſible humane Head, perſonal or collective. And yet many think that there is ſuch a Society and Regiment for Religion; National ſay ſome, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſay others: That all that will ſerve God and be ſaved, muſt be under one Co-ordinate power over all the Kingdom, or World, beſides Chriſt and the Supreme Magiſtrate: and they contend whether this power be Monarchical or Ariſtocratical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am ſo far Independent, as to think that Chriſt hath Inſtituted no ſuch Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal or National Power and Head of Religion: but that 1. his own Univerſal Kingdom: 2. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches under their ſeveral Biſhops and Teachers: 3. And Synods for concord and mutual help: 4. And Chriſtian Magiſtrates to rule all by the Sword: 5. With the improvement of Mens eminent gifts and opportunities, that theſe be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt I doubt not: 6. And whether ſome ſhould ſucceed the Apoſtles (excepting their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary powers) in having a viſiting, inſtructing,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64641:80"/>
ordering care of many Churches and their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Teachers, I confeſs my ſelf uncertain; and therefore will never ſtrive againſt ſuch, nor deny due obedience to them, who ſhew a true call to ſuch an employment. Nay, if Chriſt have made no ſuch Inſtitution; yet 1. if the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, 2. or the Churches by conſent, chooſe ſome faithful Miniſters to ſuch a power, onely to direct, inſtruct, guide, admoniſh, reprove, exhort the Biſhops and Teachers of the particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, without any other force than the Apoſtles uſed, and not deſtroying any of their proper power and duty, or that Church-order which the Apoſtles ſetled; I am no oppoſer of any ſuch, though my uncertainty diſables me from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing and ſwearing to the right of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The <hi>Scots</hi> themſelves, even by <hi>Knox</hi>'s conſent, ſet up Super-intendents over many Churches <hi>(John Spotſwood</hi> Super-intendent of <hi>Lothian,</hi> and ſo others.) And the power of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, Principal or Rector of a Colledge of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, Philoſophers, or Divines, doth not make him of any other Order or ſpecies of Office and Profeſſion than the reſt. But if any affirm more than this, I will <hi>learn,</hi> but cannot yet ſwear or ſubſcribe it.</p>
               <p n="40">XL. Thoſe that are for the obligation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> order, I have fully ſpoke to in my firſt <hi>Plea for Peace.</hi> Thoſe that are only for the power of man to make ſuch ſeveral Orders or Ranks of Governours in the Church, as are in Armies, and Kingdoms, 1. Muſt tell us what ſort of power may be given them: 2. And who muſt give it. And 1. No men can Inſtitute a power of the <hi>ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:64641:80"/>
or <hi>another ſpecies</hi> from that which we call the <hi>Sacred Miniſtry,</hi> or as the Fathers, the <hi>Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal,</hi> but what is <hi>ſubordinate</hi> about the <hi>Accidentals</hi> of Religion and the Church. 1. Not the <hi>ſame ſpecies,</hi> becauſe it is Inſtituted by God already: No Man can create a creature already created. 2. Not of <hi>another ſupra-ordinate</hi> or <hi>co-ordinate:</hi> for 1. they can prove no power given them to do it: 2. And that were to accuſe Chriſt of inſufficient doing his undertaken work, and being leſs faithful in his houſe than <hi>Moſes:</hi> 3. And it will infer Mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of a new co-ordinate Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or Religious Miniſtration: for the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>word and Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>Keys,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready appointed by Chriſt: And the Office or <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> is ſpecified by the work and <hi>terminus;</hi> and a new Office hath new work. But in the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Religious Miniſtration, there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of accidentals and circumſtances; and <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>conſenting</hi> Churches may give men power <hi>in thoſe</hi> accordingly. But not to forbid what Chriſt commanded, nor deſtroy the works and power of his Inſtitution. And if they that are for other <hi>ſuperiour or co-ordinate ſpecies</hi> of Church-power, beſides what is afore-granted, ſay that <hi>it is a lawful humane Ordinance:</hi> 1. Thoſe that ſay, <hi>Princes</hi> only may make it, confeſs the Church had none that was lawful for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years. And they muſt prove the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. Thoſe that ſay the <hi>Inferiour Biſhops</hi> made it by conſent; 1. feign Inferiours to have power to make a power above their own, (which is more than for Presbyters to ordain their like.) 2. Why may not Archbiſhops then make Patriarks, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64641:81"/>
they a Pope, <hi>ad ſummum aſcendendo?</hi> 3. They muſt prove their power; and that they are ſo far equal to Apoſtles, (who yet were but to teach the Nations what Chriſt commanded them; which theſe Men know not but by the Scripture.) 4. What Man maketh, Man may unmake. And how came we to be leſs free than our Anceſtors that made ſuch Offices?</p>
               <p n="41">XLI. In my Book of Concord where this is granted, yet I ſay, that let Church-Patriarchs, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans, Primates, Archbiſhops, or Dioceſans, like ours that have no Biſhops under them, be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo probably maintained to be lawful, yea, and deſirable; yet the uniting in them by conſent and approbation, will never become the terms or way of Univerſal Concord, which I have fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; even all that is true and good, will never be the terms of Univerſal Concord, nor juſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Communion; much leſs that which hath ſo much matter of doubt, and great ſuſpition of evil. But I will live in Chriſtian love, peace, and ſubmiſſion my ſelf, on terms uncapable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon concord, or my own approbation of the things as impoſed or done by all others.</p>
               <p n="42">XLII. Lay-Chancellours may do what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to a Magiſtrate, but not uſe the Church-Keyes, nor be the Church-Judges of Mens Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, becauſe Chriſt hath Inſtituted the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Office for it.</p>
               <p n="43">XLIII. A Church is <hi>Ens Politicum</hi> (in the ſenſe in hand) and the form of it is Relative, in the predicament of Relation.</p>
               <p n="44">XLIV. The parts of the Univerſal Church are ſimilar and diſſimilar, more ſimple or more
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64641:81"/>
compound. And the word <hi>[whole]</hi> applyed to a part, diſproveth not its being a part of the whole Chriſtian world or Church. A whole hand, foot, head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is part of a whole Body; and a whole Body part of a whole Man, and a whole Man part of a whole Family, and a whole Family part of a whole ſtreet, and that of a whole City, and that of a whole County or Kingdom: A whole Colledge of a whole Univerſity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſave Souls and Atomes, are compounds.</p>
               <p n="45">XLV. When we call all the Chriſtian world <hi>[The Catholick Church]</hi> and call <hi>e. g. Hippo [A or the Catholick Church]</hi> the word <hi>[Catholick]</hi> and <hi>[The]</hi> are not <hi>univocal:</hi> In the later we mean on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>[The Church at</hi> Hippo] which holds the true Catholick Faith, and is a true part of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church in the firſt ſenſe. <hi>Penuria nominum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaria reddit aequivoca.</hi>

The formal Eſſence of a Colledge, is divers from that of an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; and of a Family from a Corporation, or City; and that from a Kingdom.

my Conviction againſt himſelf and them, that their Conformity is ſo far from being the neceſſary Cement, that it is utterly deſtructive of it, as ſo impoſed: and that it muſt be on few plain neceſſary things, that common concord muſt be held, or we muſt have none. Mr.</hi> Ch. <hi>thinks me one who may be endured in the Miniſtry, and I think ſo by him; and yet how far eaſier and plainer than our Controverſies of Conformity, are thoſe things in which we differ to the height of his following Accuſations? If none ſhould be endured that cannot Covenant, Swear, Subſcribe, Declare and Practice, as is required, how much leſs can ſuch as he and I be endured in one Church, if we differ as he ſaith we do?

                  <hi>Pag. 3. [The ſeveral Congregations and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of Paſtors and People</hi> throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are not limbs and parcels of a Church, but they are ſo many Churches—conſiſting of a Paſtor Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, and people governed, joyning together in publick worſhip—It is called <hi>[the Church of</hi> England] as all the Chriſtian Paſtors and people throughout the world, are called the Univerſal Church—One Church, of which Chriſt is the tranſcendent Head—I do not ſee but it is proper to call all the Chriſtian Paſtors and people of <hi>England—</hi>One Church.<hi>—P. 6.</hi> Chriſt is the Head of the Church of <hi>England,—</hi>and under Chriſt all the Pariſh-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are ſubordinate Guides and Rulers of their Flocks reſpectively.<hi>—P. 7.</hi> Some are as Colonels of Regiments, others as Captains of Troops; the Body
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64641:83"/>
is but One, the Members many.<hi>—P. 13.</hi> The New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament ſaith,—The Churches of <hi>Galatia, Gal. 1. 2.</hi> the Churches of <hi>Judea, Aſia,—</hi>Yet One body.—All the faithful make One heavenly City,—one Church of the firſt born;—ſo that Gods Church on Earth is Many Churches, and yet but One Church.—(Do you not think now that we are agreed? But hear him judge himſelf.) <hi>P. 15.</hi> I will ſhew one common Errour or miſtake in multitudes of our able Divines,—That thoſe we call particular Churches, are counted Parts and Members of the Church Univerſal. This I deny,—Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> makes the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> to be an integral part of the Church Univerſal,—as a Troop of an Army, or a City of a Kingdom. So the Independents. I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw this Errour by this Argument. One and the ſame thing cannot be both a Body and a Member, a whole and a part, a ſociety and one ſingle perſon.—But that which we call a ſingle or particular Church, is not a Member but a Body; it is not a limb or part of a Church, but a whole and entire Church,—It hath a whole within it.<hi>—London</hi> is not a Member of <hi>England,</hi> but a City and aggregation of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. It's no leſs than a flat contradiction in terms,—what Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Medul. l. 1. c. 32.</hi> that a particular Church <hi>eſt Membrum ex aggregatione variorum Membrorum ſingulorum compoſitum,</hi> contrary to common reaſon and plain Scripture.<hi>—P. 18.</hi> A bare Member in the Body hath no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but acteth by mere natural life and appetite, and is not endued with rational authority, nor can be capable of any.—That which we call a ſingle Church, is a Catholick or Univerſal Church. It hath an Univerſal Head. To be a Chriſtian, is to be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64641:83"/>
of an univerſal impartial ſpirit;—where there is an All, there is an Univerſal.—But every ſingle Church hath an All within it, the Paſtor and all his flock.—The Church Univerſal and particular, do only differ as to place and number;—A Church of godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and people in <hi>France, Holland,—</hi>and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> differ but as to place.—Every Church (of Chriſtians) muſt needs be a Church Univerſal; not a limb or member of another Church, but a true body, or entire Chriſtian ſociety.<hi>—P. 20.</hi> Chriſts Body is One: not as one is oppoſed to Multitude—but to diviſion, contrariety, and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§ 4. P. 21.</hi> This leads me to ſhew the unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of another part of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Doctrine, and ſome others with him: He ſaith, [There are two eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially different Policies or Forms of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts Inſtitution, never to be altered by man: <hi>1.</hi> The Form of the Univerſal Church as Headed by Chriſt himſelf, which all Chriſtians own as they are Chriſtians, in their Baptiſm. <hi>2.</hi> Particular Churches headed by their particular Biſhops or Paſtors, and are parts of the Univerſal, as a Troop of an Army, or a City of a Kingdom.—And he defines the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church to be, <hi>The univerſality of Baptized Chriſtians, headed by Chriſt himſelf.</hi> Theſe his ſayings contain many Errours; I will firſt note them out, and then confute and prove them to be Errours. <hi>1.</hi> It is an Errour in the art of defining, to put in thoſe words, <hi>[Headed by Chriſt himſelf.] 2.</hi> It is another Errour to define the Univerſal Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Guides and Miniſters, as one eſſential conſtituent part. <hi>3.</hi> It is another Errour to ſay, that the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, and Churches particular, differ eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially. <hi>1.</hi> It is an Errour in the art of deſining to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64641:84"/>
ſay,—Headed by Chriſt himſelf] that's ſuppoſed, but need not be in the definition. He finds fault himſelf with ſuch a defect in the definition of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church. Grant them to be Chriſtians, and you grant they own Chriſt.<hi>—2.</hi> It is an Errour to define the Univerſal Church without Paſtors,—So doth the Aſſemblies Confeſſion, and Mr. <hi>Hudſon—</hi>His definition of the Church without Paſtors, is, as if he defined a living healthful man, without a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, liver or lungs.<hi>—P. 24. 3.</hi> If there be an eſſential difference between Church and Church, what then is the difference between the Church and the World! Heaven and Hell! the righteous and the wicked!—How can any man know which is the right Church? We ſhall never be able to confute Popery nor Infidelity by this Doctrine: For this Doctrine ſuppoſeth two eſſentially different Churches: The U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Church without Paſtors, and of this Chriſt is Head himſelf: Particular Churches, of which Chriſt is no Head, but particular Paſtors are the Heads.—By this Doctrine the ſame thing ſhall be contrary to it ſelf.—Chriſts Church in this world is but one! And can one and the ſame thing have two different Eſſences, beings, and definitions? <hi>Quae conveniunt uno tertio,</hi> &amp;c. But the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and particular agree <hi>in uno tertio.</hi> They ſtand on one foundation, are directed by one rule, quickned by one ſpirit; an addition of homogeneous Particles makes no eſſential difference. It will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily infer, that God is contrary to himſelf, and that the eſſentiating principles of Church holineſs, order and government, are black and white, darkneſs and light,<hi>—P. 25.</hi> If this opinion ſtand, Religion cannot ſtand, Two eſſentially different Forms of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64641:84"/>
Churches, will infer two ſorts of Holineſs, the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the other, (yet) <hi>ſubordinata non pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> If Chriſt ſet up two repugnant, or eſſentially different Church-Forms, he is not the Saviour, but the deceiver of the world. (O dreadful!)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§ 5. P. 92.</hi> A word more <hi>ad hominem</hi> of that opinion, That particular Churches are parts of the Univerſal, as a Troop is of an Army, or a City of a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>This is Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> opinion: why then do you blame the turning all the Pariſh-Churches into Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, and making them to be but parts of the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan, as a Troop is of an Army, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who ſees not that your Doctrine doth the ſame that you condemn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If they are but parts and Members of another Church, (the Univerſal) then they are not Churches.—It is not unlikely but you can find ſomewhat to ſay in defence of this your ſelf-contradicting Doctrine; but I believe it will match your wit, were it ten times more, and prove too hard for you. Look to it; if your diſputations againſt Prelacie ſtand, down goes this main aſſertion of yours. If your diſputations againſt Prelacie be found to have a hollow and falſe bottom, then you have made you work for repentance, you have greatly injured the Church of God, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and have deceived a great many. Look what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh the Pope to be to all the Paſtors, Churches, and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans through the world, <hi>That do you make this which you call the Church Univerſal: for you ſay that particular Churches, as headed by their reſpective Biſhops and Paſtors, are parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of another Church called the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal:</hi> By which aſſertion you ſet up an Univerſal
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64641:85"/>
Head or Government over all the Paſtors, Churches, and Chriſtians in the world beſides Chriſt; and you ſay this is of Divine Inſtitution; and you lay the concord of all the Churches upon it. Do but grant the Papiſts this one aſſertion, that particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as headed by their reſpective Paſtors, are parts and members of the Univerſal Church, as a City is of a Kingdom, and overthrow the Popes headſhip over all if you can. It will follow that there muſt be, beſides Chriſt, an Univerſal Eccleſiaſtical Monarch <hi>on Earth, either perſonal or collective,</hi> who muſt have the Supreme power. <hi>P. 96.</hi> But indeed you have gone beyond <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in ſeting up Papal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. Your other aſſertion ſets up <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> by making the Holy God the Author and Founder of two eſſentially different Churches, or <hi>Church-Forms.</hi> According to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> aſſertion for the Pope, there would be Paſtors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But according to your aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all the world muſt be Atheiſts, of no Religion at all.<hi>—P. 224, 225.</hi> Your diviſion of the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Univerſal</hi> and <hi>particular,</hi> is plainly againſt that Rule in Logick; <hi>Membra omnis bonae diviſionis debent eſſe inter ſe oppoſita.</hi> But in this your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion the <hi>Membra dividentia are not inter ſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſita: you oppoſe the ſame thing againſt itſelf. You make the Church at</hi> Corinth <hi>a particular Church,—The whole or the Univerſal Church at</hi> Corinth <hi>is ſound and good.</hi> You plainly leave out of your deſcription, the differencing Form or token of that which you call a particular Church, and that is <hi>Neighbourhood,</hi> or dwelling or abiding in this or that place,—you make a new eſſential of Church-Memberſhip and Church-Communion, and lay the peace of all the Churches on it, and ſay it is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64641:85"/>
ſure, harmleſs, fitted to the intereſt of all good men. This ſtartles me, I ſtrive to be ſilent and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: The more I ſtrive, the more I am overcome <note n="*" place="margin">Alas! then there is no remedy!</note>. Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with me, and we had Conference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this point,—ſuſpecting mine own judgment; I have conferred with divers about your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notions, two Churches, or two Church-Forms differing eſſentially; and they cannot apprehend how it can ſtand! you make the Univerſal Church-Form, and the particular Church-Form to differ eſſentially, and this by Divine Law. I prove to you from the nature of the thing it ſelf, and the expreſs word of God, that the Univerſal Church of God at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the particular Church of God at <hi>Corinth,</hi> are one and the ſame.—To oppoſe the Univerſal and particular Church, and ſay they differ eſſentially, is to oppoſe the ſame thing againſt itſelf, and make the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Authour and Founder of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubverting Principles. <hi>P. 226, 227.</hi> As for that other point, of the Church particular being part of the Church Univerſal, it is to ſay, that the whole Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> is a part of the whole Church, which is abſurd.</p>

               <p>§ 1. WHat Chriſtians heart can chooſe but mourn for the Church of God, and the puzzling confounding temptations of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that muſt hear men charged thus publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Atheiſm, and the overthrow of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for that which the Chriſtian world agreeth in; and this by Preachers of profeſſed humility, ſincerity and zeal? How ſhall the unlearned know when they are ſafe? yea, what ſnares are thus laid to rob men of their time, as well as their Faith and Charity? I muſt not give ſuch lines their proper names: but I will ſay that it remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth me of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 6. and it cryeth out <hi>unclean, unclean.</hi> How few words of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>ſoberneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſoundneſs,</hi> can you number among all theſe? Had he written and publiſhed it in his ſleep, as ſome talk, and walk, it were ſome excuſe! But for a Man, a Miniſter, awake, and after publick admonition, deliberately, on conſultation, a ſecond time, to talk at this rate in the Preſs!—And yet cannot we be endured without their Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the <hi>Friendly Debater</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke</hi> have compared ſuch Books as this with thoſe that they reprehended, perhaps they will ſay, <hi>Iliacos intramuros, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To begin at the end, I am ſorry to read what
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64641:86"/>
he ſaith of the <hi>Divers he Conferred with, &amp;c.</hi> 1. I never till now read or heard Papiſt, Proteſtant, or any Chriſtian of his mind: And, alas, are divers of it now? Are Conformiſts come to that? Either they were at Manhood, or in breeches at leaſt, or not: If not, he ſhould have choſen other Counſellers: If yea, were they Laymen or Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen? He was to blame if he took up with the former alone in ſuch a caſe. If the later, he greatly diſgraceth them.</p>
               <p>But we muſt ſay ſomewhat of our Atheiſtical Errours. The beginning of his words, which ſay the ſame thing which he ſo abominateth, I will not charge with contradiction in ſence from the reſt: for if he mean the ſame thing by <hi>[One</hi> and <hi>Two, A Church and no Church, A part and no part, Yea and Nay]</hi> they are no contradictions in ſence. And indeed I cannot perceive that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth what he readeth and anſwereth, nor well what he ſaith. And therefore I am not ſure when I underſtand him; but I will review ſome of the things that his words ſeem to accuſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>§ I. <hi>The Univerſal Church,</hi> as I <hi>defined it, is a True Church.</hi> Proved: Where there is a true Church-Head and a Body of all Chriſtians on earth, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſubjected to that Head by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Covenant, there is a true Univerſal Church: but ſuch is that which I named and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined as the Church Univerſal.<hi>—Ergo.—</hi>The Major is from the definition to the thing deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated. As to the Minor, 1. That Chriſt is the True Head. 2. And all Chriſtians the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal true body, (viſible as Baptized, and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64641:87"/>
as Heart-Covenanters.) 3. And that mutual Covenanting is a ſufficient bond for this Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union, the Chriſtian Reader will chide me if I ſtay to prove.</p>
               <p>§ 11. <hi>Particular Churches exiſtent, are true Churches in Eſſence.</hi> Proved to him: 1. He oft confeſſeth this and the former. 2. A <hi>true pars di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigens &amp; pars ſubdita, neceſſarily qualified, ad eſſe, and united in thoſe relations for Church-ends, are a true particular Church: But ſuch are many exiſtent particular Churches</hi> (and all that I defined:) <hi>Ergo.</hi> 1. That a true Biſhop, at leaſt with his Presbyters, is a true <hi>pars dirigens:</hi> 2. And a qualified flock, a true <hi>pars ſubdita:</hi> 3. And that ſuch are found united in theſe relations, I will take for granted with the Reader, except Mr. <hi>Ch.</hi> And the Major is the definition.</p>
               <p>§ III. That the <hi>Relative union of the governing Part,</hi> or <hi>neareſt Head to the Governed body, is the ſpecifying form.</hi> The proof being <hi>de Ente politico &amp; notione Logicâ,</hi> is the conſent of all <hi>Politicks, Logicks,</hi> and uſe of ſpeech by the profeſſours of both, known to us in the world. I oft enough diſtinguiſhing <hi>de nomine aequivoco,</hi> have told men that it is not every Chriſtian Aſſembly that we ſpeak of, but <hi>ſocietas politica.</hi> And all Politicks call the form of the Government, the ſpecifying form of the Politick Society, throughout the known world. So Monarchy, Ariſtocracie, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie, are ſpecifying forms of Republicks: And Schools, Armies, Navies, have divers Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive forms, ſpecifyed by the union of the various Regent Relative parts to the reſt.</p>
               <p>§ IV. <hi>The Form is a chief eſſential part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:64641:87"/>
§ V. <hi>Therefore divers ſpecifying forms, prove di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers eſſences in ſpecie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ VI. <hi>It is not the generical form that ſpecifieth.</hi> Elſe all things that are <hi>ejuſdem generis,</hi> ſhould be <hi>ejuſdem ſpeciei.</hi> All bodies are not Animate, nor all Animals Men, nor all Men Biſhops or Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</p>
               <p>§ VII. The Genus denominated without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining it, with the <hi>ſpecifying form or difference, makes the Definition of the Species.</hi> Elſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the <hi>ſpecies infima,</hi> would be confounded by the conjunct definitions of all the ſuperiour <hi>Genera:</hi> He that defineth a King, muſt not put in it the definition of <hi>Homo,</hi> of Animal, of <hi>Vivens,</hi> of <hi>Corpus</hi> and <hi>Anima,</hi> of <hi>ſubſtantia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ VIII. <hi>The higheſt ſpecies muſt be defined by its proper higheſt form, though not the ſubordinate ſpecies.</hi> The King muſt be put in the <hi>definition</hi> of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but not of a City, Country, Church, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, School; he is there ſuppoſed in a Kingdom. And ſo of others.</p>
               <p>§ IX. The higher <hi>Genera</hi> muſt not be named in the definition of the ſpecies, but the next, which is the ſuperiour ſpecies. Therefore Mr. <hi>Ch.</hi> miſtook his Art of defining, when he ſaid I miſt it, by naming Chriſt as the Head of the Church Univerſal, and adding that I blame my ſelf that defining of a particular Church. As in Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it is not the ultimate end, but the neareſt that muſt be in the definition; ſo is it not the <hi>higheſt</hi> but the next <hi>Genus</hi> that muſt be named. In de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining all the lower ſpecies, the higher <hi>Genera</hi> are but implyed in the naming of <hi>genus proximum,</hi> and not named.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:64641:88"/>
§ X. The <hi>Relation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of a <hi>humane Biſhop,</hi> are not the ſame Relation, in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, though both be called Heads or Rulers. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: There is not the ſame <hi>ſubjectum,</hi> nor the ſame <hi>fundamentum, vel ratio fundandi,</hi> nor the ſame <hi>Correlate,</hi> (for all the Chriſtian world and a Dioceſe are not the ſame) nor the ſame <hi>neareſt terminus: Ergo,</hi> not the ſame <hi>Relation.</hi>

Therefore the Univerſal Church Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Chriſt onely, and a particular Church ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately Headed by a Biſhop or Clergy-head, are eſſentially divers, and two: Proved: Where the formal ſpecifying Head or Regent part is two, or divers, and the Body divers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties are divers <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> or eſſentially: But ſo it is here: <hi>Ergo.</hi> That <hi>One and One</hi> are <hi>Two,</hi> I will not undertake to prove to Mr. <hi>Ch.</hi> nor think it needful to prove to others, nor yet that Chriſt is <hi>One,</hi> and a Biſhop one; and not the ſame. That Chriſt is the formal Head of the Univerſal Church, all Chriſtians confeſs, and therefore to be named in the definition, whether Mr. <hi>Ch.</hi> will or not, and not ſuppoſed: Baptiſmal Union and ſubjecting to him, maketh us Chriſtians, and not ſuppoſeth us ſuch (in viſible Church-ſtate.) That Chriſt is not the <hi>formal ſpecifying</hi> Head of a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church</hi> as ſuch, but of the <hi>Univerſal,</hi> and ſo the Supream Head only of the particular, is proved before. 1. Becauſe the ſpecifying <hi>forma totius heterogenei,</hi> is not the ſpecifying form of the parts. 2. Elſe all that Chriſt is Supreme Ruler to, ſhould be ſuch particular Political Churches: which is falſe; It is not true of ſingle perſons, of Chriſtian Armies, Troops, Markets, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64641:88"/>
Courts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ſuch. 3. Chriſt himſelf by his Apoſtles hath ordained a ſubordinate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſpecies of Church-heads or Rulers. 4. From parity of caſes: Natural and Political. The <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma animalis,</hi> is not <hi>forma hominis,</hi> nor <hi>forma ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis forma oculi, manus, pedis,</hi> &amp;c. The General is the formal Head of the Army, but not of a Regiment, but the Colonel: Nor the Colonel of a Troop, but the Captain; nor the King of a City, but the Maior or other ſubordinate head: Nor the King or Maior of a Family, School, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but the <hi>Pater-familias,</hi> the Maſter, the Rector, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Depoſe the ſubordinate Head, and it's part of the Kingdom ſtill, but no Family, School, Colledge, Troop, Regiment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All Mankind that profeſs dealing in ſuch ſubjects, (as far as I know) are agreed in all this. As to the Body related alſo, a Dioceſs is not all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world.</p>
               <p>§ XII. <hi>Every true particular or ſingle Church, is part of the Univerſal, (which is Headed only by Chriſt.)</hi> That it is <hi>part of the Univerſal,</hi> I know not that ever man denyed till now, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable pious Divine maketh this with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Atheiſtical, making God and Chriſt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, driving all Religion out of the world, Popery, worſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Proved. <hi>Quae unita totum conſtituunt ſunt partes: At Eccleſiae omnes particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares, cum membris caeteris &amp; Chriſto Capite totam ſeu Univerſam Eccleſiam Redemptorum conſtituunt: Ergo, ſunt Eccleſiae Univerſae partes. Eccleſia uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa conſtat ex horum unione. Ergo, haec omnia ſunt ejus partes.</hi> Again, If the ſingle Churches be no parts of the Univerſal, either they are Co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64641:89"/>
Churches with the Univerſal, or there is no Univerſal. If the Univerſal be <hi>All</hi> without them, than they are none: If not, then it is not Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, if there be other Churches which are no parts of it. Again, If they be no parts of the Church Univerſal, they are no parts of the Body or peculiar people or Kingdom of Chriſt, (for that is but one, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 15, 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> But they are parts of the Body of Chriſt. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XIII. <hi>To ſay that the whole Church,</hi> e. g. at <hi>Corinth, and the whole Church in the world are the ſame,</hi> and what's predicated of one is alſo of the other, is a ſaying—not to be juſtly denominated. The <hi>ſubjectum, relatum, correlatum, fundamentum, terminus, proximus,</hi> and ſo the relation are divers. The whole Church and its Head, and a part and its ſubordinate Head, are not the ſame. The Kingdom and the City, the City and a Pariſh or Ward, the Univerſity and a Colledge, the Man and a hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not the ſame.</p>
               <p>§ XIV. <hi>To ſay</hi> as he doth, that a <hi>Family is not a part of the ſtreet,</hi> or that of the City, and <hi>London no Member or part of the Kingdom,</hi> is ſtuff that—I will not name: an ill foundation for the charge of <hi>Atheiſm, Blaſphemy,</hi> and all Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But I am out of all fear that he ſhould make one Proſelyte that's <hi>ſani cerebri.</hi> If any accuſe him of leſs than denying God and Chriſt, even but of Depoſing the King from moſt of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and ſaying that <hi>London,</hi> and ſo of every one City, Corporation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is no part of it, I would deſire them to allow him his own Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: for he mcaneth not ſo ill as he ſaith.</p>
               <p>§ XV. To ſay that <hi>one whole cannot be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64641:89"/>
or part of another whole,</hi> is yet, if poſſible, more—than the former. What, may not <hi>Corpus poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum</hi> be a member of a larger body Politick? Is there any <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Univerſe</hi> if this be true? at leaſt ſave <hi>Atomes</hi> and <hi>Spirits:</hi> And in what ſenſe an <hi>Atome,</hi> or <hi>Anima,</hi> or <hi>Spiritus,</hi> may be called <hi>totum, Scaliger,</hi> and the Schoolmen, and Metaphyſicks, commonly tell you. Are not whole ſtones part of Mountains? and whole Trees of the Forreſt? and whole Herbs of the whole Garden? and whole Fields of the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey? and whole Pariſhes of the whole Dioceſs and County, and thoſe of the Kingdom? and that of <hi>Europe?</hi> and that of the world? Is not a whole hand or foot part of a whole man? Is not the mateial Univerſe made up of compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded parts? What a trick has he found to exempt us all from Government? every man may ſay, <hi>I am a whole man: therefore</hi> I am no part of the Biſhop of <hi>Londons</hi> Dioceſs, or of the Pariſh, or of the Family. Deny or deſtroy all ſuch parts, and you deny or deſtroy the whole. Did he think that all Noun Subſtantives ſignified the ſame thing, which have the ſame Adjective; and that a <hi>whole Man,</hi> and a <hi>whole Dog,</hi> or <hi>World,</hi> are all one?</p>
               <p>§ XVI. It's little better when he argueth that homogeneal parts make not a new <hi>ſpecies.</hi> As if he could prove that the Church is <hi>Totum homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum.</hi> Are not Chriſt and Chriſtians, the King and the Subjects of the Univerſal Church, <hi>partes heterogeneae, in eſſe politico relativo?</hi> Are not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Laicks <hi>partes heterogeneae?</hi> Had he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got how much of his Book is to prove even Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64641:90"/>
and Presbyters as widely different? No Chriſtian denyeth it of the Church Univerſal, nor any of ſingle Churches, that denyes not a Miniſtry, and the being of ſuch Churches as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical.</p>
               <p>§ XVII. While thus he maketh National Churches Metropolitical, Dioceſane, Parochial, and the very Independent, which he moſt revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, <hi>all one,</hi> or of <hi>one eſſential ſpecies,</hi> it ſeemeth that he knoweth not how he unſaith moſt that he ſaid before.</p>
               <p>§ XVIII. It is little better that he maketh ſeveral Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> and at <hi>Plimouth, &amp;c.</hi> to differ only in <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Place.</hi> 1. Do not the Popiſh, Proteſtant, Epiſcopal, and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, differ in the <hi>Form</hi> of Government? 2. Do not thoſe of the ſame Form differ as <hi>Individuals</hi> by their ſeveral Rulers? beſides abundance of accidental differences?</p>
               <p>§ XIX. And what Doctrine is it to ſay, <hi>Chriſts Body is one; not as one is oppoſed to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> but to <hi>diviſion and deſtruction?</hi> Hath Chriſt a multitude of Bodies univocally ſo called? even ſuch a Body as we treat of? Hath Chriſt many Univerſal Churches containing all Chriſtians headed by Chriſt?</p>
               <p>§ XX. When he had ſo groſly wronged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as to ſay, <hi>It is an errour in the art of defining, to ſay</hi> of the Univerſal Church, it is <hi>Headed by Chriſt himſelf;</hi> what other Head or formal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent part doth he name? will he have another? or will he have none in the definition? Is that the art of defining?</p>
               <p>§ XXI. It's little better to ſay, <hi>Is is an errour
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64641:90"/>
to define the Univerſal Church without Paſtors, as the Aſſembly did.</hi> What! a better Logician than all the Aſſembly too? Alas, how fell the good man under this temptation? He inſtanceth in a body defined without Liver, Stomack, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But 1. I hope he doth not think all is excluded that is not to be named? 2. Is there no better definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a man, than <hi>Animal implume, bipes, &amp;c.</hi> or one that hath a Liver and Stomack, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When to the <hi>Entelechia</hi> or <hi>anima,</hi> he added <hi>Corpus orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum, Ariſtotle</hi> thought he ſaid enough of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Is not <hi>Animal rationale</hi> a juſt definition of a man, without naming his <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Spleen,</hi> or <hi>Heart?</hi> Is not the <hi>Genus &amp; differentia</hi> enough for a definition? <hi>Definitiones debent eſſe breves; &amp; nihil otioſum continere: otioſum eſt quo ablato, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitio reliqua rei eſſentiam explicat.</hi> A Kingdom is defined by naming no more than the King and Subjects in general, without naming Judges, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are no conſtitutive principles in Nature, but <hi>Mater, materiae diſpoſitio &amp; forma:</hi> And the imperfect definitions of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, muſt be as like as may be to thoſe of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The <hi>ſpecifying form</hi> here, is only <hi>Chriſt the Head ſo related:</hi> Though he made <hi>Chriſtians</hi> before <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and were all Paſtors dead, the Church were ſtill Chriſts Univerſal Body; yet I grant it is not a juſt <hi>organized body</hi> without Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors: but that maketh them but to be the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler part of the diſpoſed matter: men do not uſe to play the Anatomiſts in definitions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Animal,</hi> or of <hi>Corpus organicum,</hi> to name <hi>Heart, Stomack, Lungs, &amp;c.</hi> But it is a <hi>health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man</hi> that Mr. <hi>Ch.</hi> is defining. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64641:91"/>
is not a <hi>healthful Church,</hi> but a <hi>true Church in eſſence</hi> that I was defining. 2. If it had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, the name of the parts need not enter the definition of health. And are theſe his <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving truths?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXII. And what an intimation is it, that if <hi>there be an eſſential difference between the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and particular Church,</hi> there's none between the <hi>Church and the world,</hi> the <hi>righteous and the wicked, Heaven and Hell.</hi> Theſe things are fitter to be anſwered by <hi>Interjections</hi> (which be no words; but <hi>voces non vocabula)</hi> than by Speech. If Chriſt and a Biſhop <hi>in eſſe relationis politicae</hi> differ eſſentially, muſt good and bad, Heaven and Hell be all one? If an Army, and a Regiment, and a Troop, differ in their formal ſpecifying eſſences, muſt a Subject and a Rebel, the Court and the Gallows therefore be all one. <hi>Proh! apage!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXIII. Next he asks, <hi>How can any man know the right Church then?</hi> Anſw. What! no way but by making Chriſt and a Biſhop formally the Head? we know the Univerſal Church by its true definition; and a true particular Church by its true definition and properties.</p>
               <p>§ XXIV. Yea, he ſaith, <hi>we ſhall never be able to confute Popery and Infidelity by this Doctrine.</hi> Anſw. Alas, will the good man turn Papiſt or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel, unleſs the <hi>Univerſal Church</hi> and a <hi>Dioceſane</hi> have the ſame <hi>ſpecifying difference,</hi> or <hi>formal Head?</hi> Then what remedy?</p>
               <p>§ XXV. I have no Interjection deep enough for that which followeth, <hi>viz. This Doctrine ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth two eſſentially different Churches: The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church without Paſtors, (Putares) and of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64641:91"/>
this Chriſt is Head: particular Churches, of which Chriſt is no Head] Putares!</hi> Where ſaid I any ſuch thing! Is this lawful? As if 1. there muſt be no <hi>Paſtors,</hi> unleſs they be the <hi>formal Head</hi> of the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Church.</hi> 2. And as if there muſt be <hi>no Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Supream Head,</hi> if the Biſhop be the <hi>formal differencing ſpecifying ſubordinate Head:</hi> and all but the <hi>named parts</hi> are denyed: As if he would have more than the <hi>genus proximum,</hi> and <hi>differentia ſpecificans</hi> in a definition: yea, even the <hi>genus ſupremum!</hi> and Chriſt ſhall be the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying Head, or none!</p>
               <p>§ XXVI. He ſaith, <hi>[So the ſame thing ſhall be contrary to itſelf.]</hi> As if 1. Chriſt and a Biſhop, in formal relation were proved to be the ſame. 2. Or things ſubordinate were contrary, (which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth himſelf.)</p>
               <p>§ XXVII. He ſaith, <hi>[Chriſts Church in this world is but one.]</hi> Anſw. If there be but one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, 1. Then numerically the Church of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> are one: And then if I ſeparate not from the Church at <hi>Baſil,</hi> I ſeparate not from the Church of <hi>London.</hi> 2. If <hi>de ſpecie</hi> there be but one, then a Patriarchal, Dioceſane, Parochial, Presbyterian, and Democratical Church are but of one ſpecies: And why then did you uſe ſo many words to tell us of the need of Biſhops over Biſhops, and of the ſeveral ſorts of ſupra-ordinate Church-Rulers? Then a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church and a Pariſh-Church are but one.</p>
               <p>§ XXVIII. He addeth, <hi>[Quae conveniunt uno tertio, conveniunt inter ſe; but the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and particular agree in uno tertio, &amp;c.]</hi> Anſw, As if <hi>Convenientia generica,</hi> were <hi>convenientia tota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64641:92"/>
vel ſpecifica?</hi> or, <hi>Convenientia partialis &amp; tota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, Accidentalis &amp; Eſſentialis,</hi> were all one? What pretty Logick is here, to prove a King and a Conſtable all one, becauſe they are both Men, both Chriſtians, and both Rulers? I hope then a Biſhop and a Presbyter are all one, that in your ſorry ſenſe agree in <hi>uno tertio?</hi> But let us hear the inferred Charge againſt us.</p>
               <p>§ XXIX. <hi>An Addition</hi> of <hi>Homogeneous Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>makes no eſſential differences.</hi> Anſw. Chriſt and a Biſhop are heterogeneous: Yea, a <hi>Dioceſane</hi> and a Pariſh-Prieſt: have you proved that they are not? or that they are?</p>
               <p>§ XXX. <hi>It will neceſſarily infer that God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to himſelf,</hi> ſaith he. Anſw. O Temerity in the dark! that is, unleſs his Church-relation be the ſame with the Biſhops? As if the King be contrary to himſelf, if his Kingdom and a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration or School be not of the ſame ſpecies?</p>
               <p>§ XXXI. He ſaith, <hi>[If this opinion ſtand, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion cannot ſtand. An.</hi> Do you mean in <hi>you</hi> or in <hi>me,</hi> or <hi>all others?</hi> Do you reſolve to caſt away all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if Chriſt and a Biſhop be not the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming regent parts of the Church Univerſal and particular? Think better of it firſt; for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is more neceſſary than ſo. Do you think that the Chriſtian world, which hath ever been of the opinion which you deteſt, had never any Religion? Nor hath now any? Which way do Churches that are <hi>parts</hi> of the Univerſal, caſt out all Religion?</p>
               <p>§ XXXII. <hi>If Chriſt ſet up two eſſentially dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Church-Forms, he is not the Saviour but the deceiver of the world.</hi> Anſw. And muſt <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:64641:92"/>
bear ſuch a charge as well as I? I ſhould ſooner have expected it from a Turk or Jew, than from you.</p>
               <p>§ XXXIII. He ſaith, <hi>[Why then do you blame turning Pariſh-Churches into Chappels, and making them but parts of a Dioceſane, as a Troop of an Army?]</hi> Anſw. <hi>Putide putares.</hi> When ſhall we meet with a true Sentence? It is not for making them <hi>parts of a Dioceſane</hi> Church as <hi>Troops</hi> of an Army, but for making them no <hi>Political true Churches,</hi> but disbanding all the Troops, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them no <hi>Troops,</hi> but ſuch parts of a Regiment as Squadrons are. It is for putting down Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Biſhops, and not for being themſelves Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops over them; yet on this doth he ground his charge of my <hi>deceiving men, and wronging God and his Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§ XXXIV. He addeth, <hi>[Look what</hi> Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>maketh the Pope,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that do you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for you ſay that particular Churches, as headed by their reſpective Biſhops and Paſtours, are parts of another Church called the Church Univerſal. By which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion you ſet up an Univerſal Head—beſides Chriſt, and you ſay this is of Divine Inſtitution, and lay the Concord of all the Churches on it.]</hi> Anſw. If you are <hi>ſani Cerebri,</hi> this is ſo groſs, that your <hi>putarem</hi> hath no excuſe. Had you not your ſelf repeated my definition, and carpt at thoſe very words, <hi>[Headed only by Chriſt]</hi> and many times your ſelf repeated it as my opinion. 2. Or had you tryed your wrangling wit to have proved, that <hi>[if Chriſt only be aſſerted to be the Head,</hi> I thereby aſſert another Head] or that <hi>[If I make Biſhops particular ſpecifying Heads, I
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64641:93"/>
therefore aſſert a humane Univerſal Head,]</hi> you had ſome cloak for your <hi>putarem:</hi> But now—If you next print that I ſaid that a Dog is a man, I will no more wonder at it than at this. See Reader how my <hi>Church-Concord</hi> is oppugned, and by what weapons Satan doth that work. As if he that ſaith the King only is the ſpecifying Head of the Kingdom, and the Captain of his Troop, or the Dioceſans of a Dioceſs, were a Traytor, and did aſſert another Head of the Kingdom than the King.</p>
               <p>§ XXXV. <hi>Do but grant the Papiſts</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this one aſſertion, that particular Churches, as headed by their reſpective Paſtors, are parts and members of the Univerſal, as Cities of a Kingdom, and overthrow the Popes Headſhip over all if you can. It will follow, that there muſt be beſides Chriſt, an univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch on earth, &amp;c.</hi> Anſw. 1. <hi>Affirmanti incumbit probatio.</hi> Did you think we muſt take your bare word in ſo great a caſe? Do you ſay one word to prove your affirmation? Muſt we all turn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts upon your immodeſt naked ſaying, it is ſo? 2. But your immodeſty is in this exceſſive to me, that have written <hi>two Books</hi> againſt <hi>Johnſon, alias Terret,</hi> and the later but lately and largely, to prove that the Church hath no <hi>Univerſal Head</hi> but Chriſt, notwithſtanding the particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the Biſhops; and for you to give me not a word of anſwer to them, and bid me now <hi>prove it if you can,</hi> when I have voluminouſly proved it! This is ſuch dealing as I will not name.—3. But I am heartily ſorry, what ever did it, that you are got ſo neer to Popery. As if you will be a Papiſt, unleſs all the writers of the

               </p>
               <p>§ XXXVII. He adds, <hi>[According to your aſſertion, all the world muſt be Atheiſts, of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at all.]</hi> Anſw. Then all the world of Chriſtians are ſo; for as far as writings notifie, they are generally of this mind. Alas, Brother, did you ſhew this to any man before you Printed it? for their honour I muſt think you did not; and for your ſake I wiſh you had.</p>

If Neighbourhood be the <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing form,</hi> then all Chriſtian Neighbours are particular Churches: But that is falſe: <hi>Ergo.—</hi>1. Thoſe that dwell together only for Trade, are not therefore Churches. 2. Thoſe that hold that there are no particular Churches or Paſtors, but that all Chriſtians are as Prieſts. 3. Thoſe that hold that the Miniſter of the Pariſh where they

live is no true Miniſter, nor the Pariſh a true Church. 4. Thoſe that profeſs themſelves Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of no particular Church. 5. Thoſe that profeſs to be no Members of that Church, but of another. 6. Papiſts and Sectaries that ſtand in oppoſition to that Church. 7. Thoſe that dwell near another Pariſh-Church, and many miles from their own, are not Members by proximity. 8. Thoſe that are Excommunicated, which is <hi>de facto</hi> all profeſſed Non-Conformiſts. 9. In places where the Magiſtrate tyeth not Churches to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-bounds, perſons of the ſame ſtreet and houſe may be of ſeveral Churches. 10. No man that conſenteth not is a Church-Member. 11. And who knoweth not that <hi>proximity</hi> is but <hi>diſpoſitio materiae,</hi> and not the differencing form?

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64641:96"/>
in baptizing the Infants of Non-Confederates,</hi> p. 129. <hi>[I do utterly withſtand it as Wickedneſs and Abomination in Gods Church; I am to die and burn at a ſtake before I yield to any ſuch thing: This is Mr.</hi> Baxters <hi>way: He offers it to Biſhop</hi> Morley <hi>and Biſhop</hi> Gunning, <hi>in his Preface to his laſt Book of Concord, that poſterity may ſee what it is that he would have had, and laboured to ſet up in all the Churches: And accordingly, let both the preſent and future Ages ſee and know,</hi> p. 130. <hi>Your way is not ſo innocent as that of re-baptizing. For the very matter and terms of your Church-Covenant are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe, and plainly Schiſmatical! As if Conſtables and people of each Town muſt Confederate to be a Corporation, an Independent body having all juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction within themſelves, and ſuch as will not enter into this Confederacy, muſt be counted none of the Kings Subjects.—To ſay there are no Churches in the world but a few Independent Churches,—were to go beyond</hi> Browniſm: <hi>It were rather to teach In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity: ſuch an opinion would be abhorred by all: Now Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>and the Independents Doctrine ſaith it.—Their errour, ſhould they hold it habitually, predominantly, and practically, would be certainly their damnation.—</hi>p. 141, <hi>[I ſee not but Pagans, groſs Hereticks, Apoſtates, Thieves and Robbers might combine together and ſay, I take thee for my Paſtor, and I take you for my people: Doth not your Doctrine infer it?</hi> p. 143. <hi>If I yield to their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, I muſt ſubvert the office of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and all his faithful Miniſters, and all the Churches to this day; which I will not do for fear of the cenſure of any man living, no nor of a whole Council of men,</hi> p. 57. <hi>The way that Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64641:96"/>
ſeems to be a worſe way,—It is the way of rigid Independencie.—Indeed Mr.</hi> B. <hi>in all his Writings ſeems to be againſt the Office of Lay-Elders: But that he is not for them under another notion, as Heads and delegates of the people, mutually choſen by the Paſtor and people, for aſſiſtance in Diſcipline, may be doubted. He ſeems to hint at it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§ 2. How little truth is in all this, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance ſuch? 1. either it is truth that I <hi>am for ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Independency, or not.</hi> If not,—if yea, I am glad that the Independent way is no worſe. I am not much acquainted with them: But, if this man ſay true, 1. They are for no Covenanting, but conſent to the relation ſignifyed. 2. They are not for binding any to continue in that relation. 3. They are not for binding any from a regular uſe of any other Miniſter, or Churches Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. 4. In places where Pariſhes are divided by Law, and the ordinary attendance on the Paſtors Miniſtration goeth for a ſign of conſent, they are true Churches and Members that thus ſignifie it; and <hi>ad eſſe</hi> it is uſually enough, though <hi>ad bene eſſe</hi> in doubtful caſes the more expreſs, as more intelligible <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> is beſt. 5. They are againſt an Office of Lay-Elders, diſtinct from Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Word and Sacraments, as of Gods inſtitution for Church-government. 6. They are againſt Democracie, or the Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of the People. 7. They take refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Pariſh-Churches for the beſt Order, not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all for Members that are in the Pariſh, but all the capable. 8. They are againſt gathering Churches out of ſuch Pariſh-Churches, without great neceſſity. 9. They are greatly againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64641:97"/>
any qualification as neceſſary to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in point of holineſs, but expreſs conſent to the Baptiſmal Covenant, or profeſſion of Chriſtianity, not diſproved. 10. They make not the peoples <hi>Election</hi> of their Paſtors neceſſary <hi>ad eſſe,</hi> but meer <hi>conſent,</hi> though the Patron or others Elect them. 11. They ſuppoſe that the peoples <hi>Election or conſent</hi> is not neceſſary to make a man a Miniſter in the Univerſal Church, but only to make him their <hi>Paſtor.</hi> As to make a Phyſician, and to make him my <hi>Phyſician,</hi> differ. 12. They ſuppoſe that a true Miniſter officiateth as ſuch, where ever he doth it. 13. They ſuppoſe that aſſociations or correſpondencies of Churches for concord and help, and Synods to that end, and dependencie on ſuch Synods, is uſually a duty where it can well be had; and needleſs diſcord a fault. 14. They refuſe not to ſubmit in practice to the inſtructions or admonitions of any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Viſiter or Overſeer of many Churches, called by ſome Archbiſhops. 15. They refuſe not the precedency of one Paſtor in every particular Church over the reſt of the Presbyters. 16. They refuſe him not the name of the Biſhop, nor yet to ſubmit to his negative voice as of the <hi>Quorum</hi> (or the Archbiſhops either) in Ordinations and all great publick matters. 17. They are for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from no Chriſtians, further than they ſeparate from Chriſt, or would force them to ſin; but are for univerſal Love and Concord. 18. They are for obeying the Magiſtrate in all lawful things belonging to his function. 19. They take the moſt extenſive Love, Peace, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord for the moſt deſirable and beſt. 20. It is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64641:97"/>
next their obedience to Chriſt and his ſufficient Laws; the great reaſon why they are againſt the terms impoſed in moſt places of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, where things unneceſſary and ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted are made neceſſary to Communion. Reader, Mr. <hi>Ch.</hi> is ſo honeſt a man, that it were unjuſt to take him for a deliberate ſtudied Lyar. Therefore ſeeing he ſaith that <hi>my way is rigid Independency,</hi> and oft maketh me a <hi>downright Independent,</hi> I that know my own Judgement, and knew not theirs ſo well as he ſeems to do, am glad to hear that they are no worſe, and that they are wronged by ſuch as accuſe them of denying any of thoſe Twenty points.</p>
               <p>§ 3. And ſuppoſing that he ſaith true, and that they hold but <hi>my way,</hi> as he calls it, I will now try the force and honeſty of his charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
               <p>And firſt, it ſavours of a ſpirit worſe than his own, that when he had before uſed the word <hi>[Oath]</hi> as owned by me, and then ſaid, he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of it,</hi> that he ſtill uſeth the word <hi>[Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant]</hi> here as mine, inſtead of <hi>Conſent,</hi> which is the word which I uſe, and over and over ſay, that I own no <hi>Covenant but any ſignification of Conſent to the relation;</hi> onely becauſe I ſaid, that not <hi>ad eſſe,</hi> but <hi>ad bene eſſe,</hi> plain or expreſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in doubtful caſes is beſt.

               <p>§ 13. IX. <hi>This Doctrine puts a new clauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Baptiſm, which Chriſt never put in, and altereth Chriſtianity</hi> (ſaith he.) <hi>Before I baptize you, I muſt have an antecedent Covenant or ſignified Conſent from you to ſubmit to me; and you muſt be baptized in the name of</hi> Paul, <hi>&amp;c. No Church-covenant, no Church-member, no right to any Church-ordinance.</hi> Anſ. <hi>Confundendo fortiter caluminaris.</hi> 1. The Eunuch conſented to be a Chriſtian of the Church Univerſal, but not to be of a particular Church; without that Conſent he had not been baptized: but this was not needful to it. 2. The diſpute whether Lay-mens baptiſm be valid, I leave to you. But if yea, it is not neceſſary that I judge the Baptizer a Miniſter. If not, then it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and my conſent is neceſſary to make me a Chriſtian, but not him a Miniſter: But mutual conſent is neceſſary to his Paſtoral relation to a particular Church. 3. An Ordinance common to the Church Univerſal, and proper to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, ſhould not be confounded, nor ſo much as the modal miniſtration. Do I adde to Baptiſm, if I ſay that by the Canons and Cuſtom of all the Churches for one Thouſand years, a man was not to be taken for the Biſhop of any
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64641:100"/>
Church without mutual conſent? what's this to Baptiſm? And what temerity is it to feign men to wrong Chriſt by that which was his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo judged and uſed in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</p>
               <p>§ 14. X. [Saith he] <hi>It maketh the people Church-Rulers or Co-partners in office with the Paſtors, ſo that without their Conſent they can do nothing; not baptize. Anſ.</hi> Of me the calumny hath no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, I have written ſo much to the contrary: Yea, the very <hi>Act calumniated eſſentially</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>contrary in it.</hi> As he that conſenteth to be a <hi>Servant,</hi> conſenteth <hi>not to be Maſter,</hi> but to <hi>obey:</hi> So they that conſent to be <hi>Lay-members</hi> of a Paſtors Flock, conſent that <hi>he,</hi> and not <hi>they,</hi> ſhall rule, and that they will be the <hi>obeying part.</hi> How could you wink ſo hard, as not to ſee that your falſe witneſs confuteth it ſelf? And what if he cannot be their Governour <hi>without their conſent,</hi> doth this give them any part in <hi>governing?</hi> Nay what if he cannot baptize a Non-conſenter, or give him the Lords Supper, is the Refuſer a Church-governour? The man had got a heap of Notions againſt the Independents in his mind, or his inſtigator that hath the ſame diſeaſe had thruſt them in, and out they muſt come againſt he knew not whom or what, upon the word <hi>[Conſent.]</hi> What work would he make in the Church, if he ſhould deny the neceſſity of this <hi>Conſent,</hi> and have the Church made a Priſon where Infidels ſhould be cram'd and drencht with the Sacrament?</p>

               <p>§ 16. XII. He addes <hi>[It bindeth people to be dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers within the precincts of that one Church, to hear no other Miniſter, to joyn with no other Congregation. Anſ.</hi> Concatenated Calumnies, as to me: They onely conſent to the Relation of Lay-members till they remove their dwelling or relation. They conſent to take that Church but as a part of the Univerſal, and therefore to hold juſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with all others, and receive what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit they can from any other Miniſters. I abhor a Covenant that renounceth Communion with the Univerſal Church, or any part of it, without neceſſary cauſe. <hi>Putide haec putares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 17. XIII. He addes, <hi>[What ſhall godly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64641:101"/>

If I have no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their <hi>conſent</hi> to communicate with us <hi>pro tempore,</hi> they expect it not: And <hi>de ignotis non judicat Eccleſia;</hi> and <hi>non apparere</hi> is equal to <hi>non eſſe.</hi> If I have notice of their <hi>Conſent,</hi> it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſome notice that they are <hi>baptized,</hi> or <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> and have more right than Heathens to Communion: And if ſo, 1. They conſent to be Members of the Univerſal Church, and as ſuch I ſhall give them the Sacrament and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though I were no Paſtor of any particular ſtated Church. 2. They conſent to a Tranſient Temporary Communion with me as a Miniſter in the Catholick Church. And 3. They conſent to tranſient temporary Communion with that particular Church, and tranſient temporary Communion I will give them; yea, and may call them tranſient Members of that Church; but no further any of theſe than they conſent. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian giving evidence of his Chriſtianity, hath right to tranſient Communion in all Churches in the world where he cometh: yea, all are not bound to live in ſtated Churches; ſome are Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, ſome unſetled Embaſſadors, ſome Factors amongſt Heathens, ſome of no Habitation, Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, Pedlars, Tinkers, and ſuch wandring Trades; ſome live where is no Church with whom they may hold lawful Communion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now we have a new Divine riſen up in the end of the world, that ſeems to make all the ſetled Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt in the world for many hundred years, to be all Traitors to Chriſt, becauſe theſe wanderers muſt not conſent to their ſpecial rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64641:102"/>
nor enjoy their proper Priviledges; and becauſe they conſent themſelves to a more ſetled relation and Communion than theſe wanderers or refuſers are capable of. What would all the old Church, that made ſo many Canons about their proper Communion, have thought of this mans Doctrine, if he had come among them at their Elections, Diſcipline, Diſtributions to the Widows and Poor, and ſaid, <hi>Hold Sirs! You are all deſtroying Baptiſm and Chriſtianity, by conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to more towards one another than you owe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very unknown wanderer, or refuſer of a ſetled Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate?</hi> As if with our new Politician all Cities and Corporations are Traytors, or deny or wrong the King, becauſe all Subjects are not Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, ſome being Vagrants, ſome in Villages, ſome Souldiers, ſome in odde Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and becauſe Cities conſent to a ſpecial ſort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the reſt have not. Between the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathematizers and theſe <hi>over-wiſe Cenſurers,</hi> there are few Chriſtians in the world that are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as no Chriſtians for being ſound Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>§ 18. XIV. He was aware that we ſay that every one that may come into the Temple is not a part of my ſpecial Charge as a Paſtor, which I cannot do for all: And he ſaith, <hi>[It's all one to your Doctrine if he refuſe your Church-covenant—The Miniſter all this while is no Miniſter; the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all this while are no Chriſtians.—They are no more lawful Paſtor and People, than Whoremonger and Whore going together, and committing acts of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, and living in Fornication all their days—Anſ.</hi> Continued Calumny as to me. Is no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty or tender fear of ſinning againſt the Ninth

Commandment left? 1. He that refuſeth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be a ſtated Member, is none ſuch: But is he therefore no Chriſtian? Awake, Conſcience! Do any Independents ſay that none are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans but their ſpecial charge; yea, or ſtated Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of particular Churches? If there be any ſuch, what's that to me? 2. Such perſons may be Members of the Univerſal Church, and I am a Paſtor in the Univerſal Church; and as ſuch may communicate with them. 3. If he deſire temporary Communion, he conſents to as much as he deſireth, and that he may have: If he deſire more, he ſhall have more. § 19. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith the Accuſer) <hi>what ſpeak you of</hi> Literae Communicatoriae, <hi>Theſe are nothing to yourcaſe;</hi> (he ſaith it, <hi>ergo,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it.) <hi>It ſhuts him out of all particular Churches and Congregations under Heaven, except,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Anſ. Putares!</hi> of me it's thus true or falſe. 1. He that conſents not to be a ſtated Member of any Church, none, becauſe he would be none: and it's blind ſelf-contradiction, to ſay that I <hi>ſhut him out,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>he will not come in.</hi> 2. He that conſenteth to be a Member of the <hi>Univerſal Church</hi> ſhall not be ſhut out. 3. He that by <hi>literas Communicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> or any good teſtimony, ſheweth himſelf a Chriſtian, and deſireth onely one days temporary Communion with a ſtated particular Church, ſhall not be denied that which <hi>he deſireth,</hi> nor will we urge him to more.</p>
               <p>§ 19. XV. He adds <hi>[It layeth waſte Pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, leaving people to go to what Church they will—Intimating, that being a godly man and a Pariſhioner, doth not make him a Member of the Pariſh-Church—Teaching people to be diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly.]

Anſ.</hi> 1. <hi>A quatenus ad omne valet conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentia.</hi> I ſaid enough before to prove the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of your Church-eſtate. 1. Then there were no Church till there were Pariſh-bounds 2. Then if Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be <hi>godly,</hi> and <hi>dwell</hi> in the <hi>Pariſh,</hi> they are Members againſt their wills. 3. And they are Members of two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches; one in deſpight of them, and of the other as Conſenters. 4. There are ſome Houſes that are in no Pariſh (that I have known.) Alas, theſe muſt be of no Church. 5. Some parts of one Pariſh are in the middle of another. The truth is, Pariſh-bounds are ordinarily of good uſe for <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> is for <hi>Edification,</hi> and to promote the thing ordered: and he layeth it not waſte, 1. That giveth it no more than its due, as a humane mutable circumſtance, and not as eſſential. 2. Nor he that refuſeth it when it is turned againſt the <hi>end</hi> and the <hi>res ordinanda.</hi>

               <p>§ 20. XVI. He addes, <hi>[Then if the Paſtor ſet over them be a ſon of</hi> Belial<hi>—and ſinfully to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated by the Magiſtrate; the people of the Pariſh who can neither remove him, nor ſit under a more edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Miniſter, muſt covenant to him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Strange! who would have thought but this was neerer your opinion than theirs? Briefly, if the man be <hi>tolerable,</hi> they muſt rather accept of him than have none. If he be <hi>intolerable</hi> in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, they may uſe ſuch common gifts as he hath, (as we read even <hi>a Cicero)</hi> but they muſt be of no particular Church, till they can be ſo on law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful terms. Even a Council of the Popes decreed, that till men can have lawful Paſtors, they muſt forbear that Communion that ſuppoſeth ſuch: And who can doubt of it?</p>

§ 21. XVII. Next, he quibbles onely with a Queſtion <hi>[How long ſhall it laſt?] Anſw.</hi> How long will you be of the Pariſh-Prieſts or the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſans Flock, or of a Phyſicians Hoſpital? We cannot ſecure men from providential changes a day, and therefore would not have them to binde themſelves but on ſuch ſuppoſitions—He that means to go to morrow to another Countrey, ſhould conſent but to this days Communion. He that intendeth here to dwell, muſt conſent to the relation of a ſtated Member of that Flock till he remove, or till God ſhew him juſt cauſe to change that relation: till then, he ſhould know his proper Paſtors.</p>
               <p>§ 22. XVIII. Next, he queſtioneth, <hi>[Who ſhall degrade them that prove Heretical or Scandalous?</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Anſ.</hi> The <hi>Ordainers</hi> made him a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> by <hi>Inveſtiture,</hi> &amp;c. and yet without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he was not related to us as our Paſtor, or we to him as part of that Church. And ſo we may withdraw our conſent, and become none of his ſpecial Church-flock, and leave it to the <hi>Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> to degrade him if he muſt be <hi>degraded,</hi> as to the world and Church Univerſal. One would think this Anſwer ſhould be undeniable. But he goeth on with his diſmal accuſations, <hi>p.</hi> 116. <hi>[The particular Church-covenant is a thing of mans invention, no where required of God; it is deſtructive to the Church and Souls, ſhould it be practiſed.] Anſ.</hi> Seeing Covenanting and known Conſenting are all one with him, what a dreadful damning ſin doth the man make it for to conſent to be under our Paſtors Office? Then he that would eſcape damnation muſt not conſent to the office
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64641:104"/>
of the Pariſh-prieſt, much leſs of the Biſhop: much leſs ſwear obedience to the Biſhop: And leaſt of all, ſay or ſwear <hi>never to endeavour any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> We have need to bleſs us from Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, if Conſenting be ſo damnable. But what meant he to ſay <hi>[ſhould it be practiſed?]</hi> Doth he not know that <hi>it is practiſed by them all?</hi> and ſo that this Judge doth damn them all.</p>
               <p>§ 23. XIX. He next anſwereth two of our <hi>pretences.</hi> 1. From the <hi>Election of Miniſters</hi> by the people: And ſaith, <hi>Election is quite another thing; till they are ordained, they are no men in office—but perſons deſigned—Anſ.</hi> Alas, that the man that hath all this while been damning others, ſhould not ſee that he hath ſo damned himſelf; yea, and quite exceeded my damning errour. This it is to print with the zeal deſcribed <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. before men know what it is that they talk of. Note, that he is not againſt the peoples <hi>election</hi> (if he be intelligible) and yet elſewhere <hi>[They are Rebels and no Chriſtians]</hi> that <hi>ſtand</hi> not to the King and Parliaments election. 2. Note, that he talks of one election, (to the Office of the Miniſtry as ſuch) and I talk of another election, even to be <hi>our particular Paſtor:</hi> For this Phyſician to be <hi>my Phyſician.</hi> 3. Note, that the mans bare word muſt, againſt all common uſe and reaſon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us that <hi>Conſent</hi> which I require is more than <hi>Election,</hi> which is much leſs. The <hi>Elector</hi> nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and firſt <hi>determineth</hi> of the perſon. <hi>Conſent</hi> may come after, even in obedience to the Elector. The King electeth the Biſhop, and the Patron the incumbent Parſon. Doth every one that after <hi>conſenteth</hi> do more? or muſt we lay by our ſenſes
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64641:104"/>
in believing ſuch Writers againſt damning er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? 4. Note, that he quite overgoeth the truth on the popular extream, which he accuſeth others of: As if the people muſt elect a man to the indefinite Office of a Miniſter as ſuch, which is falſe. Chriſt ſent out his Apoſtles, and the Apoſtles ſent abroad a converting Church-gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſtry without any popular election. The <hi>Ordainers</hi> muſt chuſe who ſhall be a Miniſter (by his conſent.) The Chriſtian people <hi>ſhould chuſe</hi> [and <hi>muſt conſent</hi> at leaſt] who ſhall be the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Guide of their own Souls; or <hi>their Paſtor</hi> in particular. And the Magiſtrate muſt chuſe, 1. Whom he will maintain and encourage. 2. Whom he will tolerate. How came he to think <hi>that Election is nothing to the caſe,</hi> as if <hi>Conſent</hi> were ſomething more? yet is he at it again, P. 119. <hi>[They make it another Baptiſm.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 24. XX. Next, he anſwereth our ſaying that <hi>[No man can be a Paſtor to a people againſt their wills.]</hi> And doth he ſay <hi>Yea,</hi> or <hi>Nay?</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plainly, but talks of ſomewhat elſe, and ſaith, <hi>[He is a Paſtor by Office and Calling whether the people will or not, and ſo Paſtor and people are not</hi> ſimul naturâ.] As if the equivocating with the word <hi>[Paſtor]</hi> warranted him to damn his Brethren, and confound Church-order: As <hi>[a Paſtor]</hi> ſignifieth but a <hi>Miniſter commiſſioned to become the actual undertaking Guide of a particular Church-flock when he is called to it;</hi> ſo this man may be called a <hi>Paſtor aptitudinal,</hi> as a man is a Captain that hath Commiſſion to raiſe a Troop: But as the word <hi>[Paſtor]</hi> ſignifieth one that is <hi>actually the Overſeer of a particular Church-flock,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:64641:105"/>
he is none till he have a Flock; and in both ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Paſtor and Flocks are relate and correlate, <hi>&amp; ſimul naturâ:</hi> that is, in the firſt, <hi>ſimul in eſſe cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito &amp; intentionali:</hi> In the later, <hi>in eſſe exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.</hi> But, ſaith he, <hi>[God is God whether the people will or no; and Chriſt is Chriſt, Apoſtles are Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles—and ſo faithful ordained Miniſters are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.] Anſ.</hi> This is but the fallacy of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid equivocation of the word <hi>[Paſtor.]</hi> 1. God is not made God, nor Chriſt made Chriſt, nor Apoſtles or indefinite Miniſters ſuch by contract or humane conſent: But he that ſaid, <hi>Come out from amongſt them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people,</hi> and maketh ſome a <hi>holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and peculiar people,</hi> &amp;c. is <hi>ſo related</hi> to none but <hi>Conſenters.</hi> Chriſt is an <hi>offered Saviour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſers;</hi> but he is not the Saviour and Head of any as Chriſtians, or a Church actually, but <hi>Conſenters:</hi> without conſent we are not <hi>materia diſpoſita</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive of the peculiar relation. A man may be <hi>authorized</hi> to be a Tutor, Schoolmaſter, Phyſician, Captain, Maſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without my conſent: but he is not my <hi>Tutor, Maſter,</hi> &amp;c. till I conſent, ſave aptitudinally, not actually. 2. And theſe relations are more dependent on humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or Conſent, than Gods being God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, ſaith he, <hi>[If all be Pagans, the Miniſter law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ordained and appointed to convert and baptize and be a Paſtor to them, is a true, full, and compleat Paſtor before he have chriſtened one ſoul of them. Anſ.</hi> True or falſe as the equivocation is taken: As one <hi>decreed</hi> to be a <hi>Husband</hi> to a Wife that is yet unborn, may by the deceiving improper lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of an equivocator be ſaid to be the <hi>true,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64641:105"/>
full and compleat Husband</hi> of her yet unborn or unmarried; that is, one <hi>deſigned</hi> to be a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hereafter in a proper ſenſe; ſo here. But <hi>Paſtor eſt ovium ſeu gregis Paſtor: Analogum per ſe poſitum ſtat pro ſignificato famoſiore.</hi> Heathens are no Church; <hi>Ergo,</hi> no man is a Paſtor of them as a Church.

               </p>
               <p>§ 25. XXI. But ſaith he, <hi>[Mark the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you are baptized a godly man; I have nothing againſt you, onely this, I cannot take you for one of my Flock, unleſs by a voluntary conſent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I muſt ſhut you out as an Apoſtate, or a Pagan.] Anſ. Calumny</hi> and <hi>Deceit</hi> conjunct. 1. It's immodeſt calumny to ſay, <hi>[as an Apoſtate or a Pagan]</hi> I take him for a Chriſtian, and on due teſtimony ſhall admit him to ſuch Communion (lawful) as he himſelf deſireth. 1. Whether as a Member of the Univerſal Church. 2. Or alſo as a fixed Member of another Church deſiring temporary tranſient Communion here. 2. It is groſs <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi> to ſay <hi>[I put him out]</hi> that refuſeth to come in. If I give him no more than he is willing of, what do I put him out from? If I take him not for a Member of my proper ſtated Charge, it is becauſe he deſireth it not. I thank God I never was a proper Paſtor to any People againſt their wills, nor ever will be, were I capable of more ſervice.</p>
               <p>§ 26. But, ſaith he, <hi>[This makes againſt you—Can any man forbid theſe people from being Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Particular Church that are of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal?] Anſ.</hi> Self-contradiction!

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64641:106"/>
themſelves? Doth the Phyſician forbid them to be his Patients that conſent not? Do we ſhut them out that will not come in? Yet he feigneth us to do no leſs <hi>than caſt them out of the Church Univerſal, as caſting them out of all Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars under Heaven. Anſ.</hi> Calumny hath got ſuch a channel, that his Writing runneth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly that way. 1. I caſt them out of no Church under Heaven, who will not conſent to come in. 2. Were they of no particular Church, they may be in the Univerſal, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved, of many ſorts.</p>
               <p>§ 27. He next noteth, that <hi>it is but ſignified Conſent that I require:</hi> But he ſaith, neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles mention it, and <hi>all the Church are without it. Anſ.</hi> Let us trie here whether this be true or falſe, and all his damning and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtning cenſures fall not on the Holy Ghoſt and all the Churches. I.

II. It is certain that theſe had <hi>fixed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi> of their own, that were related to them ſpecially as their <hi>ſpecial Charge,</hi> ſo as they were not related to all or any other Churches. III. It is certain that theſe Paſtors had not equal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to go into all other mens Dioceſſes or Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, and ſay, You are as much my Charge as any others, and play the Biſhops in other mens Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; though when they had a Call, they might be Miniſterial Temporary Helpers. IV. It is certain that theſe Paſtors were ſpecially obliged to many Offices for thoſe peculiar Flocks, which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64641:106"/>
to other Churches they were not ſo obliged to (but onely to occaſional help.) Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> nameth many of them, and ſo do the Scripture and Canons. 1. A conſtant publick Teaching them, which they owe not to all others or any. 2. Conſtant Government by the Keys. 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Adminiſtration of the Lords Supper. 4. Conſtant leading them in publick Worſhip, Prayer, Praiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. A ſpecial care of the Poor. 6. Ordinary Viſitation of the Sick. 7. Comforting the Afflicted, admoniſhing Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, watching over all. The Canons will tell you much, which every man oweth more to his own Charge than to others. V. It is certain that this Flock oweth a more ſpecial attendance, and account, and obedience to theſe Paſtors, than to Strangers or others of other Churches. 1. To hear them. 2. To receive the Communion or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily of them. 3. To maintain them; and ſo in the reſt. V. I. It is certain that none of this was done or can be done without mutual Conſent. VII. It is certain that this Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, Office, and Duty was ſetled by Chriſt's Apoſtles, and continued by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Churches on Earth from age to age.</p>

And <hi>Laodicea</hi> had a peculiar Church, <hi>v.</hi> 16. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 12, 13. ſheweth the common ſtate of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches: <hi>Know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you; and to eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake.

And ſhall a Chriſtian Miniſter ſay, <hi>[O but do not promiſe, no nor ſignifie any conſent to do it, for that is to be rebaptized, and is damning to the practiſers.]</hi> The Biſhops and Elders that <hi>Timothy</hi> is inſtructed about, were ſuch as had
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64641:107"/>
their proper Flocks, and took <hi>care of them</hi> as the <hi>Church of God,</hi> that were to <hi>rule them well, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> in the <hi>Word and Doctrine;</hi> to <hi>preach the word in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon,</hi> reprove, rebuke, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, with all long-ſuffering and Doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. the Elders that <hi>Peter</hi> writeth to were to <hi>feed the Flock of God which was among them,</hi> taking the <hi>overſight</hi> of them (more than of all the world) <hi>not by conſtrain, but willingly,</hi> (and may they not <hi>ſignifie willingneſs?)</hi> not as <hi>Lords, but Examples to their Flocks, and Shepherds under the chief Shepherd.</hi> Heb. 13. 7, 17, 24. ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſeth it, <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you;</hi> they watch for your Souls as thoſe that muſt give account, not of all the world, but of that Flock that they overſee. The ſame Church had Biſhops that had Deacons, and ſome Deaconeſſes, Widows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it was never known that Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons were to be indefinite Overſeers of the poor of all Churches, but they had ever relation to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches. This is the <hi>ordering</hi> of the Churches appointed by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Tit. 1. 5. And yet this man maketh it an abuſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury againſt Chriſt, and overthrow of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p>§ 29. II. As for the conſtant judgement and practice of all Churches, I am aſhamed that ſuch uſage ſhould put me to ſuch a work, as to prove that they ever held and practiſed that which this man condemneth in me. He knoweth nothing of the Churches ſtate, and Hiſtory, and Canons, that knoeth not, 1. That all Churches were So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of Chriſtians united under their proper known Biſhops or Paſtors, fixed to thoſe Flocks
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64641:108"/>
by proper relation, though alſo related to the World and the Church Univerſal. 2. That the people did not onely <hi>Conſent,</hi> but <hi>Chuſe</hi> their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and he was to be no Biſhop that had not their conſent. 3. That the Laity of other Churches promiſcuouſly had no power to chuſe them, but onely thoſe whom they were ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. 4. That the Biſhops, as <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſpeaks, were to know the particular Members of their Churches, and ſee that they came conſtantly to the Aſſemblies, even to <hi>enquire after Maids and Servants,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by name.</hi> 5. That they made multitudes of Canons for exerciſing particular Diſcipline on each perſon that needed it, by long ſuſpending ſome from Communion, reſtoring others, taking care of the poor and of all. 6. That they took not the Catechumens for the Church, but Candidates, and prepared and tried them before admittance. 7. That it was not mere baptizing that made them of that Flock; for they preached and baptized in other places. 8. That it was not mere neighbourhood of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; for there were ſometime divers Churches in one City, as in <hi>Meletius</hi> caſe at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thinks the Jewiſh and Gentile Chriſtians at firſt had ſeveral Biſhops and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the ſame Cities ordinarily. And the <hi>Audians, Luciferians, Donatiſts,</hi> and others that were of the ſame Religion, had divers Churches, beſides ſuch as the <hi>Novatians,</hi> that had ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Doctrinal differences: and none till now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought that theſe were all the ſame Paſtors ſpecial Flocks, and the ſame particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Yea, I have elſewhere cited that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64641:108"/>
that decreed that if any Biſhop neglected to convert the Hereticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he that converted them ſhould have them (as his Flock or Church.) In a word, all Church-hiſtory and Canons deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing their particular Churches, and their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Orders, Offices, Priviledges, Diſcipline, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and limiting them that ſtrove for the greateſt, from encroaching one on another, tell us ſo fully that they were ſo many <hi>incorporate Chriſtian Societies</hi> conſiſting by <hi>mutual Conſent</hi> of their <hi>proper Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Flocks,</hi> that <hi>Et pudet &amp; piget,</hi> that ſuch a task as the proofs ſhould be thus impoſed on me by a Miniſter.</p>
               <p>§ 30. The ſame is ſtill continued, even by the Conformiſts. 1. The Miniſters are even to <hi>ſwear Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Dioceſane,</hi> and the <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſane</hi> promiſe it to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop:</hi> And this is a Covenant and more. 2. They are to attend him at Viſitations, and otherwiſe to expreſs their conſent to his Government, which they do not to the Biſhop of the Neighbour-dioceſſes. 3. The Pariſhioners ſignifie their conſent to their Relation to that particular Church and Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, by their conſtant Attendance, Submiſſion, Communion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. The Law and Canon command their <hi>Conſent;</hi> yea, to keep their own Pariſhes, though the Miniſter preach not at all, ſuſpending Neighbour-miniſters that receive ſuch to their Communion that come from ſuch a Reader to them. And the Conformiſts ſay that men are bound to obey theſe Canons.</p>
               <p>§ 31. Either Pariſhioners are ſuppoſed thus to ſignifie Relation-conſent to that particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor and Church, or not: If yea, this Accuſer
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64641:109"/>
falſly ſuppoſeth that <hi>no Church</hi> but the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> do ſo. If not, then he giveth up moſt of their Cauſe to the Browniſts, that ſay the <hi>Pariſh-Churches</hi> are none: For it's eaſie proved that <hi>Non-conſenters</hi> are none. Thus raſh men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute themſelves. Nay we are all ſilenced for <hi>not Covenanting</hi> to the preſent frame of Dioceſane Churches, and <hi>never to endeavour an alteration.</hi> Yet ſaith this man <hi>[It is not in any of the Churches, unleſs Independents, neither explicite nor implicite.]</hi> Then none ſhould ſo much as implicitely ſhew Conſent to the Relation to his Dioceſane or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-paſtor or Church.</p>
               <p>§ 32. But ſaith he, (to me with groſs falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) <hi>[Your Covenant is to this effect, you ſhall not onely ſubmit to me as your Paſtor, but binde your ſelf by a particular antecedent Covenant ſo to do: You ſhall dwell in the Pariſh, and Covenant ſo to do, &amp;c.] Anſ.</hi> I wiſh, that though deſign brought the word <hi>Covenant</hi> infread of <hi>Conſent</hi> into his mouth, it might not ſo long ſtick there as to choak his Conſcience, to think that any uſe of it is lawful. Where and when did I engage any to dwell in the Pariſh? If they dwell there, I never hindred any from removing. 2. But the <hi>Conſent required is beforehand!</hi> very true. The Liturgie bids men come tell the Miniſters before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand that they deſire the Communion: Shall I ask them to conſent to their duty when it is paſt? Or can I know who are capable till I know who conſenteth? But, ſaith he, <hi>Why not à Church-Covenant for all other Duties? Anſ.</hi> Why not a Marriage-covenant to make one a Prieſt? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why not an Oath of Allegiance to make one a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64641:109"/>
Coblar? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Conſent neceſſary to the being of a Relation, is one thing; and Conſent to every Duty, is another; which yet in general all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould promiſe ſincerely to perform. Muſt we write Books againſt ſuch things as theſe?</p>
               <p>§ 33. To the Objection, <hi>[I am not bound to take every one that comes into the Pariſh for one of my Charge:</hi> he hath no better anſwer than to tell us of Pariſh-bounds ſetled by law, and bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me to do my beſt for all.] <hi>Anſ.</hi> Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully confounding <hi>[Charge]</hi> the <hi>Genus</hi> with <hi>[Church:]</hi> As if Heathens, and Atheiſts, and Papiſts, and Refuſers are of that <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe I have a Charge to ſeek their Converſion: Or as if I had no ſpecial Charge of that Church. 2. He did not ſee that he confuteth himſelf, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that we <hi>muſt conſent</hi> becauſe of <hi>the Law.</hi> 3. And he forgot the many hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Pariſh-diviſions.</p>
               <p>§ 34. His zeal at laſt thus ſwelleth <hi>[p.</hi> 129. <hi>I do utterly withſtand it, as wickedneſs and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Gods Church: I am to die and burn at a Stake before I yield to any ſuch thing.

You will make me think you are deeply melancholy! Is it ſo frightful a thing for me to ſay, <hi>I will be no Paſtor to any that conſent not,</hi> as to put you into talk of <hi>dying and burning at a Stake?</hi> Had the

Which is liker to be the burning party! they that ſay <hi>[We will rule none but Conſenters or Volunteers,]</hi> or they that call this <hi>wickedneſs and abomination,</hi> and ſo are for the contrary courſe?

               <p>I Had thought to have gone thus over the reſt of his Book; but it is ſuch ſtuff, that my Reaſon and Conſcience bid me ſpare my own and the Readers time. I. He begins with tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me <hi>what the Church of</hi> England <hi>is,</hi> and all is worſe than nothing: Inſtead of telling me what is the <hi>Conſtitutive, Formal, Regent part,</hi> he tells me of Biſhops, Paſtors, Convocation, King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if he defined a Man to be one that hath a Head, Eyes, Liver, Stomack, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> II. It grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me to read what he ſaith of Popery. 1. His Suppoſition that Popery is ſound, if the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church be a part of the Univerſal, having its ſubordinate form of Government under Chriſt's. 2. His Suppoſition of the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>'s turning Chriſtian, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Univerſal Prince and Biſhop of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as a lawful thing. 3. His Suppoſition of the Pope's reſigning his Place to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> if he were alive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. His Note that to claim but St.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64641:110"/>
                  <hi>Peter</hi>'s Place is not to claim Chriſt's, with more ſuch, are unwiſe Temptations to Strangers to fear leſt <hi>London-</hi>Air have done him hurt. III. His many words about the Princes power to chuſe Paſtors for all his Subjects, and that if faithful, he is no <hi>Chriſtian that refuſeth to accept them.</hi> 1. Is all a bare ſaying over what he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; taking little or no notice of my Diſcourſe on that ſubject in my firſt Plea; where all that's againſt us is anſwered before, and I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it. 2. And it ſhamefully condemneth his foreſaid Condemnations. Is not <hi>Conſent</hi> then neceſſary to the impoſed Paſtor, if <hi>not conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Unchriſten men?</hi> 3. It ſuppoſeth that the political Controverſie <hi>[Whether the King be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by God to chuſe what paſtoral Guide all the Subjects ſhall truſt their Souls with?]</hi> (any more than what Tutor, Phyſician, Wife, Diet, they ſhall take) is an eſſential of Chriſtianity, and yet it is not in the Creed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When yet it is notorious that all Churches for moſt Ages ſince Chriſt, if not almoſt all in the world to this day, were and are of the contrary minde, and ſo are all unchriſtened by him. 4. And though I urge him, he will not anſwer what I ſaid of the Queſtion, <hi>Who ſhall judge whether the Miniſter be faithful?</hi> 5. If the Patron preſent a weak ignorant man, that is faithful, but of little uſe comparatively; and people that feel their need, and regard Eternity, chuſe before him ſuch a one as <hi>Hilderſham, Rogers, Dod, Preſton, &amp;c.</hi> he declareth them not onely Sinners, but <hi>Rebels againſt Chriſt, and no Chriſtians.</hi> IV.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64641:112"/>
And I hear by my Neighbours when they fall out about <hi>Intereſt</hi> or <hi>Words,</hi> that without a School or Univerſity, they can attain to copious fluent pungent Oratory, to deſcribe each other as all that is nought; and prove all ſo undeniably by vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſeveration or Oath, that he ſhall paſs for Criminal that will not take their words for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.

                  <hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Gardiner</hi> were ſuch, and that it is much of the Roman-Catholick Infallibility: for ſure they durſt not wrack, burn, and maſſacre, and ruine all ſorts, for that which they did not think themſelves certain of; yea, and certainly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the noble ends of Unity, Government, and Peace.</p>
               <p>§ 2. To talk it out to the laſt with theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Talkers, is a task for one that hath as <hi>many Tongues</hi> as all they, and is as ready a Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſt, and that is like to overlive them, and that hath no better work to do, and that thinketh that they will read or hear him without the ferment of tumifying impatient Pride: Or elſe that it is neceſſary to ſave the endangered people from ſeduction, to overtalk the ſeducers in length and number of words, and that Souls are ſtill unſafe and looſe to the truth, as long as there are any to talk againſt it. I confeſs, that if you will hive the Swarm aright, it is uſually neceſſary that with a lowder noiſe you drown the Voice of the Miſleader.

Do not men pay dearer for a place in a Play-houſe, than in the Church? And I have oft heard ſome gentile Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſay, that <hi>they can profit more by a Play than by a Sermon.</hi> You think that ſuch Books will make the Book-ſellers-ſhops, like the <hi>Toy-ſhops:</hi> And what if they do? Will there not be <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>indulgent Parents</hi> while the world laſteth? What Shops have more trading, or ſeldomer break, than Toy-ſhops, that ſell Babies, and Puppets, and Hobby-horſes, and Pipes? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thoſe that ſell Perriwigs, Pide-ſilks and Ribbons? You think that the Book-ſellers Shops will grow like Ale-houſes and Taverns which ſober men will rarely viſit. And what

Can I expect that men that never were ſtudious or bookiſh, eſpecially in matters of Divinity and Holineſs, but have been bred up in fulneſs and pleaſure, in courtſhip and converſe with ſuch as themſelves, who will take him for a Fanatick that doth but talk much and ſeriouſly of Heaven, or Scripture, or things Divine, that ſcarce ever heard what a Nonconformiſt hath to ſay for himſelf, nor ever ſeriouſly examined the cauſe, or read a Book which openeth their caſe in all their lives. I ſay, can I expect that ſuch ſhould be able or willing to underſtand us? I mean, not as if <hi>All were ſuch;</hi> but it hath been my hard hap to meet with few perſons, even of Gentile

               <p>§ 5. And it is a great advantage which they have got by the <hi>Oxford-Act</hi> of baniſhing above five Miles from Cities and Corporations all that ſwear not as is there required.

Thorny-hedge in the midſt of this part of the Vineyard of Chriſt, to ſeparate one part of the faithful Miniſters and people from the reſt: And that I earneſtly deſire to ſee that Wall or Hedge pull'd down, that Chriſt's Flock among us may be one: And I will do the beſt I can whilſt I live to get it down, that there may be no ſuch ſeparation. And ſeeing this is a work above my power, I will go ſometime on both ſides the Hedge, though by ſo doing I be ſcratcht, and a Thorn in the Fleſh by a buffetting Meſſenger of Satan reprehend me. But reverend Doctors hear my Reaſons: It is not to avoid Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but Separation. I am a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and not a <hi>Sectary:</hi> I am for Communion with the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church: If you will hedge in one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the Anabaptiſts another, and the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts another; and ſo other Sects that muſt have their peculiars, and turn Chriſt's houſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſeveral Chambers, and his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field into your little Incloſures; and then ſay, Keep onely in our Room, and go into no other; Keep onely in our Encloſure, and go not on the other ſide of the Hedge: I ſhall tell you, that I abhor your ſeparation. I have buſineſs on both ſides: I believe the holy Catholick Church and the Communion of Saints, and not onely your Encloſure, and the Communion of your Conformiſts: I have ſome buſineſs on your ſide the Hedge, the Law and your own expectation will tell you part of it: I ſee ſome of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Family with you. I have buſineſ, on the other ſide the Hedge: There are as good as you; and ſuch as I am neerly related to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

Your thorn-hedge hath encloſed but one corner of Chriſts Vineyard, and I have buſineſs in the reſt: It hath ſeparated Parents from Children, Husbands from Wives, as to Church-communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Maſters and Servants, Brethren from Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Neighbours from Neighbours: If they that made the hedge can juſtifie it, let them do it, it will be tryed before a jealous God ere long! if thoſe of you that in learned Books and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons exhort us (with ſomewhat hiſſing Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick) to ſeparate from thoſe on the other ſide the hedge, can prove that themſelves are all Chriſts Church, and that God would have us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from all ſave them, and give over Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and all publick Worſhip of God, till we can conſcionably conform to all their Impoſitions: I ſay, if all theſe ſilencing Preachers can make good their accuſation of the Brethren, and their concluſions, let them that undertake it ſpeed as they perform it: but for my part, I will not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from Father, Mother, Brother, Friend, and all good Chriſtians ſave a domineering Sect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Sect will elſe call me <hi>Separatiſt.</hi> I was wont to draw the Map of the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal as one Body or Field, or Vineyard of Chriſt, hedged in indeed round about from Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and diſtributed into thouſands of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, as Streets and Families in one City: But if any will ſay, Hold Communion

with one <hi>Street</hi> or <hi>Family,</hi> and ſeparate from the reſt, and then ſay that you are a Schiſmatick for not being for that odious Schiſm; I will hear ſuch, as I do the people that talk through the windows on the weſt ſide of <hi>Moor-fields,</hi> when they ſay that all are <hi>mad</hi> or <hi>Schiſmatical,</hi> that are not in their Cubs and Chains. Mr. <hi>Cheney</hi> was never there I think, and yet it was <hi>(per album an atrum neſcio)</hi> revealed to him that I am down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right for an Independant Covenant, which hath twenty Arguments extant to batter it, and prove it guilty of irreligiouſneſs, or ſomewhat worſe: And they ſay (for I am not acquainted much with their practice) that the Independent bind their flock to hold Communion with none but their own Sect, nor to depart without leave from their particular Churches. I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are ſlandered (for whoever falls ſick, I will firſt fear the moſt epidemical or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſeaſe:) but if it be no ſlander, I profeſs that I will never be of a particular Church, which claims to be the univerſal, and will forbid me Communion with all ſave them. And if in this the Prelatiſts agree with the Independents, I am againſt the ſeparating, Sectarian, Schiſmatical preſumption of them both. I take the Kitching and Cole-houſe to be parts of the houſe, and I have ſometimes buſineſs in them both.

               <p>§ 1. CHriſt ſaith, that the <hi>Devil is the Father of Lies;</hi> and doubtleſs he hath ſubtilty to excuſe them and improve them: and it is a great advantage to them, that they are ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned by humane nature, that it is taken for an injury to humanity, to charge any man to be a Lyar; and a Ruffian will ſay it deſerveth a challenge or a ſtab. You will think it a paradox, that natural diſlike ſhould be turned to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a ſin. But it is but natural light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the underſtanding, not changing or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the will againſt it. And therefore it is but pride of reputation and impenitency, that is indeed the fortreſs of the ſin.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Accordingly it hath many times been my hard hap, to have ſuch Books written againſt me, (and that by men whoſe Reputation is not undervalued by themſelves or their followers) as were to be anſwered chiefly by a <hi>Mentiris</hi> from end to end, if it would not ſeem by cuſtom to be uncivil. And to tire the Reader by turning a <hi>Mintiris</hi> into a civil long Parentheſis, and this as frequently as groſs falſhoods are openly ſaid or intimated, is tedious, even when neceſſary. With one I was put to uſe my Arithmetick, and to anſwer him by numbring the <hi>untruths</hi> aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64641:117"/>
But I have forborn it with others far more guilty, leſt their reverence and power ſhould make truth intolerable, whoſe paſſion or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or errour, had made groſs Lies ſeem true and neceſſary.</p>
               <p>§ 3. This Impleader hath been taught too much by the ſame. Maſter; and had he not ſpent part of his Book on Doctrinals, where his <hi>Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> are but <hi>mendae,</hi> but been all Hiſtorical where there are too many <hi>Mendacia,</hi> I might have been put to the way of anſwering before-mentioned: But be they <hi>Mendae</hi> or <hi>Mendacia,</hi> they need <hi>aniend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the Reader may need an antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>

               <p>§ 5. The ſame is repeated p. 1. <hi>[He pretends to give Reaſons for the ſinfulneſs of Conformity,</hi> M. 2.] And he overpaſſeth the chief part of my Book, in which I ſtate the caſe of Government and Separation, on pretence that it is <hi>[a dark and dirty way in which I have loſt my ſelf.</hi> M. 3. And a little will ſatisfie him, that regards ſuch an eaſie, dark and dirty anſwer.</p>

might have coſt both Printer and Writer dear: And the Book was written divers years (as many can witneſs) before the Act that reſtrained the Preſs expired. And is it not credible that every man loveth himſelf, and is unwilling to be rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? I knew how eaſily you are diſpleaſed, and I felt a little what you can do when you are diſpleaſed, and others felt more. And is it hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie then to ſay, <hi>I feared to diſpleaſe you?</hi> And verily, I was afraid by it of occaſioning your wrath and contentious Writings againſt many others, and making the breach wider, which I deſired to heal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When it's viſible in the Book that I avoid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation, doth not that prove that I ſaid true?</p>

Who would have thought that there had been ſuch men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, and Paſtors of a Reformed Church? But I do not believe that there are many ſuch, that think it morally poſſible that we ſhould all believe all Conformity lawful; they would never elſe have truſted ſo much to Mulcts and Jails, as to think their Church undone without thoſe Helps.

               <p>Judge by theſe Evidences of this mans Wit and wondering. 1. By the <hi>great number</hi> of the things which we judge ſinful: They might diſpute men into their Opinion in ſome <hi>few dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,</hi> that cannot in ſo many. 2.

Conſider the <hi>quality</hi> of the ſilenced Miniſters: Could they think that ſuch men as <hi>Anthony Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Sam.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64641:122"/>
Did they never read or hear what might be ſaid for the New-Conformity? Had they not Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Wit enough to underſtand it? Or had they no Conſcience living or dying? So many hundreds that after their beſt enquiries, and hearing all, remain Non-Conformiſts, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to be all brought to Conform. 5. Judge by old experience: Were old <hi>Hilderſham, Ames, Dod,</hi> and hundreds like them, brought to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity heretofore? Mr. <hi>Sprint,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> and ſome others were, but more were not. Did not even the <hi>Weſtminſter-</hi>Aſſembly of old Conformiſts forſake it aſſoon as they could? 6. Judge by the change of the Caſe, and the Writings even of the old Conformiſts: Such things are put into the New-Conformity, as <hi>Bilſon, Hooker, Uſher,</hi> and other old Conformiſts have written againſt. And would they alſo repent and change their minds, if they were alive?

Burges, Sprint,</hi> and ſuch others of their minde that writ for the old Conformity bin alive, they would all have bin Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts to our new Impoſitions. 7. Judge by the <hi>means that are uſed</hi> to convince us: Is there any thing ſaid that hath ſuch cogent Evidence as to convert ſo many hundred men to your Opinions? Did ſuch men as Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Herle,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> &amp;c. want the Inſtruction of our preſent Lords, to make them wiſe enough to Conform? When I know none of the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts writings that have ſo much as named ſome
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64641:122"/>
of the things that we think worſt of. 8. Judge by preſent Experience: Why is it not done, if it be morally poſſible? Have you not had near twenty years Trial, by your Reaſonings, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, Writings, Reproaches, Allurements, Threatnings, Canons, Fines, Jails, Informers, crying out for execution of the Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is it yet done? Have there not ſince more (of the Laity) turned from you, than have turned to you? Will not Experience convince you? 9. Judge by the great diverſity of mens conditions and capacities, which I have elſewhere opened. Will ever men of ſuch different Capacities, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> agree in ſuch and ſo many things? 10. Judge by the requiſites to ſuch a Concord. It muſt be by bringing all the Miniſtry to a higher degree of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Honeſty</hi> than all the Nonconformiſts. For it can be nothing that you think keeps us from Conforming, but <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Badneſs.</hi> (Dr. <hi>Aſheton</hi> undertaketh, as going to the bar of God, to prove that it is <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Covetouſneſs)</hi> And how can you hope to make us all ſo much <hi>Wiſer</hi> and <hi>Better</hi> than we are?

What Credit then is to be given to ſuch mens Hiſtory or Reports? Is this it in which the Authority of Archbiſhops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, that they muſt be followed in ſlanders? No: It is not their Obedience to Archbiſhops, but their Conformity to a calumniating Spirit: For <hi>Brambal</hi>'s Predeceſſor, Arch-Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> (a man honoured by all good men that knew him,

But being at <hi>London</hi> a year or two before he died, the Lord <hi>Broghil</hi> (ſince Earl of <hi>Orery)</hi> would needs bring me to him; where I dealt ſo plainly with him, in demanding by what Right, againſt the Will of almoſt all the Kingdom, he pull'd down our lawful <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy that we were ſworn to, and the Parliament, as caſt him into ſuch Paſſion, as broke out in reviling many of the worthieſt Parliament-men, that he knew me to be familiar with. The laſt time the Earl of <hi>Orery</hi> ſaw me, he told me, he had told the King of that Conference, and that he ſhould love me the better while he lived, for my Faithfulneſs. He and <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Thurloe</hi> were (ſilently) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. A Twelvemonth after, Sir <hi>Francis Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole</hi> would needs diſpute me into Repentance for being for the Parliaments Cauſe, by way of Writing: I told him, that the ſad effects were enough to make us all ſuſpicious; but I would give him thoſe Reaſons that had moved me, with a true deſire to know the full truth, that if I had erred, I might not remain through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance without Repentance: He wrote to me, that in the mean time, ſeeing I was ſatisfied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Cromwels</hi> Uſurpation, I ſhould go to <hi>London</hi> to ſet it upon his Conſcience to perſwade him to reſtore our preſent King: I ſent him

My deep diſpleaſure againſt the Madneſs of the Army, that had rebelliouſly pull'd down all Power, King, Parliaments, and at laſt him whom they ſet up themſelves, drew me firſt to write the ſad Meditations in the end, and then a ſharp Preface to the Army againſt

I never ſpake with one of them; but I have heard ſo credible teſtimony of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, eſpecially of <hi>Hampden</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> that I am far more confident that they are in Heaven than that ſuch as you will ever come thither. Impartial men of both ſides honoured them; I heard an antient grave Gentleman, that was no Phanatick, nor accounted a Puritan, but a ſober honeſt man, ſay, 1644. <hi>[If I might chooſe what perſon in all the world I would be, I would be</hi> John Hampden.]</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not only Biſhop <hi>Jer. Tailor,</hi> but Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians commonly that acknowledge, that <hi>It hath not pleaſed God to make Politick Caſes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64641:126"/>
and forms of Power ſo eaſie to us, as that all good Chriſtians can decide the Controverſies about them.</hi> It's commonly agreed, that God hath not forbidden Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, Democracy, or Mixt Government; nor made only one of theſe to be lawful. And it is paſt Controverſie then, that it is <hi>National Fundamental conſtituting Contracts, Laws or Cuſtoms,</hi> and not any <hi>expreſs Scripture,</hi> that muſt tell us <hi>de facto &amp; jure,</hi> what is the <hi>Species</hi> of each Countreys Government. It is not in the Creed, Lords-Prayer, Decalogue, or Sacraments: Therefore the knowledge of it is not of abſolute Neceſſity to Salvation: I finde it not in the condition of the Covenant of Grace. Methinks they that ſay Heathens may be ſaved, ſhould grant it of Chriſtians that know not when a ſinful diviſion falls out between King and Parliament (and that with many difficult circumſtances) which it is that ſhould be then obeyed or defended. Chriſt was drawn by Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites to pay Tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> rather than offend; but he would not be drawn to juſtifie his Dominion over the Jews. <hi>Paul</hi> commands Obedience to the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> as of God, and as watching for our good: But he would not be drawn to declare, Whether it was <hi>Caeſar</hi> or the Senate which was the Higher Power, when they came to be divided in their Commands.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I have produced too large Teſtimony from Antiquity, how ordinarily the Biſhops of Eaſt and Weſt too quickly owned and praiſed the Uſurpers of the Empire, when once in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Not only the Synods in <hi>Martius</hi> time that owned <hi>Maximus,</hi> but <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Theopl. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and.</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:64641:127"/>
to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, and many Weſtern Biſhops, and ordinarily far moſt of the Eaſtern Biſhops preſently owned Uſurpers, that came into the Empire by the Murder or Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their Predeceſſors. And are all theſe Fathers and Chriſtians damn'd?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Liturgie requires that when ſuch are Buried, they are openly pronounced ſaved; that is, <hi>That God of his great Mercy hath taken to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf their Souls out of the miſeries of this Life, and that we hope to be with them:</hi> We muſt be Silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and Impriſoned if we will not ſay this, and ſubſcribe to it, and reproached if we do: This is the Conformity which they would have us yield.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Do you not tremble your ſelf, when you que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether they be not gone to a worſe place and revile us for the hopes of their Salvation? Doth not your Conſcience ask, If ſuch men be not ſaved, what will become of me, that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately write ſuch Volumes of Falſhoods againſt God's true Servants, and their preſent ſerving him, as if they muſt ceaſe Preaching and all Church-worſhip, till they dare Conform to all impoſed? O why will you condemn your ſelf in others!</p>
               <p n="7">7. I finde many of your ſelves honouring Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and ſuch others that held the Principles which thoſe men went upon; and you never yet, that I heard of, reviled any man for hoping that they were ſaved: No nor <hi>Grotius,</hi> nor <hi>Barclay,</hi> nor the common ſort of Lawyers, and Politick-Writers, that have ſaid more of the Caſes in which Kings
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64641:127"/>
may be Reſiſted and Depoſed, than they did, or than I ever ſaid. If ſuch Principles may ſtand with the Salvation of <hi>Grotius, Hooker, Bilſon, Althuſius, Alſtedius, Willius,</hi> &amp;c. Why not of theirs that I have mentioned?</p>
               <p n="8">8. You know, I ſuppoſe, that it was moſtly Epiſcopal men that began the War; Lords, Commons, and Souldiers on both ſides. (If you <hi>will</hi> not <hi>know,</hi> and can be ignorant when you liſt, your Will hath a freedom which mine hath not.) And are you ſure that your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts alſo are damned?</p>
               <p n="9">9. You hereby teach them that are confident that the <hi>Laudian Clergie</hi> were the chief Cauſers of the War, to conclude therefore that they are damned. And ſo our Clergy on both ſides will be like <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh's and the Emperour's in <hi>Germany,</hi> firſt exciting and encouraging the Princes and People of the two ſides, and then taking Oaths againſt each other, and laſtly damning one another; till a Reverend Council of Biſhops Decreed, that all the Biſhops on the Emperours ſide ſhould be Depoſed, and the Dead digg'd out of their Graves and burnt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. You will open the eyes of the people to ſee what manner of Spirit you are of, and that it is no wonder if you cannot endure us to Preach and Live by you; who take us for Criminal for hoping that men are ſaved, who otherwiſe were of moſt exemplary Lives; but being in point of Politiques on the Parliaments ſide, and doing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, while they profeſſed to arm only againſt Subjects, holding the perſon of the King to be inviolable. I finde not that even in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64641:128"/>
Barons Wars, or the Wars between the Houſes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> no nor King <hi>Stephens,</hi> the Cenſures were ſo high. <hi>Anſelme</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is Sainted, that was againſt his King.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I believed then that it was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, when their Commiſſions were for him. 2. I propoſed my Reaſons upon a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Knights demand, requeſting ſatisfaction by an Anſwer: And had you or any of you ever ſince confuted them, it had been more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than only to Recite them and Condemn them. But I have over and over publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my revocation of that whole Book, (though not of all that's in it) and wiſht that I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver written it, for more Reaſons than I will now name to you. 3. My Judgment about the King's Power, and our Obedience, I have fully declared in <hi>The Second Plea for Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 18. The third Accuſation is, <hi>[His pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious adhering to the Covenant.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The man knoweth that I own not the impoſing it, ſpecially as a Teſt for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Concord, it being an engine of Diviſion ſo impoſed. 2. That I own not the taking it ſo impoſed. 3. That I deny that it obligeth me to any thing that is evil, yea or from any Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the King in things lawful, nor to any thing but what I have a former obligation to from God himſelf. 4. But I confeſs that I dare not ſay, that it obligeth no man to repent of his Sin, nor to be againſt Popery, Prophaneneſs or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64641:128"/>
Schiſm, nor to endeavour any amendment of Church-Government. And I will not deny, but that I take Perjury to be no indifferent thing; which of theſe is the Crime of Adherence, he tells me not.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The next Accuſation is, <hi>[Crying down the Royal Martyr as a Papiſt.]</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have ſaid, Till he tell me where, and how he proveth it, I muſt take him for a groſs Calumniator, and wonder not that he Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. In my <hi>Key for Catholicks</hi> he may ſee where I prove the contrary, that the King was no Papiſt. I will confeſs that which he knoweth not: 1662, and 1663. when the Kings Letter in <hi>Spain</hi> to the Pope was Printed out of Mr. <hi>de Cheſne</hi> by <hi>Prynne,</hi> I was ſtruck a while with doubt and ſuſpicion; But I ſoon conſidered, 1. That the words promiſed but Endeavours for Unity. 2. And that it was written in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> power, in a ſtreight.</p>
               <p>§ 20. The next is, <hi>[Crying up his Murderer.]</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A repeated malicious falſhood.</p>
               <p>§ 21. The next Accuſation is, <hi>[His Principles in his Holy Commonwealth.]</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I oft told you, <hi>The Book is revoked long ago.</hi> 2. The Principles which I own I have publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as aforeſaid in the <hi>Third</hi> Plea: and he doth not confute them. 3. Of the Wars I ſpake before: What other doth he name? Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited many of them; and the <hi>firſt</hi> as I remember was, that I ſay, <hi>[That pretence to unlimited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is unlawful, or Tyranny, becauſe God hath Limited all Humane Power.]</hi> If this be Hereſie or Diſloyalty, I hold it ſtill: I miſtake much, if
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64641:129"/>
any Kings have Power from God to command all their Subjects to blaſpheme or deny God or Chriſt, or to renounce his hope of Heaven, or to worſhip the Devil, and ſell his Soul to him, nor to murder Father, Mother, Wife or Children. I will venture to diſpute this with any Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt. But as to the harder queſtion, Whether Kings may kill any or all their Senators or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Subjects for nothing, or burn all their Cities, or take all their Wives, Children and Eſtates, I will leave it to Stateſmen to debate. I am ſorry that ever I wrote ſo much about their matters.</p>
               <p>§ 22. The next charge is, <hi>[His preſent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices in defending Schiſm.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Prove it, or number it with your Slanders. What is the Schiſm? Is it Schiſm to ſay, <hi>That it is unlawful like Atheiſts to ceaſe all Publick Worſhip of God, till Conſcience can finde it lawful to Conform?</hi> Others think that the contrary is both Schiſmatical and Atheiſtical. Can you prove that I am for Silencing faithful Miniſters, and making partition ſeparating hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Vineyard of Chriſt? My Rule is, to go no further from any Chriſtian than he goeth from Chriſt, or would force me to ſin for his Communion.</p>
               <p>§ 23. The next charge is, <hi>Sedition;</hi> that is, not giving over God's Worſhip, till I can ſwear, ſay and do all that is impoſed. Where is the proof of all theſe Accuſations? But their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Juſtice is, firſt to do execution (caſting out 2000) and next to juſtifie it by an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation behinde our backs, and next to bring
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64641:129"/>
their Witneſſes, when we are dead or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to ſpeak; and they are one anothers Witneſſes. This mans proof is, that Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſaid it: The next mans may be, that <hi>This</hi> man ſaid it: Dr. <hi>Aſhetons</hi> proof was, that the <hi>Debate-maker</hi> ſaid it; and who ſaid it to him I know not.</p>
               <p>And p. 100. This man hath an infallible wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi> then of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> And what ſaith he? Why firſt, <hi>That I did what I could to make the King odious to his people.</hi> But where's his proof? It's enough; The Biſhop ſaid it. 2. <hi>I ſowed the ſeeds of Sedition at</hi> Kederminſter: The proof is the ſame; the Biſhop ſaid it. 3. The Biſhop taught him to adde, <hi>[I my ſelf have heard him, in a Conference in the</hi> Savoy, <hi>maintain ſuch a Poſition, as was deſtructive to the Legiſlative Power of God and man.]</hi> But what if the Biſhop ſpake as falſely, as if he had ſaid that I pleaded for <hi>Mahomet?</hi> Where is your proof then? I after Printed the words with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute of the Dr's, to which they were an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: And I have in my Second Plea, in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation of Scandal, vindicated them. Let any man of brains read both, and believe the Biſhop and you if he can. But, Reader, if ſuch mens renewed Accuſations cauſe me yet to Print that Anſwer to the Biſhop's Letter, which for peace I caſt away; blame not me, but them that force me to it: I am for peace, but they are for War.</p>
               <p>§ 24. But what good will it do the Reader, to have this mans Falſhoods detected and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred?
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64641:130"/>
They are ſo many and ſo groſs, that it is a troubleſome work; as p. 107. <hi>[Your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which aſſert, that the King may be Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.]</hi>

As far as I can remember, it was ſhortly after the <hi>Savoy-</hi>Conference, that the firſt Copy was written; but juſt the Month I do not remember. 2. Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Copy among my rude neglected Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, I wrote it fair in 1671. And my Memory is not ſo ſtrong, as to be ſure that I altered not a word: For I caſt away the firſt rude Copy. 3. After that, I thought it had been loſt, not ſeeing it ſome years: Till Mr. <hi>Matthew Silveſter</hi> told me, that I had long ago lent it him to read: I did not think it worth the Publiſhing. But one of judgment that he ſhewed it to, thinking otherwiſe, I added a few Lines in the End: This is the Truth, and if it be the Impleaders intereſt to believe it to be falſe, let him uſe his Intellect and Pen accordingly, I'le no more ſtrive againſt him.</p>

root of the firſt difference between the old Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts and Conformiſts, <hi>One part cleaving to the Scripture, and the other being for reteining all that came in before</hi> 600, <hi>and common to them with the</hi> Greeks, <hi>[which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doubtleſs was the ſounder Opinion; ſo that the Foundation of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity was laid on a falſe Principle, and they that built thereon frequently raiſed Sedition,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They that thought each mutable circumſtance of Worſhip muſt have a particular Command in Scripture, erred; but there were few ſuch, at leaſt of any Learning: But thoſe that took the Law of God in Nature and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for the only and perfect univerſal Law, did not erre.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So many Corruptions in Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Diſcipline came in <hi>before</hi> 600, and are <hi>reteined by the</hi> Greek <hi>Church,</hi> that we cannot make that the meaſure of our Reformation: If you are for all <hi>[that is common to the Papiſts and</hi> Greeks] How prove you that you may Silence and Impriſon all that are not?</p>
               <p n="3">3. And if this be the Rule, you are yet ill reformed. It is more than three and three Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Additions which you yet want, which the Papiſts have: I could name ſuch a Catalogue as might make <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> better underſtand what your Conforming Principles are, and what muſt be further expected when you are able. And the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> will tell us, when once <hi>England</hi> is of the <hi>Greek</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, how poſſible it is to ſtep over to the Pope. But why doth not the Church of <hi>England</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the <hi>Greek</hi> Church now, if it be ſo great
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64641:133"/>
a Duty, as will warrant the Silencing and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning of Refuſers? I hear but of few that grow in love with their Worſhip, ſince the <hi>Greeks</hi> had a Church in <hi>London;</hi> eſpecially Scholars that underſtand them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But what if the firſt Non-Conformiſts er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? What's that to us any more than to you? We reverence the Primitive Example more than theirs; and never took them for the Maſters of our Faith.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Your Charge of their <hi>Sedition</hi> is much more ſharply laid on the Proteſtants in general by <hi>Pateſon, the Image of both Churches,</hi> and by <hi>Philanax Anglicus,</hi> and many others, than you lay it on the old Non-conformiſts: and all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can talk at that rate againſt others, as <hi>Pryn</hi> doth of <hi>Prelates Treaſons.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I have anſwered this to Mr. <hi>Cheney:</hi> There is an Interpretation which giveth us the general obliging ſence of the Law; which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience

muſt judge by, if we will ſubſcribe: and this belongeth only to the Lawgivers, as I have proved. And there is an Interpretation which only directs the Judicial Sentence, in this or that mans particular Caſe, as whether he ſhall be puniſhed as guilty or not; and this is it that belongeth to the Judges: If the Judges will put a falſe ſence on the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy, I may not take them in that ſence. Their Expoſitory Power muſt direct their own Sentence, and that the Execution; but if I be put to Swear or ſubſcribe my ſelf to any impoſed words, no Judge can Abſolve me from taking them <hi>in the uſual ſence, unleſs the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers give another.</hi> This is our Rule, and we dare not Equivocate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to your confuſed talk, that <hi>[Magiſtrates can diſpenſe with the leſſer parts of the Law,]</hi> it is uſeleſs to me: The Lawgivers can expound, ſuſpend and change the Law: The Executive Magiſtrate can ſuſpend his own Sentence and Execution in ſome caſes; but not the ſence of the Law, nor allow my Conſcience to change the ſence.</p>
               <p>§ 6. Impl. <hi>[All that is required by the Act, is unfeignedly to Aſſent and Conſent that there is ſuch a meaſure of Truth and Goodneſs in the Book of Common Prayer, as qualifies it for the publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God.]</hi>

If the <hi>[all things]</hi> in the Books, mean not <hi>[all the words]</hi> but <hi>[things]</hi> diſtinct from <hi>[words]</hi> I would we could know what they are: Sure it is not the <hi>Paper and Ink</hi> that the Parliament mean.

               <p n="4">4.

               <p>§. 9. Whereas the Commons brought the Lords to agree with them, for not limiting the ſenſe of the Declaration of Aſſent and Conſent to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of all; he anſwereth, 1.

of this he cannot truely ſay that I am the firſt.</p>
               <p>I proved from the impoſed words and ends, that it is appointed to the uſes of a Sacrament, but indeed not by Chriſt, and therefore is but a humane Sacrament; And I anſwered his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to Mr. <hi>Che.</hi> which he taketh no notice of.</p>
               <p>He cites me as ſaying, that Parents may offer their Children to Baptiſm, though they cannot have it without the Croſs, it being the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſin, and not theirs. And what then? Is it therefore none of the Miniſters ſin, 1. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it. 2. To uſe it. 3. To refuſe to Chriſten Children whoſe Parents dare not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it. 4. Nor the Biſhops to ſilence Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that refuſe ſuch Conformity?</p>
               <p>§ 23. p. 34, 35. He would explain the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick by Art. 27. <hi>Thoſe that rightly received Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and Chriſtian Proprietors may offer their Children,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Canon forbiddeth the Miniſter to refuſe any as aforeſaid; What's this then to the reſt? 2. Right <hi>coram Eccleſiâ</hi> giveth the Church Power to receive them: But it muſt be Right <hi>coram Deo</hi> to Remiſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that muſt aſſure their Salvation: which we cannot prove that the Children of Atheiſts, Sadduces, or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels have. 3. The Conformiſts are here them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves divided: One part of them give that certain Salvation only to all baptized Infants, which the other give to all in the world, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed or unbaptized.

The Canons and Liturgy require it. 4. It is not true, that it's only <hi>the duely qualified:</hi> It is all that are not <hi>Naturally,</hi> but <hi>Morally unfit,</hi> that is, that are at Age, and have Reaſon and Health. If the Prieſt ſhould put away any as unfit, he muſt accuſe them to the Chancellor, and they muſt be Excommunicate and lie in Jayl while they live, unleſs they Communicate. So that here is a plain Expoſition. 4. There are multitudes unfit to Communicate, whom the Miniſter cannot put away, that were they not conſtrained, would keep away themſelves; as ſecret Atheiſts, Infidels, Sadduces, Socinians, Arians, Seekers, ſecret Fornicators, Thieves, Drunkards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are conſcious of their Sin and Impenitence: But rather than lie in Jayl, will all Communicate.</p>

Is it our <hi>higheſt Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge</hi> to have unfit men conſtreined to prophane holy things, and profeſs themſelves what they are not; and the dogs forced in, that ſhould lie without? Is Chriſt's Diſcipline againſt our higheſt Priviledges? 2. Who knoweth not that Infidels, Sadduces and wicked men do account
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64641:139"/>
theſe Priviledges to be none: Cure them of their Contempt, and you need not force them by a Jayl. Till then, is it the Paſtors that refuſe ſuch till they voluntary ſeek it, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of theſe Priviledges, that are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved? Chriſt giveth pardon and life to none but deſirous Conſenters; and if you will ſeal and deliver the promiſe of it to thoſe that will but prefer it to a Jayl, and make up your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on ſuch terms, we dare not imitate you. The Church-Keys exerciſed are, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Praejudicium futuri judicii,</hi> and ſhould intimate to men, who they be that ſhall be let into Heaven, or ſhut out: And to ſay, <hi>Come all and take Chriſt, Pardon and Life, who will rather take the Sacrament than lye in a Jayl,</hi> is like <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel.</hi>

We deſire the higheſt degree of Charity. But ſuch a judgment of mens future ſtate, though called <hi>Charitable,</hi> ſeemeth to us ſo fearfully uncharitable, that it is one of the greateſt things in which we ſeem to differ: And I will not ſhew the riſe, and the import and tendency of it, leſt Dr. <hi>Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and the <hi>Reflecter</hi> on <hi>Sacril.

And if we be judged to have worngfully denied our Miniſterial help and Communion to any, we pretend to no power to hinder any other Church or Paſtor from receiving him. 10. And if we be by Magiſtrates caſt out or afficted for our Duty, we ſhall quietly give up the Temples and publick Church-maintenance, of which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may diſpoſe, and without reſiſting or diſhonouring him, endure what he ſhall inflict upon us, for our obedience to God. This is our odious Tyranny.</p>

2. On the other ſide, our Accuſers, 1. Some of them are for power in themſelves to force men by the Sword, that is, by Mulcts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Penalties, to be ſubject to them, or be of their Church and Communion. 2. Others are for the Magiſtrate thus forcing them, when the Biſhop Excommunicates them. 3. They thus make the Church like a priſon, when no man knoweth whether the people be willing Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or only ſeem ſo, to eſcape the Jail. 4. They would be ſuch forcing Rulers over many ſcore or hundred Pariſhes. 5. They would have power to Rule, Suſpend and Silence the Paſtors of all theſe Pariſhes, when they think meet. 6. They hinder the Paſtors of the Pariſh-Churches from that exerciſe of the Keys aforeſaid in their own Pariſh-Churches, which belongs to the Paſtors Office. 7. They would compel the Pariſh-Miniſters to Admit, Abſolve, or Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate (at leaſt as declaring other mens Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences) when it is againſt their Conſciences. 8. They would make Miniſters ſwear Obedience to them, and Biſhops ſwear Obedience to Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops. 9. Some of them are for their power to Excommunicate Princes and greateſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, though contrary to the fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it diſhonour them. 10. Some of them ſay, that if the King command one Church-Order, or Form, or Ceremony, and the Biſhop another, the Biſhop is to be obeyed before the King: As alſo if the King bid us <hi>Preach,</hi> and the Biſhop forbid us, 11. And they ſay, that their Cenſures, even <hi>Clave errante,</hi> muſt be obeyed. 12. And that he whom a Biſhop cuts off from
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64641:144"/>
one Church, is thereby cut off from all, and none may receive him. 13. And that it is lawful to ſet up Patriarchs, Metropolitans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to rule the Church, according to the ſtate and diſtribution of Civil Government. Look over theſe two Caſes, and judge which party is liker to Church-Tyrants; and then judge what Credit is due to ſuch Accuſers of the Non-Conformiſts in this Age.</p>
               <p>§ 43. II. As to Reordination, I have anſwer'd to Mr. <hi>Cheny</hi> what he ſaith: He deceitfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voideth determining the firſt Queſtion, whether they intend a Reordination or not: Whereas I have proved, 1. That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is againſt twice Ordaining. 2. That they call it and take it for a true Ordination which is to be received from them, by ſuch as Presbyters had Ordained. 3. And therefore that they ſuppoſe the former Null. 4. And this is much of the reaſon of mens doubting whether they ſhould receive the ſecond, which is given on ſuch a Suppoſition. But this man is little concerned in the true ſtating of the caſe.</p>
               <p>§ 44. III. What he ſaith of the Miniſters power for Diſcipline, is anſwered already to Mr. <hi>Cheney</hi> that hath the ſame.</p>
               <p>§ 45. About the Covenant, 1. he falſly makes me ſay, that <hi>the King took it:</hi> Whereas (whether he did or not) I only ſay, that he was <hi>injuriouſly and unlawfully drawn to ſeem to owne it and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Next he aggravates this Injury: And who contradicteth him?</p>
               <p n="3">3. He pleadeth, <hi>That the King is not obliged
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64641:144"/>
by it to make any alteration in the Government of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will not examine your Reaſons: The King never made me his Confeſſor, nor put the queſtion to me; Why then ſhould I make my ſelf a Judge of it? And why muſt my Miniſtry lie on a thing beyond my knowledge? But am I ſure that no Parliament-man that took that Vow is bound there in his place to endeavour a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Alteration, when I am paſt doubt that much is needful?</p>
               <p>He would 1. make it doubtful, <hi>Whether it was a Vow to God?</hi> I think it not worth the labour to prove it to him that doubteth of it after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate reading it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith, <hi>[Any lawful endeavours are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.] Anſw.</hi> But the <hi>Obligation to lawful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are denied.</hi> Are not the words <hi>univerſal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſaith, <hi>[The Covenant condemned as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, cannot lay an Obligation.]</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A Vow to God unlawfully <hi>impoſed</hi> and <hi>taken,</hi> may binde to a <hi>Lawful Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. He calls it <hi>[unneceſſary alterations againſt the Law of the Land.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſuppoſe I ſhall prove ſome reforming alteration neceſſary; And it is not againſt Law for a Subject to petition for it, or a Parliament-man to ſpeak for it. Yet when the man ſeems to me to be pleading Conſcience out of the Land, he ſaith, <hi>[Would not this cauſe the Chriſtian Religion in a ſhort time to be exploded out of all Kingdoms?]</hi> Alas poor people! what uncertain Guides have you?</p>
               <p n="5">5. He concludes, that <hi>the power of Reforming
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64641:145"/>
being in the King, the Vow was null. Anſw.</hi> The Regal Power of Reforming is only in the King: To change Laws without him, is Uſurpation. But Parliament-men may ſpeak for it, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects petition, and on juſt cauſes write and ſpeak for needful Reformation: And I ſpeak for no other.</p>
               <p>§ 45. IV. About <hi>not taking Arms againſt thoſe Commiſſioned by the King;</hi> He plainly profeſſeth that we muſt not diſtinguiſh where the Law doth not. And if it be an unlimited Univerſal Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, it will quite go beyond <hi>Mainwaring</hi> or <hi>Sibthorpe:</hi> And for all his talk, my ignorance of the Law ſhall ſuſpend my Subſcription. 1. King <hi>John</hi> gave up his Kingdom to the Pope: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay it had been unlawful for the Kingdom to reſiſt ſuch as he ſhould have Commiſſioned to execute it. 2. Nor ſuch as ſhould be Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned to diſpoſſeſs the right Heir, and ſettle it on a Stranger, or an Enemy. 3. Nor ſuch as ſhould be Commiſſioned to ſeize on all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Eſtates or Lives, yea or lay Taxes contrary to Law, in caſes where the Law enableth the Sheriff by the <hi>Poſſe Comitatus</hi> to reſiſt. 4. Nor if any get the Broad-Seal to Commiſſions to ſeize on the King's Garriſons, Forts, Navies, Treaſures, Guards, whereby a traiterous Lord-Keeper might at any time Depoſe the King. I have told you, that old Parliaments Popiſh and Proteſtant, and Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> &amp;c. were as much Nonconformiſts in this as I am.</p>
               <p>And ſo much to the Impleaders Accuſations of the Nonconformiſts, and his Reaſons for the

               <p>WHile we hear men, that ſhould be our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, go on to call to Magiſtrates for Execution of the Laws (which they have got) againſt us, and for want of matter of Accuſation againſt thoſe that they proſecute, raking up odious Criminations from the late Wars, which few of the now Silenced Miniſters had any hand in; and never ceaſing to tell men, that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners of that War were guilty of the King's Death. After 17 or 18 years Silence, 1. I told them, That two parties of the Epiſcopal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts being the beginners, in <hi>England,</hi> it's wonder'd that they ſee not how they accuſe themſelves: And why do they not profeſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance firſt? 2. I fully told them what are our Principles of Government and Obedience, and intreated them to ſhew me, wherein they are diſloyal or culpable. And this man is the firſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64641:146"/>
that I finde pretending to aſſault it, and ſhame leſsly paſſeth over the Book itſelf, and by his ſilence ſeemeth to juſtifie our Doctrine. And yet to ſhew his Will, he taketh occaſion again to take up the foreſaid actions of the evil Civil War, as if that were any thing to the preſent Cauſe; or as if he were calling the dead to Judgment: (For we have oft offered them thanks, if they will Silence only thoſe that had a hand in thoſe Wars.) 2. He taketh on him to anſwer my Hiſtorical Preface; and therein heapeth abundance of untruths, part of which I mentioned in the ſecond Chapter, and the reſt I have ſo fully confuted in my Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Hinkley,</hi> and in an Hiſtorical Index of thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that I will not waſte my own and the Readers time, by ſaying the ſame things here again. And his Accuſations of my <hi>Concord</hi> and <hi>Moral Prognoſtication,</hi> I have anſwered before.

            <p>§ 1. WHen the King, being more merciful than the Canoneer Clergy, had granted Licenſes to the Nonconformiſts, for the publick worſhipping of God in peaceable Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, many of the Clergy ſtill cryed down ſuch Aſſemblies as Schiſmatical; when before they ſeemed to lay the charge of Schiſm on them, for their want of Authority: And theſe are the men, that when it is for their Intereſt, are zealous defenders of the Royal Power againſt ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Limitations; but their Intereſt can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, or at leaſt abſolve Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> himſelf. Some of them would have perſwaded us to forbear the Liberty which the King had granted us, and ſo to be the Silencers of our ſelves, and to forbear Gods publick Worſhip till we dare Conform. And no wonder, when they apprehended ſuch diſmal Conſequents to their Church from our Preaching, as Mr. <hi>Hinkley</hi> in his Letter-book hath told you. Among others, Dr. <hi>Fulwood</hi> would have drawn us into half this guilt, on pretence of perſwading us to the moderate uſe of our Licenſes. On which occaſion I wrote a ſmall Book, to prove that <hi>wilful deſerting of our Miniſtry</hi> even when it is forbidden unjuſtly, and yet remaineth notoriouſly neceſſary to the ends
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64641:147"/>
of the Inſtitution) <hi>is downright Sacriledge, and worſe than alienating Church-Goods or Lands.</hi> But I took occaſion in it to deal as plainly with thoſe Non-Conformiſts who are inclined to unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Separations, as with our Accuſers. Dr. <hi>Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> wrote an Anſwer to this Book: I never replyed, partly that they may ſee that I can give ſuch men the honour of having the laſt word, and partly to ſave mine own and the Readers time. But now either he, or ſome other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Author that is marked <hi>M. A.</hi> hath pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed more <hi>Uſeful Reflections</hi> on that Book. He knoweth to what uſe, and let him uſe them accordingly.</p>
            <p>§ 2. I. Part of his Reflections are Citations out of that and other of my Books, of ſuch words as ſeem to be for them, and againſt the Non-Conformiſts and my ſelf. II. The other part is his deſcant on the words, which he diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and ſetteth them to the Tune which ſuits his Inclination, and may ſerve his turn.</p>
            <p>Should I Print an Anſwer to ſuch ſtuff as this, and in many Sheets tell men where and how ſuch men ſpeak amiſs, the Reader might think that Satan hath ſuch power on me, as by any of his Inſtruments, at his pleaſure, to draw me to caſt away my own and other mens preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time.</p>
            <p>§ 3. All therefore that I ſhall ſay to him ſhall be this, I. As to the firſt, that 1. I can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile my own words, though he cannot: And as he never deſired me to teach him to do it, I am not at leiſure to offer him my Service: All is not contradiction, which men that underſtand
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64641:147"/>
not words do think ſo. 2. Readers, You ſee here when they call for Moderation, and would have us come as near them as we can, they do but turn it to reproach. And one that granteth them all that they cite out of my Books, and comes as near them as I do, is nevertheleſs thought unſufferable by them, in the exerciſe of the Miniſtry and out of Jayl. This is the ſpirit of the men.</p>
            <p>§ 4. II. To the other part I only ſay, The man miſtakes all the queſtion; which is not, <hi>Whether I be good or bad, learned or unlearned:</hi> Let this be determined with him as he will. I am ſo ignorant and bad, that I will not now trouble him with much contradiction. But the queſtion is, 1. <hi>Whether the two thouſand Miniſters were juſtly Silenced?</hi> 2. <hi>And whether if they wilfully (though ſo Silenced) deſert the Miniſtry to which they were Devoted and Conſecrated, they will not be guilty of damnable Sacriledge and Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?</hi> If the man will ſpeak to purpoſe to this queſtion, it is like that ſome one will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute his Defence of ſo great a ſin, when I am paſt this unpleaſant Military Work.</p>
