            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Wrath is <hi>forum externum,</hi> that externall court, that contaynes all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward arguments, <hi>à praemio &amp; poena,</hi> from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and puniſhment of God and man. <hi>Non ſine cauſa gladium portat</hi>: he caryes not the ſword in vaine, he is to reward or puniſh. And this is the ſeruants and hirelings argument, which keeps baſe affections within compaſſe, and prepares the way to charitie it ſelfe, <hi>Vt ſeta filum introducit,</hi> as the needle or briſſell brings in the thred: wherein although he that

            <p>Conſcience is that <hi>forum internum,</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court wherein God ſits, and either by the principles of reaſon, or by the lawes of the holy ghoſt, gouernes and iudges all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons done or to be done, and either accuſeth, or excuſeth, It is <hi>Iudicatorium rationale,</hi>

               </note> not an affectionate or wilfull, but a reaſonable Iudge. It is <hi>Liber animae, ad quem emendandum ſcripti ſunt omnes libri,</hi> It is the booke of the ſoule, for the examining and amending where of all bookes were written: In which are regiſtred all our thoughts, wordes, and deeds: what wee haue done, what we muſt receiue, and whither wee muſt goe, to heauen or hell; and when wee muſt leaue all other bookes, this booke will not leaue vs, but bring vs to Gods

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſome caſes, <hi>Conſcientia etiam erronea ligat</hi>: An erroneous conſcience doeth bind.</p>
            <p>The proceſſe of this conſcience is by way of Syllogiſme.

The Aſſumption is the diſcourſe of reaſon: and therfore many times is erroneous. This is good, or this is euill. The concluſion is the collection of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. Therefore this is to be done, or that is to bee auoyded. Wherein becauſe the diſcourſe of reaſon being erroneous, makes an erroneous conſcience; therefore that the lawes of men be not exorbitant, it ſhall be needfull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe certaine rules or cauſes, that muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in all lawes, Ciuil and Eccleſiaſtical, that they may bind the conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt there muſt be <hi>materia debita,</hi> a due matter, that is iuſt and lawfull, or els indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in it ſelfe: for in things ſimply good or euill, which are commanded or forbidden by
<pb facs="tcp:19345:5"/>
God and Nature, No man hath power to croſſe the will of God. And in theſe things mans power is declaratory and executory, not ſoueraigne of it ſelfe; In things indifferent there is a power to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand for circumſtances of time, place, order, and the like, and there is a neceſsitie of obedience, and that for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake, elſe man hath no power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing of himſelfe; And yet it is the ſinne of diſobedience, <hi>Non ſolùm malum, ſed &amp; vetitum facere,</hi> not onely to do that which is euill, but that alſo which is forbidden.</p>
            <p>The 2. is <hi>forma debita,</hi> a due forme, an equal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> proportion of honors &amp; burdens, according to the difference &amp; degrees of ſeueral Eſtates, conditions, and qualities, as alſo a due order of proceeding in Law-making, without tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult or confuſion, without malice, ſpleene, or reuenge. The 3. is <hi>Efficiens debitam,</hi> a due <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> efficient, or a ſufficient power to whom the care of Law-making is delegated. For as the ſentence of him that is no Iudge, is no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; ſo the Law of him that is not authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to decree Lawes, is no Law. The 4. is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
               <hi>finis debitus,</hi> a due end, Publicke good, and not priuate: for as a Tyrant herein differeth
<pb facs="tcp:19345:6"/>
from a King, that the Tyrant intendeth his priuate good, &amp; the King propoſeth the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke: ſo euill Lawes ayme at priuate and bad ends, and good Lawes propoſe the moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke and beſt ends, the increaſe of good Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſafety of the Common wealth. And theſe cauſes concurring, the matter being lawfull or indifferent, the forme due, the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient potent, and the end publicke and good, the Lawes of man muſt be obeyed, not onely for wrath but for conſcience, which is the greateſt Obligation on earth: For <hi>Nemo hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manam potestatem contemnit, niſi qui priùs diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam contempſit,</hi> No man contemnes the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of man, vnleſſe he firſt haue contemned the power of God.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, All muſt obey: Euill men for feare, and good men for conſcience. Now Subiection in this Text, is a tranſcendent, and hath no proper place to be ſpoken of, becauſe it is to bee ſpoken of in euery place; And therefore let vs conſider two points. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the neceſsity of obedience. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are two, Subiects that muſt obey, and Higher powers, that muſt gouerne and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The neceſsitie will bring vs to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit

<pb facs="tcp:19345:15"/>
make Orders and Decrees, and commanded the Prieſts as well as the people, and reformed the Prieſts, as well as the people. Yea, <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> did depoſe <hi>Abiathar</hi> the high Prieſt: and they forced and compelled both Prieſt and people to ſerue the Lord, and to aboliſh ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie and ſuperſtition: And therefore this is a power of Iuriſdiction ouer perſons Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall in cauſes of Religion.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid that theſe Kings did this by the direction of the Prophets, and moſt of theſe Kings had their peculiar Prophets and Seers; this is nothing to the queſtion: for no man euer denyed direction to Kings. They haue Counſailers for cauſes Ciuill, and Prophets, Prieſts and Biſhops for cauſes of the Church. And the queſtion is not, <hi>Quâ directione,</hi> but, <hi>quâ authoritate</hi>: Not by what direction; they muſt direct themſelues by their beſt helpes: but by what Authoritie; not a deriued or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated Authority from the Prieſt, but by that originall Commiſsion, <hi>Neceſsitate praecepti,</hi> by the neceſsitie of the precept, in which they are made guardians of the whole Law.</p>
            <p>If it be further ſaid, theſe Kings did this by an extraordinary and Propheticall power,
<pb facs="tcp:19345:15"/>
which is but onely ſaid and neuer prooued; the confutation is ready: If this had beene done by a Propheticall power, why are thoſe Kings regiſtred as glorious and good Kings, that walked in the wayes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and tooke care of Gods Religion: And on the other ſide, thoſe Kings that omitted theſe duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, not onely noted and diſgraced, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for the omiſsion of that which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this opinion concerned not their office? Had the ſupreme care of Religion in theſe Kings beene onely a Counſaile and no Precept, no man ſhould haue been diſgraced and condemned for it; for no man is to bee condemned for the omiſsion of a Counſaile, And therefore the Scripture condemning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kings for the omiſsion of this dutie, and regiſtring <hi>Nahuchodonoſor, Darius,</hi> and the King of Nineue for their great care in this charge; this is not a Counſaile, but a precept in the Lawe, that Kings muſt take charge of the whole Law, and cauſes Eccleſiaſticall as well as Temporall.</p>
