            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

benighted Drunkards) are not yet able to finde

offer us ſo much occaſion, to pity the dangerous

detecting the malignant diſtemper of their faults, it

yield to a ſeperation from the ſubjects that poſſeſſe

their true reference, who following the tracts of St. <hi>Judes</hi>
murmurers, in admiration of ſome mens perſons for advantage

not only in opinion, but practiſe, than which nothing can be
more deſtructive to the concord and peaceable unanimity of
ſpiritual Congregations; for as in phyſical Compoſitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

violent diſunion of Integrable parts breeds a more dangerous
ſhiſme in the body, than a humerous diſtemper; ſo in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
corporations, an actual ſeperation from the Catholick
fellowſhip of beleevers in Gods ſervice is a greater pandor to
confuſion, than the ſcandal of a ſpeculative diſtraction. It is
time therefore for our Seminary Presbyters, who have been
the Protoplaſtiques of a Rebellious generation, both in Church
and State, to make a confeſſion of their paſt faults, as well as
their preſent faith to the King. They are now ſufficiently read
in the book of their own conſciences to know, <hi>nemo periculoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
peccat, quam qui peccata defendit,</hi> to Apologize for ſin is
more damnable, than to act it, and not to retract inexcuſable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104118:5"/>
errours, doth as much unqualifie a delinquent for mercy, as
the perpetration thereof can adapt him to juſtice. Repentance,
though it may be too ſoon ended, can never bee too late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun;
he, that lives like St. <hi>Lukes</hi> judge on the bench, neither
fearing God, nor regarding man, may have the grace to die
like the <hi>Jewes</hi> theef on the Croſſe, with profeſſion of both; for
that power which expreſly denyeth forgiveneſſe to one ſin one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
doth implicitely conceede a poſſibility of pardon to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
On this conſideration it would be worth their paines to
tranſlate their Petition for Presbytery into a Suit for Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and publickly to acknowledge his Majeſties Declaration
which is the proof of his grace, to be an argument of their
guilt, who (like cunning fencers, that aim at the legs, when
they intend to veny the pate) under a reformative pretence of
deſtroying thoſe revenous beaſts, which worry the people,
begg'd leave of their maſter to hunt the kingdome, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
granted, they took liber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y of themſelves to make him their
chief game: for it is well known from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> that
the credit of their falſe doctrine was the very leaven where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the people were firſt moulded into a ſowre lump of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
malice againſt their Sovereigne.</p>
            <p>And I may truly ſay, it was the unlucky Boutefen, which
not only yielded ſmoak to ſmother all Treaties into a nullity
of ſucceſſe, but that gave light alſo to clear the way for
more active inſtruments then themſelves to take off the
Head of our eternally renowned Saint <hi>Charles,</hi> together
with the Government from his ſoulders; for although they
entred not the Stage with thoſe miſcreants that perſonated <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
in the fifth Act; yet becauſe they appeared with others
who playd the parts of <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> in the firſt Scene
of the Tragedy, we may juſtly chriſten them the Grandfathers
in law of that bloudy fact, which being unmatchable in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104118:6"/>
ſtories, may be in ſome ſort compared to the crafty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of the cruel wolfe in the fable, who told the ſheep, <hi>Da
mihi potum, &amp; ego mihi dabo cibum,</hi> meaning to eat him up for
his courteſie. A fact, which as former ages have not been ſo
learnedly wicked to invent, ſo I hope the future will be more
honeſtly wiſe than to imitate; A fact, which may ſchoole our
Kings of <hi>England</hi> into a uſe of the <hi>Italians</hi> prayer, to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from their friends whom they truſt, as well as from their
enemies whom they fear, and inform the people with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
ſoul, rather to ſheath their ſwords in one anothers bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
upon private quarrels, than to draw them againſt their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
in open war.</p>
            <p>But, if the Recognition of ſuch an execrable murder be not
caution enough for ſubjects to reſtrain them from Rebellion,
let the memorable example of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> puniſhment be
their exhortation to obedience, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13, 14. who (though
a ſtranger to <hi>Sauls</hi> kingdome, and by them requeſted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
his pain with the inference of death) was by <hi>Davids</hi>
command for touching the Lords anointed, inſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to looſe his life.</p>
            <p>If Kings lives then are ſo precious in Gods account, that
they may not be touched in the heat of proclaimd hoſtility,
what a curſed ſin muſt that be, which juſtifieth thoſe who take
them away in cold bloud?</p>
            <p>By theſe animadverſions I hope the whole hoſt of ſpirituall
officers, who have fought againſt the Regiment of the Church,
will be victoriouſly fens'd into a unanimous Iudgement, that
it is far better for them to have the Apoſtles doctrine in their
hearts, then the <hi>Scots</hi> diſcipline in their hands, to be content
with that eſtate wherein they have been, then to covet that
wherein they ought not to be, to ſubmit to the King in cauſes

to reprove an offending brother, as I think my ſelf bound
to tell the aſſociated brethren, that they have highly wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Majeſty of God &amp; the King, both by their orall and
manual proluſions to introduce a new fangled government in
the Church, &amp; that it will be more ſafe for them to obſerve
the duty of looking into their own, then the falſe commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of overſeeing their ſuperiours actions, the performance
whereof might happily make that ſaying <hi>ex culpa ſacerdotum

and convert the hypocriſie, which ſome do, into the
ſincerity of obedience, which all ſhould profeſſe; for though
none of them be puritanized into Donatiſme, but can proteſt
it their neceſſary obligation to reverence the Kings perſon,
yet moſt are ſo far ſublimated from the droſſe of ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that they cannot without defiling their conſciences vaile
to the train of his ceremonious Titles, they can eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct
ſupream Governours, dryly ſwallowed, but with the
ſawce of Eccleſiaſtical cauſes it quite nauſeates their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks,
and the name of head is more offenſive to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
then perfumes are to the noſtrils of thoſe that are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with an Hiſterical paſſion; a monſtrous ſtraw for ſuch
mighty men to ſtumble at, which may be put in the ſame
ballance with that of their ſchiſmatical Predeceſſours in the
conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> who were ſcandalized with
the word abſolution in the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> but well content with
the Term <hi>Remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What difference there is betwixt ſupream Governour and
Head in a notional acception, is more fit for Grammatical
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104118:7"/>
Criticks, then politick Chriſtians to inquire, as they are
complicated in one ſubject, and determined to a conſtant
oneneſſe both of action and end, they muſt by the rules of
honeſty as well as Art, be conſtrued Synonymous, and in a
promiſcuous manner adjudged to contract their literal vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
into an identity of ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Indeed we cannot deny but the Title of ſupream Head
was firſt given to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight by the Pope, who
being by his own inſtitution in the world (as the ſoul is in
the body by Gods Creation) <hi>Totus in toto,</hi> and not onely <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis,</hi>
but <hi>univerſis major,</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed to part with a
piece of himſelf but for his own ends; yet we conceive it no
treſpaſſe againſt any Canon, either of Scripture or reaſon,
to convert that to a good uſe, which was firſt beſtowed to
an ill purpoſe, but for Presbyters to take that away for the
better eſteem of their own authority, which was given by
the Pope, to diſgrace the Kings jurisdiction in the Church,
is no leſſe unreaſonable to deviſe, then irreligious to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</p>
            <p>That great Bulwark of objection, (Chriſt is the ſole Head
of the Church, <hi>ergo</hi> no other can have the Title) which hath
been preſumed too ſtrong for an army of Schoolmen to beat
down, muſt neceſſarily yield upon terms to our ſide. For
although as the Church is internally conſidered in reſpect of
the kingdome of Grace, and our Saviour Chriſt as Lord
thereof, by right of Redemption, ruling the hearts of the
faithful by his ſpirit, there is no ſubjection allowable, nor
headſhip to be attributed but to him only; yet as he is King
by right of Creation, loving an Imperial Sovereignty over
all his creatures, and the Church in a militant condition,
which (by reaſon of an inſeperable commixture of good
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104118:8"/>
and bad, and common relation of the inward and outward
man) doth neceſſarily require an external policy to maintain
a uniformity and order in the worſhip of God, ſo he hath
ordained his Vicegerent on earth to whom both Clergy and
Laity muſt be ſubject.</p>
            <p>And in this qualification of ſenſe Kings may be truly ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſupream Heads in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, within their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions;
Thus <hi>Samuel</hi> called <hi>Saul</hi> the Head of the Tribes
of Iſrael, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 17. which <hi>in eodem ſigno rationis</hi> doth
imply all perſons, as well Eccleſiaſtical as civil in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
to be his ſubordinate members. And that the
Prieſts were ſubject in their very Offices to the ſupreame
power of their magiſtrates, 2 <hi>Chron. 8. Solomons</hi> Acts in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
their courſes, and appointing the <hi>Levites</hi> to their
charges, (who in manifeſtation of their duty are ſaid not to
depart from the commandement of the King) do ſufficiently
evidence, whoſe authority likewiſe to puniſh ſins of the firſt
table, that refer to Religion as well as thoſe of the ſecond,
which belong to humane ſociety.</p>
            <p>Gods own preſcript Laws to <hi>Moſes, Deut. 13. Deut.</hi> 17.
<hi>Levit.</hi> 17. are the authentique ſeals to confirm, whereunto
we may annex that fact of our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſing
the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Pedlers, by vertue of his divine Royalty,
for profanation of the Temple, as an exemplary proof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all exception.</p>
            <p>Having pickt out the pith of their Divinity in the former
objection, there reſteth one hard Argument more a break,
wherein lies the marrow of their Logick, if the power, ſay
they, in Eccleſiaſtical matters be proper to the ſupream ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
as a Magiſtrate, then it ſhould belong to all magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
and conſequently to the heathen: the definition of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104118:8"/>
a magiſtrate being one in Chriſtian and Heathen Princes;
but this would be both ſinful and ridiculous to aſſert, <hi>ergo</hi>
that cannot lawfully be maintained.</p>
            <p>Truly this is a witty ſophiſme, which deſerves the Reply
of an ingenious Reſpondent in the Philoſophers School, <hi>ſalſe
profecto, ſed falſo quidem.</hi> I preſume the ſame learning which
qualified them to oppoſe others, may enable them to anſwer
themſelves in this point; for if their conſequence be good,
<hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts had as much right to the ſervice of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as the <hi>Levitical</hi> Clergy-men, neither can our Proteſtant
miniſters have a better Title to the diſpenſation of Chriſts
ordinances, then the officers of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church do now
claim.</p>
            <p>Therefore if they will honeſtly defend their own as we do
the Kings authority in the Church, they muſt acknowledge
their argument to be contrary to the principles of art, as their
opinion is to the precepts of Religion; for when a Reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Term is adjoyned to an equivocal ſubject (as magiſtrate
is) To argue from an indefinite to a univerſall, is an illegal
conſequence, the reaſon is, becauſe what is attributed by
ſuch a note of limitation, is not an abſolute but a comparate
propriety, which doth <hi>convenire ſubjecto mediante alio,</hi> as the
power of the King in c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

him, ſimply <hi>ſecundum naturam,</hi> but Relatively as he is a true
Chriſtian Magiſtrate; according to which univocation, if
their Argument had been formed, the conſequence would
be logically true.</p>
            <p>But as we do appropriate this power onely to Kings truly
Chriſtian, So I muſt acquaint them that the Heathen ſubjects
had ſuch a Reverend reſpect to the authority of the ſupream
magiſtrate in matters of their idolatrous Religion, that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,
