            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

shall chance to <hi>yield</hi> us.</p>
            <p>And this I shall do, if God permit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some future Opportunities; if This I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently lay hold on shall prove as worthy of Acceptation, as by Me it is well-intended. That it may, I think fit to premise before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand This Declaration: That if in any Thing I have spoken, I seem to have spoken some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Austerely; I have not done it with any particular Reflections, upon any man's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, alive, or dead. My Propositions are <hi>Universal,</hi> as well as <hi>True;</hi> and my Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities to the Guilty lye All in common. As many as find themselves concern'd, may make their <hi>personal</hi> and their <hi>private</hi> Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my Reproofs; so as they carry it in their Memories, that I have <hi>made None at all.</hi> For the longer I live, the more I am of this Opinion, that <hi>Truth</hi> it self may be <hi>asserted,</hi> and <hi>Questions</hi> about it <hi>deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> also, without reflecting upon the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> (thô we <hi>must</hi> intimate the <hi>Parties</hi>) from whom we differ.</p>
            <p>And here I am tempted to <hi>take</hi> Occasion (where None is <hi>offer'd</hi>) to tell my Reader for his Service, (if I can rightly apprehend
<pb facs="tcp:106235:6"/>
it,) that when I am now and then consulted by a young Student in Divinity, and a Candidate for the Priesthood, what kind of <hi>Cynosure</hi> he shall <hi>steer by,</hi> when he is newly launching forth in the vast Ocean of Theology; I do not <hi>presently</hi> direct him, (as Dr. <hi>Steward</hi> at St. <hi>Germans</hi> directed <hi>Me,</hi>) to begin with <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis;</hi> to <hi>proceed</hi> with <hi>Baronius</hi> and The <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses;</hi> Then with the Fathers of the Church for the first Three hundred years; Nor do I <hi>presently</hi> ingage him in the Learned and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laborate and laudable Method of Mr. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> whose Parts, and Piety, his Patience, and his Pains-taking, many Theologues may imitate, but few can equal; But first I tell him, that the shortest and surest way, whereby to make himself a sufficient and sound Divine, is (next to his reading and revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Word of God,</hi>) to study the Works of Dr. <hi>Hammond;</hi> beginning with his <hi>Annotations,</hi> at least with his <hi>Paraphrase</hi> on the <hi>New Testament,</hi> His <hi>Practical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism,</hi> and His Book <hi>of Fundamentals.</hi> For I have been long of this Opinion; that He whose important Office it is, to be a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p>The word <hi>Lord,</hi> and the word <hi>Master</hi> do so <hi>agree</hi> in the <hi>Translation,</hi> and yet in the Original do so much differ, that we must bring in the <hi>Greek</hi> to explain the <hi>English,</hi> or else we shall miss of its full Importance.</p>

            </p>
            <p>§ 3. And this which helps us to <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,</hi> may help us also to <hi>divide,</hi> and <hi>apply</hi> the Text. For</p>
            <p>First of all, If he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signifies a <hi>Lord,</hi> whose Prerogative it is to <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> us; then must we pay him a strict <hi>obedience,</hi> in as much as we are his <hi>Subjects,</hi> or as being his <hi>Soldiers,</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> too. (Such as promised in our Baptism to <hi>fight manfully under his Banner.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Secondly, If he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly signifies a <hi>Master,</hi> whose property it is to <hi>instruct</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> us; then do we owe him
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106235:10"/>
               <hi>obedience</hi> too, as being his <hi>Followers</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> placed under his <hi>Discipline,</hi> and trained up in his <hi>School.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, It follows by way of <hi>Inference</hi> from two expressions in the Text, (towit the <hi>first,</hi> and the <hi>last,</hi>) that he is not only to be <hi>called</hi> our Lord and Master, but to be serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>received</hi> and own'd as <hi>such.</hi> For mark the manner in which he speaks.</p>
            <p>Ye <hi>call</hi> me <hi>Lord,</hi> and ye <hi>call</hi> me <hi>Master;</hi> and in that ye <hi>say well,</hi> because what ye <hi>call</hi> me, I truly <hi>am.</hi> But to <hi>say</hi> well, is <hi>one</hi> thing; and to <hi>do</hi> well, <hi>another.</hi> And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I truly <hi>am</hi> what ye <hi>call</hi> me, <hi>be</hi> you as truly what you <hi>pretend.</hi> If I your <hi>Lord</hi> and your <hi>Master</hi> have washed <hi>your</hi> feet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member then to <hi>do as ye have me for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> and see that ye wash <hi>oneanothers</hi> feet. If they have called <hi>me</hi> Belzebub, who am the <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>House;</hi> how much more should such as <hi>You</hi> (who are but some of my <hi>Houshold</hi>) be content to be called as <hi>bad,</hi> or <hi>worse?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the two <hi>first</hi> of these Particulars we have the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of the Text; and in the last we see the <hi>Use.</hi> Not an Use of my framing, but such as the <hi>Author</hi> of the Text was pleas'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106235:10"/>
himself to draw <hi>from</hi> it for our Instruction.</p>
            <p>§ 4. The <hi>Result</hi> of the <hi>Doctrin</hi> is briefly <hi>this.</hi> That we must not expect to live as <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines</hi> under <hi>Christ,</hi> who is not only our <hi>Elder Brother,</hi> to make us <hi>partakers</hi> of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance;</hi> but our <hi>Lord</hi> and our <hi>Master,</hi> to make us <hi>obedient</hi> to his <hi>Commands.</hi> Not our <hi>Lord</hi> only to <hi>Save</hi> us, but especially our <hi>Lord</hi> to be <hi>served</hi> by us. Nor our <hi>Master</hi> only to <hi>teach</hi> us by the <hi>Veracity</hi> of his <hi>Doctrin,</hi> but more especially to <hi>reform</hi> us by the <hi>convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingness</hi> of his <hi>Life.</hi> Our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> hath such a <hi>twofold</hi> Importance, as comes to one and the same <hi>end</hi> in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi> We may <hi>distinguish</hi> the Notions, but must not <hi>separate</hi> or <hi>divide</hi> them. They must be <hi>coupled</hi> in my <hi>Discourse,</hi> as here they are in the <hi>Subject</hi> of it. For as Scholars of Christ, we ought to <hi>imitate</hi> his <hi>Example;</hi> which how can we do, unless as <hi>Servants</hi> of Christ, we <hi>obey</hi> his <hi>Will?</hi> When <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 1. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Iesus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan both to do, and to teach,</hi> he <hi>taught</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he <hi>did.</hi> As were his <hi>Precepts,</hi> and his <hi>Doctrin,</hi> such exactly was his <hi>Life,</hi> and his <hi>Conversation.</hi> He led his Life by the <hi>Rule of the Moral Law;</hi> by his perfect <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> unto which, he was pleased to blunt the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106235:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
edge, and to abate the <hi>Rigour</hi> of it. So that 'tis absolutely <hi>Impossible</hi> for <hi>us</hi> to follow his <hi>Example,</hi> unless by yielding our <hi>Obedience</hi> to his <hi>Commands.</hi> We cannot embrace him as a <hi>Master,</hi> unless we receive him as a <hi>Lord</hi> too.</p>
            <p>§ 5. And with <hi>this</hi> I am desirous to <hi>fill</hi> my Readers so much the <hi>rather,</hi> because I take it to be a point, concerning which as it is <hi>dangerous,</hi> so it is <hi>easie</hi> for us to err. And so much the easier, because it is <hi>acceptable</hi> and <hi>pleasant</hi> to the natural Appetites of the <hi>flesh,</hi> to look on Christ as a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> but <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else.</hi> To entertain him as a <hi>Lamb,</hi> fit to be fed upon at his <hi>Table,</hi> whereby we may be <hi>nourished</hi> to <hi>Life Eternal;</hi> But <hi>not</hi> at all as a <hi>Shepherd</hi> to <hi>guide</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> us, and by the strictness of his Discipline, to keep us from <hi>straying</hi> out of his <hi>Pastures.</hi> For let us look a little <hi>within us,</hi> and <hi>examin</hi> our own <hi>hearts</hi> by our own <hi>experience.</hi> Do we not natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteem it an happy Thing, to have as much of this World as we know what to do with? as much as we can sacrifice to <hi>all</hi> our <hi>Senses?</hi> to live in as great a superfluity of Sports and Pleasures, as a <hi>Tiberius</hi> can <hi>in joy,</hi> or a <hi>Petronius think of?</hi> And (when we are deeply run in <hi>debt</hi> by our <hi>expenseful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualities</hi>)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106235:11"/>
to have all our <hi>Debts paid</hi> out of <hi>Another</hi> man's <hi>purse,</hi> all our <hi>recknings</hi> made <hi>even, Acquittances</hi> put into our <hi>hands,</hi> and nothing more required to be done on our parts, than to <hi>believe we owe nothing,</hi> and that if by <hi>continuing</hi> in our Exorbitant <hi>expences</hi> we plunge our selves in <hi>new Debts,</hi> they shall all be discharged out of the very same <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure?</hi> Nay, is it not yet a more <hi>pleasing Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> a more <hi>delicious</hi> kind of <hi>mistake</hi> and <hi>mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> to think our <hi>Debts</hi> were <hi>all remitted</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were able to <hi>contract</hi> them? And then with a greater force of Reason, Are we not apt to look on <hi>Them</hi> (I do not say as the most <hi>rational,</hi> but) as the most <hi>comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Preachers, who bring us Tidings even from Heaven, that all our <hi>Duties</hi> are done <hi>already</hi> by <hi>Another</hi> man's <hi>obedience</hi> in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half? that all our <hi>Sins</hi> are <hi>discounted</hi> by Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man's <hi>Sufferings?</hi> all our <hi>Punishments</hi> inflicted upon Another man's <hi>Shoulders?</hi> And that 'tis <hi>safe</hi> for us to <hi>Sin,</hi> upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition we <hi>despair</hi> not of being <hi>pardon'd,</hi> but believe <hi>without doubting</hi> that we were <hi>justified from Eternity,</hi> and that our Sins were all <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given</hi> before they could possibly be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? not only <hi>all</hi> the Sins that <hi>are,</hi> but <hi>all</hi> that <hi>shall</hi> be?</p>

sooner at his own <hi>Glory,</hi> than our <hi>Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> it cannot but follow from that supposal, he aymed <hi>sooner</hi> at our Salvation from the <hi>Tyranny of Sin,</hi> than from the <hi>Torments of Hell</hi> as the <hi>wages</hi> of it.

and <hi>many,</hi> why we are bought with a <hi>Price</hi> by our <hi>Lord and Master,</hi> that we might live in <hi>obedience</hi> to Him that <hi>bought</hi> us. <hi>Sin</hi> was the <hi>object</hi> of his <hi>Hatred,</hi> for being the <hi>subject</hi> of his <hi>Dishonour;</hi> And therefore the <hi>Scope</hi> of our <hi>Saviour's Purchase,</hi> was rather to <hi>purifie,</hi> than to <hi>forgive</hi> us, although it was to <hi>forgive</hi> us too. To forgive in the second place, thô to purifie in the first.

            <p>§ 17. And if these things are so; then as we tender the greatest Interest both of our
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106235:24"/>
Bodies and of our Souls. Let no man cozen us to Hell, by making us believe we are <hi>sure</hi> of Heaven. Beware of <hi>Comfortable Preachers</hi> (as they that love to be flatter'd do fasly call them,) who either write or speak much in the <hi>Praise</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> But in <hi>Disparagement</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of our Lord. And often quarrel at the <hi>necessity</hi> of being <hi>rich in good works,</hi> as if <hi>Salvation</hi> were to be had at a <hi>cheaper Rate.</hi> Let me put the case home, as well to others as to myself, in the fewest words. Have we an earnestness of Desire to live for ever in Bliss and Glory? or are we <hi>careless</hi> and <hi>indifferent</hi> what shall become of us <hi>hereafter?</hi> Do we seriously believe an <hi>Immortality</hi> of our <hi>Souls,</hi> a <hi>Life</hi> after <hi>Death,</hi> and a <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Iudgment?</hi> Or do we but <hi>talk</hi> of these things in civility to the men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom we live? if we are in good earnest in the Rehearsal of the <hi>Creed,</hi> of the <hi>two last Articles</hi> in particular, the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body, and the Life everlasting;</hi> Then let the <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> abide forever in our <hi>Remembrance.</hi> And seeing <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>Condition</hi> on which the <hi>promise</hi> of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106235:25"/>
Salvation is given unto us, that we <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>own</hi> Christ as our <hi>Lord and Master,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and our <hi>Prince,</hi> as our <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> and our <hi>Iudge</hi> too; And that we <hi>so</hi> own him in our <hi>Lives,</hi> as well as in our <hi>Beliefes,</hi> as well in our <hi>practice,</hi> as <hi>specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> Let us not flatter ourselves for shame (as so many Traytors to our own <hi>Souls,</hi>) that Salvation will be found upon <hi>easier Termes.</hi> For to such as cannot pretend to be <hi>Babes,</hi> or <hi>Ideots,</hi> or never to have liv'd <hi>within the sound</hi> of Christ's Gospel, the words of the Apostle are very positive and Express, That <hi>without Holiness and Peace,</hi> (that is to say, without our <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> both to <hi>God,</hi> and to our <hi>Neighbour,</hi>) <hi>No man living shall see the Lord,</hi> Hebr. 12. 14.</p>

            <p>§ 1. The <hi>Affinity</hi> and <hi>Connexion</hi> is as <hi>obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> as it is <hi>close,</hi> betwixt my <hi>present,</hi> and <hi>former</hi> Text. For it was the last Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which I perform'd in this Place, to shew how <hi>Christ</hi> is our <hi>Lord and Master.</hi> Such as he was pleas'd to assert himself, in the <hi>thirteenth of St. Iohn,</hi> at the <hi>thirteenth verse.</hi> It now remains that we Contemplate the Moderation of the <hi>Laws,</hi> whereby our <hi>Lord</hi> is exceeding <hi>Gratious,</hi> and our <hi>Master</hi> extreamly <hi>Good.</hi> For it seems not sufficient that he is known to be a <hi>Lord,</hi> in Exacting <hi>obedience</hi> to his Commandments, unless he be as well known to be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>gratious,</hi> in that his <hi>Commandments are not grievous.</hi> (Nothing neer so insupportable as they were thought by those <hi>Gnosticks</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> alludes to, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 3. who fell away from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, and disown'd Christ himself, for fear their Loyalty and obedience should cost them dear; living then, as they did, in Times of Trial, and Persecution;) He is our <hi>Lord,</hi> and our <hi>Master,</hi> in respect of the <hi>Yoke</hi> with which he <hi>binds,</hi> and in regard of the <hi>Burden</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:106235:27"/>
wherewith he <hi>loads</hi> us. But this our <hi>Master</hi> is <hi>Good,</hi> and our <hi>Lord Gratious,</hi> in respect of the <hi>Easiness</hi> which he gives unto the <hi>one,</hi> and in regard of the <hi>Lightness</hi> wherewith he qualify's the <hi>other.</hi> But</p>
            <p>§ 2. Our Translation, however True, is so far short of the Original, that (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, so now also,) the Greek must come in to assist the English, or else we shall miss of its whole Importance. For 'tis not only <hi>my Yoke is Easy,</hi> But <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, my Yoke is <hi>Good.</hi> My Yoke is <hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>useful.</hi> My Yoke is an <hi>indearing</hi> and <hi>delectable</hi> Yoke. For all this and more is imported by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as Lexicographers and Glossa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do make apparent. That is, (to express it without a Metaphor) The Service of Christ is a most gratious, and Desirable Service. What he commands us to perform, is not only very possible, but facil and easy to be perform'd. Nor only so, but sweet and pleasant in the performance. It is not only our Bounden <hi>Duty,</hi> but 'tis our <hi>Interest,</hi> our <hi>Delight,</hi> our <hi>Reward</hi> to serve him.</p>
            <p>§ 3. And such as the <hi>Yoke</hi> is with which he <hi>binds,</hi> such is also the <hi>burden</hi> wherewith
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106235:28"/>
he <hi>loads</hi> us. Whatsoever his <hi>Burden</hi> may here import. If the <hi>Burden</hi> of his <hi>Precepts,</hi> then 'tis <hi>absolutely</hi> light. For then the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> and the <hi>Yoke</hi> are Terms <hi>aequivalent.</hi> The <hi>lightness</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> explains the <hi>Easiness</hi> of the <hi>other;</hi> and the later clause of the Text is but an <hi>Exegesis</hi> of the <hi>former.</hi> Or admit that by his <hi>Burden</hi> is meant the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> of his <hi>Cross;</hi> yet even <hi>then</hi> we must confess it is <hi>comparatively</hi> light. And so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is in two considerable respects. First in respect of the <hi>endless punishment,</hi> which will fall upon Them that <hi>refuse</hi> the Burden; and again in respect of that <hi>unspeakable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> which will be given unto them that shall <hi>take it up.</hi> The <hi>Cross</hi> of Christ at its <hi>heaviest</hi> is but a <hi>Burden</hi> of <hi>Afflictions,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> accompts <hi>light</hi> for these two reasons. First because <hi>it is but for a moment;</hi> next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>it works for us a far more exceeding and</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> 
               <hi>eternal weight of glory.</hi> For as the same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith to the same <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (what seems at first hearing a contradiction,) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that <hi>That which was glorious was not glorious at all, in respect of the</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>glory which excelleth.</hi> So 'tis as true That
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106235:28"/>
               <hi>our Afflictions are no Afflictions, in comparison with the Beatitudes which they work for us as our Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. This is the meaning of the Text consider'd simply in it self. Wherein are two Things especially which offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to our <hi>Consideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First the <hi>Greatness</hi> of Christ in the <hi>Extent</hi> of his Authority; and</p>
            <p>Secondly his <hi>Goodness,</hi> in the merciful <hi>use</hi> or <hi>employment</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>First his <hi>Greatness</hi> is very evident, in that he has the power to impose a <hi>Yoke,</hi> and a <hi>Burden.</hi> A <hi>Yoke</hi> of <hi>Injunctions</hi> upon our <hi>Necks,</hi> and a Burden of <hi>Suffrings</hi> upon our <hi>Backs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next his <hi>Goodness</hi> is as apparent, from the <hi>easiness</hi> of the one, and from the <hi>lightness</hi> of the other. For besides That <hi>Eternal and exceeding weight of Glory,</hi> which gives an <hi>easiness</hi> to the <hi>Yoke,</hi> however <hi>hard;</hi> and a <hi>lightness</hi> to the <hi>Burden,</hi> however <hi>heavy;</hi> The one is so <hi>easy</hi> in <hi>it self,</hi> and the other in <hi>it self</hi> is so truly <hi>light,</hi> (considering that <hi>dolor, si gravis, brevis,</hi> is just as much, as <hi>si longus, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi>) that even the <hi>Yoke</hi> of his <hi>Injunctions</hi> does
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106235:29"/>
give us <hi>Freedom,</hi> and the <hi>Burden</hi> of his <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings</hi> affords us <hi>strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we put them both together, they make a Text without length extremely copious; for it exhibits to us at once the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> of the Gospel. The <hi>Yoke</hi> and the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> do prove the first, as the easiness and the <hi>lightness</hi> infer the second. It serves to keep us in the <hi>Fear,</hi> and the <hi>Faith</hi> of Christ. For first the nature of a <hi>Yoke</hi> implies a Bridle to our <hi>Presumption;</hi> and then the <hi>easiness</hi> of <hi>this</hi> Yoke does also forbid us to <hi>despair.</hi> Christ is here both in his <hi>Kingly,</hi> and <hi>Priestly</hi> Office; at once to <hi>rule,</hi> and to <hi>bless</hi> us too. He is an <hi>Absolute</hi> Soveraign, because to <hi>Him</hi> it does belong to put a <hi>Yoke</hi> upon our <hi>Necks,</hi> But yet withal he is a <hi>good</hi> and a <hi>Gratious</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, because It is not only <hi>easy,</hi> but gives us <hi>ease</hi> too. And though it may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>vex</hi> the <hi>Body,</hi> yet it brings <note n="*" place="margin">Vers. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Rest unto the Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reason of which is wrapt up in the causal <hi>For,</hi> being consider'd in its <hi>Retrospect</hi> on the Verse going before. Where no sooner had he said, <hi>Take my Yoke, and ye shall find rest;</hi> but immediatly it follows,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106235:29"/>
               <hi>For,</hi> or <hi>Because</hi> my Yoke is easy. And this again affords us a <hi>double Reason,</hi> for which we should <hi>come</hi> at his <hi>Invitation,</hi> (v. 28.) First because my <hi>Yoke</hi> is <hi>easy,</hi> Therefore <hi>come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me;</hi> Next because it is so <hi>gratious</hi> as to give <hi>Rest unto your Souls,</hi> Therefore <hi>come unto me all ye that labour.</hi> And this is the meaning of the Text in its relation to the Context.</p>
            <p>§ 5. To Contract my meditations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compass of the time, and withal to go forwards with the design I have in hand, (which is not only to shew the <hi>Law,</hi> but also the <hi>Equity</hi> of the Gospel,) I must not <hi>now</hi> consider Christ in the <hi>extent</hi> of his <hi>Authority,</hi> as he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (that is to say) an <hi>Absolute unaccomptable</hi> Master, to whom of right it does belong to impose a <hi>Yoke,</hi> and a <hi>Burden;</hi> (for That was properly the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the last Service which I perform'd;) But only in the <hi>exercise</hi> and <hi>usage</hi> of it, as he is <gap reason="foreign">

They make their Error the more Incurable, by adding to it as great a <hi>Truth,</hi> [that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done all we can, in our submission to the Burden and Yoke of Christ, we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be accountable for All we cannot; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause where our utmost obedience <hi>Ends,</hi> our Saviour's begins to be reckon'd to us.]</p>

my Text as strongly at least as I am able, and against the Exposition St. <hi>Iohn</hi> made of it against the <hi>Gnosticks:</hi> And I think I have done it with very great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For as an <hi>Objection</hi> is never stronger, than when it is borrowed from <hi>Experience;</hi> So Truth is never more Glorious, than Oppositions and Objections (by being well answer'd) are apt to make it. Nor can an <hi>Objection</hi> be better answer'd, or more to the <hi>Snarler</hi>'s satisfaction, than when <hi>Experience</hi> as well as <hi>Reason,</hi> even in the Greatest and Best of men, is opposed to the <hi>Experience</hi> and <hi>Wants</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> in the <hi>Worst.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer cannot be Categorical, but must be adaequate to the Objection, and so proceed by several Steps; First in general, and then in some of the choisest or the most difficult of the Particulars. First I answer in general, That when 'tis said by our Lord, <hi>his yoke is easy, and burden light,</hi> it is not meant in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to That inveterate rank of Sinners, in whom <hi>the God of this World</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi>

               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 29.</note> and tread his <hi>Burden</hi> under their <hi>Feet.</hi> But as 'tis meant that his <hi>Yoke</hi> is smooth and easy in <hi>it self,</hi> or easy to Them who are wont to <hi>wear</hi> it, (whereby they have fitted it for their Necks, and their Necks for It,) so 'tis meant that his <hi>Burden</hi> is not <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>simply,</hi> but comparatively light; in respect of That <hi>Glory,</hi> whereof it <hi>works</hi> for us a <hi>weight</hi> unspeakable; and in respect of That <hi>Burden,</hi> of God's <hi>heavy Vengeance,</hi> from which it <hi>frees</hi> us. In like manner when St. <hi>Iohn</hi> affirms of <hi>Christ</hi> as a <hi>Legislator,</hi> that <hi>his Commandments are not grievous,</hi> it is not meant with respect to the <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note>

No, the Objection lyes clearly against the <hi>Soreness</hi> of the man's <hi>Eyes,</hi> and the <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of his <hi>Palate,</hi> Not at all against the <hi>Sun,</hi> and as little against the <hi>Salt,</hi> which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by the <hi>Experience</hi> as well of the <hi>Most</hi> as the most <hi>judicious,</hi> (indeed of All mortals who are not mad,) to be as good and useful Creatures, as any are in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and lower world.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Monogram</hi> of the Answer I purpose in <hi>general</hi> to the Objection, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I descend to the most difficult of the Particulars,) And I am now to fill it up

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106235:37"/>
by much the greatest, so 'tis the Soul's <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> Pleasure, to arrive at an Ability to <hi>despise</hi> That of the Body. Such was the <hi>Savour</hi> and the <hi>Gust</hi> which <hi>David</hi> had of God's Precepts, and such was his Accompt of the <hi>Delight</hi> he took in them. And surely All People of Vertue in all the Ages of the World, have ever said the same thing from the same Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. So that if any body is not of <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Mind,</hi> 'tis meerly for want of his <hi>Experience.</hi> For the Proof of sweet things lyes in the <hi>Trial,</hi> and the <hi>Taste.</hi> As the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist cry'd out in one place, <hi>Lord how sweet</hi>

            <p>Many Examples of which we have, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Christian,</hi> but Heathen World. It

was for no other reason, that <hi>Hierocles</hi> flung his Blood in his Lictor's face; that <hi>Zeno</hi> spit out his Toung into the Teeth of his Tormentor; that the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> did chose to suffer the Extremities of Heat and Cold; that the <hi>Brachmans</hi> and the <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> maintain'd their Paradox e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Victory, <hi>Nihil jucundius esse quàm pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti;</hi> I say for no other reason, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate that their <hi>Souls</hi> were <hi>above</hi> the Infirmities of their <hi>Bodies.</hi> Somewhat like the Brave Martyrs in the Eleventh Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> (thô not from the same reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious<note place="margin">Ileb. 11. 35.</note> Principle,) who having been <hi>tortur'd, would not accept of a Deliverance.</hi> In the midst of all their Agonies, they would not admit of a Relaxation.

            <p>§ 17.

            <p>First it is not an <hi>Absolute,</hi> but a <hi>Conditional</hi> Command. We are to <hi>pluck out an Eye,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a supposal that it <hi>offends</hi> us; that is to say, If it is <hi>scandalous,</hi> and makes us stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into Sin; and into such <hi>wasting</hi> Sin, as makes us fall headlong into Hell; for so our Saviour does infer in his very next words.

            <p>Thirdly 'tis the Dictate of <hi>Sanctified Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> That of any <hi>two evils,</hi> whereof the <hi>one</hi> is of <hi>Sin,</hi> the other of <hi>Affliction,</hi> we must choose to <hi>Suffer</hi> the <hi>greatest,</hi> rather than wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>Do the least.</hi> Our first Care must be, to <hi>make a Covenant with our Eyes, not to look</hi>

               <hi>upon a Maid.</hi> Next in order to That De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, we should not <hi>look round about us in the Streets of the City,</hi> for fear our Eyes become our Enemies. Or if our Eyes chance to wander beyond the Bounds of That Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, our third degree of Care must be, <hi>not to gaze upon a Woman, lest we fall by those things that are pretious in her,</hi> (v. 5. &amp; 8.) Or if <hi>This</hi> cannot be done, 'tis better to <hi>out</hi> them whilst they are <hi>innocent,</hi> (as <hi>Virginius</hi> did his <hi>Daughter,</hi>) than continue them as <hi>Inlets</hi> to <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> Nor should we be

            </p>
            <p>Last of all, this Commandment which is so <hi>grievous</hi> to us in <hi>Sound,</hi> is very far from being such in its intrinsick <hi>signification.</hi> For, in our Saviour's gratious sense, 'Tis but the <hi>Vanity</hi> of the Eye which we are bound to <hi>pluck out;</hi> 'Tis but the <hi>Violence</hi> of the Hand which we are bound to <hi>cut off;</hi> And the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity</hi> of the Foot which we are bid to <hi>cast from us,</hi> (as is shewn more at large in an <note n="*" place="margin">See the third Sermon on Mar. 10. 17.

Is any man <hi>Covetous</hi> and extremely <hi>close sisted?</hi> He thinks it is for his <hi>Interest,</hi> as being the way to be <hi>Rich</hi> in <hi>mony,</hi> which is the only <hi>Grand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> that he is <hi>driving.</hi> Or is he Free, and <hi>open-handed?</hi> He thinks it for his <hi>Interest,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the ready way to make him <hi>Rich in good Works,</hi> which is the highest and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest <hi>end</hi> at which he <hi>ayms</hi> in this World. Is there any man running headlong into a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomary <hi>Contempt</hi> of his Saviour's <hi>Yoke?</hi> He thinks it is for his <hi>Interest,</hi> as being the way to <hi>live merrily,</hi> and in <hi>Prosperity</hi> here on <hi>Earth,</hi> which is the <hi>Soveraign Allective</hi> of his Desires. Or does any man take <hi>pleasure</hi> in supporting both the <hi>Burden</hi> and <hi>Yoke</hi> of Christ? He thinks it is for his <hi>Interest,</hi> as being the way to <hi>dye safely,</hi> and to <hi>live af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death</hi> a life of <hi>Bliss</hi> and <hi>Immortality;</hi> which is the utmost <hi>Atchievement</hi> his heart is set on. Lastly would ye know the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> why I have meditated <hi>so much</hi> upon this

kind of Subject? why I have struck so <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Blows</hi> upon this great <hi>Anvil?</hi> made so many long <hi>Discourses</hi> (though on occasion of divers Texts) touching the <hi>Equity</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> of our Saviour's Gospel? and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable <hi>Necessity</hi> of our <hi>obedience</hi> unto the end? The Reason of it is truly This, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have thought it most mine <hi>own,</hi> and <hi>other</hi> men's <hi>Interest</hi> so to do. And till we are able to be so happy, as to convince <hi>our selves</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> that 'tis most for our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> to bear the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Christ's <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Burden</hi> of his <hi>Cross</hi> when 'tis laid upon us; 'Tis very sure that <hi>neither</hi> of us shall bear the one, or the other, as is <hi>requir'd.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as 'tis as sure, on the other side, That as we <hi>never</hi> neglect our <hi>Interest</hi> in what is <hi>Secular,</hi> or <hi>Carnal,</hi> (as touching our <hi>Credits,</hi> or our <hi>Estates,</hi> or our <hi>Temporal Preservation;</hi>) so as little shall we indure, to start aside from the <hi>Burden</hi> or <hi>Yoke</hi> of Christ, if indeed we do <hi>believe</hi> it our greatest <hi>Interest</hi> to bear them as He requires. For can the very same man who is sollicitously <hi>careful</hi> to get a <hi>Trifle,</hi> be as perfectly careless to gain a <hi>Talent?</hi> or stand in very <hi>great</hi> Dread of a <hi>lesser</hi> Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106235:51"/>
But of an infinitely <hi>greater,</hi> in <hi>none</hi> at all? If we are <hi>strict</hi> in our <hi>conforming</hi> to the <hi>Commandments</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> with whom the <hi>Penalties</hi> are but <hi>Temporal,</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenses</hi> but <hi>finite.;</hi> we cannot sure be <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> to the <hi>Commandments</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> on a Supposal that we <hi>believe</hi> it as great a Truth as any is, That his <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Rewards,</hi> are both <hi>Immortal,</hi> and <hi>Immense.</hi> Nor can I think of a more <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> or a more <hi>satisfactory</hi> Accompt, why the Commandments of <hi>men</hi> should be so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>heeded</hi> by us, with more <hi>circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> than those of <hi>Christ,</hi> but that we fear <hi>Them</hi> more, and believe <hi>Him</hi> less; or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the Interest of our <hi>Bodies</hi> above the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of our <hi>Souls;</hi> or prefer the seeming certainty of what is <hi>Present,</hi> before the <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Expectance</hi> of what is <hi>future;</hi> And had rather become the owners of <hi>Earthly</hi> Contentments in <hi>Possession,</hi> than to be deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Reversions</hi> in <hi>Heaven it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 23. And therefore to the end we may be able even <hi>to feel,</hi> and by consequence to arrive at the <hi>Conviction</hi> of <hi>Experience,</hi> That the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Christ's <hi>Law</hi> is really <hi>Easy in it</hi>

               <q>Wherefore we receiving a Kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have Grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with Reverence and godly Fear. For our God is a Consuming Fire.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THere is something Difficult in the Text, which will (I think) be best explain'd by way of Answer to an Objection. For why is it said here, <hi>Let us have Grace?</hi> It may seem at first hearing a strange expression, whether we <hi>have</hi> it, or have it <hi>not.</hi> For if we <hi>have</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:106235:54"/>
it, it seems <hi>superfluous;</hi> and if we have it <hi>not,</hi> it seems as <hi>vain.</hi> We <hi>need</hi> not say <hi>Let us have,</hi> what 'tis plain we have <hi>already</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we <hi>say</hi> it: And we say to <hi>no purpose, Let us have</hi> this or that, which whilst we have <hi>not,</hi> it is not in our <hi>power</hi> to have. For, Is the Grace of God Almighty at <hi>our Disposal?</hi> Can we <hi>confer</hi> it upon <hi>our selves,</hi> that it should hear be said to us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Let us have grace?</hi> we cannot <hi>have</hi> grace till we <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> it, nor can we possibly <hi>receive</hi> it, till God most <hi>freely bestows</hi> it on us. What is this that he saith then, <hi>let us have grace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To answer this it must be known, that in many places of Scripture <hi>Grace</hi> doth signifie the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Whether as being the chief <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument</hi> or <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Grace;</hi> or as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exhibiting <hi>the Covenant of Grace,</hi> which does often stand oppos'd unto the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works;</hi> or else as being the <hi>great Message</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> from <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>Earth.</hi> Whether for <hi>these,</hi> or for <hi>other</hi> Reasons, so it is that the word <hi>Grace</hi> doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten signifie the <hi>Gospel;</hi> especially <hi>then,</hi> when 'tis oppos'd unto the <hi>Law.</hi> A clear Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of which we have, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 17. <hi>The Law</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:106235:54"/>
               <hi>came by</hi> Moses, <hi>but Grace and Truth from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ:</hi> that is, The <hi>Gospel</hi> of Grace and Truth. For there was <hi>truth</hi> in the <hi>Law,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Gospel;</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> was given unto the <hi>Iews,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> of whom we are. And therefore the meaning of it must be, That as the <hi>Law</hi> came by <hi>Moses,</hi> so the <hi>Gospel of grace</hi> came down from Heaven by <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> and so it is called by St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20. 24. Another Instance of it we have <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>We are not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> that is, the <hi>Gospel of Christ</hi> which is the <hi>Word of his Grace;</hi> and so St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it again, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32. For it cannot be meant concerning the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Sanctification;</hi> because even <hi>They</hi> were under <hi>that,</hi> who were under the <hi>Law</hi> that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Moses;</hi> else would <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> himself have been <hi>void of Grace.</hi> Which being eminently Impossible, 'tis plain the <hi>Gospel</hi> must be the thing which is there opposed unto the <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as in <hi>other</hi> places of Scripture, so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in <hi>This</hi> which now is under consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, the <hi>Grace</hi> of God is so set, as to signifie nothing but the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And (the word

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to <hi>Have</hi> it in this place, is nothing else but to <hi>hold it fast.</hi> So that the Scope of the Exhortation, is, that we <hi>hold fast the Gospel or Law of Christ,</hi> described to be the <hi>Instrument,</hi> whereby we may perform a <hi>Service acceptable to God.</hi> But <hi>acceptable Service</hi> it cannot be, unless attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Reverence.</hi> To wit with a <hi>reverence</hi> of his <hi>Mercy</hi> in the <hi>beginning</hi> of the Text, and with a <hi>fear</hi> of his <hi>Wrath</hi> in the later <hi>end.</hi> The Duty therefore is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>behind;</hi> and that with such <hi>Reasons,</hi> as 'tis not easy to <hi>resist.</hi> For first the <hi>Reason</hi> going <hi>before</hi> is drawn from the <hi>richness</hi> of our <hi>Reward,</hi> in case we <hi>serve</hi> God as he here requires. And then the <hi>Reason</hi> coming <hi>behind</hi> is from the <hi>Grievousness</hi> of the <hi>Punishment,</hi> in case we serve him <hi>not at all,</hi> or not at all with due <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>godly Fear.</hi> Our <hi>reward,</hi> if we <hi>do,</hi> is no less than a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and a Kingdom <hi>not to be moved.</hi> But our <hi>punishment</hi> (if we do <hi>not</hi>) is to <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> by the hand that should make us <hi>whole;</hi> to feel the <hi>God</hi> of our <hi>life</hi> a <hi>consuming fire.</hi> The one affords us an <hi>Allective,</hi> whereby to <hi>draw</hi> us to the Duty; the other an <hi>Impellent,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:106235:55"/>
to <hi>drive</hi> us <hi>on.</hi> It is the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and the <hi>Care</hi> of the holy Penman, to place our <hi>Duty</hi> in the midst of <hi>a double motive,</hi> that if the <hi>one</hi> cannot engage us, the <hi>other</hi> may. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with a <hi>Promise,</hi> to feed our <hi>Hope;</hi> and concludes with a <hi>Threat,</hi> to excite our <hi>Fear.</hi> The first as a <hi>Spur</hi> does provoke to <hi>Vertue;</hi> the second, as a <hi>Bridle,</hi> withholds from <hi>Vice.</hi> And he is sure a <hi>dull Beast,</hi> whom <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Spur</hi> cannot <hi>excite,</hi> or at least a very <hi>wild</hi> one; whom <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Bridle</hi> cannot <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole circuit of the Text being thus explain'd, there are <hi>five</hi> things especially to be <hi>inferr'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First that the <hi>Liberty</hi> of a Christian doth carry its <hi>Yoke</hi> along with it. It being a liberty from <hi>Moses,</hi> but not from <hi>Christ;</hi> the Condition of whose <hi>Gospel</hi> is our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto the <hi>Law.</hi> I do not mean the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical,</hi> whether <hi>Iudicial</hi> or <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> which were but <hi>positive</hi> Laws at best, but the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> or <hi>Moral,</hi> which is withal the <hi>Aeternal</hi> Law; The Law, of which our Saviour saith, that he came not to <hi>abrogate,</hi> but to <hi>fulfil</hi> it: Not to <hi>evacuate,</hi> but <hi>fill</hi> it up. Rather
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106235:56"/>
to <hi>strengthen,</hi> than to <hi>destroy</hi> it. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>let us have Grace,</hi> that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, let us <hi>hold fast</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> or <hi>Law of Christ.</hi> And let us hold it as an <hi>Instrument</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to <hi>serve</hi> him. And let us serve him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, so as our <hi>Persons</hi> and our <hi>Service</hi> may be <hi>accepted.</hi> But yet</p>
            <p>Secondly, we cannot Serve him <hi>so,</hi> as to be <hi>accepted;</hi> (we cannot do it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, so as to satisfy and <hi>please</hi> him in what we do,) unless we serve him with <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>godly Fear</hi> With a <hi>reverence</hi> of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> whereby we are <hi>capable</hi> of a <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and with a <hi>fear</hi> of his <hi>Wrath,</hi> whereby he becomes a <hi>consuming fire.</hi> So that the Reverence has a <hi>Retrospect</hi> on the beginning of the Text; and the <hi>fear</hi> has a <hi>Prospect</hi> upon the <hi>End.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
            <p>Thirdly, here is a <hi>reason</hi> for <hi>each</hi> of these <hi>Qualifications,</hi> by which our <hi>Service</hi> is to be <hi>such,</hi> as to be <hi>accepted.</hi> A reason <hi>why</hi> it must be with <hi>reverence,</hi> and a reason <hi>why</hi> it must be with <hi>fear.</hi> Let us serve God with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>because thereby we receive a Kingdom,</hi> (a Kingdom of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> too; the <hi>first</hi> being as 'twere an <hi>Inchoation</hi> of the <hi>second;</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:106235:56"/>
and <hi>Both</hi> as I conceive, alluded to in this Text;) Again let us Serve him with godly fear; <hi>Because he is</hi> else <hi>a consuming fire.</hi> And then</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is obvious to infer even from <hi>hence,</hi> that the <hi>Fear</hi> of God, as a <hi>Destroyer,</hi> may nevertheless be a <hi>godly fear;</hi> because it is coupled here with <hi>Reverence,</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence with <hi>love.</hi> For Reverence is a <hi>Compound,</hi> which hath <hi>love</hi> as well as <hi>fear</hi> for a chief <hi>Ingredient.</hi> And the Fear here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by <hi>godly</hi> Fear, is not only a fear of <hi>God's Power</hi> and <hi>Majesty,</hi> in respect of which he is a <hi>Severaign,</hi> who hath an <hi>absolute Do minion</hi> over the work of his hands; nor on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a fear of his <hi>love and mercy,</hi> in respect of which he is a <hi>Father,</hi> who by his Children must be <hi>revered:</hi> but especially a Fear of his <hi>Wrath and Iustice,</hi> in respect of which he is a <hi>Iudge,</hi> and so an <hi>Executor of Vengeance.</hi> It is a <hi>fear</hi> indeed of <hi>God,</hi> but under the notion of a <hi>Consumer.</hi> A <hi>fear</hi> enforced with a <hi>Reason</hi> all arm'd with <hi>terrour;</hi> (for nothing strikes terror so much as <hi>Fire.</hi>) Lastly a <hi>fear</hi> whereof the <hi>Terror</hi> is ushered in with the Causal <hi>For,</hi> which shew's the <hi>Tendency</hi> of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106235:57"/>
Terror towards the <hi>Godliness</hi> of the fear: for thus lyes the order and the coherence of the words. Let us serve him with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and <hi>Godly</hi> fear, <hi>For</hi> our God is a Consuming Fire.</p>
            <p>Last of all we may infer from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 6. to v. 11.</note> 
               <hi>our,</hi> That God is no such Accepter of Persons, as to <hi>connive</hi> at Sin in <hi>us,</hi> whilst he does <hi>punish</hi> it in <hi>others.</hi> No, <hi>the times of their ignorance God winked at,</hi> (saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,) <hi>But now commandeth all men every where to repent.</hi> To <hi>us</hi> indeed, if we <hi>repent,</hi> he is <hi>a God ready to pardon; swift</hi> to shew <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and <hi>slow</hi> to <hi>wrath.</hi> But to <hi>us</hi> being <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent</hi> he is a Terrible, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See Deut. 4. 24. where a</hi> consuming Fire <hi>is explained by</hi> a jealous God. <hi>Which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 24. 17. where</hi> the glory of the Lord was like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire upon the top of the Mount.</note> a <hi>jealous,</hi> and an <hi>avenging</hi> God. From whence 'tis inferr'd by the holy Writer, That <hi>we,</hi> as well as the People <hi>Israel</hi> are bound to serve God with <hi>Fear and Reverence;</hi> Because <hi>Our</hi> God as well as <hi>Theirs</hi> is a <hi>consuming Fire.</hi> That is, the <hi>same</hi> God is such, as well to <hi>Us,</hi> as to <hi>Them.</hi> For here 'tis worthy to be observ'd, That as <hi>Moses</hi> exhorting his people <hi>Israel to take heed unto themselves, that they forget not the Covenant of the Lord their God,</hi> gave his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in these words, For <hi>the Lord Thy God is</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:106235:57"/>
               <hi>a Consuming Fire;</hi> So our Apostle in this Chapter, having first of all compared the <hi>Law</hi> with the <hi>Gospel, Moses</hi> with <hi>Christ,</hi> and a <hi>Contemner</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> with a <hi>Despiser</hi> of the <hi>other;</hi> and having exhorted us to the <hi>Duty</hi> incumbent on us as we are <hi>Christians;</hi> gives the very <hi>same reason</hi> in the very <hi>same words,</hi> (with no more than the change of a Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syllable,) for <hi>OUR God is a consuming Fire.</hi> Such he is, as the God of <hi>All;</hi> but above all, as he is <hi>OURS;</hi> because <hi>we</hi> sin, when we sin, against greater <hi>light;</hi> and against great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>obligations</hi> to <hi>cease</hi> from sinning.</p>
            <p>Having now done with the explication and with the division of the Text, 'twill be most <hi>useful</hi> as well as <hi>natural</hi> to begin with the <hi>first</hi> of the five Illations, Because the greatest numbers of men do stand in need of a conviction, That <hi>Christianity</hi> is a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> requiring our <hi>Industry</hi> and <hi>Care.</hi> A <hi>Service</hi> consisting of <hi>Obedience,</hi> as well as <hi>Faith;</hi> in as much as the <hi>Promises</hi> of the Gospel are clog'd with <hi>Precepts.</hi> Thô the Yoke of Christ is easy, yet 'tis a <hi>Yoke;</hi> and thô his Burden is light, yet 'tis a <hi>Burden</hi> To <hi>stand fast in that Liberty wherewith Christ</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:106235:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>hath made us free,</hi> is <hi>to hold fast the Gospel or Law of Christ,</hi> and to hold it as an <hi>Instrument</hi> whereby to <hi>serve</hi> him: and to serve him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, so as our Persons and our Service may be accepted.</p>
            <p>A Doctrin the rather to be Imprinted in all our memories and our minds, (as either a method for prevention, or means of cure,) because throughout <hi>the whole catalogue of damning Haeresies,</hi> whether as that Catalogue was <hi>begun</hi> by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> or as <hi>continued</hi> by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> or as <hi>perfected</hi> by St. <hi>Austin,</hi> (and other <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>) none hath shed a more killing Influence upon the minds and manners of Christian People, (so far at least as I am able to conjecture,) than the <hi>mistaken,</hi> but <hi>pleasant</hi> notions, of <hi>Iustification,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> of Christ, and <hi>Christian Liberty.</hi> Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any four things are more needful to be believ'd; or more subject to be mistaken.

               <hi>obedience</hi> as the <hi>chief purpose</hi> of his coming, and to give us <hi>Heaven</hi> as the <hi>Accession.</hi> For real happiness consisting in being <hi>holy as God is holy,</hi> 'Tis plain that <hi>Heaven</hi> can be no more, than a good <hi>Appendix</hi> of our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. For can we imagin, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self can be any whit the <hi>happier</hi> for being in <hi>Heaven?</hi> No; 'Tis <hi>Heaven</hi> which is the <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier</hi> for being <hi>God's Throne:</hi> which should he fix upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> Heaven would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently be his <hi>Footstool.</hi> As it is not the <hi>Court</hi> which gives Majesty to the <hi>King;</hi> But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the <hi>King</hi> is, there's the <hi>Court.</hi> To be in Heaven <hi>without holiness,</hi> (like the lost Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Angels) would be to make it a <hi>second Hell.</hi> And therefore They, at the Day of Judgment, who shall intreat the <hi>Hills</hi> to <hi>cover</hi> them, and the <hi>Mountains to fall upon them,</hi> will have no other reason for that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, than <hi>to be hid from the face of him that sitteth upon the Throne.</hi> From whence it is obvious to infer, that to a man of <hi>impure Eyes,</hi> nothing <hi>smarts</hi> more than the <hi>Sight of Bliss.</hi> And therefore our Saviour's coming hither was <hi>first</hi> to <hi>fortifie</hi> our eyes, or to make them <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> to procure us the <hi>Blessed Vision.</hi>

            <p>THe words (in <hi>general</hi>) are a <hi>Command,</hi> delivered by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Name of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Great Master,</hi> to the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of God, in the Church at <hi>Philippi.</hi> In which there are chiefly <hi>four</hi> things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd.</p>
            <p>First the <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>Servants.</hi> Next the <hi>wages</hi> which they <hi>expected.</hi> Thirdly the <hi>work,</hi> with which the wages was to be <hi>earn'd.</hi> And lastly the <hi>manner,</hi> or <hi>qualification,</hi> with which the working was to be cloath'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:106235:73"/>First for the <hi>Quality</hi> of the Servants, <hi>They</hi> were such as had been <hi>diligent</hi> in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their Duty. They had not only been <hi>sometimes</hi> dutiful; they had not only been good by <hi>fits;</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they had <hi>always obeyed;</hi> They had <hi>evermore</hi> liv'd in the fear of God.</p>
            <p>Next for the <hi>Wages</hi> which they expected, <hi>That</hi> is expressed by [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] to be <hi>Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> both as it signifies a <hi>deliverance</hi> from the tremendous <hi>Pains</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> and as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting an <hi>Advancement</hi> to the ravishing <hi>Ioys</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Thirdly for the <hi>Work,</hi> with which the Wages was to be earn'd, That is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> Very significantly implyed in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as that looks back upon the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. As ye have <hi>always obey'd,</hi> so now <hi>much more</hi> obey the Gospel. <hi>Continue</hi> the Course of your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Go on to <hi>finish</hi> the work which ye have begun; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>work,</hi> and <hi>work out</hi> your own Salvation.</p>
            <p>Last of all, for the <hi>Manner</hi> or <hi>Qualification</hi> of the working, whereby to make it become effectual for the receiving of the Reward,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106235:73"/>
There must be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, our Salvation is to be wrought for, <hi>with Fear and Tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi> And that according to the <hi>threefold Signification</hi> of this expression.</p>
            <p>First with <hi>Meekness</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi> We must not put the <hi>least Trust</hi> in the <hi>greatest Performances</hi> of our <hi>own;</hi> nor must we be <hi>puff't</hi> or <hi>lifted up</hi> with the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>given</hi> us.</p>
            <p>Next with <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Solicitude.</hi> That we may not for <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Perseverance,</hi> finally <hi>miss</hi> of the <hi>Prize</hi> that is set before us, and for which we have hitherto as it were <hi>contended</hi> by our <hi>obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly with <hi>Awefulness,</hi> and <hi>Horror,</hi> or <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Dread;</hi> Because as God is (in one Cafe) a <hi>quickning Light,</hi> so he is (in another) a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming Fire.</hi> He who <hi>purposely</hi> created us to do him <hi>service,</hi> is He who will <hi>turn us to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> unless we serve him as he <hi>Requires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now to anticipate an Inquiry, how <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> and <hi>Solicitude,</hi> (as well as <hi>Awefulness</hi> and <hi>Dread,</hi> are comprehended under the notion of <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Trembling,</hi> I think it is easy to make it clear from the consideration of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text;</hi> without recourse to those other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106235:74"/>
wherein we meet with the <hi>same expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> For</p>
            <p>First <hi>in vain</hi> should we indeavour the <hi>working out</hi> of our <hi>Salvation,</hi> but that <hi>it is God who worketh in us both to will,</hi> and to <hi>do.</hi> And therefore we must do it with all <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> because in <hi>our</hi> selves (as <hi>of our selves</hi>) there dwelleth no good thing; no not so much as <hi>Inclination</hi> to <hi>any</hi> thing that is <hi>good,</hi> no not so much as <hi>Aversation</hi> from <hi>any</hi> thing that is <hi>evil.</hi> But <hi>every good and perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights.</hi> If we can triumph over the <hi>Law,</hi> as the <hi>strength of Sin,</hi> by treading <hi>Sin</hi> under our <hi>Feet,</hi> as the <hi>sting of Death,</hi> All the <hi>Thanks must be to God, who hath given us the Victory through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And yet</p>
            <p>Secondly; Although it is <hi>God that worketh in us both to will, and to do;</hi> yet the Apostle makes it a <hi>Reason,</hi> why <hi>we our selves</hi> are to <hi>work out</hi> our <hi>own Salvation.</hi> And therefore we must do it with <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Diligence,</hi> lest whilst God by his <hi>Grace</hi> is not wanting unto <hi>us,</hi> we finally miss of his <hi>Glory,</hi> by having been wanting unto <hi>our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:106235:74"/>Thus we see there is pregnant Reason, for the Double Importance of the Phrase as 'tis <hi>meerly rational.</hi> And of the <hi>literal</hi> Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I suppose there cannot be any Doubt. For</p>
            <p>We must work out our Salvation with <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Trembling,</hi> (in as much as that sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the greatest <hi>Awefulness</hi> and <hi>Dread,</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the <hi>Dreadfulness</hi> of our <hi>Doom,</hi> in case we work <hi>not at all,</hi> or not at all to <hi>that purpose</hi> that God requires. And thus I hope I have so <hi>divided,</hi> as withal to have <hi>explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>clear'd</hi> the Text.</p>
            <p>The first three Parts of the whole Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may well be thrust up together into this Doctrinal Proposition. [That our Salvation is not attainable by a meer <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> of <hi>Iudgment</hi> in point of Faith, or a bare <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude</hi> of <hi>Opinions</hi> concerning God; But by <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Gospel</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>] For what is expressed by <hi>obedience,</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this Verse; is also expressed in the later, by <hi>the working out</hi> of <hi>our own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And as <hi>Salvation</hi> is a Thing which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires our <hi>working;</hi> So 'tis not any kind of working will serve our Turn. For</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:106235:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>The last Particular of the four affords us a <hi>second Proposition,</hi> which is as apt to defend us from Carnal Security, as the First. To wit, [That however Unavoidable our State of Bliss may seem to us, by our having (with the <hi>Philippians) obeyed Always,</hi> yet our <hi>obedience unto the Gospel</hi> or <hi>Law of Christ,</hi> by which alone we are to <hi>work out our own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is to be qualified and season'd with <hi>Fear and Trembling.</hi>]</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> of these I have consider'd in a former Subject of Meditation, when I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon the <hi>Matter</hi> of which our work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to <hi>consist.</hi> I now am come to that Part of my General Method and Design, which obligeth me strictly to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Second;</hi> as touching the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> or <hi>Qualification</hi> wherewith our working is to be cloath'd, whereby to make it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come effectual for the receiving of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. To wit, with <hi>Meekness</hi> and <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> with <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Solicitude,</hi> with <hi>Awefulness</hi> and <hi>Horror,</hi> or <hi>holy Dread;</hi> the threefold Importance of <hi>Fear and Trembling;</hi> which must first be considered in the <hi>Gross,</hi> and after that, in the <hi>Retail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:106235:75"/>First consider'd in the <hi>Gross,</hi> it shews us a ready and easy way of <hi>reconciling</hi> and <hi>understanding</hi> those parts of Scripture, which being taken but in the <hi>letter,</hi> do seem to <hi>differ,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict.</hi> For there is not any <hi>One</hi> Passion or Affection of the Mind, either more rigidly <hi>forbidden,</hi> or more earnestly <hi>commanded,</hi> than that of <hi>Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is so rigidly forbidden, that the <hi>fearful and unbelieving have their part in the Lake of Fire and Brimstone,</hi> (Rev. 21. 8.) where St. <hi>Iohn</hi> making a <hi>Muster</hi> of such as are <hi>listed</hi> under the <hi>Devil,</hi> and <hi>bound</hi> for <hi>Hell,</hi> sets the <hi>Fearful and Unbelieving</hi> (as it were) in the <hi>Front</hi> of the whole <hi>Battalia,</hi> with which the desperate <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Darkness</hi> is wont to wage <hi>War</hi> against the <hi>Father of Lights.</hi> As for The <hi>Murderers,</hi> and <hi>Whoremongers,</hi> The <hi>Sorcerers</hi> and <hi>Idolaters,</hi> They all <hi>march after</hi> in <hi>Rank and File;</hi> Implying the <hi>Fearful</hi> and <hi>Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> to be the <hi>Ringleaders</hi> in Hell, and as it were in the <hi>Van</hi> of the Devil's Army. <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief</hi> is so commonly the <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> is commonly such a <hi>Tempter</hi> to <hi>Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> that we find them often yok't toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if not so as to signifie, one, the other.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106235:76"/>
               <hi>Woe be to fearful Hearts, and faint Hands,</hi> and <hi>the Sinner that goeth two ways; woe be to him that is faint-hearted, for he believeth not, therefore shall he not be defended,</hi> (Ecclus. 2. 12, 13.) It seems that <hi>Fear</hi> is a Thing, of which we ought to be <hi>sore afraid;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is apt to make us sinners <hi>going two ways at once.</hi> One in our <hi>Principles,</hi> and quite another in our <hi>Practice.</hi> Very fit to be compar'd unto <hi>wandering Stars,</hi> which are carried towards the <hi>West</hi> by the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> whilst They are stealing towards the <hi>East</hi> by their <hi>proper motion.</hi> When <hi>Peter</hi> was frighted upon the Sea, and cryed [<hi>Lord save me</hi>] as he was just ready to sink; although it was a <hi>good Prayer,</hi> yet because it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Carnal <hi>Fear,</hi> rather than <hi>Faith,</hi> our Saviour presently took him up with an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>O Thou of little Faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</hi> And so it was fitly said by <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> in his Divine <hi>Benedictus,</hi> That God did Therefore <hi>deliver us out of the hands of our Enemies, that we might serve him without Fear,</hi> (Luke 1. 74.) With which agrees That of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy; He hath not given us the spirit of Fear, but of Love,</hi> (2 Tim. 1. 7.)
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106235:76"/>
To which it is added by St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> That <hi>there is no Fear in Love, for perfect Love casteth out Fear,</hi> (1 John 4. 18.)</p>
            <p>Thus we see how this Passion is very <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidly forbidden</hi> throughout the Scriptures. And yet for all that it is so <hi>earnestly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> that we cannot <hi>serve God acceptably,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we serve him with <hi>Fear,</hi> as well as <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> (Heb. 12. penult) Nor can there be any such thing as the <hi>working out of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> unless we do it with <hi>Fear and Tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> For the <hi>fear of the Lord</hi> is the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Wisdom,</hi> (Prov. 1. 7.) Nay (as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> goes on in the fourteenth Chapter, v. 27.) The <hi>fear of the Lord</hi> is a <hi>Fountain of Life;</hi> the attainment of which is the <hi>end of Wisdom.</hi> And thence 'tis set by our Apostle as the highest accomplishment of a Christian, To <hi>perfect holiness in the Fear of God,</hi> (2 Cor. 7. 1.)</p>
            <p>What then may be the meaning of these <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, these so <hi>seeming Contradictions,</hi> that we must serve God <hi>with</hi> Fear, and that we must serve him <hi>without</hi> Fear? that there is <hi>no fear</hi> in <hi>love,</hi> yet <hi>no true love</hi> without some <hi>fear?</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:106235:77"/>The Reconcilement of These is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obvious. It is no more but to distinguish betwixt that which is <hi>Carnal,</hi> and that which is <hi>Spiritual;</hi> betwixt the spirit of <hi>Bondage,</hi> and the spirit of <hi>Adoption;</hi> betwixt a <hi>servile,</hi> and <hi>filial</hi> Fear. As 'tis true in <hi>one</hi> sense, that <hi>perfect Love doth cast out Fear,</hi> so 'tis true in <hi>another,</hi> that perfect <hi>Love</hi> doth <hi>carry fear</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <hi>with</hi> it.</p>
            <p>When I say with St. <hi>Iohn, It casteth out Fear;</hi> I mean that childish unmanlike Fear, which <hi>betrayeth those Succours that Reason of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth;</hi> especially that heathenish and carnal fear, the fear of <hi>Poverty,</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effects of <hi>Persecution;</hi> the fear that made so many <hi>Sinners</hi> going <hi>two ways</hi> at once. And so it casteth out <hi>one</hi> fear with <hi>another;</hi> the <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>them</hi> that can <hi>kill</hi> the <hi>Body,</hi> but are <hi>not able</hi> to hurt the <hi>Soul,</hi> with the fear of <hi>Him</hi> who is able to cast them <hi>both</hi> into <hi>Hell.</hi> In this sense 'tis said, we must serve God <hi>without Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when I say the <hi>same Love</hi> doth carry <hi>fear</hi> along with it, I mean <hi>the fear of offending God,</hi> the fear of <hi>quenching</hi> or <hi>grieving</hi> his holy <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> the fear of <hi>never doing enough</hi> whereby to

please him; the fear of <hi>falling into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> the fear of a treacherous <hi>deceitful heart;</hi> that is, the fear of <hi>Unsincerity</hi> in the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi> of our <hi>Service;</hi> the fear of <hi>falling</hi> from our own <hi>steadfastness,</hi> and so of <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Grace of God in vain.</hi> In this sense<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 1.</note> 'tis said by the <hi>Royal Prophet, Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce unto him with Reverence.</hi> And thus 'tis said by the <hi>Royal Preacher, Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is the man that feareth always.</hi> As a meer <hi>carnal fear</hi> is a <hi>fear</hi> of that which is <hi>carnal,</hi> so a <hi>godly fear</hi> is the <hi>fear of God.</hi> First a fear of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> in respect of which he is a <hi>Soveraign;</hi> next a fear of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> in respect of which he is a <hi>Father;</hi> (for so 'tis said by the Prophet <hi>David, There is Mercy with thee, ô Lord, therefore shalt thou be Feared.</hi>) Lastly a fear of his <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> in respect of which he is a <hi>Iudge,</hi> and also an <hi>Executor</hi> of <hi>Vengeance.</hi>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106235:85"/>
is evinced even from <hi>hence,</hi> that as God hath <hi>his</hi> part, so we have <hi>ours,</hi> in the great <hi>Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of our <hi>Salvation,</hi> Because we are many times <hi>threatned</hi> with <hi>falling short of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> in Case we <hi>depart from the living God.</hi> For God cannot <hi>threaten</hi> to be <hi>reveng'd</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>Creatures,</hi> for what <hi>Himself</hi> doth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>not do,</hi> but for what is either <hi>performed,</hi> or not <hi>performed,</hi> by his <hi>Creatures.</hi> It being not possibly <hi>imputable</hi> to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that God hath <hi>made</hi> it <hi>Thus,</hi> or <hi>Thus;</hi> any more than God himself can be <hi>accompta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to his Creature, <hi>why</hi> he made it <hi>Thus,</hi> or <hi>Thus.</hi> God indeed doth <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I may say in some sense, that God made <hi>Hell</hi> for the use of <hi>all;</hi> as well of the <hi>best,</hi> as the <hi>worst</hi> of men. For a <hi>Torment</hi> only to <hi>These,</hi> who have <hi>hated knowledge,</hi> and <hi>will</hi>

could wish that this <hi>Distinction</hi> (since 'tis suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of it self) might find so much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in all mens Eyes, as to <hi>appease</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile</hi> dissenting Brethren.

For the Decree which is <hi>respective</hi> in <hi>sensu diviso,</hi> may so be proved to be <hi>Absolute</hi> in <hi>sensu composito,</hi> as to afford a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, That God's <hi>Decree</hi> of the several <hi>Ends</hi> was in <hi>respect</hi> to the several <hi>Means.</hi> For if in <hi>sensu composito,</hi> He did absolutely decree, that all who are <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>repent</hi> should belong to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and that all who
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106235:87"/>
are <hi>faithless</hi> and <hi>impenitent</hi> should in like manner belong to <hi>Hell;</hi> Then his Decree was <hi>respective</hi> (in <hi>sensu diviso</hi>) of that <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> or <hi>Impenitence,</hi> by which Professors do belong to <hi>Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Hell.</hi> From whence it follows unavoidably, that if we are <hi>faithless</hi> and <hi>impenitent,</hi> (be it in a <hi>greater,</hi> or <hi>lesser</hi> measure,) we ought to be affected with <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>trembling,</hi> (in the <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> sense of this expression,) and never to give our selves Rest, until we be <hi>faithful,</hi> and do <hi>repent.</hi> But faithful and penitent we cannot be, till by the power of God's Grace, (after our <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears</hi> shall have given him <hi>no Rest</hi>) he shall be pleas'd to work <hi>in us,</hi> and <hi>with</hi> us too, not only to <hi>will,</hi> but to <hi>do</hi> his work. That by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Grace we <hi>may</hi> all <hi>endeavour,</hi> and by the power of his Grace <hi>on</hi> our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, we our selves may have a <hi>Power</hi> too, whereby to <hi>work out our own Salvation.</hi> And work for it we must with a sacred <hi>horror,</hi> because of the <hi>Dreadfulness</hi> of our <hi>Doom,</hi> if we work <hi>remissly.</hi> For as (on one side) God himself cannot <hi>condemn</hi> us, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our sins past have been very <hi>great,</hi>)
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106235:88"/>
if we immediately <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>amend</hi> our <hi>lives,</hi> because he is <hi>faithful who hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> and he hath <hi>promised forgiveness</hi> to all that <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>turn</hi> unto him; so withal (on the other side) Let our Righteousness past have been what it will, yet if we <hi>return from Righteousness to Sin,</hi> God himself can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>save</hi> us, without our <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> because he hath <hi>sworn</hi> that the <hi>Impenitent</hi> shall <hi>not enter</hi> into his <hi>Rest.</hi> Not that God can be <hi>overpower'd</hi> by any <hi>Quality</hi> in the <hi>Creature,</hi> whether <hi>Repentance</hi> in the first Case, or <hi>Impenitence</hi> in the <hi>second;</hi> But because his <hi>Power</hi> (in the <hi>first</hi>) is suspended by his <hi>Mercy,</hi> as it stands in conjunction with his <hi>Truth.</hi> For in his <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> he made a <hi>Promise</hi> to give us <hi>pardon</hi> if we <hi>repent,</hi> and in his <hi>Truth</hi> he must <hi>perform</hi> it. Just so his <hi>Power</hi> (in the second) is suspended by his <hi>Iustice,</hi> as it stands in conjunction with his <hi>Truth</hi> too. For in his <hi>Iustice</hi> he made an <hi>Oath</hi> to be <hi>revenged</hi> on the <hi>Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> and in his <hi>Truth</hi> he must make it <hi>good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now since each of these Cases concerns us <hi>All,</hi> (be we never so <hi>good,</hi> or be we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so <hi>evil,</hi>) I need not shew by another
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106235:88"/>
               <hi>Medium how</hi> the <hi>love</hi> of God's <hi>Mercy</hi> doth consist with a <hi>fear</hi> of his <hi>Indignation,</hi> and how whilst we <hi>love</hi> him as a <hi>Father,</hi> we ought to <hi>fear</hi> him as a Judge.</p>
            <p>But (to conclude with such a <hi>Caveat,</hi> as may best of all become an <hi>Ingenuous</hi> People) Take we heed that our <hi>Fear</hi> do not swallow up our <hi>Love;</hi> for fear it swallow up <hi>us</hi> too in the <hi>Bottomless Pit</hi> of <hi>Desperation.</hi> We must <hi>serve</hi> God with <hi>Fear,</hi> but so as to <hi>fear</hi> him also for <hi>Love.</hi> Ever saying with the Psalmist, <hi>There is mercy with thee ô Lord, therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shalt thou be feared.</hi> The Psalmist did not thus argue, <hi>There is Mercy with Thee ô Lord,</hi> Therefore shalt thou be <hi>rely'd upon,</hi> Therefore we shall make the <hi>bolder</hi> with thee; we shall break thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without the <hi>fear</hi> of being <hi>damn'd,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we know thou art <hi>slow</hi> to <hi>anger,</hi> and being <hi>angry</hi> art quickly <hi>pleas'd;</hi> But because of thy <hi>mercy</hi> thou shalt be <hi>feared.</hi> And there is good reason for it. For by how much the <hi>kinder</hi> a Father is, a well-natur'd Son will <hi>fear</hi> to <hi>offend</hi> him so much the <hi>more.</hi> And the more our <hi>Father</hi> which is in Heaven does even <hi>delight</hi> to please <hi>us,</hi> (by heaping his
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106235:89"/>
               <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Favours</hi> on us,) by so much the more shall we be <hi>afraid,</hi> (if we are <hi>well-natur'd</hi> Children) to <hi>exasperate</hi> our <hi>Father</hi> which is in Heaven.</p>
            <p>What then remains, but that we <hi>ponder</hi> these things, and <hi>lay them up</hi> in our <hi>hearts,</hi> and <hi>draw</hi> them <hi>forth</hi> into our <hi>Actions,</hi> and daily <hi>repeat</hi> them in our <hi>Lives,</hi> And reap the comfort of so doing, in the <hi>hour</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Iudgment.</hi>

            </p>

               </gap>, <hi>That I may be sav'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next the <hi>Means</hi> of its <hi>Attainment</hi> (which make the <hi>Object</hi> of his Inquiry) are here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to consist in <hi>Practice.</hi> For it is not thus ask't, what must I outwardly <hi>Profess?</hi> or what must I inwardly <hi>believe?</hi> But <gap reason="foreign">

Yet <hi>not</hi> as <hi>Pris'ners,</hi> or <hi>Private men,</hi> but as attested by the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to be <hi>Embassadors from God.</hi> For as <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> had <hi>His</hi> mission from <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> so had <hi>They Theirs</hi> from <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Son. As my Father sent me, so send I you,</hi> was the saying of Christ to his Twelve Apostles. And <hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth me,</hi> As <hi>he that receiveth me, receiveth</hi> also <hi>him that sent me.</hi> They were not only The <hi>Nuntio's,</hi> but <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives</hi> of Christ. <hi>He alone</hi> was the <hi>Oracle,</hi> at which <hi>Salvation</hi> was to be <hi>ask't;</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were two of those sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Mystae,</hi> by whom the <hi>Responses</hi> were to be <hi>given.</hi> And so of <hi>Them</hi> in <hi>That Notion</hi> our <hi>Neophyte Iailour</hi> did fitly ask,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What must I do, that I may be saved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed is the <hi>Division,</hi> But it is not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106235:95"/>
               <hi>nice</hi> enough to be the measure of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the <hi>Tractation</hi> of the Text.

Nor so, in <hi>general,</hi> or at <hi>large,</hi> but as particularly relating unto the <hi>Terrors</hi> in the <hi>Context,</hi> whereby the <hi>Iailour</hi> of <hi>Philippi</hi> was happily <hi>frighted</hi> into Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It being chiefly my present Aim, (not to touch on those Notions which I have used on a Text of some Affinity with This in another Place, but) to fill up the Vacuities of my former Design, by <hi>supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> That <hi>Here,</hi> which was there <hi>omitted.</hi> For the accomplishing of which,</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Text <hi>abstractively</hi> consider'd, does afford at <hi>first</hi> view, but a <hi>single Act,</hi> and a <hi>single Object.</hi> Yet in <hi>relation</hi> to the <hi>Context, each</hi> of these is <hi>twofold; one</hi> whereof is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd,</hi> and the <hi>other imply'd.</hi>

            <p>First the <hi>Object</hi> here <hi>express'd</hi> is (<hi>in sensu com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posito</hi>) <hi>The Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And this is <hi>Objectum formale Quod.</hi> It is not <hi>Christ</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Iesus,</hi> nor is it <hi>Iesus</hi> without <hi>The Lord.</hi> For <hi>That</hi> were the gross and common Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, <hi>A benè conjunctis ad malè divisa,</hi> which yet <hi>the Flesh</hi> of <hi>most Professors</hi> is apt to <hi>impose</hi> upon their <hi>spirits.</hi> He is in <hi>all</hi> his <hi>Three Offices</hi> to be the <hi>Object</hi> of our <hi>Belief.</hi> And in his <hi>Three</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Next <hi>the Word of God preach'd</hi> is the <hi>object</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> which is here <hi>imply'd.</hi> And (as the men of the Schools do love to word it) This is <hi>Fidei objectum formale Quo.</hi> For as <hi>Faith</hi> cometh by <hi>Hearing,</hi> and <hi>Hearing by the</hi>

               <hi>Word of God,</hi> which Word cannot be <hi>heard</hi> without a <hi>Preacher;</hi> so no sooner was it said by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> that the Jailour must <hi>believe in the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> but in the next breath it follows, <hi>They spake unto him the WORD of God,</hi> (v. 32.) They had in vain told him he <hi>must,</hi> had they not taught him how he <hi>might.</hi> And therefore they did not only possess him with the <hi>necessity</hi> of his believing, But in tenderness to his Soul they straight afforded him the <hi>means</hi> too. They did not train up their Convert (like the <hi>Catechists</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>) only <hi>to believe as the Church believes,</hi> that is to say, by a <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>implicit</hi> Faith, making <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Credulity</hi> the only <hi>Parents</hi> of <hi>Devotion;</hi> But they <hi>built up</hi> his Faith on the <hi>Foundation</hi> of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106235:119"/>
the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> That by the <hi>knowledge</hi> of some Praemisses which he might easily <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,</hi> he might attain to a <hi>Belief</hi> of what was yet <hi>Incomprehensible.</hi> To beget in him a <hi>solid</hi> and a <hi>well-grounded</hi> Faith, such as whereof he might be able to give a <hi>rational Accompt,</hi> they both exhorted him to <hi>believe in,</hi> and <hi>also preached</hi> to him the <hi>WORD</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ; the <hi>object</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> which is here <hi>imply'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come we now, from <hi>the double Object,</hi> to observe in the Text <hi>a double Act</hi> too. Whereof the first is <hi>Internal,</hi> and that <hi>express'd;</hi> the second <hi>External,</hi> and that <hi>imply'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Act Internal,</hi> which is <hi>express'd,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>to believe.</hi> The <hi>Act External,</hi> which is <hi>imply'd,</hi> is <hi>to confess</hi> what is believ'd in spite of Temptations to <hi>conceal</hi> it. (And this did the <hi>Iailour</hi> of <hi>Philippi</hi> in the next Verses after my Text.) For as inwardly with the <hi>Heart</hi> a man <hi>believeth</hi> unto <hi>righteousness,</hi> so <hi>outwardly</hi> with the <hi>Mouth</hi>

               <hi>Confession</hi> is made unto <hi>Salvation.</hi> Indeed the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> were all for the <hi>Inward Act only,</hi> for the better avoiding of Persecution. But the <hi>Outward</hi> is by <hi>God</hi> as indispensably <hi>requir'd;</hi> And the

               <hi>Inward</hi> Act <hi>without</hi> it is not <hi>sincere.</hi> Thence it is that they are <hi>coupl'd</hi> as the <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> Rom. 10. 9. <hi>If thou shalt confess with thy Mouth the Lord Iesus, and believe in thine Heart that God hath raised him from the Dead, thou shalt be sav'd. Believing</hi> and <hi>speaking</hi> are from <hi>the same spirit of Faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 13. <hi>It is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken. We also believe, and therefore speak.</hi> A <hi>double Act</hi> then there <hi>must be, if the end be to be sav'd.</hi> A True <hi>Believer</hi> must be a <hi>Confessor</hi> in time of <hi>Trial,</hi> And when duly call'd to it, a <hi>Martyr</hi> too.</p>
            <p>Again, As the <hi>Object,</hi> and the <hi>Act,</hi> so too the <hi>Subject</hi> of it is <hi>double.</hi> For though <hi>begun</hi> in the <hi>Intellect,</hi> yet 'tis <hi>consummated</hi> in the <hi>Will,</hi> (as <note n="*" place="margin">Aq. 22<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Practical habit.</hi> And truly such is <hi>That Faith</hi> which is required in the Text, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Products</hi> of it in the Context.

               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19.</note> 
               <hi>reconciling the World unto himself.</hi> And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever cometh to Christ, must <hi>believe,</hi> as that he <hi>is,</hi> so withal that he is a <hi>Rewarder</hi> too.

            <p>Pass we on from the <hi>Nature</hi> to the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> of Believing. Which here is visibly imply'd by the <hi>Retrospect</hi> of the Text, as 'tis an <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Question,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, what <hi>must</hi> I do that I may <hi>be sav'd?</hi>] for sure the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Answer,</hi> if it be <hi>adaequate</hi> to the <hi>Question,</hi> must needs be This, Thou <hi>must</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Lord Jesus Christ.

               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:106235:121"/>
               <hi>Necessity,</hi> and <hi>indispensably requir'd.</hi> For, as without our <hi>pleasing God,</hi> it is impossible to be <hi>sav'd,</hi> so (we know) <hi>without Faith, it is impossible to please him,</hi> Heb. 11. 6.</p>
            <p>Last of all we have here the <hi>Issue,</hi> or the <hi>Conclusion</hi> of the whole Matter, at once <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed</hi> in the <hi>Reflexion</hi> of the <hi>Answer</hi> upon the <hi>Question,</hi> and <hi>expressed</hi> in the <hi>words</hi> of the Answer too. <hi>Salvation</hi> is not the <hi>Effect,</hi> but yet the necessary <hi>event</hi> of our Faith in Christ. Nor is it properly the <hi>wages,</hi> but most certainly the <hi>Reward</hi> of a true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. It comes to pass as unavoidably upon the Praemisses suppos'd, as an <hi>Effect</hi> on a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of all things <hi>requisite</hi> to its Production. For the Question having been This, [<hi>What must I do that I may be sav'd,</hi>] to which the Answer is, <hi>Believe, and thou shalt be sav'd,</hi> (An Answer given by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> who spake <hi>as the Spirit gave them utterance,</hi>) here does arise a <hi>mutual Inference,</hi> as of the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> and the <hi>Promise,</hi> so of the <hi>Duty</hi> and the <hi>Reward.</hi> Here is a necessary <hi>Tendency</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> towards the <hi>second,</hi> and a necessary <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence</hi> of the <hi>second</hi> upon the <hi>first.</hi> For as <hi>Salvation</hi> cannot be had (by such as live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:106235:122"/>
the Gospel, without a praevious <hi>Belief in the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> so wheresoever such <hi>Believing</hi> does go <hi>before,</hi> 'tis very plain that <hi>Salvation</hi> must follow <hi>after.</hi> Both af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us matter of <hi>Caution,</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> too.

            </p>
            <p>Thus have I done with the <hi>Division,</hi> and (in the ordering of <hi>That</hi>) with the <hi>Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Text.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:106235:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
does arise from an <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>saving Faith.</hi> For as every one that <hi>paints</hi> is <hi>not</hi> presently <hi>a Painter,</hi> nor every <hi>Painter</hi> an <hi>Apelles;</hi> so 'tis not every <hi>Belief</hi> which can denominate <hi>a Believer,</hi> nor is it every <hi>Believer</hi> who can be <hi>sav'd.</hi> It will not therefore be sufficient to preach up the <hi>Faith of Christ in general,</hi> (which yet too many are wont to do, because 'tis easiest to be done,) nor to depredicate in particular the several rare <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of Faith, without distinguishing all along betwixt the <hi>Roots</hi> and the <hi>Causes</hi> from whence they <hi>grow;</hi> But we must first have the <hi>Patience</hi> to learn <hi>our selves,</hi> and then the <hi>Care</hi> as well as <hi>Skill</hi> to make it <hi>visible</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>others,</hi> how much <hi>The Habit</hi> of <hi>salvifick</hi> or <hi>saving Faith</hi> is meant to <hi>grasp</hi> and <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend</hi> in its <hi>whole Importance;</hi> and so (by a consequence unavoidable) how much <hi>short</hi> of Salvation, <hi>every</hi> Faith, <hi>without This,</hi> will be sure to land us.</p>

            <p>First 'tis clear that the word <hi>Faith</hi> does<note place="margin">Eight Accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Faith, whereof the Last only is <hi>Saving.</hi>

               <hi>let God be true, and every man a lyar.</hi> Next it signify's The <hi>Promise,</hi> which is in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness<note place="margin">(2)</note> and Truth to be <hi>performed.</hi> And of this we have an instance 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 12. where the wanton young Widows are said to be lyable to Damnation, <hi>because they have cast off their first Faith.</hi> That is, their <hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>constant widowhood</hi> which they had made unto the <hi>Church,</hi> whose single <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> they had thereby <hi>wedded</hi> and <hi>espous'd.</hi> Thence it<note place="margin">(3)</note> signify's a <hi>Confidence,</hi> as <hi>that</hi> is opposed to <hi>Distrust;</hi> A full <hi>Dependance</hi> on the <hi>Power,</hi> and a <hi>firm adhaerence</hi> unto the <hi>Promises</hi> of our Lord.

            <p>§ 8. No, the <hi>saving Faith</hi> is That, which comprehends <hi>Both</hi> the <hi>former,</hi> and <hi>more</hi> than Both.

For when our Saviour gave Commission for the <hi>preaching of the Gospel to every Creature,</hi> he did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, <hi>He that believeth shall be sav'd;</hi> But <hi>he that believeth and is Baptèzed, He's</hi> the man that shall be sav'd, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16.

               <hi>Christian Duties,</hi> which are all shut up in <hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>Homer's Iliads</hi> in a <hi>Nutshell,</hi>) Then indeed they might have made him a <hi>Solifidian,</hi> or a <hi>Fiduciary,</hi> which had not been the way to his being <hi>sav'd.</hi> But se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly I answer, That the objection is made of a <hi>false Hypothesis;</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> dealt <hi>honestly</hi> and <hi>discreetly</hi> with the Jailour; when having told him <hi>he must believe in the Lord Iesus Christ</hi> for his being <hi>sav'd,</hi> (it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently follows after the Text,) <hi>they spake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the Word of God;</hi> that is, they <hi>expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to him.

That this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the Importance, may appear by the words of our blessed Saviour; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been asked by a <hi>Iew,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> by a <hi>Gentile,</hi> [what Course was to be taken whereby to inherit Eternal Life,] gave him an Answer which some may <hi>censure,</hi> as too much savouring of the <hi>Law,</hi> but yet it

seems not unsuitable to the <hi>oeconomy</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> [<hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments.</hi>] Now in as much as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did not teach <hi>another Doctrin,</hi> but the <hi>same</hi> in <hi>other words</hi> with their <hi>Master Christ,</hi> they must needs be understood to have given This Answer, That if the Jailour should <hi>so believe</hi> in the Lord Jesus Christ, as to <hi>imitate</hi> his <hi>Example,</hi> and yield <hi>obedience</hi> to his <hi>Commands,</hi> and continue so to do <hi>all the days of his life,</hi> he should <hi>not fail</hi> (in that Case) of his being <hi>sav'd.</hi> And though the <hi>Rule</hi> is very <hi>true,</hi> That <hi>nothing is wanting in</hi>

            <p>But this is not all. For I observe the <hi>Compellation</hi> hath a <hi>twofold Aspect</hi> upon the <hi>Question;</hi> and seems to give us a <hi>pregnant Reason</hi> at once for the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:106235:144"/>First here is something to be <hi>done</hi> by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Follower</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that because He is a <hi>Master.</hi> It is not, Master, <hi>what shall I say,</hi> or Master, <hi>what shall I believe,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; Master, what shall I <hi>Do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is Secondly observable in this Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate of Heaven, a <hi>meek Resignedness</hi> of <hi>mind</hi> to <hi>any</hi> Command of Christ imaginable, and that because he is a <hi>Good,</hi> or a <hi>Gracious Master.</hi> The <hi>Servant</hi> presumes not to <hi>choose</hi> his work, He does not <hi>bargain</hi> for Life Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal at such a Rate as he thinks fit, with a [Master, I <hi>will</hi> do <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi>] but <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely</hi> asks (with an humble kind of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; <hi>what</hi> shall I do?</p>
            <p>These are Particulars more than enough, not only to <hi>exercise</hi> and <hi>entertain</hi> our Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but (perhaps) to <hi>distract</hi> them too. And therefore it cannot be taken ill, if I shall gather their whole <hi>Result</hi> into <hi>Four Doctrinal Propositions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First that the <hi>Son</hi> of God <hi>Incarnate,</hi> who at present is our <hi>Advocate,</hi> and will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be our <hi>Iudge,</hi> and who purposely came to <hi>save</hi> us from the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of our <hi>Sins,</hi> is not only A <hi>Saviour,</hi> to propose <hi>Promises</hi> to our
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:106235:145"/>
               <hi>Faith;</hi> But also A <hi>Master,</hi> to challenge <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to his <hi>Commands.</hi> We must not only <hi>believe</hi> him, which is but to have him in our <hi>Brains;</hi> nor must we only <hi>confess</hi> him, which is but to have him in our <hi>Mouths;</hi> no nor must we only <hi>love</hi> him, though That is to have him in our <hi>Hearts;</hi> but farther yet we must <hi>obey</hi> him, and do him <hi>Service,</hi> which is to have him in our <hi>Hands</hi> and our <hi>Actions</hi> too. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>Master,</hi> what shall I <hi>do?</hi> And yet</p>
            <p>Secondly; Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is not any way a <hi>Severe</hi> or <hi>Aegyptian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> Master, who looks to reap where he never sow'd, and exacts store of work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allowing any Materials; but a Master full of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Lovingkindness.</hi> And this he is in <hi>two respects.</hi> To wit of the <hi>work</hi> which he <hi>requires,</hi> which is not <hi>foesible</hi> only, but <hi>pleasant;</hi> and of the <hi>wages</hi> which he <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth, Aeternal Life.</hi> For each of these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which do arise out of the Text, he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>A good Master.</hi> And therefore</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We must in <hi>gratitude</hi> unto so <hi>Good</hi> a <hi>Master</hi> as <hi>This,</hi> behold our selves as
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:106235:145"/>
obliged to <hi>two Returns;</hi> to wit a <hi>Readiness</hi> of <hi>Obedience,</hi> and a <hi>Resignedness</hi> of <hi>Wills.</hi> First a <hi>Readiness</hi> of <hi>obedience,</hi> even because he is our <hi>Master;</hi> next a <hi>Resignedness</hi> of <hi>wills,</hi> because he is our <hi>Good</hi> Master. Our Christian Tribute to <hi>both together,</hi> [to wit his <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and his <hi>Goodness,</hi>] must not only be <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,</hi> but <hi>Unconstrain'd.</hi>

               </gap>; <hi>what</hi> shall I do? that is to say, <hi>I will do any thing.</hi> I am <hi>ready</hi> to perform <hi>whatever</hi> Service thou shalt <hi>appoint,</hi> be it never so <hi>harsh,</hi> or be it never so <hi>difficult.</hi> Eternal Life is such a <hi>Prize,</hi> as for which I can never do <hi>enough.</hi> I say not therefore what I <hi>will</hi> do, but humbly <hi>ask</hi> what I <hi>shall.</hi> Yet</p>

               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:106235:146"/>I now have done with the <hi>Introduction,</hi> wherein is included the <hi>Explication</hi> and <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of the Text.

And this the rather, because</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before</hi> I find Access to the four <hi>Doctrinal Propositions,</hi> I must direct to several <hi>Lessons</hi> from Those three <hi>Preliminary Subjects</hi> the <hi>Text</hi> affords us. To wit the Quality of the <hi>Person</hi> who here inquires, The excellent <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of his Inquiry, and The <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Oracle</hi> inquired of.</p>
            <p>First the <hi>Person</hi> here <hi>inquiring</hi> had three remarkable <hi>Qualifications; Youth, Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi> And yet for all that, he did not ask as a <hi>young</hi> man, <hi>How shall I purchase the sweetest Pleasures?</hi> nor yet as a <hi>Rich</hi> man, <hi>How shall I compass the greatest wealth?</hi> no
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:106235:146"/>
nor yet as a <hi>Ruler, How shall I climb to the highest Pinacle of Preferment:</hi> But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his three <hi>Impediments</hi> pulling him <hi>down</hi> towards the <hi>Earth,</hi> he seemed wholly to be solicitous, <hi>How he might come by a place in Heaven.</hi> And therefore hence we are to take out a <hi>threefold Lesson;</hi> one for <hi>Young</hi> men, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>Rich</hi> men, a third for <hi>Rulers.</hi> (And I suppose of <hi>these three,</hi> this particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation does now consist).</p>
            <p>First our <hi>Young</hi> men must learn, from the <hi>example</hi> of this <hi>Inquirer,</hi> to <hi>remember their Creator in the days of their youth, whilst the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil days come not, nor the years draw nigh when they shall say, We have no pleasure in them,</hi> (Prov. 12. 1.) And that especially for these <hi>three Reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First the <hi>younger</hi> any one is, he came the <hi>more lately</hi> out of the <hi>Hands</hi> of his <hi>Creator;</hi> and has had the <hi>less time,</hi> to grow <hi>forgetful of the Rock out of which he was hewn.</hi> It is with mens <hi>Souls</hi> as with their <hi>Bodies,</hi> and with their <hi>Bodies</hi> as with their <hi>Cloaths;</hi> The <hi>newer,</hi> commonly the <hi>better;</hi> and the <hi>older,</hi> so much the <hi>worse.</hi> A <hi>little</hi> evil Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is enough to <hi>ferment</hi> the <hi>greatest Mass</hi>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:106235:147"/>
of good manners. And if the <hi>whole World does lye in wickedness,</hi> (as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> affirms it does,) how can we look to be the <hi>purer,</hi> by growing <hi>old</hi> and <hi>decrepit</hi> in so much <hi>Dirt?</hi> no, the longer we converse with <hi>Pitch</hi> or <hi>Birdlime,</hi> (to which the <hi>wickedness</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> may very happily be compar'd) It is by so much the <hi>harder</hi> to make us <hi>clean.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, we ought to <hi>run</hi> after Christ, (like this <hi>Inquirer</hi> in the Text,) not go to him like a <hi>Torpedo,</hi> as if we did not <hi>affect,</hi> but <hi>fear</hi> him; or <hi>tanquam Bos ad Cer<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But now the <hi>younger</hi> any man is, he can <hi>run</hi> so much the <hi>faster;</hi> whereas grown <hi>old</hi> he will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>go.</hi> It was therefore the <hi>Blessing</hi> of God to <hi>Enoch,</hi> that <hi>he took him away speedily,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>hasten'd</hi> to cut him off, to the end <hi>that wickedness might not alter his Understanding, nor deceipt beguile his Soul,</hi> (Wisd. 4. 11, 14.) This was That that gave <hi>occasion</hi> to the <hi>young</hi> mans <hi>Inquiry</hi> which lyes before us. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard our Saviour say, <hi>Suffer little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to come unto me, for of such is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> (v. 14.) And that <hi>no man shall enter into the Kingdom of God, unless he receive</hi>

            <p>This is the <hi>use</hi> we are to make of the first Qualification of our Inquirer, and These are the <hi>Reasons</hi> on which it stands.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Lastly our <hi>Great men</hi> must learn, from the <hi>Example</hi> of This Inquirer, to lay their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at <hi>Christ's</hi> Feet, and to tread it under their <hi>own.</hi> Or (to express it in the words of <hi>the Son of Sirach</hi>) <hi>the greater he is, to humble himself so much the more,</hi> Ecclus. 3. 18.

of an <hi>impious Act;</hi> or indeed afraid of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> unless of <hi>not fearing God.</hi> The <hi>vitious</hi> Warrier or Dueller, who seems to breath nothing but Courage, (such Courage as is common to the stout <hi>Horsman</hi> with his <hi>Horse,</hi> when carrying <hi>Thunder in his Throat,</hi> he madly <hi>rusheth into the Battel,</hi>) I say a man of such an <hi>Animal,</hi> or Brutal Courage, who will rather be <hi>Damn'd</hi> than be <hi>thought</hi> a <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> is yet, for all his brave Pretences, most <hi>cowardly afraid</hi> of Reproach, and Obloquie, and of Twenty other objects of <hi>carnal Fear.</hi> Whereas a man that fears <hi>God,</hi> fears <hi>nothing else: fears not what man can do unto him,</hi> (Psal. 56. 11.) And He who does not fear God, is not a <hi>Valiant,</hi> but <hi>stupid</hi> Sinner. To meet with Nobleness indeed, we must not consult the <hi>Herald's</hi> Book, unless we take along with it the Book of <hi>The Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> (Chap. 17. vers. 11.) where the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Beroea</hi> are said to be <hi>Nobler</hi> than those of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> Not because they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from greater Parents, nor because they were advanced to greater Places, But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause with greater <hi>readiness</hi> they <hi>heard the Word of God preach't;</hi> that is, because they were <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:106235:153"/>
and of more <hi>Teachable Dispositions.</hi> That alone is <hi>true Nobleness,</hi> which is sometimes The <hi>Daughter,</hi> and still the <hi>Mother</hi> of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. That 'tis sometimes the <hi>Daughter,</hi> is very evident: for 'Twas the <hi>Lowliness of Mary</hi> which made her the <hi>Mother of our Lord.</hi> And so when <hi>Abigail</hi> made <hi>David</hi> That win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Complement from the heart, of her being The humble <hi>Handmaid to wash the feet of the Servants of her Lord,</hi> Her <hi>Humility</hi> did so <hi>advance</hi> her in <hi>David</hi>'s Mind, that he made her his <hi>Queen,</hi> if not his <hi>Mistress.</hi> The King was so <hi>captivated</hi> and <hi>charm'd</hi> by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Magick</hi> of so much <hi>meekness,</hi> as he could not have been more by any <hi>Philtrum</hi> to be imagin'd.

            </p>
            <p>Nor is True Nobleness more the <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> than 'tis the <hi>Mother</hi> of Humility. For as the <hi>Lowliness of Mary</hi> made her the <hi>Mother of our Lord,</hi> so she was much the <hi>more lowly</hi> for That <hi>Advancement.</hi> And so <hi>The Ruler</hi> in the Gospel, (who is ennobl'd by <hi>Three</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists,

            <p>But now, besides the single Reason which has been given by <hi>Siracides;</hi> There are other Reasons assignable, why <hi>the greater any man is, he is to humble himself the more.</hi> He must be <hi>humbler,</hi> being a <hi>Master,</hi> than whilst he was yet but his Master's <hi>Man.</hi> Still the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

for being High. And because to some Persons This may seem an <hi>harsh Paradox,</hi> or at least <hi>an hard Saying;</hi> I shall attempt to make it <hi>easy</hi> by Three Degrees.</p>
            <p>First 'tis observable in Historians and Moral Writers, that such as are rais'd out of the Dust are apt to prove the most ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and cruel Tyrants. They commonly <hi>take down</hi> the stairs by which Themselves were <hi>taken up;</hi> and, like a man <hi>climbing</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Ladder,</hi> love to be <hi>treading</hi> under their <hi>feet</hi> the chiefest means of their Advancement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Asperius nihil est humili cum surgit ad altum.</hi> The <hi>Fire</hi> out of the <hi>Bramble</hi> affects to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the lofty <hi>Cedar.</hi> Thence it was that <hi>Pausanias</hi> murder'd King <hi>Philip,</hi> to be <hi>talk't</hi> of. And 'twas <hi>Phocas</hi> his <hi>Sensuality,</hi> of a pitiful <hi>common Souldier,</hi> to set his foot upon the Neck of the Great Emperour <hi>Mauritius.</hi> So <hi>Charles the First</hi> of These Realms (of whom the World was not worthy) was not only sent to Heaven by some of the vilest of all his Subjects, But particularly by some Himself had rais'd out of the <hi>Mire.</hi> And if these things are so, that They are aptest to be debauch't by their worldly Greatness,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:106235:154"/>
whose <hi>Greatness steams</hi> out of a <hi>Dunghill;</hi> (as every man's does if he be traced far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough back,) it follows then that they have need of the greater Care, and must be ply'd with the stricter Caveats, <hi>the Greater they are,</hi> to <hi>humble themselves so much the more,</hi> because they are Then in the greatest Danger. For the greater any one is, by so much the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> are his <hi>Temptations:</hi> and to be safe from That <hi>Artillery,</hi> he stands in need of being <hi>armed</hi> with greater <hi>Meekness.</hi> The more St. <hi>Paul</hi> was advanced by his <hi>Abundance of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> the more he was <hi>buffeted by Satan,</hi> and by <hi>Himself</hi> too. For he did Therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>beat his Body black and blue,</hi> (as the word imports,) that, by Those <hi>profitable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 27.</note> He might <hi>bring it into Subjection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the <hi>Greater</hi> any man is, the more Humility does <hi>become</hi> him. It sits upon him so much the better, with the more loveliness, and congruity. It is not only the more his <hi>Duty,</hi> but <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Ornament</hi> to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 'Tis a Vertue which should flow from a Man of <hi>Grandeur,</hi> with such a kind of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity,</hi> as <hi>Munificence</hi> ought to do from a man of <hi>Wealth.</hi> For He who is <hi>flat upon the</hi>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:106235:155"/>
               <hi>Ground</hi> can no more prove that he is <hi>humble,</hi> than He who <hi>lives upon Almes,</hi> that he is <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally-minded.</hi> We know the <hi>Taller</hi> any man is, by so much the <hi>lower</hi> he has to <hi>stoop:</hi> whereas the <hi>Lowliness</hi> of a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> is not his Vertue, but <hi>Stature</hi> only. We need not go far to find an Instance; for go we whither we will, it will find out <hi>us.</hi> How many are there who do not <hi>scorn</hi> to beg their Bread from door to door, not because they are <hi>humble,</hi> but <hi>shameless</hi> Creatures? who, were they honourable, and potent, would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew themselves <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>oppressive</hi> too. Vices made almost <hi>invisible</hi> in the <hi>necessitous</hi> sort of men, not for want of a <hi>Being,</hi> but of competent <hi>Materials,</hi> to set them forth. The weaponless Serpent <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> though much more <hi>harmless,</hi> may yet be as <hi>maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> as any <hi>other;</hi> nor is't a <hi>commendable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,</hi> which only proceeds from <hi>a want</hi> of <hi>Teeth.</hi> How many are there within our knowledge whose <hi>Backs</hi> are cloath'd in course <hi>Russet,</hi> whilst yet their <hi>Bloody-minded Insides</hi> are lin'd with <hi>Scarlet?</hi> And when a person of such a Frame shall be reduced by some Extremity, to beg an Halfpenny

               </gap>, his <hi>lowness</hi> of <hi>Fortune,</hi> not his <hi>lowliness</hi> of <hi>Mind.</hi> It's true indeed, an <hi>humiliation</hi> may help <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> him for an <hi>Humility,</hi> (just as any Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <hi>Attrition</hi> may lead the way to <hi>Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>) but sure I am that the <hi>Gymnosophists,</hi> who were tormented by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> were no whit the <hi>meeker</hi> for being <hi>humbled.</hi> They who think themselves <hi>humble,</hi> because they see themselves <hi>low,</hi> (and not for any other more solid reason,) do not know their <hi>own Hearts;</hi> which are commonly so <hi>hidden</hi> from <hi>human Eyes,</hi> as hardly ever to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, till they are placed upon a <hi>Mountain:</hi> Let that Mountain be what it will, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Riches, or Renown, or of worldly Greatness. Almost <hi>all</hi> that were <hi>sick</hi> came to Christ for a <hi>Cure;</hi> And (as <hi>They</hi> at least thought) with good <hi>devotion.</hi> But in that they did not all return to <hi>thank</hi> him, they shew'd the <hi>Principle</hi> of their coming to have been nothing but their <hi>Convenience.</hi> Had the Votary in my Text been very <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>contemptible,</hi> had he been every body's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:106235:156"/>
by being in every body's Debt, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably <hi>haunted</hi> with some <hi>Disease,</hi> he had not done a strange Thing in <hi>seeking Christ</hi> upon his <hi>Knees;</hi> But that being extremely <hi>Rich,</hi> and a <hi>Ruler</hi> too, and in the Bravery of his Youth, he should consider Christ so <hi>much,</hi> and himself so <hi>little,</hi> This was an evidence of his <hi>generous</hi> and <hi>noble Meekness.</hi> And Therefore <hi>the greater thou art, my son, lessen thy self so much the more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And do it for a Third Reason, which ought at least to be as prevalent as Both the former. For the Greater any man is, the greater Accompt he is to give to his one Great Master which is in Heaven; that is, to a Master, with whom there is <hi>not Respect of Persons.</hi> In <hi>the Day when God shall judge the Secrets of men by Iesus Christ,</hi> He who now sits in State and Jurisdiction upon the Bench, shall stand at God's just and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Bar. He shall be called to a Reck'ning, a dreadful Reck'ning, how his Talent of Authority has been employ'd, and what Good he has done with his Jurisdiction. What poor Orphans he has righted; what Widows Causes he has pleaded; what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:106235:156"/>
               <hi>Innocence</hi> he has protected; what Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Persons he has incouraged with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; what vile Offenders he has discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced and punish't; what Great mens oppressions he has resisted; what Rising Mutinies and Rebellions He has indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to repress. For a man's Honour, and Authority, his Power, and Greatness, as well as Wealth, are things of which he must give <hi>Accompt.</hi> Thô for a <hi>King</hi> to be <hi>accomptable</hi> to any Tribunal upon Earth, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies indeed a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> yet <hi>Kings Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> do stand <hi>accomptable</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> even for their high Privilege of <hi>unaccomptable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to Men.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Greater</hi> any man is, he is to <hi>humble</hi> himself <hi>the more,</hi> and then (as it follows in the Text) <hi>he will find favour of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>use</hi> we are to make of the <hi>Third</hi> Qualification of our Inquirer; and These especially are the <hi>Reasons</hi> inducing to it.</p>
            <p>But now the Case in my Text is one of the strangest we ever heard of. For would we not think it exceeding strange, if the chief Magistrate of a City (forgetting the <hi>Mace</hi>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:106235:157"/>
that is born before him) should run to meet the poorest Cottager, and throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self down upon his <hi>Knees</hi> too, and lifting up his <hi>trembling Hands,</hi> should intreat him so <hi>humbly</hi> as to call him <hi>Master,</hi> and so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly intreat him as to call him <hi>Good Master?</hi> 'Tis true that <hi>Christ</hi> was no Cottager, because according to his <hi>Manhood</hi> He was very much <hi>poorer,</hi> as <hi>having not where to lay his Head.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 8. 20.</note> Yet the Man in my Text who had <hi>Great Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions,</hi> and was <hi>a Ruler,</hi> in the pride and glory of his <hi>Youth</hi> too, did thus come <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> after <hi>Christ;</hi> and <hi>kneeled down</hi> to him, thô in the <hi>Form of a Servant;</hi> and call'd him <hi>Master,</hi> thô born of <hi>Mary,</hi> Spouse to <hi>Ioseph the Carpenter.</hi> As if through That <hi>Veil</hi> of the <hi>Carpenter's Son,</hi> he had had an <hi>Eye</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> to see <hi>The Wisdom of the Father,</hi> The Son of That <hi>Almighty Architect,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was The <hi>Builder</hi> of <hi>All</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> Heb. 11. 10.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:106235:157"/>
than positive sense of that word. For That which He sought <hi>directly,</hi> was a Deliverance out of his Dangers; Not an <hi>Inheritance of Aeternity,</hi> but only <hi>an Escape from the Wrath to come.</hi> So that the Quaerist we are upon, is more Didactical than the former; as afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us many <hi>more,</hi> and more <hi>Noble</hi> Lessons. Three whereof we have had already. And Three, if well minded, are enough for One Lecture; as, if slighted, they are too many.

Thirdly if we are <hi>foul,</hi> He alone has <hi>that Blood</hi> by which we may be <hi>cleansed from all our Sins,</hi> (1 John 1. 7.)

It is the <hi>Top</hi> of that <hi>Wisdom</hi> which we are capable of on <hi>Earth, to sit with</hi> Mary <hi>at his Feet,</hi> and to <hi>hear his Word,</hi> (Luke 10. 39, 42.) Fifthly if we inquire for the only <hi>true way,</hi> which leadeth unto <hi>life,</hi> and to <hi>life Eternal,</hi> He alone is <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> (John 14. 6.) Are we affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the <hi>Law?</hi> He alone hath <hi>redeemed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us,</hi> (Gal. 3. 13.) In a word: He is the <hi>true Noah's Ark,</hi> whereby to <hi>escape</hi> the <hi>Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> of <hi>Sin and Hell.</hi> He hath broken the Ice, and <hi>made way for us, that we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Gate,</hi> (Micah 2. 13.)

            <p>All which being consider'd, we thus may Argue within our selves. If the great <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Shebah</hi> did choose to take so <hi>long</hi> a <hi>Iourney</hi> as from <hi>Shebah</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and all to hear a <hi>wise man speak,</hi> (Matth. 12. 42.)

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:106235:176"/>
through several <hi>Countries,</hi> and put himself to learn of every great <hi>Master</hi> that he could <hi>hear</hi> of; with how much a <hi>greater</hi> force of reason should <hi>we</hi> travel far and near to find out the <hi>Wisdom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> to learn of that <hi>Good,</hi> as well as <hi>Great Master,</hi> who alone hath <hi>the words of Eternal Life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But some perhaps may here object, That the Man in the Text met with <hi>Christ in the way,</hi> whilst here on <hi>Earth.</hi> How shall <hi>we</hi> find him out since his <hi>Ascension</hi> into <hi>Heaven?</hi> The <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us He is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and in <hi>Hell</hi> too. <hi>If we go up into Heaven, he is there; And if we go down into Hell, he is there also.</hi> But to <hi>Heaven</hi> we <hi>cannot,</hi> and to <hi>Hell</hi> we <hi>dare</hi> not go.</p>
            <p>To which the Answer is very obvious. That if Christ is in <hi>Hell,</hi> because he is <hi>every where,</hi> by the necessity of his <hi>Godhead;</hi> he is by consequence here on <hi>Earth</hi> too, for the very <hi>same reason.</hi> And that we may not say with <hi>Seneca,</hi> [<hi>Qui ubique, nusquam,</hi>] that he who is <hi>every where</hi> is <hi>no where,</hi> for that he is every where <hi>invisible,</hi> and so as difficultly <hi>found</hi> as if he <hi>were not; The Righteousness</hi>

            </p>
            <q>That the Son of God Incarnate, who at present is our <hi>Advocate,</hi> and will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be our <hi>Iudge,</hi> and who purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came to <hi>save</hi> us from the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of our <hi>Sins,</hi> is not only a <hi>Saviour</hi> to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Promises</hi> to our <hi>Faith,</hi> but also a <hi>Master</hi> to exact <hi>Obedience</hi> to his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi> We must not only <hi>believe</hi> him, which is but to have him in our <hi>Brains;</hi> nor must we only <hi>confess</hi> him, which is but to have him in our <hi>Mouths;</hi> no nor must we <hi>only love</hi> him, which (were it possible to be done) were <hi>only</hi> to have him in our <hi>hearts;</hi> But farther yet we must <hi>Obey</hi> him and <hi>do</hi> him <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> which is to have him in our <hi>Hands</hi> and our <hi>Actions</hi> too. <gap reason="foreign">

            </q>
            <p>§ 3. A Proposition of such Importance to all that are <hi>Candidates</hi> for <hi>Heaven,</hi> and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous for the <hi>way</hi> which will lead us <hi>thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> that truly a <hi>Sermon</hi> on <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Subject</hi>

should be as <hi>long</hi> as a man's <hi>life.</hi> We cannot <hi>touch</hi> on that <hi>string</hi> either too <hi>often,</hi> or too <hi>much,</hi> by which we are taught to <hi>bear a part</hi> in the <hi>Quire</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> And therefore if at present I only <hi>touch</hi> upon it in <hi>short,</hi> I would be known so to do for these two Reasons. First because I must consider it in the <hi>second</hi> Doctrinal Proposition, (it being <hi>impossible</hi> to consider that Christ is <hi>a Good</hi> Master, and not to consider at the same time that he is <hi>a Master;</hi>) Next because I shall resume it upon a <hi>sitter</hi> passage of Scripture, which I shall handle either in <hi>this,</hi> or in a <hi>Neighbouring</hi> Congregation.</p>
            <p>§ 4.

indeed <hi>the Law of Christ,</hi> and the Law to be <hi>fulfill'd,</hi> is very evident from the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians, Bear ye one anothers Burdens, and so fulfil the Law of Christ,</hi> (Gal. 6. 2.)</p>

            <p>That when all is done that can be, <hi>we are unprofitable Servants;</hi> Our <hi>Obedience</hi> is not<note place="margin">Luke 17. 10.</note> the <hi>Cause,</hi> but the meer <hi>Condition</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

            <p>As <hi>Christianity,</hi> like <hi>Manhood,</hi> hath its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>steps</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>growth;</hi> so the <hi>Soul,</hi> as well as the <hi>Body,</hi> doth stand in need of <hi>Food,</hi> and <hi>Raiment.</hi> And agreable to the <hi>Complexion</hi> of <hi>immaterial Beings,</hi> she is not only <hi>bedeck't,</hi> but <hi>sustain'd</hi> with Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:106235:217"/>
that some have thought there is <hi>none at all.</hi> For if God will come speedily to the <hi>Aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Elect,</hi> (as our Saviour saith he will, in the two next Verses before my Text,) who were <hi>not Elected</hi> without a <hi>Praescience,</hi> as well of their <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> as of their <hi>Faith;</hi> How can it be that <hi>when He comes, He shall not find Faith upon the Earth?</hi> But if we atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively consider the Text before us, as it stands in relation to <hi>all</hi> the Verses going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and more especially to the <hi>first,</hi> This Objection will quickly vanish, and we shall find a good Connexion, between the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and praesent words. For our Lord having exhorted The Neophyte-Disciples to whom he spake, <hi>Not to faint in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> but <hi>to pray-on with Perseverance,</hi> (v. 1.) excites them to it with an Assurance, that their Prayers shall not be fruitless. And that their Prayers shall not be fruitless, He convinceth them by an Argument <hi>à minori ad majus.</hi> This appears by his whole Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble touching the <hi>Widows Importunity,</hi> praevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Heart of an <hi>hardned Iudge.</hi> From whence the Argument is as natural, as it is logical, and convincing.

               <hi>Prayer</hi> of the distressed and importunate <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi> returned at last into her Bosom with good Success, thô from a <hi>most corrupt Iudge,</hi> who had <hi>no fear of God, nor regard of Man,</hi> (v. 2.) <gap reason="foreign">

To which He adds by way of <hi>complaint,</hi> and by a Compassionate <hi>Erotésis,</hi> or <hi>Expostulation, (cohaering</hi> with what he said before, by a <hi>Conjunction Adversative,</hi>) that when He shall come in the later Days to be an <hi>Avenger of his Elect,</hi> The Apostasie will be so general, He will find <hi>but Few</hi> of them.

He will find but Few <hi>Faithful;</hi> and with very much <hi>Profession,</hi> very <hi>little True Faith;</hi> They alone being <hi>Elect,</hi> who <hi>persevere</hi> unto the <hi>End</hi> in The Faith of Christ; and whose Faith is <hi>efficacious,</hi> as well as <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> to make them Faithful.</p>
            <p>§ 2. We see The <hi>Cohaerence</hi> of the Text, which will help us not to err in the <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of it. For in that our Lord asks, <hi>When the Son of Man cometh, shall He find Faith upon the Earth?</hi> It is as if he should have said in plain and peremptory Terms, That at his second Coming from Heaven to judge the Inhabitants of the Earth, He shall not find <hi>Many</hi> Christians, who will pray with <hi>that</hi> Faith, which alone can inable them to <hi>pray without ceasing, and not to faint.</hi> When He shall come to save <hi>Believers,</hi> He will find <hi>but few</hi> such in the <hi>Gospel-sense.</hi> Not <hi>none simpliciter,</hi> but <hi>none secundum quid.

<pb n="421" facs="tcp:106235:218"/>
through a miserable defect of Christian <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> The great <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which God in Christ (the only true <hi>Shechinah</hi>) was pleas'd to make with the <hi>Sons of Men.</hi> Historical Faith there is in <hi>many,</hi> such as is common to men with <hi>Devils,</hi> who are said by St. <hi>Iames,</hi> to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and tremble.</hi> A sturdy <hi>Praesumption</hi> there is in <hi>Many,</hi> which they mistake for the <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> of Faith. A <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Security</hi> is in <hi>Many,</hi> which they take to be the <hi>Product</hi> and <hi>Fruit</hi> of Faith. There is in many such a <hi>Carnal and Human Faith,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Being of Heaven and Hell, a Life after Death, and a Day of Judgment, as that there is such a Place as <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or <hi>Eutopia;</hi> whereof thô <hi>This</hi> is as <hi>fictitious,</hi> as <hi>That</hi> is <hi>real,</hi> yet by Ignaroes in Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy they are <hi>believed Both alike.</hi> Thus in one sense or other, <hi>Faith</hi> is as common as <hi>Infidelity:</hi> a Weed which grows in <hi>most</hi> mens Gardens. But very <hi>few</hi> have <hi>That</hi> Faith, of which our Lord does here speak; to wit a Faith which is attended with <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> a Faith coupl'd with <hi>Fear</hi> to offend our <hi>Maker;</hi> a Faith productive of <hi>obedience</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

most in fashion, the easiest, and cheapest, most for their Secular Ends and Interests, and where their wickednesses may pass with the greatest freedom. But our Saviour in the Text which is now before us, did only speak of a <hi>Divine,</hi> and a <hi>Saving</hi> Faith, which is peculiar to <hi>unfeigned</hi> and <hi>real</hi> Christians; not at all of That <hi>Human</hi> or <hi>Historical</hi> Faith, which is common to every <hi>titular</hi> or <hi>nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Christian, or hypocritical <hi>Professor</hi> of Christ's Religion. So that the meaning of the Text does seem to be evidently This: [When the Son of Man cometh to be The Judge of the Quick and Dead, <hi>shall He find Faith, shall He find Charity, shall He find Iustice upon the Earth?</hi>] For Saving Faith <hi>infers</hi> Charity, and Charity Justice. Where Justice is wanting, there can be no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Charity; and where there is not such Charity, there can be no Christian Faith.

wants of Faith in the <hi>second</hi> Notion of the word can prove 'tis wanted in the <hi>first.</hi> For let the <hi>Practice</hi> of men amongst us be what it will, yet their <hi>Principles</hi> (they will say) may be as Orthodox as their <hi>Professions;</hi> and they have still a <hi>firm Assent unto the Truth of Christ's Gospel in All its Doctrines.</hi> But to This Objection it may as easily be Answer'd, that as a Practical Infidel or Atheist is a worse Monster than a Speculative, so there is no better way to prove the first, than by the second. Men may <hi>believe the Word of God</hi> with an <hi>Human</hi> Faith, when yet 'tis easy to demonstrate, They do not believe it with a <hi>Divine</hi> one. Nor is there any greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Deceitfulness of a man's Heart, than is his Treacherous <hi>Belief</hi> that he does <hi>Believe,</hi> and that with a truly-Christian Faith; when yet he proves by All his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, that he is either <hi>no Believer,</hi> or <hi>such</hi> a Believer of <hi>the Gospel,</hi> as he is of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s, or <hi>Cicero's Works,</hi> and no whit bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

<pb n="442" facs="tcp:106235:229"/>
of a meerly <hi>human</hi> Law, and where the Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty is no greater, than the <hi>loss</hi> of a man's <hi>Ears,</hi> or the <hi>forfeiture</hi> of his <hi>Estate,</hi> than from committing a <hi>greater Evil,</hi> which is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by <hi>God himself,</hi> under the Poenalty of their <hi>missing the Ioys of Heaven,</hi> and also of <hi>abiding the Pains of Hell,</hi> but that they do <hi>more</hi> believe the <hi>one,</hi> than they do the <hi>other?</hi> It cannot be for <hi>This</hi> reason, that men do think it a greater Misery, to suffer a <hi>little</hi> for a <hi>short</hi> Time, than all imaginable <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to all <hi>Eternity.</hi> It cannot be, that they had rather fry in Hell without ceasing, than indure the short loss of Life and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.

and most univocal, <hi>who are Vessels of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and who of Wrath:</hi> Who were decreed from All Aeternity to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Believers,</hi> and <hi>Unbelievers.</hi> No more but so: <hi>He that believeth, shall be saved, and He that believeth not, shall be damn'd.</hi> Which cannot possibly be meant concerning every <hi>human</hi> Faith, whereof the World is too full. It cannot be meant of <hi>such</hi> a Faith, as makes a man <hi>abhor Idols,</hi> but not abstain from <hi>committing Sacrilege.</hi> Nor can it be meant of <hi>such</hi> a Faith, as is strong enough to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Mountains,</hi> (to wit The <hi>Laws</hi> and the Land-Marks of Church and State,) to pull down Kings, and unsettle Kingdoms; But not strong enough to bring forth Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Christ's Commands, and (by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence unavoidable) to God's Vicegerents upon Earth. It cannot be meant of the <hi>Antinomian,</hi> or the <hi>Fiduciarie</hi>'s Faith, which sets it self into a kind of opposition unto <hi>Good works;</hi> and so by consequence is the Parent of nothing but practical Infidelity. But 'tis meant of That <hi>sanctifying</hi> and <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith,</hi> which whosoever hath, <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the world,</hi> 1 John 5. 5. 'Tis meant
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:106235:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Iustifying</hi> Faith, not only in the <hi>mystical,</hi> but <hi>literal</hi> notion of the word; a Faith which <hi>so</hi> justifies, that (in a competent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree) It does evermore make its Possessor <hi>Iust.</hi> It makes him an <hi>upright and honest man. Saving Faith</hi> being a <hi>Grace,</hi> which, as it is the <hi>most</hi> commonly <hi>talk't</hi> of, so it is (I am afraid) the <hi>least</hi> commonly <hi>understood,</hi> of any one thing in the <hi>Christian Code.</hi> We could not else so much abound with <hi>Knaves</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites</hi> as we do in the Christian World. That which we call <hi>Divine</hi> Faith, which is a justifying and sanctifying and saving Faith, and upon which The Word of God does every where lay so great a stress, must be an Habit of the <hi>Will,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Understanding;</hi> not only <hi>flourishing</hi> in the <hi>Head,</hi> but deeply <hi>rooted</hi> in the <hi>Heart.</hi> It must be such as does contain a full and <hi>generous Belief</hi> he dares to dye for; a full and <hi>Practical Belief</hi> that <hi>Iesus Christ is the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as;</hi> a <gap reason="foreign">

His Affections are taken off from the beggarly Elements of the World, and fix't entirely upon <hi>God,</hi> as his soveraign Good. I mean they are set upon <hi>God in Christ, reconciling the World unto Himself.</hi> And <hi>overcome The world</hi> he does, (as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> must needs mean,) by <hi>overcoming its Temptations;</hi> its <hi>Pomps,</hi> and <hi>Vanities;</hi> its <hi>Smiles,</hi> and <hi>Flatteries;</hi> nor only the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi> but <hi>Terrors</hi> of it.

List, as The <hi>Head-spring</hi> and <hi>Fountain</hi> of all the Rest. For I think I may challenge any man living (without immodesty) to Name any one <hi>Actual</hi> and <hi>Damning</hi> Sin, which has not the Sin of <hi>Self-love</hi> for its most execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Original.</hi> It was meerly <hi>Self-love,</hi> which turned <hi>Luciser</hi> into a <hi>Devil,</hi> and made the <hi>Son of the Morning The Prince of Darkness.</hi> It was the Sin of <hi>Self-love</hi> which turned those Protoplasts <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> out of their <hi>Innocence,</hi> and by consequence out of their <hi>Paradise,</hi> which they held and possessed by That one Tenure. It was at first the <hi>Love of Self,</hi> and of <hi>Self-preservation,</hi> which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>renounce</hi> and <hi>abjure</hi> his Master. And it was first a <hi>Self-love,</hi> which produced in <hi>Iudas</hi> a <hi>love of Mony,</hi> wherewith he was tempted to <hi>betray,</hi> and to <hi>slay</hi> his Master. Thence it was that <hi>Self-denial,</hi> or <hi>Self-abne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> was the very first <hi>Lesson</hi> our Saviour taught his first Disciples. And 'tis the first <hi>we</hi> are to learn, in the <hi>School</hi> of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> It being the <hi>Causa-sine-qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> of all other Duties in a <hi>Christian.</hi> For whosoever has once attain'd a good Degree of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> or of <hi>Self-hatred</hi> for Sins
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:106235:234"/>
committed, can fast from eating, when he is hungry; and even from drinking, when he is dry; from stealing, when he is Poor; and from coveting, when he is Rich; from repining, when he is low; and from oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, when he is lofty; and so from every thing else, which either is <hi>sinful</hi> in it self, or so much as a Temptation <hi>inducing</hi> to it. How did St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he <hi>repented, revenge</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon himself, for his having so <hi>basely</hi> (out of <hi>Self-love</hi>) not only <hi>disown'd,</hi> but <hi>forsworn</hi> his Lord? He did not only <hi>deny Himself,</hi> in opposition to his <hi>Denial</hi> of Jesus Christ, But <hi>abhorr'd</hi> himself too, in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his <hi>Self-love,</hi> which <hi>betray'd</hi> him to it. How triumphant was his <hi>Faith,</hi> and his <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial?</hi> how triumphant over <hi>Himself,</hi> and his former <hi>Cowardize?</hi> how did he preach up Christ Crucified, for which he was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with his Head downwards? and in All he did, or suffer'd, how did he bear down all before him, (not only all the <hi>World,</hi> but the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> too,) as mighty Cataracts and Torrents do sticks and straws? So did <hi>Peter,</hi> as well as <hi>Paul,</hi> courageously <hi>sight the good sight of Faith.</hi> Such in Him
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:106235:235"/>
was That <hi>Faith which overcometh the World. And when the Son of Man cometh</hi> to be the Judge of Quick and Dead, (Lord!) how much (or rather how little,) <hi>shall he find</hi> of such fighting and conquering <hi>Faith upon the Earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 11. This is infinitely far from <hi>That</hi> Carnal Faith, which only <hi>works</hi> (<hi>by Self-love</hi>) All the Degrees of <hi>Disobedience</hi> to Christ's Commands. No, The Faith which He shall find in <hi>comparatively None</hi> (that is to say <hi>in very few</hi>) at his <hi>second</hi> Coming, is <hi>such</hi> a Faith as strongly works by a <hi>Love of others;</hi> which is said with great reason to be <hi>The ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law</hi> in Both the Tables of The Decalogue, (which our Blessed Lord came to <hi>fulfil</hi> and perfect, not to abrogate, or to destroy;) because 'tis hard, if not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, for us to name any one Duty, incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on us as Men, or Christians, which is not the Necessary Production of <hi>such a Love</hi> as <hi>Faith works</hi> by. For as immoderate <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love,</hi> which consists with an <hi>human</hi> and <hi>worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Faith, is <hi>the Root of All Evil</hi> without Exception; so a truly <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> which is <hi>operative,</hi> and <hi>works by a due love of others,</hi>
               <pb n="455" facs="tcp:106235:235"/>
(a <hi>love of God with all our hearts,</hi> and of <hi>our Neighbour as our selves,</hi>) cannot choose but be <hi>the Root of all the Good fruits</hi> to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd. For how can any man <hi>indure</hi> to be rebelling against <hi>his God,</hi> whom he does love <hi>with all his Soul,</hi> and <hi>above</hi> Himself? And how can any man (<hi>knowingly</hi>) suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be induced to <hi>wrong</hi> his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> whom he does love <hi>without hypocrisie,</hi> and <hi>As</hi> Himself? that is, as <hi>sincerely,</hi> thô not as <hi>well;</hi> or as <hi>well,</hi> (if you please,) thô <hi>not as much.</hi> With a <hi>sicut similitudinis,</hi> thô not <hi>ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitatis.</hi> In which sense 'tis said by our Lord Himself, <hi>Be ye perfect, As your Father in</hi>

            <p>§ 1. THere is a Time when in Scripture <hi>God</hi> is said to tempt <hi>Man.</hi> And again there is a Time when <hi>Man</hi> is said to
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:106235:242"/>
tempt <hi>God.</hi> Last of all there is a Time when <hi>the Devil</hi> is said to tempt <hi>Both;</hi> and Both <hi>at once</hi> in this Text, in which are met the <hi>two Natures</hi> of <hi>God and Man.</hi> Now though <hi>to Tempt</hi> in each Case is still a phrase of <hi>one sound,</hi> yet is it often found to be of very <hi>different significations.</hi> Indeed <hi>so</hi> different, that they may seem to <hi>contradict.</hi> For <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> saith, <hi>God tempted Abraham;</hi> And yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>God tempteth no man.</hi> It is implyed by our Saviour, that <hi>God is tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at least by some;</hi> And yet 'tis said by St. <hi>Iames, He is not tempted of any.</hi> Now the way to reconcile them is briefly This. When <hi>God</hi> is said to tempt <hi>Man,</hi> it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing but a <hi>Trial,</hi> a kind of <hi>Search</hi> which God makes in the <hi>Heart</hi> of man. Not that God can be <hi>in doubt,</hi> or stand in need of an <hi>Inquiry,</hi> how any man's <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>affected</hi> towards him; But 'tis to admonish him of his <hi>weakness,</hi> or to convince him of his <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> or else to evidence his <hi>Faith,</hi> or to exercise his <hi>Patience,</hi> or to make his <hi>Integrity</hi> the more <hi>conspicuous,</hi> and <hi>rewarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> that God is pleased to <hi>explore</hi> and to <hi>search</hi> his Heart. Thus in <hi>Genesis,</hi> and <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
               <pb n="469" facs="tcp:106235:242"/>
and in the Thirteenth of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> and the <hi>Israelites</hi> are said to have been tempted by <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 2. <hi>Man</hi> (in the second place) is said to tempt <hi>God,</hi> when without any <hi>Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or <hi>Assurance</hi> of <hi>Success,</hi> he rashly goes out of his <hi>Calling</hi> to <hi>meet</hi> with <hi>Danger.</hi> Or when without any <hi>Warrant,</hi> whether from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Word</hi> of God, he gladly falls<note place="margin">Historiam de falso Messiâ El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>david, A.

For what is this but to <hi>explore,</hi> or to make a <hi>Trial,</hi> both of the <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of God? not at all out of <hi>Faith</hi> in his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Promise,</hi> but out of a wanton <hi>Curiosity,</hi> or bold <hi>Praesump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. But now the <hi>Devil</hi> is said to tempt either God, or Man, and Both together in the Text, when not only <hi>without,</hi> but <hi>against</hi> the Word, he does <hi>solicite</hi> and <hi>intice</hi> to something or other which is <hi>Evil.</hi> And thus our <hi>Lord</hi> is said in Scripture to have been <hi>tempted,</hi> even as <hi>We.</hi> Not by Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:106235:243"/>
only and Thirst, by Cold and Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by Slander and Disgrace, by Pangs and Torments, and all Degrees of <hi>Affliction</hi> to which the Name of <hi>Temptations</hi> is justly fixt; But to the <hi>worst</hi> of Afflictions, that is, to <hi>Sin;</hi> and to the <hi>worst</hi> even of Sins, to wit <hi>Idolatry;</hi> And to the <hi>worst</hi> of Idolatries, even <hi>the worshipping of the Devil.</hi> Who being permitted to take him up to an exceeding high Mountain, did shew him from thence, as in a Landskip, All the Kingdoms of the World and the Glory of them; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon made him this glorious Offer, <hi>All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me:</hi> Or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>If, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down, Thou wilt worship me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. Which words do present us with Satan's Masterpiece; And the Motto on his Ensign, is [<hi>Now, or Never.</hi>] For as the Roman <hi>Triarij,</hi> when their <hi>two first</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons<note place="margin">T. Liv. Dec. 1. l. 8.</note> had fought in vain, were depended upon at last as their <hi>only Refuge;</hi> So when the Devil had been improsperous in his <hi>two first</hi> Onsets upon our Saviour, He comes at last to make use of <hi>All the Kingdoms of the Earth, and the Glory of them;</hi> clearly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:106235:243"/>
upon <hi>This,</hi> as his most formidable <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve;</hi> And even against the <hi>Fortifications,</hi> not only of the <hi>Innocence,</hi> but the <hi>Divinity</hi> of our Lord, (who was no less <hi>the Lord of Armies,</hi> than <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi>) his most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, most powerful, most hopeful Stratagem.</p>
            <p>The Text, at first view, affords no more than <hi>two Generals.</hi> To wit the Devil's <hi>vast Offer,</hi> And the unreasonable <hi>Condition</hi> with which 'tis clogg'd. But out of these <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals</hi> put together, we may (by the help of a little Logick) draw <hi>four Particulars.</hi> Each of which will be a <hi>Doctrin,</hi> whereof it will be easy to make good <hi>Use.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The First particular Doctrin is, That <hi>the Kingdoms of the Earth,</hi> and <hi>the Glory of them,</hi> being all met together (as here they are,) do amount to nothing more, than so many <hi>glittering Temptations.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The Second is, That <hi>all the Goods of this World,</hi> however <hi>lovely</hi> they may appear to <hi>Carnal Reason,</hi> or <hi>Common Sense,</hi> are yet by God's <hi>Patience,</hi> and wise <hi>Permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in the <hi>Devil</hi>'s <hi>Proffer,</hi> and <hi>Disposal.</hi> I
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:106235:244"/>
say They are so <hi>by God's Permission,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Devil can give nothing, till God gives <hi>leave;</hi> which, for wise and just Ends, it often pleaseth him to afford.</item>
               <item>3. The Third Doctrin is, That the utmost <hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>Drift</hi> of all the <hi>Donatives</hi> of the <hi>Tempter,</hi> is to <hi>steal</hi> our Hearts from <hi>God,</hi> and to <hi>turn</hi> them wholly upon <hi>Himself.</hi> He never <hi>Proffers,</hi> but with a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Proviso.</hi> He does it <hi>liberally</hi> indeed, [<hi>All these things will I give thee,</hi>] But with a <hi>covetous</hi> Supposition, [<hi>if, falling down, thou wilt worship me.</hi>]</item>
               <item>4. From whence it follows in the fourth Place, That how incessantly soever some men do <hi>labour,</hi> whereby to <hi>purchase</hi> these Gifts of Satan, yet there is nothing in the World with greater easiness to be compass'd; if the Devil may be try'd by his own <hi>Confession.</hi> Who, though the things here spoken of are great, and goodly, (<hi>even the Kingdoms of the Earth, and the Glory of them,</hi>) is yet most <hi>ready</hi> to part with <hi>All,</hi> in exchange for an <hi>Act</hi> of our <hi>Adoration.</hi> To attain the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The <hi>All</hi> that our Tempter can
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:106235:244"/>
                  <hi>give,</hi> or <hi>offer,</hi> nothing more needs be done, than <hi>to fall down to him and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>§ 1. To prove the <hi>First</hi> of these Four, [That <hi>the Kingdoms of the Earth,</hi> when they are <hi>All put together,</hi> make but a <hi>glittering Temptation, or handsom Snare,</hi>] we need not argue or dispute from a fitter Topick, than the very signal <hi>Method</hi> the Devil here useth. Who, when he could not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt our Saviour by all the Miseries of <hi>Want,</hi> did now at last attempt to do it by the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Overtures of <hi>Plenty.</hi> Nor can we think he was so <hi>silly,</hi> as not to <hi>rise</hi> in his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from the less unto the greater. It being for nothing but his <hi>Subtilty,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with his <hi>Malice,</hi> that He is call'd <hi>The Old Serpent;</hi> And is said by St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> to<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 9.</note> have <hi>deceiv'd the whole World.</hi> And if <hi>the Children of this World are wiser in their kind</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 16. 8.</note> (as our Saviour says they are) <hi>than the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light,</hi> How much more is their <note n="*" place="margin">John 8. 44.</note> 
               <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> who for the <hi>Power</hi> of his working, and <hi>Success</hi> of his Policy, is called sometimes <hi>The</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">John 14. 30. John 16. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Prince,</hi> and once <note n="‖" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The God of this World?</hi>
               <pb n="474" facs="tcp:106235:245"/>
Nor is it certainly for Nothing, that <hi>The Devil</hi> has in Scripture such <hi>glorious Titles.</hi> For if we consider the <hi>world of men,</hi> who are divided in their Affections 'twixt <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> we shall find by their <hi>Actions,</hi> (the best <hi>Interpreters</hi> of their <hi>Hearts</hi>) that the Territories of Satan are much the greater. Our Saviour tells us of a <hi>Broad</hi> way which leadeth to <hi>Destruction,</hi> and <hi>many</hi> there be that go in thereat; whereas (in comparison,) the way to <hi>Life</hi> is but <hi>Narrow,</hi> and They that go thither (he saith) are <hi>few.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Those unclean Spirits</hi> which are expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be <hi>the Spirits now working</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>in the Children of Disobedience,</hi> are but little after call'd by the same Apostle, <hi>The Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities,</hi> and the <hi>Powers,</hi> and (which is more) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Rulers of this</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 12.</note> 
               <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 2. That thus it is, the Scripture tells us. But some may wonder that thus it <hi>should</hi> be. What may therefore be the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> why so <hi>few</hi> should fight manfully under the Banner of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who therefore said truly, <hi>His Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> And so <hi>many</hi> under <hi>Satan</hi>'s, who thence is
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:106235:245"/>
said to be <hi>the Ruler,</hi> and <hi>the God of this world?</hi> It cannot be because God is more <hi>unwilling</hi> to be obey'd, and <hi>belov'd</hi> by his People, than Satan is. Nor can it be because God did make it <hi>necessary</hi> for Satan, to have a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er success in the World than Christ. Nor can it be because God is more delighted in the <hi>Damnation,</hi> than the <hi>Salvation</hi> of his Creatures. (He would not fo <hi>gratifie</hi> the Prince of Darkness; nor could his Mercy have been <hi>then</hi> over all his Works.) Nor can it be because Satan is of <hi>more strength</hi> than the Almighty, or more powerful to <hi>corrupt,</hi> than God to <hi>purifie.</hi> For could it consist with God's oeconomy, to work on our <hi>Wills</hi> by That <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> by which the <hi>Wind</hi> and the <hi>Fire</hi> and the <hi>Sea</hi> obey him, we should not be in a <hi>capacity</hi> to break his Praecepts; we should act only as <hi>natural, spontaneous</hi> Agents; and do our Duties as the <hi>Stones</hi> do, in tending <hi>downwards.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as having made us an other Thing, to wit a <hi>rational</hi> sort of Creatures, and that <hi>in viâ;</hi> not yet arriv'd at our Journeys end, but in a <hi>Tendency</hi> from <hi>Earth,</hi> either to <hi>Heaven,</hi> or to <hi>Hell;</hi> not <hi>indefectibly good,</hi> like the
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:106235:246"/>
Spirits in <hi>Heaven,</hi> nor <hi>consummately evil,</hi> like those in <hi>Hell,</hi> but as it were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the <hi>Skirts,</hi> or the <hi>Confines</hi> betwixt them Both; to wit <hi>inclinable</hi> to evil, and also <hi>capable</hi> of good; does therefore work upon our <hi>Wills</hi> in a <hi>congruous</hi> manner; in such a manner as is agreeable with the <hi>nature</hi> we are <hi>of,</hi> and with the <hi>condition</hi> we are <hi>in.</hi> Does not press us by any force to <hi>list</hi> our selves in his <hi>Army;</hi> But freely leaves us our option, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be <hi>Royalists,</hi> or <hi>Rebels</hi> to him. Nor can it derogate from his Goodness, that he leaves it in our <hi>power</hi> to be <hi>rebellious;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he gives us <hi>sufficient Grace,</hi> whereby he enables us to <hi>obey.</hi> It is not therefore by a <hi>Fatality</hi> that Satan has got so many Soldiers; but by the <hi>voluntary Defection</hi> of such as serve him. Who cannot say that the Tempter does <hi>irresistibly</hi> debauch them, though with the <hi>Vanities</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> he does <hi>assault</hi> them from <hi>without,</hi> and with the <hi>Treacheries</hi> of the <hi>Flesh</hi> he does <hi>surprise</hi> them from <hi>within.</hi> For the Devil's very <hi>utmost</hi> is but to <hi>tempt</hi> us. And let the <hi>matter</hi> of Temptation be what it will, whether <hi>Honour,</hi> or <hi>Disgrace,</hi> whether <hi>Pain,</hi> or <hi>Pleasure,</hi> whether <hi>Frights,</hi>
               <pb n="477" facs="tcp:106235:246"/>
or <hi>Flatteries,</hi> whether <hi>want,</hi> or <hi>superfluity,</hi> or even the same in the Text wherewith he tempted our Blessed Saviour, [<hi>All the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Earth, and the Glory of them;</hi>] Yet because by <hi>all These</hi> he can but <hi>solicite,</hi> and <hi>intice</hi> us, we cannot say he does <hi>ravish,</hi> but <hi>court</hi> our Wills. 'Tis true, the Devil is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by many terrible Appellations throughout the Scriptures; as that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baddon,</hi> and <hi>Apollyon,</hi> a <hi>Murderer from the Beginning,</hi> a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and a <hi>Red Dragon,</hi> a <hi>Roaring Lyon,</hi> and a <hi>Serpent.</hi> And in one respect or other he is indeed each of These. But yet he carrys away the <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Assents</hi> of men, not as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> only by <hi>Strength;</hi> nor as a <hi>Roaring</hi> one, by <hi>Rapacity;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a <hi>Serpent,</hi> by <hi>Circumvention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. Now then let us return to see how the Argument will go on; (having seen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough already, upon what foot it stands, and put a Block out of the way too, at which too many are wont to stumble;) can we imagin it to be <hi>likely,</hi> that the old ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Serpent, <hi>the subtlest Creature under Heaven,</hi> could be so <hi>stupid</hi> and <hi>obtuse</hi> in the Art of Mischief, as to employ his <hi>chief</hi>

strength upon a Design of <hi>less</hi> importance, and to reserve his <hi>weakest</hi> force for his very <hi>last Onset,</hi> or <hi>Assault?</hi> At first he tempted our Blessed Saviour to nothing else but <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust;</hi> and therefore only made use of his being <hi>hungry,</hi> (v. 3.) Next he tempted him to <hi>Praesumption,</hi> which is the opposite Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation; and thought it enough for that Effect, to put him in mind of his <hi>Praeroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> (v. 6.) But now at last he runs high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and seeks to bribe the most <hi>righteous Iudge</hi> to the greatest unworthiness in the World, <hi>an Idolizing the unworthiest of all his Creatures.</hi> He knew that Christ was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> because he heard him so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by <hi>God the Father,</hi> (Chap. 3. v. 17.) He also knew the Son of God to be <hi>God the Son</hi> too. And he knew that God the Son was even <hi>the Wisdom of the Father.</hi> And when he would tempt <hi>Wisdom it self</hi> to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the very Tempter, he could not but know he was to use the <hi>highest Allective</hi> to be imagin'd. Which by what other means should he hope to do, than by taking up our Lord <hi>to an exceeding high Mountain,</hi> shewing him there, as in a Synopsis, <hi>All the</hi>

               <hi>Kingdoms of the World, with the Glory of them,</hi> and then by making this lusty Proffer, <hi>All These will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me?</hi>

            <p>§ 4. This then does lead us to see the reason, why 'tis said by St. <hi>Paul, That the</hi>

               <hi>love of mony is the Root of all Evil.</hi> And why by St. <hi>Iames, Go to now ye rich men, weep and</hi>

               <hi>howl for the Miseries that shall come upon you.</hi> And why 'tis said by our Saviour (of whom we believe that he shall come to be our Judge,) <hi>Wo to you that are Rich, for ye have</hi>

               <hi>received your Consolation. Wo to you that are full, for ye shall hunger. Wo to you that laugh, for ye shall mourn and weep.</hi> And why 'twas said by the Spanish Friar, That <hi>Few Potentates go to Hell, because</hi> (compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively speaking,) <hi>they All are but Few.</hi> And why we vowed in our Baptism to fight man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully under Christ's Banner, as well <hi>against the World,</hi> as the Flesh, and the Devil. And why we pray in our publick Litany, not only <hi>In all Time of our Tribulation, of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Tempest, of Plague, Pestilence, and Famine, of Battle, and Murder, and suddain Death;</hi> But (as a Danger, if not a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:106235:248"/>
as great as either,) <hi>In all Time of our WEALTH, Good Lord deliver us.</hi> Nor can we render a better reason, (as long as <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> sits as <hi>Iudge,</hi>) why so many who have been placed <hi>upon exceeding high Mountains,</hi> (a great deal higher even than That on which the Devil here placed our Blessed Saviour,) from whence they could not only <hi>see,</hi> but <hi>injoy</hi> the Kingdoms of the Earth, and the Glory of them, have gladly <hi>laid down</hi> those Kingdoms, and <hi>divorc'd</hi> themselves from those Glories, as having known them by sad experience, to be but <hi>exquisite Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>pleasant Snares.</hi>

            <p>§ 5. But here I would not be so mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as our Lord was by his Disciples, when he pronounced it <hi>impossible for a rich man to</hi>

               <hi>enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> For when I say that <hi>worldly Greatness</hi> is one of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's most cogent Engines, whereby to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter down the <hi>Castle</hi> or <hi>Soul</hi> of Man, I am far from implying 'tis <hi>irresistible.</hi> Though I argue that the Devil is then the greatest <hi>Poliorxetick,</hi> (as Soldiers word it) when he lays Siege to a man's Soul with <hi>All the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Earth;</hi> yet can it not therefore

be deny'd, but that we may beat him out of his Trenches, <hi>through him that strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth us;</hi> and that (as He did,) with an <gap reason="foreign">

so exempted by God Almighty from the Dignity and Privilege of <hi>suffering</hi> for him. This then (we must confess) is the great <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> of <hi>Temptations,</hi> (to give our Enemies their Due,) that by resisting them to the end, we <hi>manfully fight</hi> under Christ's <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> conform our selves to his <hi>Example,</hi> and suffer for <hi>his</hi> sake, as He for <hi>ours.</hi> In which respect (no doubt) it was, (as before I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that St. <hi>Iames</hi> began his Epistle with this remarkable Exhortation, <hi>Brethren count it all Ioy when ye fall into divers Temptations.</hi> Some may <hi>wonder</hi> at the Expression, and think it <hi>impious,</hi> that at the instant in which we pray, <hi>lead us not into Temptation,</hi> we should be <hi>glad</hi> of those things we daily <hi>deprecate.</hi> But St. <hi>Iames</hi> does there speak touching <hi>proportionable</hi> Temptations, such as are not <hi>above our strength;</hi> and are not for the <hi>staggering,</hi> but for the <hi>trial</hi> of our <hi>Faith.</hi> Now the <hi>Trial of our Faith worketh</hi>

            <p>§ 13. Again the Goods of this World are very apt to breed <hi>Sloath;</hi> And this was the <hi>Third</hi> great Sin of <hi>Sodom.</hi> Not only <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Fulness of Bread,</hi> but <hi>Abundance of Idleness was in her.</hi> A man who lives by

somewhat else to do, than to admit of what he did at a Time of <hi>Idleness</hi> and <hi>Plenty,</hi> when he wallowed in the <hi>Mire</hi> of the <hi>Good Things</hi> of <hi>This World.</hi> Thus the <hi>Earth,</hi> which lyes <hi>Idle,</hi> is presently over-run with <hi>Weeds;</hi> whilst the <hi>Heavens,</hi> which ever <hi>move,</hi> still keep their <hi>Purity.</hi> Just as Waters, <hi>standing still,</hi> are very easily <hi>corrupted;</hi> whilst Those that <hi>run,</hi> and run <hi>swiftly,</hi> keep themselves <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>unpolluted.</hi>

            <p>§ 14. Again the Goods of this World, the more they labour to <hi>fill</hi> the Appetite, the more they <hi>dilate</hi> it, and make it <hi>empty.</hi> They are apt to make a <hi>thirsty, hydropick</hi> Soul. As the <hi>Poor</hi> man does <hi>labour,</hi> to grow <hi>less</hi> poor; so the <hi>Rich</hi> does <hi>lay up,</hi> to grow <hi>more</hi> rich. And though 'tis hard to make a <hi>Rule</hi> which will not admit of some <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,</hi> yet 'tis generally observable, that a <hi>poor</hi> man's care is how to keep out of <hi>want;</hi> whereas the care of the <hi>Rich</hi> is how to get into <hi>Superfluity.</hi> A man of <hi>mediocrity,</hi> who is but <hi>well enough to live,</hi> is aptest to think himself <hi>well enough;</hi> nor aims so much at the <hi>Increase,</hi> as at the meer <hi>Praeservation</hi> of his Possessions. Whereas <hi>Abundance</hi> of
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:106235:258"/>
Riches makes a <hi>Plethory</hi> in the Heart, which breaks out into an <hi>Itch,</hi> without due <hi>Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and <hi>Evacuations.</hi> By how much the <hi>fuller</hi> he is of <hi>Wealth,</hi> by so much the <hi>more</hi> his Heart is set upon the <hi>raising</hi> of his <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and the leaving to his Children a great deal more than he was <hi>left.</hi> He loves to be <hi>joyning House to House, and to be laying</hi>

The reason of it is chiefly This; That what appears very <hi>Great</hi> to them who <hi>want</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> it, does, to them who do <hi>embrace</hi> it, almost totally <hi>disappear.</hi> What <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Hunger</hi> present as <hi>bigg, Possession</hi> makes to seem <hi>little,</hi> even because it does not stand at a <hi>due Distance</hi> from the <hi>Appetite.</hi> For an Object may be <hi>too near</hi> (as well as <hi>too far</hi>) to be truly <hi>seen;</hi> witness the Letters of any

For now 'tis time that I <hi>apply,</hi> and so <hi>improve</hi> what I have said, by adding several <hi>Considerations,</hi> whereof the one will very fitly become a step unto the other.

            <p>§ 16. First then let us consider; That if the World's <hi>Good things</hi> are commonly made the Devil's <hi>Lime-twigs,</hi> laid before us as our Food, but only intended for our Fetters; It concerns us that our <hi>Souls</hi> be night and day kept <hi>on wing,</hi> and incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>flying over</hi> these Snares of Satan. Which to accomplish the more effectually, we must be careful not to stand upon <hi>exceeding high Mountains,</hi> nor take <hi>too much</hi> of this <hi>World</hi> within our <hi>Prospect.</hi> The <hi>Bowels</hi> of St. <hi>Paul</hi>

            <p>§ 18.

Satan tempts us to <hi>Rebellion,</hi> with the Things that are <hi>seen,</hi> which are but <hi>Temporal;</hi> God solicits us to <hi>Obedience,</hi> with the Things that are <hi>not seen,</hi> which are <hi>Eternal.</hi> Satan's Proposals are to the <hi>Flesh;</hi> God's especially to the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Satan takes us up to an exceeding <hi>high Mountain,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers to us from thence, <hi>all the Kingdoms</hi>
               <pb n="518" facs="tcp:106235:267"/>
               <hi>of the Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Glory of them;</hi> God, on the other side, takes us up to <hi>Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or at least takes us down to the <hi>Valley of Achor,</hi> and discovers to us from thence, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven, and Glory of it,</hi> and saith to <hi>us</hi> in effect, (as the Devil to Christ,) <hi>All This will I give you, if falling down ye will worship me.</hi> Now it remains that we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to <hi>which</hi> Proposal of the <hi>two</hi> our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Appetites have the most reason to <hi>incline.</hi> Let's put them Both into the <hi>Scales,</hi> and then choose That that shall weigh the <hi>heaviest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Things of this present World, the best we can say of them is This, <hi>They all are to perish in the using.</hi> The World it self is but a Thing, <hi>whose Fashion passeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> But 'tis the <hi>saddest</hi> consideration, that the World's Good things are much more <hi>dangerous</hi> than they are <hi>frail.</hi> It being a Duty extremely difficult, <hi>to use this World as not abusing it;</hi> And yet if we <hi>omit</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this Duty, The richest Possessions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth will but serve to purchase for us the largest Interest in Hell. So that the Devil's <hi>Liberality</hi> amounts to <hi>This</hi> only, That
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:106235:267"/>
if we will but <hi>Idolize</hi> him, he will <hi>give</hi> us whatsoever may do us <hi>Harm.</hi> He will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply us with the means of being damn'd so much the deeper. Was it (think we) for <hi>nothing,</hi> or a thing by meer <hi>chance,</hi> that as our Saviour chose <hi>Poverty</hi> (rather than Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) for himself, so he chose such as were <hi>poor,</hi> (as well in <hi>Fortune,</hi> as in <hi>Spirit,</hi>) to be <hi>inrich'd</hi> by his <hi>Grace,</hi> and made <hi>Inheritors</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom?</hi> Was there not (think we) something in it, that the Primitive Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency consisted in <hi>selling all that they had,</hi> and <hi>laying it down at the Apostles Feet?</hi> The least we can gather from it is This, (And be it spoken as impartially to the due <hi>comfort</hi> of the <hi>Poor,</hi> as to the needful <hi>Humiliation</hi> of such amongst us as are <hi>Rich,</hi>) That <hi>Poverty,</hi> though it is not exempt from <hi>All,</hi> is yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious <hi>unto fewer,</hi> and <hi>lesser</hi> Dangers. For <hi>Riches</hi> commonly do inable us to <hi>do</hi> things to be <hi>repented;</hi> whereas <hi>Poverty</hi> helps to fit us to <hi>repent</hi> of things <hi>done.</hi> Indeed 'tis best of the two, to have <hi>Food convenient,</hi> (as <hi>Agur</hi> words it;) to be in such a <hi>mediocrity</hi> 'twixt Poverty, and Plenty, as not to be <hi>pinched</hi> with the <hi>former,</hi> nor too much <hi>load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

with the <hi>later. Agur</hi> prayed against <hi>Both;</hi> but for different reasons. He prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Poverty,</hi> as apt to make him turn <hi>Thief;</hi> But he prayed against <hi>Riches,</hi> as apt to make him turn <hi>Atheist.</hi> Now by how much it is <hi>worse</hi> to be an <hi>Atheist,</hi> than a <hi>Thief,</hi> by so much <hi>Riches</hi> should make a <hi>sadder,</hi> and a more <hi>formidable</hi> Condition. And 'twas perhaps for this reason, (amongst some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,) that the most Learned of all our Kings thought <hi>Him</hi> the <hi>happiest</hi> man in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who by his Quality and Estate had a <hi>middle</hi> Station, betwixt an <hi>High Constable,</hi> and a <hi>Iustice of Peace.</hi> For such a man is neither held to be <hi>Poor</hi> nor <hi>Rich.</hi> He has not the <hi>Indigence</hi> of the one, nor the <hi>Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the other. Is freer from <hi>Contempt,</hi> and from <hi>Envy</hi> too. Has weaker <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> and fewer <hi>Troubles.</hi> This is to be <hi>fed with Food convenient.</hi> And This is the Condition which <hi>Agur</hi> pray'd for. But that <hi>Scarceness</hi> in it self is safer for us (of the two) than <hi>Superfluity,</hi> we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from That Method which the <hi>Devil</hi> here used against our <hi>Saviour:</hi> who, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as his <hi>Prosperities</hi> did <hi>fall,</hi> or <hi>rise,</hi> did
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:106235:268"/>
ever find his <hi>Temptations</hi> to <hi>ebb,</hi> or <hi>flow.</hi> And we know the lowest <hi>ebb</hi> can but leave us <hi>dry,</hi> whereas the <hi>Tyde</hi> of Prosperity is apt to <hi>drown</hi> us. So <hi>frail,</hi> and so <hi>worthless,</hi> yea and so <hi>dangerous</hi> are the Things, by which <hi>the Rival</hi> of our Maker most strongly tempts us.</p>
            <p>Weigh we next the Good Things, not only of <hi>This,</hi> but a <hi>better</hi> World, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the God who may <hi>despise,</hi> vouchsafes to <hi>court</hi> us. He does not only court us with the Promise of a <hi>Deliverance,</hi> from a Bottomless Lake of Fire and Brimstone, where the Worm dyeth not, and where the Fire is not quenched; Nor seek to win us only by Promises of a <hi>Crown immarcescible,</hi> of <hi>Ioys unspeakable, and endless,</hi> such as our Hearts cannot hold, nor our Tongues ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor our Reasons comprehend, nor our Fansies reach; But farther obliges and indears us with a world of Bounties whilst we are <hi>Here.</hi> For Every man in the World has all the World in Epitome; and that not only as to the <hi>sight,</hi> but <hi>injoyment</hi> also, until he <hi>forfeits</hi> his Birthright by the High Treason of his <hi>Debauches.</hi> Till then (I say) he has <hi>a world,</hi> both to <hi>possess,</hi> and

The Truth of which saying will soon appear, to whosoever will take the pains (as <hi>Augustine Mascardus</hi> has somewhere done) to draw a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel of Particulars.

Before, was very <hi>long;</hi> It <hi>reach't</hi> as far as <hi>Iob's All,</hi> besides his <hi>Person.</hi> In so much that of the <hi>Richest,</hi> he became the very <hi>Poorest</hi> of all the People: For 'tis a <hi>Proverb,</hi> and an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> to say a man is <hi>as poor as Iob.</hi> But <hi>now</hi> the <hi>Chain</hi> is made <hi>longer</hi> by <hi>one</hi> considerable <hi>Link.</hi> For having nothing left to him, except a <hi>Body</hi> and a <hi>Soul,</hi> and (what was much <hi>worse</hi> than nothing) a <hi>vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wife,</hi> (a Wife whom the Devil had <hi>leave enough</hi> to take from him, but would not <hi>use</hi> it,) now at last his <hi>Body</hi> too is in the power of the Destroyer, who <hi>disposed</hi> of his <hi>Flesh</hi> to the very <hi>Bone;</hi> Nor is there any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, besides his <hi>Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. Thus we see by Example, how great a stroak the Devil carrys, (by God's long Sufferance, and Permission,) in the outward management of the World. That is to say, in the <hi>Disposal</hi> of <hi>all Those</hi> Things, which do pass amongst men for <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious.</hi> How was Satan permitted to harden <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> to inrage <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> to excite <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> against the <hi>Israel</hi> of God? and to <hi>dispose</hi> of <hi>all they had,</hi> according to his own Lust? Should I produce as many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:106235:274"/>
as are <hi>producible</hi> out of Scripture, and dwell on each as I have done in the Case of <hi>Iob,</hi> I should be in some danger of being <hi>Endless.</hi> It shall therefore suffice me to say in brief, That whensoever one man <hi>invades</hi> another man's <hi>Right,</hi> or whensoever one <hi>Nation</hi> usurps <hi>Dominion</hi> over another, against that Precept of God and Nature writ in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man's Heart, [<hi>What thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>wouldest that no man should do to thee, do Thou to no man,</hi>] or against those other Precepts, <hi>Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet,</hi> Thou shalt not covet thy Neighbour's <hi>House,</hi> (much less his House with all his <hi>Land</hi> too,) nay Thou shalt not covet <hi>any</hi> thing (much less <hi>All</hi>) that is thy Neighbours; 'tis not <hi>God,</hi> but the <hi>Devil,</hi> who is the <hi>Author</hi> of That <hi>Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi> God does patiently <hi>permit,</hi> and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly <hi>over-rule,</hi> and wisely <hi>order</hi> such Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trations, to many most worthy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ends, which in part we well know, and in part we know not, (touching which I shall speak in their proper place;) But still the <hi>Robberies</hi> and <hi>Invasions</hi> are the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of <hi>the Devil.</hi> Now in <hi>every</hi> such Invasion there are <hi>two</hi> Parties tempted; one
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:106235:274"/>
with <hi>loss,</hi> and another with <hi>Acquisition.</hi> They that <hi>suffer</hi> the Injustice are strongly tempted with <hi>Affliction;</hi> And They that <hi>do</hi> it are tempted <hi>worse,</hi> because with the Bait of a <hi>Prosperity</hi> which in such case is <hi>irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> The Devil trys with <hi>one</hi> Action to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>two</hi> Souls at <hi>once. Two</hi> at once, in case the Robbery does only lye betwixt <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> But many <hi>Thousands</hi> of them at once, when betwixt the two Parts of an <hi>Armed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For then the Devil at the same time provokes the <hi>stronger</hi> Party to <hi>Pride,</hi> as well as the <hi>weaker</hi> to <hi>Impatience;</hi> The <hi>Injurious</hi> side to <hi>Insolence,</hi> and the <hi>oppressed</hi> to <hi>Despair.</hi> This I take to be the Reason, why when the Devil will do a Mischief of most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Importance, he does not content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with <hi>Brutish</hi> or <hi>Inanimate</hi> Instruments; but rather prefers the use of such, as ought to be <hi>rational,</hi> and <hi>religious,</hi> and so are to render a sad <hi>Accompt</hi> of what is <hi>done in the Body;</hi> That by <hi>dashing</hi> many Thousands (as when whole Armies meet) against <hi>each other,</hi> and getting <hi>Victory</hi> for the <hi>Oppressors,</hi> he may (in one kind or other) <hi>destroy</hi> them <hi>All.</hi> To wit the <hi>Bodies</hi> of <hi>some,</hi> and the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
               <pb n="534" facs="tcp:106235:275"/>
Had the Devil (for Example) infest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iob</hi> with nothing worse than the <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>Whirlwind,</hi> or only tormented his Flesh with <hi>Byles,</hi> he had in vain spread his Net to catch no more than one <hi>Bird,</hi> (for though <hi>Iob</hi> was a <note n="*" place="margin">Job 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Phoenix,</hi> he was but <hi>one;</hi>) Had fought to plunder <hi>Iob alone</hi> of his Faith and Patience. Whereas by stirring up the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeans</hi> and the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> to do him Mischief, he cunningly <hi>caught</hi> at one <hi>Draught</hi> as great a <hi>Multitude</hi> of Souls, as he had prosperously <hi>employ'd</hi> in so <hi>foul</hi> a <hi>Riot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. Now 'tis plain by this Instance of Satan's Power <hi>to take away,</hi> He has a power to <hi>bestow</hi> too, by God's permission; and that in order to an <hi>end,</hi> not as <hi>bad</hi> only, but <hi>worse,</hi> propos'd by Satan unto Himself. For when he takes from the <hi>Innocent,</hi> how <hi>liberal</hi> is he to the <hi>Guilty?</hi> It may be said of his Instruments, They do not <hi>always</hi> serve him <hi>for naught.</hi> He often <hi>caresses</hi> them whilst they are <hi>here,</hi> that so <hi>hereafter</hi> he may have liberty to <hi>glut</hi> his <hi>Malice</hi> on them <hi>the more.</hi> What he <hi>snatches</hi> (as 'twere with one hand) from the <hi>Innocent</hi> Party, he commonly <hi>gives</hi> (as with the other) to the <hi>Kennel</hi> of <hi>Robbers</hi>
               <pb n="535" facs="tcp:106235:275"/>
whom He <hi>employs.</hi> Look what <hi>Camels</hi> and <hi>other Cattle</hi> he deprived <hi>Iob</hi> of, he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer at the same Instant on Such as <hi>drove</hi> them out of his <hi>Fields.</hi> And thus I hope my <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> is clear from <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 5. Secondly from <hi>Reason</hi> 'twill be as easy to evince it. For if the <hi>Goods</hi> of <hi>this world</hi> were not <hi>suffer'd</hi> by <hi>God</hi> to be disposed of by <hi>the Devil,</hi> our <hi>Leviathan</hi> would have had reason for his <hi>Denial</hi> of any <hi>Difference</hi> 'twixt <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong.</hi> If God <hi>alone</hi> does still dispose of all Possessions under the Sun, (as prosperous Rebels and Usurpers are wont to urge,) and the Devil of none at all by God's permission, <hi>All</hi> things <hi>then</hi> must needs be <hi>right,</hi> except the <hi>Laws</hi> and the <hi>Statutes</hi> which forbid men to steal upon pain of Death. They would not only be <hi>irrational,</hi> but <hi>cruel</hi> things. For why should any man be <hi>censur'd,</hi> (much less certainly should he be <hi>punish't,</hi>) for <hi>taking</hi> That which <hi>God gives</hi> him? Shall not God, without offence, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of things as He <hi>pleaseth?</hi> why then are we so <hi>wicked,</hi> so <hi>void</hi> of all <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> as to prosecute a Man who is call'd <hi>a Thief,</hi> in case he breaks up our Houses, takes our Cash out
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:106235:276"/>
of our Coffers, drives our Cattle out of our Grounds, or carries our Corn out of our Barns, if <hi>God</hi> has made him <hi>His Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> and (by his <hi>absolute Decree,</hi> or by his <hi>All-working Providence,</hi>) <hi>disposed</hi> of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to That man's <hi>use?</hi> Or why did God himself say, <hi>Thou shalt not steal,</hi> if a man can have <hi>nothing,</hi> but what <hi>God gives</hi> him? For whatsoever <hi>God</hi> gives him, becomes his <hi>own.</hi> No <hi>propriety</hi> of <hi>man</hi> can <hi>exclude</hi> that of <hi>God,</hi> or be <hi>equal</hi> to it. And in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances of Title amongst <hi>our selves,</hi> still (we know) a Deed of <hi>Gift,</hi> confers as abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute a <hi>Right,</hi> as a Deed of <hi>Purchase.</hi> If then we may have any thing which by right is not <hi>ours,</hi> we have it certainly from <hi>Satan,</hi> and not from <hi>God.</hi> For one of These Members fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing (that I may make my work short) must needs be granted. Either that Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, and Theft, Extorsion, and Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all sorts of Cousenage, are <hi>names,</hi> and <hi>words,</hi> and <hi>nothing else;</hi> (invented only by Politicians, Ecclesiastical and Civil,) or that if they are <hi>Things,</hi> they are very <hi>Good,</hi> as being derived from <hi>God the Author;</hi> or that God is the Author of what is <hi>morally evil;</hi>
               <pb n="537" facs="tcp:106235:276"/>
or that at least they are the <hi>works,</hi> not of <hi>God,</hi> but of the <hi>Devil.</hi> The First of these cannot be; for then it would follow, That <hi>Theft is no Sin.</hi> Much less the Second; for then it would follow, <hi>that Sin is Good.</hi> Much less the Third; for then it would follow, <hi>that God is Evil.</hi> Each of which being <hi>false,</hi> and <hi>blasphemous</hi> too; 'Tis plain the Fourth, by way of Refuge, must needs be granted, (seeing no fifth Member can either <hi>be,</hi> or be <hi>imagin'd,</hi>) That <hi>All our Robberies and Frauds are not of God, but of the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 6. Now this becomes a sure Medium to prove the Point we have in hand; because the Things of this world (I mean the <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of it) are wont to be bandied up and down, from one Possessor to another, by secret Fraud, or by open Force. How ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>few</hi> (in comparison) are <hi>contented</hi> with the Portion which God has given them? and have no more in their Possession than can be properly call'd <hi>Theirs?</hi> How much is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by daily <hi>cousenage,</hi> in Fairs, or Markets? How much by <hi>filtching,</hi> and <hi>purloyning,</hi> in private Families, and Common Fields? How much by <hi>Bribery,</hi> and <hi>Corruption,</hi> in
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:106235:277"/>
Courts of Justice, (as we call them,) and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction? (I do not mean so much in <hi>This,</hi> as in foreign Kingdoms and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths.) How much by Cutpurses and Cutthroats, in publick Meetings, and High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways? How much by <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>length of Praying,</hi> when Pharisaical Negotiators do pray and preach <hi>for a Pretence,</hi> that they may <hi>swallow down Orphans and Widows Houses?</hi> How much by <hi>Riots</hi> and <hi>Depredations</hi> of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disciplin'd Armies, through <hi>the Spirit which</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>is still working in the Children of Disobedience?</hi> In a word, I am not qualified to name the several ways and methods, by which Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is promoted, and Equity trodden into the Dust. Now whatsoever is <hi>ill-acquired</hi> cannot possibly be our <hi>own,</hi> however call'd by <hi>our Names.</hi> For <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Possession</hi> are many times at such Distance, that they can never once <hi>meet,</hi> or be <hi>reconcil'd.</hi> Yea by how much the nearer <hi>Possession</hi> is, <hi>Right</hi> may stand the farther off. Ill got Possession gives right to <hi>nothing,</hi> unless to <hi>Hell,</hi> and the <hi>Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet;</hi> or to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Restitution. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> got a full <hi>Possession</hi> of <hi>Naboth's Vineyard;</hi> But 'twas by Murder, and Perjury, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borning
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:106235:277"/>
Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> to bear false witness, And so by doing That to Satan which Satan tempted our Saviour to. Things so far from giving him <hi>Right</hi> unto <hi>another</hi> man's Goods, that they betray'd him into a <hi>Forfeiture</hi> of what had otherwise been his <hi>own.</hi> For by a complicated <hi>Treason</hi> against the <hi>Majesty</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> his very <hi>Soul</hi> (as well as <hi>Body</hi>) <hi>became consiscate</hi> to <hi>the Devil.</hi> Indeed it implys a Contradiction, that a man should get <hi>Right,</hi> by doing <hi>Wrong.</hi> There is a Man in the world (says the inspir'd Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi>)<note place="margin">Habak. 2. 6, 7, &amp;c.</note> who does <hi>inlarge his Desire as Hell, and is</hi> as greedy <hi>as the Grave, and cannot be satisfied; But gathereth together all Nations, and heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to himself all People.</hi> But mark what follows. <hi>Woe to him who increaseth what is not</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> 
               <hi>His. Woe to him who coveteth an evil Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>

               <hi>and the Beam out of the Timber shall answer it. Woe to him that buildeth a Town with Blood, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 12.</note> 
               <hi>stablisheth a City by Iniquity.</hi> Now what is the <hi>Reason</hi> of all These Woes, but <hi>that he increaseth what is not His?</hi> If 'tis <hi>His,</hi> let him
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:106235:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shew <hi>how.</hi> Did he <hi>buy</hi> it? or was it <hi>given</hi> him? Or did he <hi>inherit</hi> it by <hi>Nature?</hi> Or was it <hi>so</hi> made over to him, as <hi>Canaan</hi> by God to the <hi>People Israel?</hi> If this later, Let us hear it made good by a <hi>Voice</hi> from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> and that attested too by <hi>Miracle.</hi> So as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did prove the Principle and Power by which They acted. If he cannot do This, <hi>it is not His.</hi> Therefore he hadit <hi>not</hi> from <hi>God;</hi> Therefore he had it from the <hi>Devil.</hi> And thus we have the Proposition made good by <hi>Reason.</hi> Nor by <hi>solitary</hi> Reason, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction <hi>with</hi> Scripture, and grounded <hi>on</hi> it.</p>
            <p>§ 7. Thirdly we may prove it by known <hi>Experience.</hi> By <hi>other</hi> mens Experience, and by our <hi>own.</hi> First by <hi>other</hi> mens Experience, and that attested as well by <hi>Sacred,</hi> as by <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Story. <hi>David</hi> was taught by his Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that Prosperity was <hi>Then</hi> the usual Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ungodly. For so he tells us at large in the Seventy third <hi>Psalm; I was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 73. from v. 3. to v. 14.</note> 
               <hi>at the wicked, I saw the ungodly in such Prosperity. They are in no peril of Death, but are lusty and strong. Their Eyes swell with Fatness, and they do even what they list. They come in no misfortune like other folk, neither</hi>
               <pb n="541" facs="tcp:106235:278"/>
               <hi>are they plagued like other men. Therefore fall the People unto them, and thereout suck they no small advantage. Tush, say they, how shall God see? Is there knowledge in the most High? Loe these are the ungodly, these prosper in the Land, these have Riches in Possession.</hi> But I, on the contrary, <hi>Who have cleansed my heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 12.</note> 
               <hi>and have washed mine hands in Innocence;</hi> I who have lived in the fear of God, and made a conscience of my ways, <hi>All the day long have I been punished, and been chastened</hi>
               <note place="margin">13.</note> 
               <hi>every Morning.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> tells us<note place="margin">Jer. 12. 1, 2, 3.</note> too, from his own Experience, <hi>That the way of the wicked was wont to prosper; and that they who dealt treacherously were happy men. They were planted, took root, they grew, they multiply'd; yet God was not near in their Mouth, and far from their Reins.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi,</hi> after <hi>Him,</hi> had the like Experience, <hi>That the Proud were happy, and the Workers of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>wickedness were set up; yea they who tempted God were even delivered. So as it seem'd</hi> (to the Eye of Flesh) <hi>a very vain thing to serve the Lord.</hi> And the same was observed by the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk.</hi> That <hi>the wicked</hi> (in<note place="margin">Habak. 1. 4, 15, 16.</note> his Time) <hi>did even compass about the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi>

               <hi>they gather'd them in their Net; their Portion was fat, and their Meat plenteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 8. If we pass out of Sacred into Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Story, we may discover the same Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence running through every Age of Man, from the one end unto the other. (Although my little time allow'd will not permit me to exemplifie, unless in here and there one.) That will certifie how <hi>Ninus</hi> first founded Empire in Iniquity. How the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> continued <hi>That.</hi> How the <hi>Medes</hi> and the <hi>Persians</hi> invaded <hi>These.</hi> How <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> usurped <hi>All Greece;</hi> And his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable Son the Eastern Empire. How the <hi>Romans</hi> made All bow down to <hi>Italy.</hi> How the <hi>Goths</hi> and the <hi>Vandals</hi> subdued the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> and ravag'd the greatest part of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,</hi> as far as from <hi>Poland</hi> to <hi>Mauritania.</hi> How <hi>Mahomed the First</hi> subdued the <hi>Saracens,</hi> And Profaneness became possess't of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> How the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire prospers against the Purity of the Gospel, and the Profession of Christianity, and so has done from Age to Age, and that by the <hi>Practice</hi> of all <hi>Impiety.</hi> How very <hi>clear</hi> a thing is it, (a thing of which the <hi>world</hi> is <hi>witness,</hi>) that
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:106235:279"/>

'Tis true, the Devil was permitted <hi>to</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 4. 5, 8.</note> 
               <hi>take</hi> our <hi>Saviour,</hi> not only <hi>once,</hi> but <hi>again;</hi> and to <hi>carry</hi> him whither he <hi>pleas'd</hi> too; as first <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to The City,</hi> and after That <hi>unto The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> But 'tis false to say, our Saviour was <hi>deliver'd</hi> up to Satan by God the Father. Next 'tis but figuratively true, and therefore literally false, That he <hi>gives</hi> the World's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms <hi>to such as serve him.</hi> For being no more than an <hi>Usurper,</hi> and therefore <hi>void</hi> of all <hi>right,</hi> he is not <hi>properly</hi> said to <hi>Give,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>procure</hi> them to all <hi>Usurpers.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 'tis <hi>false</hi> that he procures them <hi>to whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he pleaseth,</hi> (which yet he confidently adds,) for he procures them <hi>no farther,</hi> than God sees good to <hi>permit,</hi> or <hi>suffer.</hi> Last of all he saith <hi>falsly,</hi> That <hi>ALL</hi> the Kingdoms of the World and the Glory of them are so much as <hi>permitted</hi> to his Disposal, (if he

means all at once.) For <hi>God</hi> disposeth of <hi>many</hi> Kingdoms, wherein he suffers not <hi>the Devil</hi> to have the least thing to do. 'Twas <hi>God alone</hi> who gave his People the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> although <hi>the Devil</hi> took it from Them, and helpt to procure it for the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrians.</hi> 'Twas <hi>God alone</hi> who gave <hi>Iob</hi> his <hi>store</hi> of <hi>Cattle,</hi> although <hi>the Devil</hi> prompted his <hi>Labourers,</hi> (the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> and <hi>Sabaeans,</hi>) to take them from him. 'Twas <hi>God alone</hi> who gave <hi>Naboth</hi> a pleasant <hi>Vineyard,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>the Devil</hi> (by God's permission) helpt <hi>Ahab</hi> to it. 'Twas <hi>God alone</hi> who gave a Kingdom, (or rather <hi>Three Kingdoms</hi> which made a <hi>World,</hi>) together with all the <hi>Glory of it,</hi> to our late <hi>Martyr'd Soveraign</hi> of Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Memory, although <hi>the Devil</hi> was <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> (by the <hi>help</hi> of his Tools) to <hi>bereave</hi> him of it. In a word, if it is <hi>true,</hi> what is proverbially asserted, (and upon very good Grounds,) That <hi>half</hi> the World, <hi>at the least,</hi> does live by <hi>cheating</hi> all <hi>the rest,</hi> and by imposing on <hi>one another;</hi> Then is it easy to discern and to state the <hi>Difference,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Right,</hi> and the <hi>Possession</hi> of things on Earth; betwixt the <hi>Blessings,</hi> and the <hi>Curses</hi>
               <pb n="558" facs="tcp:106235:287"/>

            <p>§ 14. Having hitherto shew'd the <hi>Truth</hi>
               <note place="margin">Some Reasons offer'd.</note> of my Proposition, and withal <hi>clear'd</hi> it from the <hi>Objection;</hi> I am next to give the <hi>Reasons,</hi> (at least as many as I can think of, or can fairly conjecture at,) why God is pleas'd, in this World, to indure with so much <hi>patience</hi> so great a <hi>confusion</hi> upon the Earth, and leaves to the Devil so great a <hi>power</hi> in the perverting and debauching the ways of men. For whilst we look at nothing else but what is <hi>present,</hi> and <hi>before</hi> us, we seem to see nothing but <hi>Disorder,</hi> in most Events under the Sun. If none but <hi>good</hi> men did <hi>prosper,</hi> and none but <hi>evil</hi> men <hi>miscarry,</hi> A <hi>method</hi> then would be acknowledg'd, and men would probably be <hi>better</hi> than <hi>now</hi> they are. Of if <hi>all</hi> that are <hi>good</hi> were in <hi>Affliction,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> that are <hi>evil</hi> in <hi>Prosperity,</hi> still there would be some <hi>method,</hi> however men in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability would be very much the <hi>worse</hi> for the knowledge of it. But as now the world goes, There seems to be <hi>no method at all.</hi> Things fall out in such a <hi>blended promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
               <pb n="559" facs="tcp:106235:287"/>
manner. For though the <hi>wicked</hi> are found to prosper a great deal more than the <hi>righteous,</hi> (as has been shew'd,) yet 'tis as clear that many <hi>righteous</hi> do also prosper <hi>with</hi> the <hi>wicked,</hi> and many <hi>wicked</hi> ones, even <hi>here,</hi> are as much afflicted as the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi> In which respect it was said by the Royal Preacher, That <hi>all things come alike</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 2, 3, 11.</note> 
               <hi>to all. There is one event to the wicked, and to the righteous; to the clean, and to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, to him that sacrificeth, and him that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificeth not. As is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an Oath. The Race is not to the swift, nor the Battle to the strong, neither Bread to the Wise, nor Riches to men of Understanding, nor yet Favour to men of Skill, but Time and Chance happeneth to them all.</hi> In so much that some are <hi>tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by the seeming <hi>Confusion</hi> of <hi>Events,</hi> the <hi>Prosperities</hi> of the <hi>worst</hi> men, and the <hi>Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the <hi>Best,</hi> to <hi>distrust</hi> the very <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> yea to <hi>suspect</hi> the very <hi>Iustice,</hi> yea to <hi>deny</hi> the very <hi>Being</hi> of God Himself. They think <hi>they, are born at all adventure,</hi> and that they shall <hi>dye</hi> as they are born. That <hi>their spirits shall vanish into the Air,</hi> and <hi>be as if they</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="560" facs="tcp:106235:288"/>§ 15. Now to preserve our selves from <hi>falling</hi> into the very same <hi>Snare,</hi> let us reflect upon the <hi>Reasons</hi> of this <hi>Confusion,</hi> at which so many are falling headlong into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless Abyss of Eternal Misery. Not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting</hi> upon the <hi>Reasons</hi> in such a measure as they deserve, But rather pointing at the chief <hi>Topicks</hi> from which the <hi>Reasons</hi> are to be <hi>fetch't.</hi> One chief Reason is to be taken from the natural <hi>Freedom</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very rational Agent which is subjected to a <hi>Law,</hi> and by consequence made worthy ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Punishment</hi> or <hi>Reward.</hi> God's way of <hi>working</hi> upon the <hi>Will</hi> is exactly <hi>suitable</hi> to its <hi>Nature,</hi> and therefore agreeable to its <hi>Freedom;</hi> tending to <hi>rectifie,</hi> but not <hi>destroy</hi> it; and by consequence to <hi>incline,</hi> but not <hi>compell</hi> it. Were <hi>All</hi> the workings of the Almighty in full proportion to his <hi>Almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and therefore always, on all occasions, as <hi>irresistible,</hi> as they are <hi>Good,</hi> I cannot see how it were <hi>possible</hi> for any Creature to do <hi>amiss;</hi> or how an <hi>Action</hi> could be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, than <hi>God</hi> would <hi>have</hi> it. Nor can I see how 'twould be possible to give a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reason, why <hi>several</hi> men at the <hi>same time,</hi>
               <pb n="561" facs="tcp:106235:288" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the <hi>same</hi> men at <hi>several</hi> times, are either <hi>better,</hi> or <hi>worse,</hi> than <hi>Themselves,</hi> or <hi>others.</hi> Why <hi>Iohn</hi> was better than <hi>Iudas,</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> better than <hi>Himself.</hi> Better (I mean) when he <hi>asserted,</hi> than when he <hi>persecuted</hi> the Church. It follows therefore that the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of God's Impression upon <hi>the Will</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>cogent,</hi> and <hi>irresistible,</hi> but so <hi>congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> rather and <hi>suitable,</hi> as still to let it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main <hi>a Will.</hi> And therefore he works upon it otherwise, than he works upon <hi>irrational</hi> and <hi>sensless</hi> Creatures; to wit by <hi>Promises,</hi> and <hi>Threats,</hi> by <hi>Exhortations,</hi> and <hi>Praecepts,</hi> and these in conjunction with a competent measure of his <hi>Grace;</hi> which Agents <hi>natural,</hi> and <hi>involuntary</hi> (such as Vegetables, and Brutes,) are not susceptible of. Now God <hi>determin'd</hi> from all Eternity <hi>not to hinder</hi> from being <hi>done,</hi> what he eternally <hi>foreknew</hi> the <hi>congruous means</hi> I now mention'd would not prevail with <hi>wilful Creatures,</hi> so as to <hi>hinder</hi> them from <hi>doing.</hi> For why should <hi>He</hi> by his <hi>Omnipotence</hi> controul the <hi>Wills</hi> of those Creatures, whom both his <hi>Promises,</hi> and his <hi>Threats,</hi> his <hi>Miracles,</hi> and his <hi>Laws,</hi> and a <hi>competent</hi> measure of his <hi>Grace,</hi> have been
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:106235:289" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so <hi>thanklesly</hi> and <hi>vainly</hi> bestow'd upon? When he cannot restrain our <hi>Wills</hi> by means <hi>agreeable</hi> to our <hi>Natures,</hi> or by any <hi>lesser</hi> means than what are <hi>destructive</hi> to our <hi>Wills,</hi> and by consequence to our <hi>Natures,</hi> (which he eternally <hi>determined</hi> he would <hi>not violate,</hi>) How very <hi>justly</hi> must he needs <hi>suffer</hi> the <hi>worst</hi> of <hi>Actions,</hi> which withal he does <hi>direct</hi> to the <hi>best</hi> of <hi>Ends?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 16. Another Reason is to be taken from the <hi>corrigible</hi> Condition of <hi>some Evil Doers,</hi> whom God is pleased to bless and prosper with many Temporal Injoyments, thereby to <hi>mollifie,</hi> and <hi>indear,</hi> and as it were <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> them with so much kindness. A great deal of Love and Longanimity will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to <hi>melt</hi> the Heart of the <hi>hardest</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, if there is <hi>any Wax</hi> left in his Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; if there is <hi>any good nature</hi> abiding in him. And such was the Method touching which St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans; Despisest thou the Riches of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Forbearance and Long-suffering, not knowing that the Goodness of God leadeth thee to Repentance?</hi> When God is pleas'd to plant<note place="margin">Isa. 5. 2, 4.</note> his <hi>Vineyard</hi> upon a very <hi>fruitful Hill,</hi> to
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:106235:289"/>
make a strong <hi>fence about it,</hi> to <hi>gather out the stones,</hi> to <hi>build a Tower in the midst,</hi> and to <hi>make a Wine-press,</hi> what can he mean but to <hi>ingage</hi> it, to yield him <hi>Grapes</hi> in <hi>proportion</hi> to all his <hi>Culture?</hi> And he appeals to the Inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem and Iudah,</hi> whether more could be done than he had done unto his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> what could he signifie but his Indeavours, <hi>to overcome evil with doing good?</hi> Thus God draws near to <hi>us</hi> in <hi>Mercies,</hi> that we may also draw near to <hi>Him,</hi> in the <hi>Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of our Lives and our Conversations.</p>
            <p>§ 17. A Third Reason is to be taken from the <hi>Incorrigible</hi> Condition of <hi>another</hi> sort of Evil Doers, whom God is <hi>pleas'd</hi> to <hi>give over,</hi> as Physicians use to do their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate</hi> Patients. They being a sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are <hi>in love</hi> with their Diseases, and cannot <hi>indure</hi> to be reform'd, and therefore <hi>kick</hi> at the means of Cure. God leaves such as <hi>these</hi> to their own Hearts Lust, and lets them <hi>wallow</hi> (like so many <hi>Swine</hi>) in the <hi>Mire</hi> of Temporal Felicities. For as Those very Swine are ever suffer'd to <hi>fare</hi> the <hi>best,</hi> that is, to injoy the <hi>richest feeding,</hi> which are most of all designed for <hi>Sale</hi> and <hi>Slaughter;</hi> so
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:106235:290"/>
God indures with much long-suffering the Vessels of Wrath, to <hi>wax fat</hi> with all their Contentments and Sensualities, because by such their Injoyments they fit themselves for <hi>Destruction.</hi> To allow them the <hi>benefit</hi> of his <hi>Rod,</hi> were to deal with them as <hi>Sons;</hi> which why should he do, whilst they only deal with him as <hi>rebellious Servants?</hi> Suppose our <hi>Sheep</hi> and our <hi>Oxen</hi> were able to <hi>reason</hi> amongst themselves, and understood the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>End</hi> for which they are turn'd into their <hi>Pastures,</hi> would they not <hi>macerate</hi> their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and bring their Flesh into <hi>Subjection,</hi> by a great deal of <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Self-denial,</hi> and be <hi>afraid</hi> of faring well, at least in this consideration, that the <hi>fatter</hi> they grow, they grow the fitter for the <hi>Shambles,</hi> and that the <hi>leaner</hi> they are, they are suffer'd to <hi>live</hi> so much the <hi>longer?</hi> Much the same is <hi>Their</hi> Case, who <hi>defile themselves as brute Beasts,</hi> (to use the Comparison of St. <hi>Iude.</hi>) A Comparison <hi>not odious,</hi> because 'tis made by the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> who saith of Them that are permitted to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>prosper</hi> in their <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties,</hi> That <hi>they are</hi>

               <note place="margin">Chap. 1. vers. 5.</note> 
               <hi>ye will revolt more and more.</hi> Why should I cast away my kindness in Chastising you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer, when ye still grow the worse by all that is done to make you better? <hi>In vain have I smitten your Children; they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 30.</note> 
               <hi>no Correction.</hi> From all which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we may infer, That God is never so angry, as when he leaves the Reins loose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Neck</hi> of a <hi>Brutish People.</hi> When he lets them grow wealthy to their <hi>undoing,</hi> and <hi>ruin</hi> themselves with their Injoyments. When he permits them to be as <hi>happy</hi> as the <hi>Devil</hi> himself would <hi>have</hi> them; to have as much of this World, as the Serpent is able to
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:106235:291"/>
tempt them with. What <hi>Solomon</hi> saith of a <hi>Temporal</hi> Father, [<hi>He that spareth his Rod, hateth his Child,</hi>] is often true of the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;</hi> who intends to <hi>disinherit</hi> those Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible Children, whom he does not in <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> vouchsafe to <hi>strike.</hi> And in consequence of This,</p>
            <p>§ 18. A Fourth Reason is to be taken from the obligingness of the <hi>Severity</hi> of the Heavenly <hi>Father</hi> towards his <hi>Children,</hi> whom he <hi>disciplines</hi> in <hi>This</hi> World, that he may not <hi>condemn</hi> them in the <hi>Next. For whom he</hi>

               <hi>loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every Son whom he receiveth. We have had Fathers of our Flesh who corrected us, and we gave them Reverence,</hi> (saith the same Holy Author of<note place="margin">Verse 9, &amp; 10.</note> the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>) though <hi>they</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised us <hi>for their pleasure.</hi> Whereas <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits</hi> does only chastise us <hi>for our profit:</hi> And for our profit <hi>many ways;</hi> To wit for the exercise of our <hi>Faith;</hi> for the proof of our <hi>Patience;</hi> for the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our <hi>Humility;</hi> for the begetting in all our Hearts both a <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>This</hi> World, and a <hi>Desire</hi> of That <hi>to come;</hi> for the convincing us of his <hi>Iustice,</hi> which is so
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:106235:291"/>
far from <hi>partiality,</hi> that he does hate and punish Sin where e're he finds it, as well in his <hi>Friends,</hi> as in his <hi>Enemies.</hi> As he causeth the <hi>Sun</hi> to <hi>shine,</hi> so he lays his <hi>Rod</hi> too, <hi>both on the just and the unjust.</hi> For even they that are <hi>poenitent</hi> do feel its smart for a <hi>Time</hi> And They that abide in their <hi>Impoenitence,</hi> shall feel it infinitely more to all <hi>Eternity</hi> Again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He <hi>chastiseth</hi> us for our <hi>Profit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause for the <hi>hight'ning</hi> of our <hi>Reward;</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in This <hi>present</hi> life; perhaps in That which is <hi>to come;</hi> perhaps in <hi>This</hi> and <hi>That</hi> too.

<pb n="572" facs="tcp:106235:294"/>
of the seeming Disorder and Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the promiscuous Distribution of all Possessions under the Sun, There may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reasons given by considering men, and there are doubtless many others which are known to <hi>God only:</hi> and which cannot be better collected than from the Example of our Saviour, on whom the Devil and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments were permitted to have so great a Power.

Even for quite <hi>other reasons</hi> than <hi>They</hi> were able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and for <hi>contrary ends</hi> to what <hi>They</hi> were led by: To wit, the Satisfying his <hi>Iustice;</hi> the Exhibition of his <hi>Mercy;</hi> the Declaration of his <hi>Wisdom;</hi> the Manifestation of his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness;</hi> the Illustration of his <hi>Power;</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of his <hi>Glory;</hi> And (as worthily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to each of These,) the <hi>Reformation</hi> and the <hi>Safety</hi> of all our <hi>Souls.</hi> All which if we compare with the <hi>five Reasons</hi> going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we shall not wonder at the Truth of This Proposition, <hi>That all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of them,</hi> (at least successively, though not at once,) <hi>are by God's</hi>

            <p>§ 21. After the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Reason,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> let us observe the special <hi>Uses</hi> which may be made of his Doctrin. First it teacheth us how to value the <hi>beggarly Greatness</hi> of this World. Over-value it we <hi>may,</hi> and very commonly we do too; but undervalue it we <hi>cannot,</hi> do what we can. For what more <hi>despicable</hi> than <hi>That,</hi> which the <hi>Devil</hi> can both <hi>procure,</hi> and <hi>deprive</hi> us of? What more <hi>worthy</hi> of our <hi>Contempt,</hi> than what is <hi>so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued</hi> by Him that made it, as by Him to be often <hi>left</hi> in the <hi>Devil's Power</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal?</hi> The Devil can <hi>give</hi> us great Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, just as he <hi>gave</hi> them to the <hi>Chaldae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> And can <hi>take them away,</hi> as he did from <hi>Iob.</hi> For both which reasons we ought to <hi>scorn</hi> them, and to behave our selves towards them as things <hi>below</hi> us; fit for nothing but to be matter, whereby to <hi>exercise</hi> a <hi>Bounty</hi> to such as <hi>want</hi> them.</p>
            <p>First (I say) 'tis a <hi>disparagement</hi> to the <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of the World, that they are left so much by God in the <hi>Devil's Power,</hi>
               <pb n="574" facs="tcp:106235:295"/>
that <hi>Satan</hi> is suffer'd to bestow them on such as <hi>serve</hi> him. For the Gifts of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil are never <hi>Good,</hi> nor consistent with <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in such as have them. They are disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and dangerous, and Hostages gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Destruction. The Devil can give <hi>Riches,</hi> (in the sense before mention'd,) but not <hi>Contentment,</hi> and <hi>a right use,</hi> which are the ends for which we crave them. And for want of which ends, they increase our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. For as, when the <hi>Body</hi> of man is <hi>Aguish,</hi> no Addition of <hi>Clothes</hi> can make him <hi>warm;</hi> So when the <hi>Soul</hi> of man is <hi>vitious,</hi> no Addition of <hi>Treasure</hi> can make him <hi>rich.</hi> The reason of which Paradox may thus be illustrated, and clear'd. We know that though the <hi>Clothes</hi> defend the Body from <hi>outward Cold,</hi> yet 'tis the Body's <hi>inward Heat</hi> which does <hi>warm</hi> the <hi>Clothes:</hi> For else a Coffin and a Coverlid would warm a man when he is dead. Which being evidently impossible, 'Tis plain that the Body must warm the Clothes, before the Clothes can warm the Body. And thence a <hi>Child</hi> is much warmer in a very <hi>thin Suit,</hi> than his old decrepit <hi>Father</hi> when wrapt about with
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:106235:295"/>
a <hi>Wardrope.</hi> In like manner 'tis the <hi>Soul</hi> which makes the <hi>Possession</hi> become <hi>sufficient,</hi> not at all the <hi>Possession</hi> which gives <hi>content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> unto the <hi>Soul.</hi> And as the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to cure the <hi>cold Access</hi> of an <hi>Ague,</hi> is to <hi>cleanse</hi> the Body from peccant humours, not to bring it to a great <hi>Fire;</hi> so the way to be <hi>happy</hi> as well as full, is to <hi>purge</hi> an over pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate and sickly <hi>Soul,</hi> not to rake up a great <hi>Estate.</hi> There are indeed who have <hi>Abundance</hi> in conjunction with <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> But 'tis clear their Satisfaction does not arise from <hi>That</hi> Abundance. For if Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could grow from Plenty, The Man of <hi>Macedon</hi> had been satisfied in his <hi>Acquist</hi> of all <hi>Asia;</hi> and had not <hi>wept</hi> for <hi>another World.</hi> Nor would They who at first do take up Arms for <hi>meer Liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> continue the keeping of them up for <hi>meer Dominion,</hi> (when they have got their <hi>own</hi> Liberty, they would not take it from <hi>other men.</hi>) From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That no man living is <hi>contented,</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because he has <hi>enough,</hi> But that many men have <hi>enough,</hi> meerly because they are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</hi> And as a man in a <hi>Boat,</hi> when he would pull the <hi>Bank</hi> to him, finds it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:106235:296"/>
for him to do it, but by pulling <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> upon the <hi>Bank;</hi> so the only way possible to fit our <hi>Condition</hi> to our <hi>minds,</hi> is by bringing our <hi>minds</hi> to our <hi>Condition.</hi> For if a man shall inlarge his Desires as Hell, and is as greedy as the Grave, All the Possessions in the World will not fill one of his <hi>Eyes.</hi> 'Twas very shrewdly said by <hi>Socrates</hi> to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaus,</hi>

               <hi>then</hi> they <hi>disprofit in extremity,</hi> because they <hi>purchase</hi> for their <hi>Owners</hi> a place in <hi>Hell.</hi> So little reason have we to <hi>boast,</hi> that we abound in those things, which <hi>the Devil</hi> (by God's Sufferance) can help us to, who neither <hi>can</hi> nor <hi>will</hi> help us, to use them wisely to our Advantage.</p>
            <p>Much <hi>less</hi> reason have we to <hi>boast,</hi> in what the <hi>Devil</hi> can <hi>take away</hi> too; in being <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants at Will</hi> to so vile a <hi>Landlord.</hi> There is nothing more usual with <hi>the Prince of this World,</hi> than to set <hi>Pilate</hi> against <hi>Herod,</hi> as well as <hi>Both</hi> against <hi>Christ.</hi> He employs <hi>one</hi> Robber in offering violence to <hi>another.</hi> And who would care for those Riches which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make him the Devil's <hi>Sumpter?</hi> Can we think it a noble thing, to be <hi>laden</hi> with <hi>thick Clay</hi> at the Devil's <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and again <hi>unla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> at his <hi>Command?</hi> To have Wealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd on us by <hi>our</hi> Complyance with the Tempter, and taken from us by <hi>other men's?</hi> 'Twas wisely done of <hi>Aristippus,</hi> the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Socrat.

of his <hi>Philosophy,</hi> That <hi>Inaccessible</hi> Treasure which was <hi>within</hi> him; who yet would be the <hi>sole Masters</hi> of all his <hi>Wealth,</hi> those <hi>obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Possessions which were <hi>without</hi> him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which Advice of <hi>Aristippus</hi> was much like That of our Lord himself, <hi>Lay not up for your selves Treasure on Earth, where</hi> Plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and <hi>Thieves break through and steal.</hi> From whence 'tis obvious to collect, that we are not so much obliged to Them who <hi>give</hi> us <hi>our</hi> Estates, as to Them who do <hi>teach</hi> us to <hi>use</hi> them safely. The <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Agents,</hi> are often permitted to do the <hi>former;</hi> But <hi>God alone,</hi> and his <hi>Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,</hi> will oblige us so far as to do the <hi>later.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 22. Secondly let us consider, That since we find <hi>God Himself</hi> bestowing Riches upon <hi>some,</hi> as upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> or whosoever has a <hi>right</hi> to the several things which he possesseth; whilst <hi>the Devil</hi> gives to <hi>others,</hi> (by God's Permission) as to the <hi>Sabaeans,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> who plunder'd <hi>Iob</hi> of his Substance; to <hi>Achan,</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> or whosoever has <hi>Possession</hi> without a right; It concerns us to <hi>examin</hi> the exact <hi>Derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of our Estates; and to have it well stated,
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:106235:297"/>
whether we receive them from <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi> For if <hi>honestly</hi> acquir'd, and so from <hi>God,</hi> (by his Appointment, and Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) Then we may honestly <hi>injoy</hi> them, to the <hi>Glory</hi> of God, and our private <hi>Comfort.</hi> Always bearing This in mind, That we are but God's <hi>Almoners,</hi> or <hi>Usufructuaries;</hi> and must dispense to His Members who is <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary in chief.</hi> But if <hi>dishonestly</hi> attain'd to, and so from <hi>Satan,</hi> (by God's <hi>permission</hi> only, and <hi>sufferance,</hi>) we cannot honestly <hi>possess,</hi> much less <hi>injoy</hi> them, and therefore ought to do <hi>neither</hi> to God's <hi>Dishonour,</hi> and our <hi>Damnation.</hi> But as our Saviour hath said of the <hi>Eye,</hi> and <hi>Hand,</hi> That if at any time they offend us, we must <hi>pluck out</hi> the one, and <hi>cut off</hi> the other; so must we say of our <hi>Possessions,</hi> That if they <hi>offend</hi> us in the like sense, by making us <hi>stumble into Sin,</hi> we must <hi>pluck them</hi> out of our Treasury, (like the Emperour <hi>Sigismund,</hi>) and (like <hi>Him</hi> too) <hi>cast them from us;</hi> because 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us to <hi>enter</hi> as Poor as <hi>Lazarus</hi> into <hi>Heaven,</hi> than remaining Rich as <hi>Dives,</hi> to be cast into <hi>Hell.</hi> Always keeping This in memory, That Ill-gotten Goods may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase

               <hi>matter</hi> for Repentance, But <hi>Repentance it self</hi> they can never purchase.</p>
            <p>§ 23. Thirdly let us consider, That if <hi>the Devil</hi> himself is suffer'd to have <hi>more</hi> of This world at his Devotion and Disposal, than The Great <hi>Cham,</hi> or the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> or whosoever of earthly Potentates is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily thought to be the <hi>Greatest;</hi> Then are our <hi>Shares</hi> of this world the things the <hi>most</hi> to be <hi>suspected,</hi> and of which we should <hi>least</hi> be <hi>proud.</hi> Nor should we rashly take it for granted, that they are evermore the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings</hi> and <hi>Gifts</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> because we learn by sad <hi>Experience,</hi> that they are many times the <hi>Curses</hi> and <hi>Snares</hi> of <hi>Satan.</hi> If to have <hi>Riches</hi> in <hi>Possession</hi> were still a <hi>sign</hi> of God's <hi>Favour;</hi> This great Absurdity would follow, That <hi>the Devil</hi> himself would be God's <hi>chief Favorite.</hi> The Apostle's Rule is, <hi>That whom</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> 
               <hi>he loveth he chasteneth;</hi> not that whom he <hi>loveth,</hi> he maketh <hi>Rich.</hi> That He <hi>scourgeth every Son whom he receiveth;</hi> not that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one whom he <hi>receiveth,</hi> he makes to <hi>wallow</hi> in <hi>Prosperity.</hi> And 'twas a thing so very rare, when Times were better than now they are, to see the same man both <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Prosperous,</hi>
               <pb n="581" facs="tcp:106235:298"/>

               <hi>And what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinances? and that we have walked mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully before the Lord of Hosts? when the Proud are happy, and the Workers of wickedness are set up?</hi> Nor was it otherwise in the Days of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy; They are waxen fat,</hi>

               <hi>they shine, They overpass the Deeds of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; They judge not the Cause of the Fatherless, yet They prosper.</hi> See and consider how the Devil inrich't and prosper'd those <hi>Idolaters,</hi> whom he made <hi>to burn Incense unto the Moon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 44. 17, 18, 19.</note> which they commonly then called <hi>The Queen of Heaven,</hi> in the Four and fourtieth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Ieremy.</hi> Whilst they <hi>committed</hi> That Idol-worship, [Their women lying with strange men in their Husbands Presence, <hi>v.</hi> 19.] <hi>All was well with them, they saw no evil.</hi> But when they <hi>ceased</hi> from that Idolatry, <hi>they were consumed with Sword and Famin,</hi> (v. 18.)

Now having evidenced the <hi>Truth</hi> of my second Doctrin, (with greater care of <hi>Perspicuity,</hi> than of <hi>not</hi> being <hi>tedious,</hi>) both from Scripture, from Reason, and from Experience; from <hi>Aphorisms</hi> of Scripture, and from Scriptural <hi>Examples;</hi> from <hi>Solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>

            </p>
            <p>§ 2. Hereupon we are to argue <hi>à minori ad majus.</hi> If the best <hi>Mens</hi> Gifts are so Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, what then are <hi>Satan's,</hi> who (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:106235:302"/>
that He has not a <hi>right</hi> to give,) does sell his Gifts for Mens <hi>Souls?</hi> Things so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely precious, that <hi>Christ Himself</hi> could not <hi>buy</hi> them, but with his <hi>Blood.</hi> When our Souls were to be <hi>purchas't</hi> from Sin and Hell, the Son of God being Incarnate could not have given <hi>enough</hi> for them, if He had not vouchsafed to <hi>give Himself.</hi> Now 'tis the <hi>Avarice</hi> of Satan, (and his <hi>Ambition</hi> at the same instant,) to <hi>buy</hi> our Souls back un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sin and Misery, although he <hi>bids</hi> no more for them, than the pitiful Allectives of <hi>Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Greatness; The Kingdoms of the Earth, and the Glory of them.</hi> And well it were, if it were no worse. For, besides that he offers a great deal more than he <hi>can give,</hi> (he being ever God's <hi>Pris'ner,</hi> as hath been shewn,) the saddest part of it is, that however <hi>his biddings</hi> are on the <hi>Earth,</hi> his general <hi>Payments</hi> are still in <hi>Hell.</hi> All his Gifts do still flow from his Desire of such Gain. He reacheth his <hi>offers</hi> to us with <hi>one</hi> hand, that he may <hi>plunder</hi> us with the <hi>other.</hi> His liberality to <hi>us,</hi> is like the Fisherman's to the <hi>River;</hi> who in Case he does cast in a worthless <hi>Fly,</hi> 'tis that the
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:106235:303"/>
River may requite Him with some good <hi>Fish.</hi> When Satan offers us any favours, we must immediately consider he is but <hi>Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> after our <hi>Souls.</hi> He baits his <hi>Hook</hi> with <hi>worldly Greatness,</hi> that whilst we <hi>catch</hi> at the <hi>one,</hi> we may be <hi>caught</hi> with the other; and, like silly Fishes indeed, may greedily <hi>swallow</hi> our own <hi>Destruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. Thus the Things which we call the Gifts of Satan, we find by experience we do but <hi>call</hi> so. They are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Gifts and no Gifts. Munera inescata, Baits of Bounty.</hi> Such a <hi>Condition</hi> is interpos'd betwixt the <hi>Proffer,</hi> and the <hi>Performance,</hi> as makes the Donative far worse than <hi>Nothing. His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> does evacuate and null his <hi>Offer.</hi> For what he said unto our <hi>Saviour,</hi> (without a Proxy,) he saith (by his <hi>Instruments</hi>) to each of <hi>us, All these things will I give thee, if falling down thou wilt worship me.</hi> Which is as much as to say, all shall be thine with this Proviso, that thou wilt take a sure Course to be <hi>no whit the better,</hi> but much the <hi>worse</hi> for their Injoyment. Thou shalt be <hi>Rich</hi> at this present, if for the future thou wilt be <hi>ruin'd.</hi> Thou shalt have all the World at
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:106235:303"/>
will, but thou shalt have it upon Condition, that thou turn <hi>Idolater,</hi> and <hi>be damn'd.</hi> And what is this better than to say, I will give Thee very <hi>freely</hi> a great Estate, upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thou wilt <hi>pay</hi> me a thousand times <hi>more</hi> than <hi>it is worth,</hi> and also make thy self <hi>inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> of its <hi>Injoyment.</hi> I will shew thee the ready way, not to <hi>Liberty</hi> only, but <hi>Empire,</hi> upon Condition thou wilt <hi>serve</hi> me, and be a <hi>Slave.</hi> I will lift thee <hi>up,</hi> if thou wilt cast thy self <hi>down.</hi> Thus does the Devil speak Contradictions; And the <hi>Proviso</hi> with which he <hi>proffers</hi> does make the proffer of <hi>none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> Like those Beasts in the Apologue, which offer'd the Lyon to be their <hi>King,</hi> if he would but permit them to cut his <hi>Claws.</hi> They would admit Him to <hi>Reign,</hi> and to <hi>triumph</hi> over them, if he would do them the favour to <hi>disable</hi> himself for the Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus the Devil either presents us with empty <hi>Proffers</hi> rather than <hi>Gifts,</hi> with flattering <hi>Hopes,</hi> not true <hi>Possessions;</hi> or if He really indows us, he does it only to our undoing. If he helps us to Wit, 'tis that we may wickedly lay it out in speaking <hi>jest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 4. 9.</note> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and merrily <hi>drolling</hi> upon
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:106235:304"/>
               <hi>Religion</hi> to make Men <hi>laugh.</hi> If he helps us to <hi>Beauty,</hi> it is to raise up <hi>Self-love;</hi> that we may use it, like wanton <hi>Iezebel,</hi> for a Snare, and a Temptation, and that to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers most <hi>foolish and hurtful Lusts, which drown the Soul in Misery and Perdition.</hi> If to <hi>Secular Greatness,</hi> it is to betray us to <hi>Self-Relyance;</hi> and break our <hi>Necks</hi> from that <hi>Ladder</hi> by which we <hi>mounted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> If he helps us with <hi>Mony</hi> by any means, it is but just as <hi>old Gamesters</hi> do lend their cash to <hi>young Heirs,</hi> that they may <hi>lose</hi> it with them <hi>at play.</hi> Or as <hi>Harlots</hi> lend Mony unto their prodigal <hi>Gallants,</hi> that when they have <hi>spent</hi> it upon their <hi>Lusts,</hi> They with whom they have spent it, may <hi>Sue the Bond.</hi> Or as some supply <hi>Madmen</hi> with <hi>Knives</hi> and <hi>Halters,</hi> that either they may <hi>strangle,</hi> or <hi>stab</hi> themselves. How <hi>sweet</hi> soever the Gifts of Satan may seem to be at the <hi>beginning,</hi> yet their <hi>end</hi> and <hi>design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is still as <hi>bitter</hi> as <hi>Destruction.</hi> When he carried up our Saviour unto a <hi>Pinnacle of the Temple,</hi> (an high Preferment,) <hi>v.</hi> 5. it was to this end, that he might <hi>cast himself head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 6.)

end, that he might presently <hi>fall down,</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 9.) Just as when an <hi>Eagle</hi> has found an <hi>Oyster,</hi> he takes it up into the <hi>Clouds,</hi> that he may give it by so much the <hi>greater fall,</hi> and that by breaking the <hi>Shell,</hi> he may eat the <hi>Fish.</hi> In a word, we may resemble the <hi>Gifts</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> to the monstrous <hi>Locusts</hi> from out <hi>the bottomless Pit;</hi> which though<note place="margin">Rev. 9. 2, 7, 8, 18.</note> they had on their <hi>Heads</hi> (as it were) <hi>Crowns of Gold,</hi> and <hi>Faces</hi> like <hi>those of Men,</hi> and goodly <hi>Hair</hi> like <hi>that of Women,</hi> yet their <hi>Teeth</hi> all the while were as the <hi>Teeth of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>the Stings in their Tails</hi> like <hi>those of Scorpions.</hi>

<pb n="594" facs="tcp:106235:305"/>
were not true and real <hi>Givers</hi> of their Thirty pieces of Silver, but only parted with them to <hi>Iudas</hi> to <hi>buy</hi> his <hi>Loyalty;</hi> that having once sold <hi>That,</hi> he might sell his <hi>Lord</hi> too. Again, after this, <hi>they gave large</hi>

            <p>§ 6. Again we learn from this Doctrin, to <hi>suspect</hi> our <hi>own</hi> Treasures, as well as to be <hi>spotless</hi> from <hi>other mens.</hi> For Satan tempts us to <hi>Idolize</hi> him, as well by making us <hi>abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi>

But to <hi>sacrifice</hi> our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and to <hi>devote</hi> our <hi>Affections</hi> to what we have, is flatly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Idolize</hi> it. To bestow the very Riches which God hath given us, upon our <hi>Coffers,</hi> by <hi>Avarice,</hi> or on our <hi>Pride,</hi> by <hi>Prodigality,</hi> (which is another kind of Avarice, to wit a <hi>coveting</hi> of <hi>Fame,</hi>) is neither better, nor worse, than to <hi>fall down</hi> to them, and <hi>worship</hi> them. All the wickedness in the World does seem to have enter'd at these Three Doors,
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:106235:308"/>
               <hi>Beauty, Riches,</hi> and <hi>Reputation.</hi> The first of which does give Fodder to the <hi>Lust of the Flesh,</hi> as does the second to <hi>the Lust of the Eye,</hi> and the third to <hi>the Pride of Life.</hi> Now what Danger soever there is in <hi>Beauty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> will be found to be in <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Reputation.</hi> They are <hi>Idols</hi> all Three, very eminently great; But <hi>Riches,</hi> if either, are much the <hi>greatest. Te facimus Fortuna Deam,</hi> was said by the Poet <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Greatest For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes have <hi>more Adorers,</hi> than the greatest Beauties in all the World. Besides that <hi>Those</hi> are the most <hi>constant,</hi> as well as the <hi>fondest,</hi> and the most <hi>passionate.</hi> And 'tis a rational Conjecture, that there is more sleep broken for <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Riches,</hi> in a <hi>year,</hi> than there is in many <hi>Ages,</hi> for <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Beauty.</hi> We may judge by <hi>one Sigismund</hi> how it fares with <hi>all worldlings.</hi> When the worldly man should <hi>sleep,</hi> he will be thinking upon his <hi>Treasure;</hi> But when he should <hi>pray,</hi> he will fall <hi>asleep.</hi> And which is likeliest to be his Deity? That <hi>God of Heaven,</hi> on whom he cannot <hi>think</hi> for <hi>sleeping,</hi> or That <hi>white and red Earth,</hi> for his <hi>thinking</hi> upon which he can <hi>seldom sleep?</hi> We see how <hi>Avarice</hi> is <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
               <pb n="601" facs="tcp:106235:308"/>
and so a spiritual <hi>Fornication,</hi> and so an absolute <hi>Divorce</hi> of our Souls from God. Nor can the Sin of <hi>Prodigality</hi> be one whit less, as being a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to the <hi>Lust</hi> of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> perhaps to <hi>many</hi> of those Lusts, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to <hi>all.</hi> And look how many <hi>Lusts</hi> he trys to <hi>satisfie,</hi> so many <hi>Idols</hi> he does <hi>adore.</hi> Admit the <hi>Prodigal</hi> spends nothing but what is properly his <hi>own,</hi> and does some Good with it by accident; yet it is <hi>but by accident</hi> that good is done; for which not <hi>He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> but his <hi>Ambition</hi> is to be thank't. Let the man be what he will who abounds in Riches, whether a <hi>Prodigal,</hi> or a <hi>Niggard,</hi> or <hi>hardly Either,</hi> they are apt to ingender a flat <hi>forgetfulness of God,</hi> (as before I noted,) which in <hi>Iesurun,</hi> and <hi>Nabal,</hi> and in <hi>David himself</hi> may be clearly seen. The first, <hi>wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fat,</hi> did even <hi>kick</hi> against his Maker. When the second was <hi>drunk,</hi> he valued not <hi>God,</hi> any more than <hi>David.</hi> The third has humbly recorded his own <hi>Experience, Psal.</hi> 30. 6, 7. And also That of the <hi>Generality</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s own <hi>People: Psal.</hi> 78. from <hi>v.</hi> 24. to <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>When God rain'd Manna, and sent them meat to the full, and gave them all that they</hi>

               <hi>desir'd, Then</hi> (saith he) <hi>they were not estrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their Lusts.</hi> But <hi>when he slew them, they sought him, and inquired early after God. Then they remembred that God was their strength, and that the high God was their Redeemer.</hi> So that <hi>Prosperity</hi> was the thing which made them <hi>forgetful</hi> of their God, and heavy <hi>Affliction</hi> was the Instrument which brought him back to their <hi>Remembrance.</hi> When <hi>Riches</hi> do interpose between <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Soul,</hi> they are apt to <hi>intercept</hi> the Attractive Vertue, whereby God is wont to <hi>draw</hi> the Soul unto Himself; As an <hi>Adamant</hi> interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning between the <hi>Iron</hi> and the <hi>Loadstone,</hi> does intercept the <hi>magnetique</hi> force, wherewith the <hi>Loadstone</hi> allures the <hi>Iron.</hi> But as, if we take away the <hi>Adamant,</hi> the <hi>Iron</hi> will <hi>leap</hi> unto the <hi>Loadstone;</hi> so take away <hi>Riches</hi> (as in the abovenam'd Experiment;) and the <hi>Soul</hi> will be the apter to <hi>fly</hi> towards <hi>God.</hi> It is so natural for Mortals to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Prosperity, that it extorted from <hi>Moses</hi> an extraordinary <hi>Caveat,</hi> before he<note place="margin">Deut. 8. 10. to <hi>v.</hi> 18.</note> thought he could with safety admit the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> to taste of the Sweets of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Now if Prosperity is so dangerous, even

when <hi>God Himself</hi> gives it, how great a <hi>Curse</hi> must it be, when the Gift of <hi>Satan?</hi> If Riches <hi>honestly</hi> gotten are such a <hi>Clog</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul, as does oftentimes hinder her <hi>flight</hi> to Heaven; How shall she hope to <hi>mount</hi> thither, when both her <hi>Wings</hi> and her<note place="margin">Vide Plotin.

And too much <hi>Ease</hi> to which it tempts us is wont to prove a <hi>sadder Curse,</hi> than what at first was denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by God to <hi>Adam, That in the sweat of his Brows he should eat his Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 7. Again we learn from this Doctrin, as to <hi>suspect</hi> our own Treasures when <hi>present</hi> with us, so not to <hi>seek</hi> them being <hi>absent</hi> with too much fervour. For the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. 3. 26.</note> tells us, that <hi>He who seeketh Danger shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in it.</hi> And that <hi>Riches</hi> are <hi>Dangers,</hi> has not only already been made apparent, but may be farther made clear by our common <hi>Experience</hi> of its <hi>Effects.</hi> For notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are <hi>some</hi> who do <hi>make themselves Friends with the unrighteous Mammon,</hi> (that is, by <hi>giving</hi> it to the <hi>Poor,</hi> do truly <hi>lend</hi> it unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>lay it out</hi> upon <hi>Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi>)
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:106235:310"/>
yet we find it too general, that the greater mens Qualities and Fortunes are, by so much the greater are their <hi>Vanities,</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi> too.

In order to the framing of This Dissuasive, and for the making it effectual to such as

need it, I must consider those things which the World calls <hi>Great</hi> (and are in one word expressed by <hi>Worldly Greatness</hi>) in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, or native, and proper Colours; strip't of that <hi>Vizard</hi> and <hi>Disguise,</hi> which the Phantasies of People (by a too vulgar Errour) have put upon them.

            <p>The World is now at such a pass, (and 'tis a Duty not to forget it on This Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) that we do sometimes stand in need to make <hi>Apologies</hi> for God; to <hi>assert</hi> and <hi>justifie</hi> his Methods; to alledge sufficient <hi>Reasons</hi> for some of his Precepts and Prohibitions; especially for such as now we have under Consideration. Nor can we expect to be <hi>believ'd</hi> in such a <hi>Paradox</hi> as <hi>This,</hi> [That '<hi>tis a man's Interest not to be Great in this loathsom World,</hi>] any farther than our <hi>Reasons</hi> shall <hi>force Assent.</hi> I shall but urge four or five, whereof the one will rise in order above the other: That if the <hi>former</hi> cannot affect us, the <hi>later</hi> may.</p>
            <p>§ 5. The first of the Reasons I pretend to, for the Dissuasive I am upon, from any man's <hi>seeking Great Things for Himself,</hi> and for God's Prohibition, <hi>Seek them not,</hi> may be derived from the Fickleness of all Great Things on This side Heaven. Their having
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:106235:321"/>
nothing in them of Permanence, nothing of Certainty, or Firmness, which a man of any Prudence knows how to trust. From whence it follows <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> that they have nothing in them of <hi>lovely,</hi> for which they should be <hi>coveted</hi> or <hi>courted</hi> by us. And This is a Reason suggested to me from the very next words before my Text. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> (says <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Baruch</hi> by the Mouth of <hi>Ieremiah</hi>) <hi>That which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even This whole Land.</hi> He does not Thus argue, There is a <hi>Flaw</hi> in the Building, which I will <hi>Therefore</hi> break down; or a <hi>Barrenness</hi> in the Plant, which I will <hi>Therefore</hi> pluck up. But I will do it <hi>pro Imperio,</hi> because I will. For <hi>I have built,</hi> and <hi>I have planted.</hi> The whole Land is mine, and I will order it as I please. He needs not argue from its <hi>Inhabitants</hi> whereby to justifie its <hi>Destruction,</hi> because He is not only the <hi>Owner,</hi> but the <hi>Author</hi> of it. His having once <hi>built,</hi> is reason enough for his <hi>breaking down.</hi> And his having once <hi>planted,</hi> is reason enough for his <hi>plucking up.</hi> Nor may the <note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 45. 9.</note>

               <hi>Why hast Thou made, or unmade me? why hast Thou used me Thus, or Thus?</hi> 'Tis true in God's distribution of <hi>endless Punishments and Rewards</hi> to the Sons of Men, He declares Himself to act as a <hi>Righteous Iudge,</hi> a Judge with whom there is <hi>not Respect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> a Judge who <hi>renders unto every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Deeds,</hi> and according to the <hi>Law</hi> He is bound to <hi>live</hi> by.

               <hi>when their fear cometh,</hi> (Prov. 1. 26.)

            <p>§ 6. A Second Reason for my Dissuasive from any man's <hi>seeking Great Things for Himself,</hi> and for God's <hi>Prohibition, Seek them not,</hi> is to be taken from the <hi>yet sadder</hi> and more important Consideration, That the Worlds <hi>Great Things</hi> are not <hi>fickle</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but <hi>treacherous;</hi> not only <hi>transitory,</hi> but <hi>false,</hi> and <hi>fallacious things.</hi> Such arrant <hi>Snares</hi> to their Possessors, as are not more <hi>courted</hi> by men of <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Unadvisedness,</hi> than they are <hi>fear'd</hi> and <hi>suspected</hi> by men of <hi>mature Deliberation.</hi> For the more like a <hi>Meteor</hi> a Man is rais'd out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> the apter he is to return in <hi>Tears.</hi> The <hi>higher</hi> any one is exalted, his <hi>Head</hi> becomes so much the <hi>giddier,</hi> and the sooner his <hi>Feet</hi> will fail him, and the <hi>lower</hi> his <hi>Fall</hi> will be.

            <p>§ 8.

any man is, the greater is his <hi>obligation</hi> to the discharge of <hi>one</hi> duty, which, thô it is not quite <hi>impossible,</hi> is yet extreamly <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,</hi> and most <hi>uneasy</hi> to be perform'd. For still the more a man abounds in the Worlds <hi>Great Things,</hi> (such as Riches, and Honour, and Reputation,) the more he is bound up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Accompts, to lay <hi>Himself</hi> and <hi>Them</hi> too at the <hi>Feet of Christ.</hi> Still the more <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents</hi> he has receiv'd, the more he has to <hi>rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon</hi> for, at the General <hi>Audit;</hi> and 'tis still the <hi>harder</hi> for him, to make up a <hi>satisfactory</hi> Accompt; and still the Sense of This <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> both of Difficulty and Danger, should <hi>cast him down</hi> under That Greatness, which is the aptest to <hi>puff him up.</hi> And why should any man be <hi>seeking Those things for Himself,</hi> which do but aggrandize his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and lessen his Faculty to discharge it? 'Tis (I suppose) from a Conjunction of These two things, that <hi>The Friendship of the World is said to be Enmity with God.</hi> That 'tis <hi>hard</hi> (if not impossible) <hi>for a Rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> That 'tis a thing extreamly difficult, for a man to have his <hi>portion of Good Things</hi> Twice; <hi>Here,</hi>

with <hi>Dives;</hi> and with <hi>Lazarus, hereafter.</hi> Nor can I imagin a better reason, why <hi>The Rich</hi> (rather than <hi>others</hi>) should be forewarned by St. <hi>Iames, to weep and howl,</hi>

               <hi>for the miseries that shall come upon them,</hi> than that the same Talents of Greatness which are but <hi>lent</hi> and <hi>intrusted</hi> by God to men, to make them more and more <hi>affectionate</hi> and <hi>thankful</hi> to him, are wont to make them most <hi>forgetful</hi> and <hi>careless</hi> of him. That which obliges them to Humility, is made to extimulate their Pride. Why then should we be seeking <hi>Greater Things for our selves</hi> than will do us Good?

            <p>Of all the Secular <hi>Great Things</hi> from the <hi>Seeking</hi> of which we are here <hi>dehorted,</hi> the <hi>least</hi> desirable I am sure, if not the <hi>most tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous,</hi> are the Great and Rich Offices of Publick <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Trust;</hi> because They are the <hi>greatest Obstacles</hi> to That which does the most import us, to wit <hi>The Government of our selves.</hi> A Work so incumbent upon <hi>our selves,</hi> (next and immediately under God,) as that it cannot be wholly managed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>other</hi> man's Prudence, how much soever it may be greater, and more to be trusted than our <hi>own.</hi> Besides that the <hi>Government</hi> of a man's <hi>Family,</hi> althô not <hi>Great,</hi> and the <hi>Government</hi> of his <hi>Estate,</hi> althô but <hi>Little,</hi> will take up more of his Time (on which his Eternity does depend) than he can very well part with from better Objects.

<pb n="657" facs="tcp:106235:336"/>
for the <hi>governing</hi> of a man's <hi>Self, All</hi> his Time is <hi>too little;</hi> whether we look upon the <hi>hardness</hi> or <hi>profit</hi> of it. To keep our Thoughts, and our Affections, our <hi>Appetites,</hi> and our <hi>Wills,</hi> within their due <hi>Bounds and Compass,</hi> and well employ'd on those Objects to which of right they do belong, is so <hi>difficult</hi> in the <hi>doing,</hi> and yet so <hi>pleasant</hi> when it is <hi>done,</hi> that I know not whether the <hi>Work,</hi> or the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> it brings with It is more important. Hence an Overplus of Advancement is as <hi>distastful</hi> and as <hi>surfeiting</hi> to a moderate Mind, as is an Excess of Meat and Drink, either to a <hi>well-satisfi'd,</hi> or <hi>tender</hi> Stomach. And therefore as a man of a sober Appetite will expect to be excus'd by abler Drinkers than himself, from taking in more than will do him good, or more than his Body can well abide; so we must pray to be excus'd, (or be contented if we are not) by men of larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Appetites and stronger Ambitions than our own, if we shall choose to be no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in <hi>Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> than in <hi>Desires;</hi> to lessen our Burden (if already lying upon us) in proportion to the strength we have to bear it; to have our <hi>Meat</hi> and our <hi>Drink,</hi>

            <p>§ 11.

            <p>§ 14.

<pb n="669" facs="tcp:106235:342"/>
soundest Reason, and (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi>) we must duly <hi>stir up the Gift of God</hi> which is in us, whereby to find out such Means as are perhaps the <hi>least</hi> thought of, thô perhaps the <hi>most effectual</hi> to reach the End we aim at. We know an Archer, not to be <hi>short</hi> of the Mark before him, will use his indeavour to shoot <hi>beyond</hi> it. As <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes,</hi> of a Stammerer, attain'd to an excellent Pronunciation, by speaking with <hi>Pebbles</hi> in his Mouth; and so He facilitated his Conquest of a <hi>Natural</hi> Impediment, by adding and subduing an <hi>Artificial</hi> one. Have we sincerely a Desire to be the <hi>better</hi> for being <hi>Rational?</hi> to make a <hi>right use</hi> of the Light within us? to free our selves from a Disease the most tormenting in all the World? to be as happy as is possible in a Valley of Tears? we must not only <hi>not seek</hi> Great Things for our selves, but must not <hi>suffer</hi> Great Things to grow upon us <hi>in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</hi> We must never once <hi>indure</hi> to have <hi>as much</hi> of this World, as we are <hi>able;</hi> nor yet as much as is <hi>lawful</hi> for us; but only as much as is <hi>expedient.</hi> We must not dare to make Trials (as too many are wont to

There being nothing more <hi>inhuman,</hi> more <hi>unbecoming,</hi> or more <hi>unworthy</hi> of a Rational Agent, than for a man to be condemn'd, by his own Consent, to be digging all his days in the Mine, or Quarry; to be so much below a Bruit, as <hi>not to know when he has enough.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to <hi>make use</hi> of, enough to <hi>keep,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to <hi>care for,</hi> enough to <hi>lose,</hi> enough to <hi>leave behind</hi> him, enough to <hi>give accompt of</hi> in the day of Judgment.

not at all for his <hi>Wealth.</hi> For contenting himself to have <hi>done</hi> Great Things for the Commonwealth, and esteeming it his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to do them <hi>gratis,</hi> he had Estate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough only to <hi>live and dye</hi> with, But far from enough to pay the Expences of his <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</hi> Of all he had or was besides, he had been prodigally <hi>free;</hi> But his <hi>Poverty</hi> was a <hi>Treasure,</hi> he would never once <hi>part with</hi> for all the World. <hi>Agrippa Menenius</hi> made it his <hi>Choice,</hi> to be as <hi>deserving,</hi> and as <hi>poor</hi> too, if that can be a man's <hi>Poverty,</hi> which is his <hi>Choice.</hi> If'tis, 'tis <hi>such</hi> a Poverty as makes its <hi>Owner</hi> most <hi>truly Great.</hi> And if <hi>Agrippa</hi> had not been such, he had not sure been made a <hi>Iudge</hi> between the <hi>Senators</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Common People.</hi> But they who <hi>differ'd</hi> most fiercely in <hi>other</hi> Matters, could not choose but <hi>agree</hi> in <hi>This,</hi> that poor <hi>Agrippa Menenius</hi> was both the <hi>worthiest,</hi> and the <hi>fittest,</hi> and by much the <hi>most likely</hi> to reconcile them. <hi>Attilius Regulus</hi> with an Estate of no more than <hi>Seven Acres,</hi> was yet a <hi>Great</hi> and a <hi>Noble</hi> Roman; But de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in a poor and a private Life, he was taken from his Husbandry, to sit at the
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:106235:353"/>
Helm of the Roman Empire. And how <hi>unwillingly</hi> so advanc'd, did appear by This; That having subdued the Publick Enemies, and settled full Peace in the Commonwealth, he very gladly hast'ned back to That his <hi>old</hi> way of living by <hi>Plough and Harrow,</hi> which he had <hi>left</hi> for some time with an <hi>heavy heart.</hi> A Consolation to the <hi>Poor,</hi> and an Instruction to <hi>the Rich,</hi> how <hi>unnecessary</hi> to great and glorious Actions <hi>meer Riches</hi> are. I speak of Riches unattended with Frugality and Prudence, with a Contempt of mean Pleasures, and Moderation, as well as with Conduct and Magnanimity. <hi>Lucius Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Cincinnatus</hi> was just as Rich, or as Poor, as <hi>Attilius Regulus:</hi> to wit a <hi>Lord of Seven Acres,</hi> and very <hi>busy</hi> at his <hi>Plough,</hi> when the <hi>Dictatorship of Rome</hi> was presented to him.

               <hi>Houses</hi> do not stand on <hi>as many Acres,</hi> as made up <hi>all</hi> This renowned <hi>Dictator's Means.

(<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33.) So by St. <hi>Paul</hi> we are commanded, to <hi>seek those things that are above,</hi> (<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1.) Not above us here on <hi>Earth,</hi> but above every thing that is <hi>Earthy.</hi> Nor are we only to <hi>seek</hi> God's <hi>Kingdom,</hi> thô vastly <hi>Great,</hi> But (what is infinitely <hi>Greater</hi>) we are to seek <hi>God himself,</hi> who is The Great <hi>Rewarder of Them that diligently seek him,</hi> and The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of <hi>None besides,</hi> (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.)

            <p>§ 22. Now to shew the Real <hi>Littleness</hi> (the Prophet <hi>Esa</hi> calls it the <hi>Nothingness</hi>) of the <hi>Great Things below,</hi> being <hi>weighed</hi> in the <hi>Ballance</hi> with <hi>Those Above,</hi> It will not probably be amiss, to put them <hi>Both</hi> into the <hi>Scales;</hi> that so we may see how much the later <hi>weigh down</hi> the former. First the Great Things <hi>below</hi> are but <hi>figuratively</hi> such, and <hi>secundum quid;</hi> somewhat Great in <hi>Appearance,</hi> but not <hi>indeed;</hi> or only Great in their <hi>relation</hi> to what is very much less; and so an <hi>Emmet-hill</hi> is as <hi>great</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with its <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> as the whole Globe of <hi>Earth</hi> in respect of <hi>us.</hi> Whereas the Great Things <hi>above</hi> are Great <hi>simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and in <hi>Themselves;</hi> They are <hi>absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Great, and <hi>without a figure.</hi> In compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison with <hi>Them,</hi> all the Great Things <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> do presently dwindle into a <hi>Point.</hi> The
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:106235:360"/>
very <hi>Orb</hi> the Sun moves in is 100000 times bigger than <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Earth;</hi> But in relation to the <hi>Circumference</hi> of the <hi>Coelum Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeum,</hi> or but of That which is called the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> All the <hi>Dimensions</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> do immediately <hi>vanish,</hi> and <hi>lose</hi> themselves into a <hi>Center.</hi> Next the Great Things <hi>Below</hi> will sooner or later be sure to <hi>fail</hi> us, and so with very great reason they have the Title of <hi>Uncertain</hi> affixt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in Holy Writ; whereas the Great Things <hi>Above</hi> will <hi>abide for ever;</hi> There the <hi>Crown</hi> is <hi>immarcescible;</hi> nor is there only an <hi>exceeding,</hi> but an <hi>eternal</hi> weight of Glory. Again, the Great Things <hi>Below</hi> are mixt with <hi>Troubles</hi> and <hi>Solicitudes;</hi> the <hi>Stream</hi> of their Injoyment does never run <hi>clear;</hi> but what with <hi>Crosses,</hi> or <hi>Cares,</hi> is always <hi>muddy;</hi> whereas the Great Things <hi>Above</hi> do flow with such <hi>Rivers</hi> of <hi>Delight,</hi> as cannot be <hi>mingled</hi> with the least <hi>Drop</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Sorrow,</hi> or <hi>Interruption;</hi> in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God is Life,</hi> and most <hi>sincere</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures for evermore. Again, the Great Things <hi>Below</hi> do only <hi>exercise</hi> our Thirst, if not <hi>increase</hi> it; Superfluity it self, does
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:106235:360"/>
but <hi>inlarge</hi> a man's Appetite, and every man's <hi>Avarice</hi> is only <hi>wid'ned</hi> by his Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: whereas the Great Things <hi>Above</hi> will give us a <hi>plenary</hi> Satisfaction. <hi>There</hi> 'twill be <hi>one</hi> of our Injoyments, <hi>not to be able to Desire;</hi> All our <hi>Longings</hi> and <hi>Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> will be wholly swallowed up into meer <hi>Fruition.</hi> Besides, the Great Things <hi>Below</hi> are very often by <hi>God's Permission,</hi> in the <hi>Disposal</hi> of the <hi>Devil;</hi> as is evident in the two Cases of Holy <hi>Iob,</hi> and the <hi>Sabaeans;</hi> of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate;</hi> of the Greek Christians, and the Great Turk; of Innocent Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and Highway Thieves. By which and many other Cases there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more clear, than that the Great Things <hi>Below</hi> are by the <hi>Sufferance</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Devil's Disposal.</hi> Whereas the Great Things <hi>Above</hi> are above his Reach: His <hi>Chain of Darkness,</hi> which is his <hi>Tedder,</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling short of That Region from whence He fell. Lastly, the Great Things <hi>Above</hi> do all <hi>legitimate</hi> our <hi>seeking,</hi> and make it <hi>gracious;</hi> whereas the Great Things <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> do increase its <hi>Guilt.</hi> And thence the
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:106235:361"/>
Great Things <hi>Above</hi> are strictly <hi>commanded</hi> to be <hi>sought;</hi> whereas the Great Things <hi>Below</hi> are under as strict a <hi>Prohibition.</hi> Those we <hi>must</hi> seek, with <hi>Baruch;</hi> But These, with <hi>Baruch,</hi> we must <hi>forbear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These I think are All the Uses we are to make of This Message of God to <hi>Baruch;</hi> (besides the Use I made of it by way of Anticipation on this Day Sennight;) and with These I dismiss its full and final Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
