            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:98193:4"/>
be victorious, or they will triumph over thee, which will be in thy inevitable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Skill therefore in this ſo my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Warfare, will be of greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to thee, which, ſaith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, doth conſiſt, <hi>In knowing thine own Weakneſs, the Strength of thine Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the Remedy againſt both.</hi> To whoſe following Diſcourſes then, for excellent Directions herein, it falls in now aptly for me onely to refer thee.</p>
            <p>And yet this induceth me to ſay thus much more before I leave thee here, that by reading thou mayſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy glozing Corruptions uſing, in the perſon of <hi>Joſephs</hi> Miſtriſs, the moſt cogent Expreſſions to charm thee into conſent to their Exuberous Deſires: And by proceeding immediately to thoſe Replies, carried on in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> thou haſt the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of more Soveraign Antidotes to kill or enervate ſuch (elſe irreſiſtible)
<pb facs="tcp:98193:5"/>
Charms, either in the birth or riper growth, within thee.</p>
            <p>Yet here, leſt the tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence might check at the Libidinous and Prophane Language neceſſarily made uſe of by my Author; he clears that Scruple from the like practice in <hi>David,</hi> who uſeth Wicked Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but in the Perſons of the Wicked; and in <hi>Solomon,</hi> who writes Lewdly, but in the Perſons of Lewd Women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where likewiſe, among others, he ſatisfies his honeſt-minded Reader with this redundant and ſignificant Similitude, That the Roſe receives advantage in it fragrancy, by being planted near Garlick.</p>
            <p>The Stile is Verſe, that ſo no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage may be denyed the Fleſh in this her publick Tryal; or, as my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would have it, that the Scope may with the more inevitable force penetrate the Heart, as the ſonorous
<pb facs="tcp:98193:5"/>
harmony of a Trumpet doth, through the narrow paſſage of its body, the Ear; and then I may add, that the young Reader may through a happy kind of guile, be caught with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to his own Souls advantage.</p>
            <p>The Variations, Amplifications, and Additions made uſe of in this Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will I hope eaſily be excuſed, if not judged neceſſary; eſpecially where the difference between Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Conſtruing, and the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained freedome of Verſe is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>And now having given thee what I hope may ſatisfie thee, as to the Work it ſelf; I would now onely ſuperadde a brief Account of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and of the particular ſucceſs of this excellent Piece of his, both at home and abroad: And this ſhall be all I ſhall at this time ſay of both.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:98193:6"/>As to the Author, <hi>Holland</hi> (whoſe Lord Penſioner he was) could not detain him long in that <note n="*" rend="inter">
                  <hi>It is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that among the latter Penſioners in</hi> Holland, <hi>the Heer</hi> Catts <hi>onely dyed in Peace upon his Bed.</hi>

            <p>And now as to the ſucceſs of this ſmall part of his Studies, (eſteemed by the moſt, one of the moſt worthy) it hath met with ſuch kind and general acceptation at <hi>Home,</hi> that there it hath
