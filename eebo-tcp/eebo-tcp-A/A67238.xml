            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE reason of this Sermon's appearing in
Print so long after the day on which you
heard it Preach'd, was my unwillingness
to publish it till I was prevail'd with to do it by
some who thought it might be serviceable to the

end, I think it comes not out too late.</p>

Preach'd in the

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>2 Sam. iii. I.</bibl>
               <q>Now there was long War between the
House of <hi>Saul,</hi> and the House of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi>
but <hi>David</hi> waxed stronger and
stronger, and the House of <hi>Saul</hi> waxed
weaker and weaker.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THese words do give us a short account of a
long War betwixt two great Families, and
the different event it had in reference to each
of them, tending to the exaltation of the one
and the depression of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David,</hi> a Man after God's own Heart, was by
God's express Declaration (sufficiently made known
to all the People) appointed to be King, after the
Death of <hi>Saul,</hi> over all the Tribes of <hi>Israel;</hi> and
accordingly, upon <hi>Saul</hi>'s Death, he was forthwith
Anointed into the Regal Office at <hi>Hebron,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101829:5"/>
as King by the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> but the
other Tribes (who did sometimes bear the name of
<hi>Israel</hi> in distinction from that of <hi>Judah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 11. 8.</note> even before
the division of the Kingdom,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 9.</note> in the days of <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi>
I say the other Tribes) followed <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> the
Son of <hi>Saul,</hi> whom <hi>Abner</hi> the Son of <hi>Ner,</hi> had set up
in opposition to <hi>David,</hi> notwithstanding that he
could not but know he derived his Title to the
Crown from the immediate nomination of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
upon which there began a civil War betwixt
the House of <hi>David</hi> and the House of <hi>Saul.</hi> But God
was pleased so far to assert the cause of <hi>David,</hi> as to
grant him Success over his Enemies; for <hi>David</hi> (as
the Text tells us) <hi>waxed stronger and stronger, but the
House of</hi> Saul <hi>waxed weaker and weaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How far we may judge of the righteousness of a
Cause by the Success it hath, I shall take upon me to
determine. Certain it is, that good Success is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
an Argument of a good Cause. How often
have we known wicked Attempts, and the most
horrid Villainies to thrive and prosper, whilst Just
and righteous Undertakings have met with great
Miscarriages, and have had improsperous Events?
but when the Cause is apparently Just and Right,
and then good Success attends it, we cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that the hand of God is concern'd in it,
we cannot but discern his Favour to it, and his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of it; and yet from hence we must not
conclude either that God disallows of a good Cause
when he permits it to suffer, or that he approves of a
wrong Cause when he grants it good Success. For as
to the first Case, be the Cause of a People never so
just and right on which they are engaged in War, yet
he may permit them to suffer for their manifold Sins
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101829:5"/>
and Offences; and as to the other Case, he sometimes
grants Prosperity to men engaged in a wrong cause,
on purpose to make them the Instruments of his just
Wrath, in executing his Judgments on a sinful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
But now the Cause of <hi>David</hi> was undeniably
just and right, for he sate on the Throne by God's
own express Appointment, and God so far prosper'd
his Arms, as that he <hi>waxed stronger and stronger,</hi> whilst
his Enemies <hi>waxed weaker and weaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not make a parallel betwixt the War in my
Text, and the War in which we of this Nation are
engaged: for the Parallel will not hold good in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular; for the War in which we are engaged
is not (God be praised) a Civil War, not a War
betwixt two Families, or two Houses, within the
same Land or Dominion, but betwixt two distinct
and independent Kingdoms, betwixt Us and <hi>France,</hi>
betwixt the Defender of the Faith, join'd in Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy
with other Christian Princes and States of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
on one side, and the Most Christian King, join'd
with the Great Turk on the other. The Parallel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not exactly holding true, I shall wave it; nor
shall I any farther take notice of the story in my
Text, than as it affords occasion to speak upon these
four heads of Discourse;
<list>
                  <item>I. Concerning the lawfulness of War in general.</item>
                  <item>II. Concerning the War in which we of this Nation
are now engaged.</item>
                  <item>III. Concerning the Success we have had, which
gives occasion to this days Thanksgiving.</item>
                  <item>IV. And lastly, Concerning the effect which that
Success should in reason have upon us.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101829:6"/>
Of these I shall speak in their order, through
God's Blessing, with as much plainness and brevity
as I can.</p>
            <p>I. I shall speak <hi>concerning the lawfulness of War
in general.</hi> Now it must be confess'd that it is a
great unhappiness for any People to be engaged in
War; for the Miseries attending it are great, and the
event of it uncertain, and whether side soever gets
the better, yet much blood may be spilt, many a
brave Man may lose his Life in the quarrel, much
of the Nations Treasure may be exhausted, many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreseen
Losses and Calamities may be the issue of the
Victory. But yet it is as certain, that War is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
unavoidably necessary; in many cases, and
upon certain occasions, it may be very lawful, and
not repugnant to the profession of Christianity.</p>
            <p>We cannot indeed with truth admit of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
which some of late Years have so greedily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed
and spread abroad, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the state of Nature
is a state of War;</hi> as if Men were naturally Enemies
unto Men; or as if one Man were become by nature a
kind of a Wolf or a Tyger to another Man: For
Man by original Creation was made a sociable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and all Mankind by nature are inclin'd to
Peace, Unity and Concord, and mutual Love and
Kindness one with another. Some Men indeed may
have by evil custom so far debauched and corrupted
their nature, as that they may have contracted an
habit of doing wrong and injury to others, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
take some delight in quarrellings and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
but to say or believe, that a disposition to such
evil practices is originally implanted in humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is not only to disparage and vilifie the noblest
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101829:6"/>
piece of God's Creation, but to do despite unto, and to
blaspheme God himself, who is the Author of our
Being, and the Contriver of our Nature: An incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
therefore to fight, or to do such violence as
may be the cause of War, proceeds not from nature,
but from the corruption of it, and from a defection
from that innocency wherein Man was at first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 1.</note>
               <hi>From whence come Wars and fightings amongst you,</hi>
saith St. <hi>James? Come they not hence, even from your
Lusts which War in your members?</hi> So long as there
are different Passions in Men ungoverned and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd,
so long there will be fightings in the World,
Whilst Pride and Ambition, whilst desire of Power,
and of enlarging Dominions, and thirst after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
do rule in Mens hearts, it cannot well be
otherwise but that Wars and Tumults will be raised.
And although the state of Nature be not a state of
War, yet it is agreeable to nature for a Nation, or
Society of Men to defend themselves against violent
Opposition, and even to repel injuries with force.
When Rebellion or an Insurrection is rais'd in the
Land, it is certainly lawful for the supream lawful
Magistrate,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 4.</note> to whom is committed the power of the
Sword, to endeavour by force of Arms, when other
means will not prevail, to quell and suppress it. When
a Prince of an aspiring Spirit, armed with Power and
Strength, shall set upon his Neighbours, threatning
Ruine and Destruction to them, or do them any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Injury, or otherwise violate or invade their just
Rights and Liberties, it is but reasonable, as well as
lawful, for them to withstand his hostile attempts,
and to betake themselves to their Arms in their own
just Defence and Vindication; and if nothing else can
reduce him to an advantageous and honourable Peace,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101829:7"/>
they may, if they can, compel him to it by offending
him, and pull down the haughtiness of his Pride by
the diminution of his Forces; and even to be upon
the offensive part upon great and high provocations,
is as allowable as the defensive. This we know to
be practised, not only in our days, and in most parts
of the World, but even in times of old, and is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Example of Gods own People the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
throughout the History of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Even <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful, a Man
of most exemplary Piety, as well as of great Wisdom,
when he had heard of the spoil of <hi>Sodom,</hi> by the four
Kings that had set themselves against it, and that
<hi>Lot,</hi> his Brother's Son, was taken Captive by them,
he arm'd his own trained Servants, and with what
other Forces he could get, he pursued them, he fought
them, and beat them, he recovered the spoil and set
<hi>Lot</hi> at liberty; which fact, although he had not
God's express Command for it, yet met with God's
Acceptance and Approbation; for immediately after
this Victory, <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> the Priest of the Most
High God, met him in his return with the spoil, and
blessed him in the name of God,<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 19, 20.</note> saying, <hi>Blessed be</hi>
Abraham <hi>of the most high God, Possessor of Heaven and
Earth; and blessed be the most high God, which hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
thine Enemies into thine hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 17.</note> had fought the <hi>Amalekites</hi>
and beaten them, although they had not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God for so doing, yet they afterwards had
his Approbation of it: and in the <hi>20th</hi> Chapter of
<hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> he gives his people general and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
rules to be observed in waging War, declaring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101829:7"/>
thereby his allowance of it upon some accounts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it hath not his Especial Command.</p>
            <p>Neither is there any thing in the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
that forbids it, but rather some things that do
very much favour it, and makes it lawful for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
upon good occasions, to go to War, and to
be engaged in it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us to pray, as for
<hi>all men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>so particularly for Kings, that under them we
may lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all godliness and
honesty;</hi> but how can a quiet and peaceable Life be
obtained, unless it be lawful for them to make use of
the Sword, against the disturbers of our Peace, and
the hinderers of our Quiet? and accordingly we find
in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that the Primitive Christians prayed for
the Heathen Emperours, that they might have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Souldiers and Victorious Armies; and many of
the ancient Christians who lived nearest the time of
our Saviour, and of his Apostles, and who therefore
may be presumed to know our Lord's mind very
well as to this matter, did serve as Souldiers in the
Wars of the Emperours under whom they lived,
which we may imagine they would never have done,
had they thought it had been contrary to the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Religion.</p>
            <p>We are indeed, by the Gospel of Christ, obliged
to love our Enemies, but that lays no restraint upon
us from going to War against them; we may love
them, even then when we are fighting with them,
<hi>i. e.</hi> Love their Souls, and wish well unto their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Eternal State. We are commanded to forgive
Injuries, and to put up Affronts, not to revenge our
selves, not to retaliate wrong with wrong, but to
overcome evil with good. But these Commands and
Prohibitions concern only private Persons in their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101829:8"/>
private Capacities, and cannot be construed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to publick Societies, or the united body of a
Nation.</p>
            <p>Besides, we may observe, that St. <hi>John Baptist,</hi>
who was a Person under the strictest rigour of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Life, a Fore-runner of our Saviour, and sent on
purpose to prepare men for the reception of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and who gave instructions of Life to all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted
to him; when the Souldiers, amongst others,
came to take his Counsel, and asked him what they
should do, did not bid them leave that course of life
they were then engaged in,<note place="margin">Luke 3. 14.</note> but only <hi>to do no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
to accuse none falsly, and to be content with their
wages.</hi> He left them still the use of their Arms, and
only forbad them the abuse of their Power. And
<hi>Cornelius,</hi> who was a Centurion of a Band of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
under the Roman pay, when he was made a
Christian by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> did still continue a Centurion,
and had no directions given him to lay down his
Commission.</p>
            <p>As for that famous Prophecy, which without
doubt relates to the Church of Christ, and foretells
the happiness of the World upon his coming into it,
namely,<note place="margin">Is. 2. 4.</note> that <hi>men should beat their Swords into Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shares,
and their Spears into Pruning-hooks;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mich. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should not life up Sword against Nation, and that
they should not learn War any more;</hi> there are these
two things that may be said to it; <hi>First,</hi> That it
may be understood conditionally, that such indeed
would assuredly be the happy state of the World, if
all Men in it would embrace the Christian Religion,
and live up to the Rules and Duties of it; for that
would keep them from doing any wrong or injury,
and consequently there would be no occasion for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101829:8"/>
Wars, but an universal and perpetual Peace should
over-spread the Earth. Or, <hi>secondly,</hi> That we are still
to expect the accomplishment of it, that it still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
to be fullfill'd, as do also some others which
concern the state of Christ's Church upon Earth;
and therefore considering the present state of the
World, we cannot from that Prophecy rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that War is absolutely unlawful.</p>
            <p>To this we may also add, that if our Blessed Lord
had ever design'd to make Warfare Criminal, and to
forbid it wholly to his Disciples and Followers, we
may be sure that he would some where or other, have
given us a plain Declaration of his Mind in the case,
and have forbidden it us in plain, and express, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
words; which being he hath no where
done, we cannor but think them very rash, and
their Censure highly culpable, who condemn the use
of Arms amongst Christian; or that from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Command to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to put up his Sword
(which he did no purpose to give a check to private
revenge) do infer that it was his Mind, that none
who prosess his Gospel, should upon any account be
engaged in War.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, to conclude this point, as it may be
lawful for private Persons to go to Law, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to the chief Magistrate, and the Courts of Justice,
which is commonly the last, and the only way of deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Controversies that may arise betwixt one Man
and another, so it may be lawful for one Nation to
go to War with another, and to appeal to the Sword,
when the differences betwixt them cannot otherwise
be determined: And the lawfullness of levying War,
and of being engaged in it upon accounts that are just
and weighty, and when there is the Authority of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101829:9"/>
chief Magistrate for it, hath been agreed upon in all
Ages, and by all Religions; if we think otherwise,
we shall condemn the actions of those ancient and
noble Worthies, who are mention'd with honour in
the <hi>11th</hi> Chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and
recorded to Posterity for their Warlike and Heroick
Deeds, <hi>who through Faith subdued Kingdoms, escaped
the edge of the Sword, out of weakness became strong,
waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the Armies of the
Aliens.</hi> In a word, if we either say or think that the
use of Arms, and the military employment is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
inconsistent with the profession of the Gospel,
what is it but to expose the Lives and Fortunes of
Christians, as a prey to the rage and fury of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Christian Church and Faith? And thus
having considered the lawfulness of War in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</p>
            <p>II. I come now, in the second place, to speak
somewhat <hi>concerning the War which we of this Nation
are now engaged in;</hi> concerning which I have this to
say, that it is as Just and as lawful a War as ever
any People were concern'd to manage; if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
either the Enemies against whom, or the causes
for which, we fight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> As for our Enemies they are such as are the
most inveterate and implacable Enemies of our Peace
and Religion, who at first began the War upon us,
who invaded his Majesties Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
made sad havock there, and would still have done
more, had they not by the Blessing of God upon our
Arms, been beaten off, who have often threatned
<hi>England</hi> with an Invasion, who are perfect haters of
our Church and Nation, and upon all occasions do
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101829:9"/>
seek our ruine and destruction. We are engaged
against a Prince, the Ruler of those our Enemies,
who is become a Scourge and a terrour to all that
are round about him, who hath made his Will a Law,
who persecutes Christians whilst he is in League with
the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who hath made War upon his
Neighbours without cause, and enlarged his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
without right, and seeks after an Universal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
to bring all <hi>Europe</hi> into Slavery; who carries
Tyranny and Oppression, Injustice and Cruelty, Fire
and Desolation wheresoever he conquers. Which
things when we seriously consider, we cannot but
stand amaz'd at those amongst our selves, who either
wish in their hearts, or dare speak with their mouths,
that they would have, those our Enemies, to get the
better of us, who can rejoice and exult at any little
advantage they hear the Enemy hath gain'd, and
would willingly have it believed to be greater than
it is, and do magnifie it to excess on purpose to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Nation, and endeavour to make a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of a Molehill. What could these persons gain,
supposing that our Enemies should really become Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
and Conquerors over us? What if for our
great Sins and Provocations against Heaven, God
should permit our Enemies to come within our own
Bowels, and with Fire and Sword to rage here as they
have done in other places, and to make an entire
Conquest of our Land? Could these Persons, who
are so great Well-wishers to 'em, expect to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from the common Calamity? Could they
think to escape that ruine which they wish to their
own Fellow-Subjects, or be excused from that Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ing
which makes no distinction of Persons?
Could they be glad to see the Land of their Nativity
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101829:10"/>
turn'd into an <hi>Aceldama</hi> of Blood? or rejoice to have
the English Nation become Tributary to <hi>France?</hi>
But Blessed be God, that there is now as little ground
for our fearing of this, as they have to hope that their
unnatural wishes or desires may take effect. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this shews us what great reason we have to be
united against those our Enemies, and both to pray
and to endeavour all we can, that they may never
prevail against us, nor triumph in the ruine of us and
our Posterity.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>As for the causes for which we sight;</hi> they are as
just and as honourable as can be; for we fight not
for trifles, for small or inconsiderable things, but for
things of the greatest moment and concern, for our
Lives and Liberties, for the defence of our just Rights
our Laws and Privileges, for the preservation of
our Religion against the most violent attempts for
its Subversion; in a word, for the Vindication of
the common liberties of Mankind, invaded and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
on by Tyranny and Oppression. And these are
certainly as justifiable causes of a War as ever any
Nation had or can have. From the consideration of
which give me leave, I beseech you, to make these
few Inferences;</p>
            <p>(1) That we are from hence obliged freely and
willingly, chearfully and contentedly, without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
and complaining, to contribute and pay what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Wisdom of the Great Council of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall think fit to lay upon us as a Tax, for the
carrying on of this War with Vigour, till God by
his Providence shall see fit to put an happy end to it.
This methinks is as little as we can do, who fit at
home and enjoy the great Blessing of Peace, whilst
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101829:10"/>
others our Fellow-Subjects, are hazarding their
Lives abroad in fighting for us: and surely we may
be very well pleased and contented, if by parting
with our Money, we can keep the War at a distance
from us.</p>
            <p>(2.) That it is not only lawful but necessary for
those who are able, and whose occasions and manner
of Life will permit them (may, perhaps it may be
their duty too) actually to assist the King in this just
War with their own Persons, and to endeavour by
their Prowess and Courage, to lay his Enemies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
at his Feet. For it is not imaginable, that any
King whatsoever can withstand the insults of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
or protect his Subjects without their assistance
and presence with him.</p>
            <p>(3.) That we should pay a just deference, and an
honourable respect to the memory of those worthy
Persons whom the hand of the Enemy hath unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
slain in this War, particularly in the Reduction
of that City and Castle for which we now give
thanks; that we should speak well of them and thank
God for them; for that they spent their Blood in
the defence of their Country, lost their Lives in a
just Cause, and dyed upon the Bed of Honour.</p>
            <p>(4.) Lastly, that we should thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our selves obliged, as to all those in general,
who actually fight for us; so particularly to the King
himself, who hath exposed his own Person to all the
Fatigues and hazards of the War; who, like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
himself doth fight the Lords Battles, whose vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
in action is more quick than the Lightning of
his own Cannon, whose Magnanimity and Conduct,
whose Prudence and undaunted Courage, have gain'd
him Immortal Renown in the Annals of Fame, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101829:11"/>
made him to become a terrour to his Enemies. To
Him especially who hath hazarded his Royal Person
and Life in the Defence, and for the Honour of our
Church and Nation, we should pay our thankful
acknowledgment in a dutiful return of Honour and
Faithfulness towards him; which if we should fail
to do, we might justly be reproached for our ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
like as were the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jud. 8. 34, 35.</note> who <hi>shewed
no kindness to the house of Jerubbabel, namely Gideon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.</hi>
His very Presence in the Camp animates our Forces
with new Life and Vigour, and therefore when he is
pleased to be at the head of our Armies, unless by our
Sins and Rebellion against God, (unless by our ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to him and the King, we provoke God to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
our hopes, and blast our Undertakings) we
need not doubt, but that through God's Blessing, we
shall do Valiantly, and tread them under that rise
up against us. To his Matchless Valour and wise
Conduct, next to the Mercy and Goodness of God,
we owe our Preservation from the direful effects of
our Enemies Rage and Malice. And therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of Gratitude are due; first to God as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of all our Successes, and then to him as the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Instrument whereby he works them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III. And thus I come in the third place to</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Success we have had in this War, particularly this
last Summers Expedition, which gives occasion to this
Days Thanksgiving.</p>
            <p>We cannot indeed as yet truly say that we have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
vanquished and overcome our Enemies, but I hope
I may say truly in the words of my Text, that through
God's Blessing we are <hi>waxed stronger and stronger,</hi> and
they <hi>wax weaker and weaker.</hi> For what places have
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101829:11"/>
they gain'd of us this or the last Years Campaign, as
they have formerly done at the beginning of others?
Nay have they not lost much ground this Summer?
and is there not a plain stop put to the Enemies Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer?
Have we not by the bravery and resolution of
our Forces and our Allies, Retaken that strong, that
most Important City and Castle, which our Enemies
two Years ago did take, and could no otherwise take
from us than by Fraud and Treachery? Have we
not retaken them in the face and under the sight of a
numerous Army of the adverse Party, who came to
be the inglorious Lookers on of the loss they sustain'd
thereby? Where is that Bravading-Navy, that once
or twice appeared upon our Coasts, and threatned us
with an Invasion? 'Tis plain, that they sculk, and
shelter, and hide themselves in their lurking-holes,
out of which they dare not, they cannot with safety
look forth. But as for our Navy, hath not part of it.
Victoriously danced on the British Ocean, stopping
upon the Avenues of the Enemies Ports and Havens,
and with considerable Success attacking the chiefest
of their Sea-Coast-Towns? and doth not part of it
ride triumphantly, at this Day, in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi>
putting thereby a check to all their Pride and Glory?<note place="margin">2 Kings 19. 28.</note>
God at present seems to have put his Hook (as he
once threatned to do to <hi>Sennacherib</hi>) into the Nostrils
of the great <hi>Leviathan,</hi> that for so long a time hath
taken his pastime in the deep. He hath given a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Rebuke to the aspiring Fortune and Fury of the
Enemy, by the Success of ours and our Confederate
Forces, both by Sea and Land. So that now we may
hope be will in a little time begin to hearken to a
Peace; nay, that he will be brought to such a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to be forced to seek and desire it; to which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101829:12"/>
he hath hitherto been as deaf as the Adder that
stoppeth her Ears. For the Lord hath now pulled
down the high looks of the Proud, and levell'd the
haughty Stomach; he hath clipt his Wings in his
towring-flight, and brought him nearer to the
ground; he hath <hi>put the Heathen in fear, and made
them to know themselves to be but men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which Crowns our Success, and is the
glory of our Triumphs, and the chief cause of this
Days-Thanksgiving, is that it hath pleased God to
preserve our King from the many dangers to which
his Royal Person was expos'd, during the late Siege,
and in all his publick Expeditions for our Safety, and
for the deliverance of our Suffering Brethren; that
he hath kept him under the shadow of his Wings,
from falling into the hands of his Enemies, that he
hath covered his Head in the Day of Battle, and been
a Wall of Defence to him on every side. What a
deplorable and fatal blow would it have been, not
only to this Nation, but to the most considerable part
of <hi>Europe,</hi> if He, the Head of the Confederate Allies,
had by any means been cut off? If He, the Prop and
Stay of the Protestant Religion, had any ways suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
by the hands of those that hate him? How
would they have rejoiced to have been made Masters
of His Life, whose Death would be their greatest
advantage? how would they have triumph'd in
His ruine, which only could have given Life to their
dying Cause? But now how will they be astonished
and amazed, how will they shake and tremble, when
they shall see him once more besieging some of their
strongest Towns; or at the Head of a Gallant Army,
in the open Field, (Him whose very name is enough
to strike them into a Panick Fear,) when they shall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101829:12"/>
see him once more arm'd, not so much with his own
Forces, as with the strength and right hand of the
Almighty? <hi>Blessed therefore be God who hath given
prosperity unto his King, and hath delivered</hi> David <hi>his
Servant from the peril of the Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. And this leads me to the Fourth and last
head of my present Discourse, and that is <hi>concerning
the effect which our Success in this War should have
upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1.) And first it should fill our hearts with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Joy in the remembrance of the loving-kindness
of Almighty God towards us: for should we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
and exult when we consider that God is still
mindful of us, that he hath not yet left off to do us
good, and that he gives us every year fresh instances
of his concern on our accounts? Is it not a ground of
exceeding great comfort to receive so clear, and so
many pledges of his love and favour exprest in such
watchful care over us, such Protection in times of
danger, such Success over our Enemies, such deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from their Spight and Malice? Such publick
Benefits as these cannot, I am sure they ought not, to
be received without great chearfulness and gladsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of heart. We are all of us, or at least should
be, concern'd for the Publick Good, as being living
and sensible Members of the State, and are like to
partake both of the good and ill sare thereof. And
therefore how can we look upon or hear of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
Issue of God's Providence over our Nation, of
any happy Success with which God hath blessed our
Publick Undertakings, without great delight and
complacency?</p>
            <p>(2.) The Success with which God hath blessed us,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101829:13"/>
should also excite us to praise and bless God for it.
For God's Favour towards us will not have its due
effect unless it fill our Mouth with Praise, as well as
our Heart with Joy. We should look <hi>beyond the Hills
from whence cometh our help,</hi> beyond the efficacy of
second Causes, and search out the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi>
that secret sacred Wheel of Providence which winds
and turns about humane affairs as it pleaseth: Then
shall we be ready to acknowledge with <hi>David, that
it is not our own arm that helpeth us, but the right hand
of God, and his arm, and the light of his countenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath a favour unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is necessary indeed that towards the atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of great Exploits, or the encountring of formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Enemies, great Preparations should be made,
Arms and Money (the strength and Sinews of War)
should be provided, and considerable Forces raised.
For God (who makes use of second Causes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
his own wise designs) works by these towards
the defence and safeguard of his People; and we can
no more reasonably expect, that God will help a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Kingdom, without their own concurrent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
than that he will recover a Man out of a
dangerous Sickness, without the application and use
of proper Remedies, or relieve a Man in distress and
want, without his own Industry and Care. But then
we must not impure our Victory and Success purely
to any Prowess, or Conduct, or Wisdom of our
own, but to the great God <hi>who teacheth our arms to
war and our finger<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he weak and seeble; who pulleth

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101829:13"/>
and meek; who alone giveth Victory unto Kings, and
delivereth his Servants from the hurtful Sword.</hi> Upon
the consideration therefore of the good Success we
have hitherto had, as we cannot but ascribe the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
thereof to God's good hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
so we are bound to make a grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of it by our hearty Thanksgiving unto
him, saying with the Royal Psalmist, <hi>Not unto us,
O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the Praise
for thy loving-kindness, and for thy truths sake,</hi> for we
know that <hi>no King</hi> or People <hi>can be saved by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of an host,</hi> and that no <hi>mighty Man is delivered by
much strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we have great reason to praise and bless All-mighty
God for our late Success, if we either look
upon it as the <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ious return of our Prayers and
Fasting, or if we reflect upon our unworthiness
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> If we look upon it as the gracious return of
our Prayers and Fasting. For we prayed and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
our selves by fasting, and implored the Blessing
of God upon our Forces, and upon our King through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Expedition; and he hath been graciously
pleas'd to hear our Prayers, and hath granted our
desires, by giving us good Success, and protecting
the King in the day of Battle. <hi>Blessed therefore be God
who hath not withholden the request of our lips, Blessed be
God who hath not cast out our Prayer, nor turned his
Mercy from us!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> let us reflect upon our unworthiness of
it; when we consider our many great and high Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
of All-mighty God, our unthankfulness for
former Mercies, our Incorrigibleness under all the
Judgments which God at several times hath brought
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101829:14"/>
upon us, and when we withal reflect upon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God in having thus blessed and prosper'd us,
notwithstanding such our unworthiness of it, can
we forbear to praise God, saying with the Holy Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,
<hi>Thou Lord hast forgiven the offences of thy people
and covered all their sins, thou Lord hast dealt graciously
with thy servants; be thou therefore exalted in thine own
strength, so will we sing and praise thy power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3.) Moreover, the Success we have had should
engage us to trust in God for the future, and never
to doubt that God who hath appear'd so much, and
so signally stretched forth his arm on our accounts,
will now leave us; but to hope with humble confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that he will still continue to do great things
for us.</p>
            <p>(4.) It should also oblige us to newness of Life,
and better Obedience towards God. For fresh instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his goodness do call aloud upon us, to shew
forth his praise, not only with our Lips, but in our
Lives, by giving up our selves to his Service, and
walking before him in holiness and righteousness all
our days.</p>
            <p>(5.) Lastly, The Success we have had against our
temporal Enemies, should put us in mind of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
we have with our Spiritual, and that as we are
Christians we are engaged in a War far more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and of far greater consequence than any we
can have with our most inveterate Foes upon Earth,
in which if we are overcome, we shall be reduced to
a worse condition than all our other Enemies can ever
bring us into, in which if we get the Victory, we
shall gain Imm<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tal Life and Glory in the Regions
above, in comparison with which, all the Trophies
and Spoils, all the Riches and advantages we can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101829:14"/>
over our Enemies here, are but inconsiderable
trifles.</p>
            <p>When we were baptized into the Faith of Christ,
we took upon us to fight manfully against Sin, the
World, and the Devil; these are our most formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Enemies, with which we must have no Peace so
long as we live upon Earth; with these we must not
so much as enter into a Truce, or think of doing so;
nay 'tis extreamly dangerous even but to parly with
them. We carry a War continually about with us,
<hi>the flesh warring against the spirit, and the spirit against
the flesh, and these two are contrary the one to the other;
we have a law in our members warring against the law
of our mind, endeavouring to bring us into captivity to
the law of sin:</hi> We have Lusts and Passions which
War in our Members, and there are <hi>fleshly lusts which
war against the Soul.</hi> A Christian Man's Life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this World is a state of continual Warfare,
and the Church of Christ it self is but Militant here
upon Earth.</p>
            <p>Let therefore our Success against our temporal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
encourage us to get the better of our Spiritual.
What a shame will it be for us to conquer those, and
to suffer our selves to be led Captive by these? What
disgrace is it to let Sin reign in our Mortal Bodies,
when we can so easily subdue our other Enemies? What
a sad exchange of a Victory would it be to beat our
Enemies so as that they <hi>wax weaker and weaker,</hi> and
yet to suffer our Lusts and Passions to <hi>wax stronger
and stronger?</hi> O therefore let us watch and stand fast
in our Faith, let us quit our selves like Men, like
Christians, and be strong. Let us take unto our selves
the whole Armour of God, that we may be able to
withstand all the assaults of our Spiritual Enemies;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101829:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Let us gird our loins with truth,</hi> and <hi>put on the Breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
of righteousness;</hi> let <hi>our feet be shod with the
preparation of the Gospel of Peace;</hi> and let <hi>us take the
shield of Faith, and the Helmet of Salvation, and the
Sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.</hi> And let
us withal humbly beg the Assistance of God's Holy
Spirit and Grace, which then will not fail to strike
in with us; and then we need not doubt but that we
shall overcome all our Enemies of what nature soever
they be. Then, when we have fought a good fight,
and finished our course, and Successfully ended our
Warfare here, we shall enjoy an Eternal Jubilee of
Peace, Rest and Glory in the happy Regions of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>
