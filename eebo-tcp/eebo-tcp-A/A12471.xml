            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:12189:4"/>
they have acted my fatall Tragedies upon the Stage, and rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked my Relations at their pleasure. To prevent therefore all future misprisions, I have compiled this true discourse. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie hath taxed me to have writ too much, and done too little; but that such should know, how little I esteeme them, I have writ this, more for the satisfaction of my friends, and all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and well disposed Readers: To speake only of my selfe were intolerable ingratitude; because, having had so many co-partners with me; I cannot make a Monument for my selfe, and leave them unburied in the fields, whose lives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got me the title of a Souldier; for as they were companions with me in my dangers, so shall they be partakers with me in this Tombe.</p>
            <p>For my <hi>Sea Grammar</hi> (caused to bee printed by my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy friend, Sir <hi>Samuel Saltonstall</hi>) hath found such good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment abroad, that I have beene importuned by many noble persons, to let this also passe the Presse. Many of the most eminent Warriers, and others, what their swords did, their penns writ: Though I bee never so much their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, yet I hold it no great errour, to follow good examples; nor repine at them, will doe the like.</p>
            <p>And now my most Honourable good Lords, I know not to whom I may better present it, than to your Lordships, whose friendships, as I conceive, are as much to each others, as my duty is to you all; and because you are acquainted both with my endevours, and writings, I doubt not, but your honours will as well accept of this, as of the rest, and Patronize it under the shadow of your most noble vertues, which I am ever bound in all duty to reverence, and under which I hope to have shelter, against all stormes that dare threaten.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The death of this Captaine so swelled in the heart of one <hi>Grualgo,</hi> his vowed friend, as rather inraged with madnesse than choller, he directed a particular challenge to the Conquerour, to regaine his friends head, or lose his owne, with his horse and Armour for advantage, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his desire, was the next day undertaken: as before upon the sound of the Trumpets, their Lances flew in peeces upon a cleare passage, but the <hi>Turke</hi> was neere unhorsed. Their Pistolls was the next, which mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Smith</hi> upon the placard; but the next shot the <hi>Turke</hi> was so woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the left arme, that being not able to rule his horse, and defend himselfe, he was throwne to the ground, and so bruised with the fall, that he lost his head, as his friend before him; with his horse and Armour; but his body and his rich apparell was sent backe to the Towne.</p>
            <p>Every day the <hi>Turkes</hi> made some sallies, but few skirmishes would they endure to any purpose. Our workes and approaches being not yet advanced to that height and effect which was of necessitie to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; to delude time, <hi>Smith</hi> with so many incontradictible perswading reasons, obtained leave that the Ladies might know he was not so much enamoured of their servants heads, but if any <hi>Turke</hi> of their ranke would come to the place of combate to redeeme them, should have his also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like conditions, if he could winne it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The challenge presently was accepted by <hi>Bonny Mulgro.</hi> The next day both the Champions entring the field as before, each discharging their Pistoll, having no Lances, but such martiall weapons as the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant appointed, no hurt was done; their Battle-axes was the next, whose piercing bils made sometime the one, sometime the other to have scarce sense to keepe their saddles, specially the <hi>Christian</hi> received such a blow that he lost his Battle-axe, and failed not much to have fallen after it, wherat the supposing conquering <hi>Turk,</hi> had a great shout from the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers. The <hi>Turk</hi> prosecuted his advantage to the uttermost of his power; yet the other, what by the readinesse of his horse, and his judgement and dexterity in such a businesse, beyond all mens expectation, by Gods as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, not onely avoided the <hi>Turkes</hi> violence, but having drawne his Faulchion, pierced the <hi>Turke</hi> so under the Culets thorow backe and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that although he alighted from his horse, he stood not long ere hee lost his head, as the rest had done.</p>

            <p>NOw you are to understand,<note place="margin">The description of the <hi>Crym-Tartars</hi> Court.</note> 
               <hi>Tartary and Scythia</hi> are all one, but so large and spacious, few or none could ever perfectly describe it, nor all the severall kinds of those most barbarous people that inhabit it. Those we call the <hi>Crym-Tartars,</hi> border upon <hi>Moldavia, Podolia, Lituania,</hi> and <hi>Russia,</hi> are much more regular than the interior parts of <hi>Scythia.</hi> This great <hi>Tartarian</hi> Prince, that hath so troubled all his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they alwayes call <hi>Chan,</hi> which signifieth Emperour; but we, the <hi>Crym-Tartar.</hi> He liveth for most part in the best champion plaines of many Provinces; and his removing Court is like a great Citie of houses and tents, drawne on Carts, all so orderly placed East and West, on the right and left hand of the Prince his house, which is alwayes in the midst towards the South, before which none may pitch their houses, every one knowing their order and quarter,<note place="margin">His houses and carts.</note> as in an Armie. The Princes houses are very artificially wrought, both the foundation, sides, and roofe of wickers, ascending round to the top like a Dove-coat; this they cover with white felt, or white earth tempered with the powder of bones, that it may shine the whiter; sometimes with blacke felt, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously painted with vines, trees, birds, and beasts; the breadth of the Carts are eighteene or twenty foot, but the house stretcheth foure or five foot over each side, and is drawne with ten or twelve, or for more state, twenty Camels and Oxen.<note place="margin">Baskets.</note> They have also great baskets, made of smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler wickers like great chests, with a covering or the same, all covered over with blacke felt, rubbed over with tallow and sheeps milke, to keepe out the raine; prettily bedecked with painting or feathers; in those they put their houshold stuffe and treasure, drawne upon other carts for that purpose. When they take downe their houses, they set the doore alwayes towards the South, and their carts thirtie or fortie foot distant on each side, East and West, as if they were two walls: the women also have most curious carts; every one of his wives hath a great one for herselfe, and so many other for her attendants, that they seeme as many Courts, as he hath wives. One great <hi>Tartar</hi> or Nobleman, will have for his particular, more than an hundred of those houses and carts, for his severall offices and uses, but set so farre from each other, they will seeme like a great village.<note place="margin">Their idolatrie in their lodgings.</note> Having taken their houses from the carts, they place the Master alwayes towards the North; over whose head is alwayes an Image like a Puppet, made of felt, which they call his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the women on his left hand, and over the chiefe Mistris her head, such another brother, and betweene them a little one, which is the keeper of the house; at the good wives beds-feet is a kids skinne, stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with wooll, and neere it a Puppet looking towards the Maids; next the doore another, with a dried cowes udder, for the women that milke the kine, because only the men milke mares; every morning those

               <p> The continuation of the generall Historie of <hi>Virginia</hi>; the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Iles</hi>; and <hi>New England</hi>; with their present estate from 1624. to this present 1629.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>COncerning these Countreyes, I would be sorrie to trouble you with repeating one thing twice, as with their Maps, Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, People, Government &amp; Religion yet knowen, the beginning of those plantations, their numbers and names, with the names of the Adventurers, the yeerely proceedings of everie Governour both here and there. As for them misprisions, neglect, grievances, and the causes of all those rumours, losses and crosses that have happened; I referre you to the Generall Historie, where you shall finde all this at large; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to those pages, where you may read my letter of advice to the Councell and Company, what of necessitie must be done, or lose all and leave the Countrey, pag. 70. what commodities I sent home, pag. 163. my opinion and offer to the Company, to feed and defend the Colonies, pag. 150. my account to them here of my actions there, pag. 163. my seven answers to his Majesties Commissioners: seven questions what hath hindered <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the remedie, pag. 165. How those noble Gentlemen spent neere two yeares in perusing all letters came from thence; and the differences betwixt many factions, both here and there, with their complaints; especially about the Sallerie, which should have beene a new office in <hi>London,</hi> for the well ordering the sale of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,</hi> that 2500. pounds should yearely have beene raised out of it, to pay foure or five hundred pounds yearly to the Governor of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie; two or three hundred to his Deputie; the rest into stipends of thirtie or fiftie pounds yearely for their Clerks and under Officers which were never there, pag. 153. but not one hundred pounds for all them in <hi>Virginia,</hi> nor any thing for the most part of the Adventurers in <hi>England,</hi> except the undertakers for the Lotteries, Setters out of ships, Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers of commodities, also their Factors and many other Officers, there imployed only by friendship to raise their fortunes out of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the true industrious planters by the title of their office, who
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12189:30"/>
under the colour of sinceritie, did pillage and deceive all the rest most cunningly: For more than 150000. pounds have beene spent out of the common stocke, besides many thousands have beene there consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and neere 7000. people that there died, only for want of good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and government, otherwise long ere this there would have beene more than 20000. people, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re after twentie yeeres spent onely in complement, and trying new conclusions, was remaining scarce 1500. with some few cattell.</p>
            <p>Then the Company dissolved, but no account of any thing; so that his Majestie appointed Commissioners to oversee, and give order for their proceedings. Being thus in a manner left to themselves, since then within these foure yeeres, you shall see how wonderfully they have increased beyond expectation; but so exactly as I desired, I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto you: For although I have tired my selfe in seeking and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing with those returned thence, more than would a voyage to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi>; few can tell me any thing, but of that place or places they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and he is a great traveller that hath gone up &amp; downe the river of <hi>Iames</hi> Towne, been at <hi>Pamaunke, Smiths</hi> Iles, or <hi>Accomack</hi>; wherein for the most part they keepe one tune of their now particular abundance, and their former wants, having beene there, some sixteene yeeres, some twelve, some six, some neere twentie, &amp;c. But of their generall estate, or any thing of worth, the most of them doth know verie little to any purpose.</p>

            <p>Upon this River they seldome see any Salvages, but in the woods, many times their fires: yet some few there are, that upon their oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie have slaine some few stragglers, which have beene revenged with the death of so many of themselves; but no other attempt hath beene made upon them this two or three yeares.</p>
            <p>Their Cattle,<note place="margin">Their increase of Cattle and Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</note> namely Oxen, Kine, Buls, they imagine to be about 2000.

            <p>For bread they have plentie, and so good,<note place="margin">Plenty of Corne.</note> that those that make it well, better cannot be: divers have much English corne, especially M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Abraham Perce,</hi> which prepared this yeere to sow two hundred acres of English wheat, and as much with barley, feeding daily about the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of sixtie persons at his owne charges.</p>

            <p>Their servants commonly feed upon Milke Homini,<note place="margin">Their servants diet.</note> which is bruized Indian corne pounded, and boiled thicke, and milke for the sauce; but boiled with milke, the best of all will oft feed on it, and leave their fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And everie one is so applyed to his labour about Tobacco and Corne, which doth yeeld them them such profit, they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard any food from the Salvages, nor have they any trade or conference with them, but upon meere accidents and defiances: and now the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants have left it, there have gone so many voluntarie ships within this two yeeres, as have furnished them with Apparell, Sacke, <hi>Aquavitae,</hi> and all necessaries, much better than ever before.</p>
            <p>For Armes, there is scarce any man but he is furnished with a Peece,<note place="margin">Their Armes and exercise.</note> a Iacke, a Coat of Maile, a Sword, or Rapier; and euerie Holy-day, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie Plantation doth exercise their men in Armes, by which meanes, hunting and fowling, the most part of them are most excellent mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>For Discoveries they have made none,<note place="margin">Their health and discoveries.</note> nor any other commoditie than Tobacco doe they apply themselves unto, though never any was planted at first. And whereas the Countrey was heretofore held most intemperate and contagious by many, now they have houses, lodgings and victuall, and the Sunne hath power to exhale up the moyst vapours of the earth, where they have cut downe the wood, which before it could not, being covered with spreading tops of high trees; they finde it much more healthfull than before; nor for their numbers, few Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes are lesse troubled with death, sicknesse, or any other disease, nor where overgrowne women become more fruitfull.</p>
            <p>Since this, Sir <hi>George Yerley</hi> died 1628.

            <p>All the Cohow birds and Egbirds are gone; seldome any wilde cats seene; no Rats to speake of; but the wormes are yet very troublesome; the people very healthfull; and the Ravens gone; fish enough, but not so neere, the shore as it used, by the much beating it; it is an Ile that hath such a rampire and a ditch, and for the quantity so manned, victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alled, and fortified, as few in the world doe exceed it, or is like it.</p>

            <p>AS in all lands where there are many people, there are some theeves, so in all Seas much frequented, there are some pyrats; the most ancient within the memory of threescore yeares was one <hi>Callis,</hi> who most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed himselfe upon the Coast of <hi>Wales; Clinton</hi> and <hi>Pursser</hi> his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who grew famous, till Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of blessed memory, hanged

            <p>Now because they grew hatefull to all <hi>Christian</hi> Princes,<note place="margin">Their chiefe rande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz.</note> they retired to <hi>Barbary,</hi> where although there be not many good Harbours, but <hi>Tunis, Argier, Sally, Mamora,</hi> and <hi>Tituane,</hi> there are many convenient Rodes, or the open Sea, which is their chiefe Lordship: For their best harbours <hi>Massalqueber,</hi> the townes of <hi>Oran, Mellila, Tanger,</hi> and <hi>Cuta,</hi> within the Streights, are possessed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; without the Streights they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Arzella,</hi> and <hi>Mazagan; Mamora</hi> likewise they have lately taken, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. <hi>Ward</hi> a poore <hi>English</hi> sailer, and <hi>Dansker</hi> a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> made first here their Marts, when the <hi>Moores</hi> knew scarce how to saile a ship; <hi>Bishop</hi> was An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and did little hurt; but <hi>Easton</hi> got so much, as made himselfe a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse in <hi>Savoy</hi>; and <hi>Ward</hi> lived like a Bashaw in <hi>Barbary</hi>; those were the first that taught the <hi>Moores</hi> to be men of warre. <hi>Gennings, Harris, Tompson,</hi> and divers others, were taken in <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Coast they much frequented, and died at <hi>Wapping.
