            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have formerly spoken of the present Church government, by Archbishops, Bishops, &amp;c. Declaring the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and unsoundnesse thereof, and how farre degenerate, if not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the pure Primitive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apostolicall institution: Also I have touched a little of the other parts, as how unlawfull it was for them to intermeddle in temporall affaires, to use civill power, or to sit as Iudges in any Court, much lesse in the Court of Parliament, where they passe censure and judgement not onely of our lives and liberties, but on the Estates and inheritance and blood, as of us, so of our poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: And as this is unlawfull by the Divine Law, so by the Canons of the Church, yea of this Church, and Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of this Realme, (whereof I shall further enlarge myselfe in my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>ing discourse:) So hath their sitting there beene prejudiciall and obnoxious to Kings and Subjects. Now I desire briefly to declare when and how the Bishops came to be members in the Parliaments in the House of the Lords, and by what meanes they continued their sitting there; because prescription is much insisted upon; although long usage (as King <hi>Iames</hi> truly delivereth) confirmeth no right, (if unlawfull originally, or at convenient times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted.) And whereas it hath beene demanded why the first of our reasons, <hi>viz.</hi> that it hindreth Ecclesiasticall vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

was not urged 600. yeares agoe. I answer, There was then no cause; for the first beginning of Parliaments was not 74. yeares after. But if this had beene delivered of the lawfulnesse and conveniency of their intermedling in temporall affaires, I should have replyed that it hath beene declared not onely 600. but 1600. yeares agoe, and in each century since. But supposing and granting that it was meant of such Parliaments as were before the Conquest, you shall finde that above 600. yeares agoe the Prelates are charged (by their intermedling in secular affaires) to neglect the office of Episcopall function. For this we read: The Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy<note place="margin">Hollinshead.</note> altogether were unlearned, wanton, and vicious, for the Prelates altogether neglected the office of Episcopall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which was to tender the affaires of the Church, and to feed the slocke of Christ, lived themselves idle and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And if any (saith <hi>Higden</hi>) told them that their lives ought<note place="margin">Rand.

            <p>Thus, saith he, they plained the roughnesse of their doings with the smoothnesse of their answers. Briefly, they were so loose and riotous (saith <hi>Gervasius</hi> of Canterbury) that<note place="margin">Gervasius D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as this Bishop had charged the queene his mother with incontinence, so did he likewise the queene his wife <hi>Edith</hi> or <hi>Egith</hi> with adultery; but no lesse untruly and unjustly, then maliciously and enviously, as saith <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> shee being a Lady incomparable, as for beauty, so for vertue, in whose breast there was a Schoole of all liberall Sciences. And the like testifies <hi>Ingulphus,</hi> that had often conference with her, that as she was beautifull, and excellent well lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, so in her demeanour and whole course of life, a virgin most chaste, humble, and unfainedly holy, milde, modest, faithfull, and innocent, not ever hurtfull to any. And doe we not reade that about the yeare 1040. that Bishop <hi>Alfred</hi> had his hand deepe in the murder of Prince <hi>Alfred,</hi> who, having his eyes inhumanely put out, lived not long after, in torment and griefe: Some say he died by a more horrible kinde of cruelty, as his belly was opened, and one end of his bowels fastned to a stake, his body pricked with sharp<note place="margin">W.

These Bishops little regarded Ecclesiasticall vocation or function, but worldly pompe and courtly rule. They cannot bee at as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of States and Parliaments, but their neglected flock must be starved; these feed not their hungry sheepe, but hunger to feed on them; and this care of the world volves them in a world of cares. What hath beene spoken of those Bishops, I wish had not been delivered of other latter Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, wherein I crave leave to speake what others write. That they are growne to that height of idlenesse (the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ignorance and luxury within themselves) and by reason thereof, in contempt and base estimation with the people, that it is thought high time that blood should bee drawn from their swelling veines: I will not (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I might) say with them, that the Commonwealth hath little use of such (I mean of over Lordly Bishops) out for that they are so far degenerated from the Primitive institution, I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96368:4"/>
wish there were reformation, I speake not of demolishing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of amendment and restitution, and untill it appeare that the whole is unsound, I shall not assent to utter extirpation or eradication. Thus much I have made bold to deliver, though not in due place, nor in any purpose to plead against those or any of them that have declared themselves to bee of contrary opinion: I am not ignorant of my disability to enter the lists with any, or to contend with such Worthies in this or other argument: but I hope there will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to me leave and liberty to declare the cause and reason of my vote in this house, in which I have the honour to sit as a member: and if I have erred, I have beene mis-led not onely by learned Fathers and Divines, by Synods and generall Councels, but by great Lords and Barons, yea by the whole Peerage of these Kingdomes of England and France: <hi>Peter</hi> Lord Primandy and Barree, who writ the French Academy, and dedicated the same to <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. King of France and Poland, in that booke and chapter of the causes that bred change, saith, that Bishops and Prelates neglecting their charge to bestow their times in worldly affaires, grew to misliking and contempt, have procured great offences, and marvellous trouble, which may more easily be lamented then taken away, or reformed, being such abuses as have taken deepe root. And what he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth did the Peeres of France unitely deliver, That Bishops should follow Saint <hi>Peters</hi> steps, to winne soules, and not to meddle with wars, and murder of mens bodies.</p>
            <p>But to come neere and to speake of this Kingdome of England, let us heare what the English Lords did declare; we read that they did decree in the time and reigne of King <hi>John,</hi> that Bishops should not intermeddle in civill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, or rule as Princes over their Vas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>enderd; for <hi>Peter,</hi> (say they) received no power but onely in matters pertaining to the Church: and further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging themselves, use these words: It appertaines not to Bishops to deale in secular affaires, since <hi>Peter</hi> onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of our Saviour a power in matters Ecclesiastic all: what (say they) hath the Prelats to entermeddle with wars,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96368:4"/>
such are <hi>Constantines</hi> successors, not <hi>Peters,</hi> whom as they represent not in good actions, so neither doe they in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: Fie on such Rascal Ribaulds, the words in <hi>Paris</hi> are <hi>Marcidi Ribaldi,</hi> how unlike are they to <hi>Peter</hi> that usurpe <hi>Peters</hi> place? But this point of intermedling in secular affaires (though I have often digressed) and intermingled with the former parts, is proved in its proper place to bee unlawfull (<hi>viz.</hi>) in that part that treateth therof, craving pardon for this deviation, I will pursue the present argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (the obnoxiousnesse of their sitting in Parliament) and come to the points I intended to insist on (<hi>viz.</hi>) the entrance of Bishops into the Parliament house, and by what meanes they came there and continued: That they have sate there from the first Parliament to this is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: But as we are not now to consider <hi>an suerunt,</hi> but <hi>an profuerunt,</hi> so are we not to debate and discusse <hi>an factum,</hi> but <hi>an sieri debuit,</hi> for it was the argument of a Pagan (<hi>viz.)

then a Divine, that an a king and sick head of a kingdome, was of necessity to be taken off, and not to bee tampered with by any other physicke, whereby it is probable, that he was the authour of that aenigmaticall verse formerly reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Edwardum occidere, &amp;c.</hi> And well may wee beleeve it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we finde that he caused <hi>Roger Baldock</hi> Bishop of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, the late Lord Chancellour, to die miserably in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate. Not much better were Ely, Lincolne, Winchester, and other Bishops that adhered to the Queene, <hi>Mortimer</hi> and others of her part.

I might tell you how in this Kings reigne, as in others, they perswaded the Lords, and Peeres of the Realme, that they had power and right not onely to reform the Kings House and Councell, and to place and displace all great Officers at their pleasure, but even a joynt interest in the regiment of the Kingdome, together with the King. And now will any say, <hi>No Bishop no King:</hi> yet one word more before I part with these Bishops: What ground-worke they layd, and what meanes they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for the ruine of King and Kingdome, was it not their working upon the impotence of a womans will, insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what indignity it was, that a she daughter of France, being promised to be a Queene, was become no better then a waiting woman, living upon a pension; and so nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her great discontents, perswaded her going to France, which was the matter and Embrion, and as I may say, the chiefe cause of common destruction, which after ensued. God keep all good Princes from hearkning or consenting to the pernitious counsels of such pestilent Priests, and prating Parasites. To declare all their disloyalties in Parliament, and out, would fill a large volume. But now <hi>Brevis esse laboro,</hi> therefore I onely say, that as it was not for their goodnesse, but greatnesse, that they sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

so their sitting there did (I thinke I may say) almost evert Monarchy, yea Regality: with what face can they inculcate that aspersion, <hi>No Bishop, no King?</hi> Certainly, by what I have already delivered, and shall now declare in the reignes of succeeding Princes, it will appeare quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that where Lordly Bishops dominsere and beare rule and sway, neither Kings nor Kingdoms, themselves or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are secure.</p>
            <p>Now to the reigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, did not <hi>John</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury perswade and incite this King and the Parliament, to a most dangerous warre with France, whereby the death of millions hath been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned.

in place of judgement, &amp;c. Here you may note that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop did passe judgement of a great inheritance, no lesse then two or three Kingdomes, and though not betweene two brothers, but cosins, yet did adjudge most wrongfully, as was most apparant. I note withall, that the title of Lord is not assumed by this King-deposing Bishop, nor any other that I reade of. Now what hee had judged in Parliament his holy brother of Canterbury must make good in Pulpit, delivering, What unhappinesse it was to have a childe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Fabian 1. concor.

I also note that this Archbishop was brother to the Earle of Arundell, and at the same time the Archbishop of Yorke a neare kinsman to the Earle of Wiltshire; and who durst then plead against the right of the Bishops sitting in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament?</p>
            <p>In the same Kings reigne <hi>Richard le Scroope</hi> the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Yorke, did in Parliament enter into conspiracy with <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Earle Marshall, against the said King, for which they were both beheaded; I say the Archbishop as well as the Earle Marshall had his head cut off, iterate it, because some have doubted whether an Archbishop may be beheaded. And now in the said Kings reigne, in the Parliament of Coventry, let me also tell you that in the said Parliament, as in other both before and after, a Bill was exhibited against the Temporalties of the Clergy, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that Parliament <hi>Parliamentum indoctorum,</hi> saying that the Commons were fit to enter Common with their cattle, having no more reason then bruit beasts. This is <hi>Speeds</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery; but I take it that he repeateth it as the Prelates cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the house of Commons.</p>

To expiate which, he built a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Oxenford, to pray for the soules slaine in France.

Though what hee did then deliver was true of the Kings right to the Crowne of France (as was also the other of <hi>Iohn</hi> Archbishop of the same See in <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. time, and no lesse true was that of Carlile against <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. title:) Yet I may say it was not the office or function of a Bishop to incense warres domesticke or forraigne. Nay this Bishop did set this warre on foot to divert the King from reformation of the Clergy. For in that Parliament held at Leicester there was a petition declaring that the temporall lands which were bestowed on the Church were super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>From him I come to his sonne <hi>H.</hi> 6.

For wee reade of Archbishop <hi>Bourchier</hi> and other Bishops, that they did shamefully countenance the distraction of the time.

            <p>To passe from this Queen to the next, I finde that in the first yeare of good Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> there was a further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation desired; and what was then earnestly pressed by good Divines, as Doctor <hi>Scorie, Cox,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iewel, Elmer, Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi>

               <hi>Whitehead, Horne, Gest,</hi> was thus farre granted by that godly Princesse that there should bee a conference at Westminster; where being come, they were opposed by the Bishop of Winchester, Lincolne, Lichfield, Carlile, and Chester, together with some others. These Bishops (saith mine Author <hi>Stow,</hi> abruptly broke off this conference, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a mistaking of their directions: and in the next sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting utterly refused either to write their owne, or to read the others reasons, whereby all was undone that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, whereof part was imprinted by <hi>Richard Iugge</hi> and <hi>Iohn Cawood,</hi> as is to be seene: and this was in time of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.

            <p>But I hasten to conclusion. And as this vertuous Queene did yeeld that a disputate should bee had for reformation; so did the gracious Prince King <hi>Iames</hi> grant the like at Hampton Court, where were Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> and Doctor<note place="margin">Conference at Hampton court upon Thursd.

orders and estates as it were of parts, they must bee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in concord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one with another, as it were with equall and due proportion observed betweene each of them. For if one estate be advanced too much above another, dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariseth, equality being the nursing mother of peace, and contrariwise, inequality the beginning of all enmity, factions, hatred, and part-taking. But seeing it is meet that in every well establisht policy there should be a difference of rights and priviledges betwixt every estate, equality may continue, if provision be made that one estate grow not too much before the other: but more of this elsewhere in its more proper place.</p>
            <p>And as for these reasons, I yeelded my vote for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnesse and inconvenience of their sitting there: therefore I wish they may be no longer members of that most Honourable House.</p>
