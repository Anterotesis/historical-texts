            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To whome the kyng promyſed all that he coulde dooe for hym to the vttermoſte extente of his power. Sone after quene Margarete the wife of Henrye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> .vi. came to theim, with her ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne prince Edward and the earle of Penbruck, and alſo of Oxe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forde the whiche a lytle before ſayled ouer to her. After they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muned together, as concernyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſafegard of their bodies, a league was made thorowe the kyng of Fraunce his counſel.

<pb facs="tcp:3945:271"/>
Alſo the erle and the duke promyſed faithfullye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they woulde not geue ouer, vnto ſuche tyme that kyng Henrye the .vi. or Edwarde his ſoonne were proclaymed kyng of Englande, &amp; after kyng Hen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, that the erle and the duke ſhould ouerſee and gouerne the realme by the wyll and apoyntmente of the quene Margarete and her ſonne prince Ed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde, vnto ſuche tyme that the forenamed prince wer of lawfull age and habilitee, the whiche they promyſed faythfully to obſerue and dooe as they wer apoynted. And beſydes theſe, many other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions were made, aſwel for that reaſon did ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, as the buſynes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was at that tyme.

When he had receaued theſe letters, he purpoſed to go forth, and take the oportunitee of the tyme.

Therfore the Earle and the Duke than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the king as highly as they coulde for that he had doone ſo much for theim, dyd take their leaue and ſayled vnto Englande with all their armie.

                  <p>After that the Earle came to lande, he made a proclamacion in king Henry the .vi. name, that all they that were of lawfull age ſhoulde make bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle agaynſt Edwarde duke of Yorke whiche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte all ryghte and lawe at that tyme had the crowne.

if he would go quickely, he ſhould take no harme. But he ſpeakyng veraye gentely to euerye one of theim, &amp; callyng ſome by name, mooſt gentely did deſire theim y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might come into his owne toune And ſo paſſyng all the daye in that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municacion, at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> length the citezens partely ouer come w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his mooſt ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle ſpeakyng, &amp; large promiſes made, fell to this poincte, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if Edward would ſwere to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle his citezens after a gentle ſorte, &amp; hereafter bee obedient to kyng Henry his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, thei would receiue hym in to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> citee, and helpe hym w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> power that thei might.

After that it was knowen that kyng Edward came w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out all daunger of his enemies, to Notyngham, then came there to hym many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, vpon this conſideracion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the lord Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Then Edward came to Warwike, and frome thens to the erle, and pitched his tentes by hym, and the next daie after bad battaill to therle, the whiche erle durſt not come oute, for feare that the duke of Clarence whome he thought had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued hym, which duke in deede came, as it was ſhewed after with a greate power of menne. The whiche when Edward perceaued, he made towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des hym, &amp; that it ſhould not bee thought to bee a made guyle, ſette his hooſt in araye as though he would fight, and ſo did the duke. But when thei came in ſight, Richard duke of Glouceſtre as one that ſhould take vp this matter, firſte ſpake with the duke priuely in his eare, and then came to Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and did the ſame to hym, and at the laſte

At theſame tyme there came letters from the earle to kyng Henry, to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> duke of Somerſet, to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhop of Yorke, and other of the kyng his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould kepe the citee from their enemies handes for the ſpace of .ij. or .iij. dayes, &amp; he would come ſtreyght with a great armye of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne.

And Edward hearyng of this prepared his armye, and adioyned a greate po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of young menne to theim, and ſo with bowes, bylles, ſpeares and arowes, and all maner inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes apperteynyng to warre, he had ſo furnyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his menne, that he thought to make riddau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of theim at that tyme for all, and fyniſhe battayle that was ſo longe holden. And ſo came with this his armye to mete his enemies, and that he might bee the redier to fight with theim whereſoeuer he mette theim, he had foure wynges, that they could eſcape hym at no hand. And he brought with hym to battayle alſo Henry then priſoner, to the entente that his aduerſaries might bee the more diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the ſight of hym, or els, if fortune fauoured hym not, he might neuertheleſſe bee ſaued by him. After the noone, he pytched his tentes at the fore named Barnet nighe to hys enemyes, but that he myghte not fyghte that daye, he defended hys tentes veraye ſtrongelye, for the longer he tary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the better it was, by reaſon of the daylye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of noble men and commen people to hym, and the woorſe for the earle, for that he was farre from his frendes.</p>

Fyrſte the lorde Marques and the earle of Oxenforde was ſet on the lefte ſyde wyth certayn horſſemen, and he hymſelfe with the duke of Exceter on the ryght ſyde.

And thus araiyng theim to this battayl, beganne to exhorte theim, that thei would fight luſtely and lyke hardye meune, reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng the quarell of their countree, for that he had moſte falſely poſſeſſed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> croune. In like maner did kyng Edward, whiche after that he had ſet theim in ordre, encouraged theim to fight lykewyſe, and to remembre that thei inuaded rebelles, traytours and ſedicious perſons, whiche entended nothynge but the vtter deſtruccion and loſſe of theyr coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree. When daye came, the trompettes beganne to blowe on bothe ſydes, as the tokens and lignes of the battayle. And firſte the bowe men ſhot, &amp; then drawynge nere tryed it with ſweorde. Edwarde truſtyng thorowe the multitude of his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue the better ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d did ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de ſtiffely to theim, enboulde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng his ſouldiours in all that he coulde.

Then he him ſelf moſte valiauntly came among the myddeſt of his enemyes, and there kylled and ſlewe many of theim, where he hym ſelfe at the laſte was ſtriken downe and his brother lorde Marques then folo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wing hym, after whoſe deathe all the other fled, &amp; ſo were taken moſte parte of theim.

The Quene miſtruſting and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring yet muche of her owne ſoonne, aunſwered &amp; ſaied that ſhe allowed his counſell well, yf ſo that ſhe only might bee in daunger, and not her ſonne And therfore fearing that when they fought moſt earneſtly for their countree, her ſoonne might bee deſtroied or caſte awaye, ſhe thought beſt either to putte of and differre the battayl to an other time, or elles to ſende her ſoonne into Fraunce, &amp; there to bee kepte vnto ſuche tyme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they had ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſſe in their warres.

And gathering his armie went to Oxforde ſhyre, and there pytched hys tentes at Abyngton, encreaſinge hys nomber and army as much as he could.

And we all I thinke bee content that bothe her children bee with her if ſhe came frome thence and bee in ſuche place where they maye bee with theyr honoure.

But the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why the duke and the kyng fell oute, is of dyuerſe folke dyuerſe wyſe pretended. This duke as you haue hearde before, aſſone as the duke of Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter after the death of kyng Edward was come to Yorke, &amp; there had ſolempne funerall ſeruice dooen for kyng Edward, ſent to hym a ſecrete ſeruaunt of his called Perſall, with ſuche meſſages as you haue hearde before. And after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Buckyng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ham came with thre hundred horſſe to Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and ſtill continued with hym, as partener and chief organe of all his deuices till after his coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion, thei departed to all ſemyng verye frendes at Glouceſtre. From whence aſſone as the duke came home, he ſo highly turned from hym and ſo highly conſpired againſt hym, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne would meruell wherof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge grewe in ſo ſhorte ſpace. Some ſaie this occaſyon was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a litle before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ronacion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke required the kyng emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt other thrnges to bee reſtored to the Erle of Herffordes la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>oes. And foraſmuche as the title whiche he clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by inherytaunce, was ſomewhat interlaced with the title of Lancaſter, whiche houſe made a title to the croune, and enioyed theſame three dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes, as all menne knewe, till the houſe of Yorke depryued the third kyng, whiche was Henry the ſixte. Kyng Rychard ſomewhat miſtruſted &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued ſuche an indignacion that he reiected the dukes requeſt, with many ſpitefull and minotary woordes, whiche ſo wounded the dukes hearte w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hatred and miſtruſt, that he could neuer after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="lxxxiii" facs="tcp:3945:341"/>
to looke ryght on kyng Rychard, but euer feared his owne lyfe, ſo farrefoorth that when the protectoure ſhould ryde to his coronacion, feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hymſelfe ſycke, becauſe he would dooe hym no honoure. And the other takyng it in euell parte ſente hym woorde to ryſe and ryde or he would make hym to be caryed. Wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gorgeouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled and ſumpteouſly trapped with burnyng carte naues of golde embrodered, he roade before the kyng through London with an euell wyll and woorſſe heart. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> notwithſtandyng, he roaſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daye of the coronacion from the feaſte, feignyng hym ſelfe ſycke, whiche kyng Richarde ſayde was dooe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hate and ſpight of hym. And therfore men ſayd that eche of theim euer after lyued co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tynual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuche hatred and dyſtruſt of other, that the duke looked verelye to haue bene murthered at Glouceſtre, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche he in fayre maner departed but ſurely ſuche as were right ſecrete with bothe, affyrme all this to be vntrue, and other wyſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne thynke it vnlykely, the depe dyſſymulyng nature of bothe theſe menne well conſydered. And what nede in that grene world the protectoure hadde of the duke, and in what perell the duke ſtoode yf he fell once in ſuſpycion of that tyraunte, that other y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> protectoure would geue the duke occaſyon of dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, or the duke the protectoure occaſyon of myſtruſt. And ſurely menne thynke, that if kyng Rychard hadde any ſuche opynyon conceaued in hym, he would neuer haue ſuffred hym to aduoyd his handes or eſcape his power, but verye true it is, that the duke of Buckyngham was an high mynded man, &amp; euell could beare the glorye of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,

ſo that I haue hearde of ſome that ſawe it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he at ſuche tyme that the croune was ſet vpon the protectoures hedde, his yie could neuer abyde the ſight therof, but wryed his hed another waye, but men ſayde he was not well at eaſe, and that was both to kyng Richard well knowen and well take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor any demaunde of the dukes requeſt vncurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reiected, but gentelye deferred, but bothe he with greate giftes and high beheſtes in moſte lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng and truſtie maner departed from the kyng to Glouceſter. But ſone after his commyng home to Brecknocke, hauyng there by kyng Richardes commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doctour Moorton byſhop of Ely who before as you haue hearde was taken at the councell at the towre, waxed with hym very famy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer, whoſe onlye wyſedome abuſed his pryde to his owne delyueraunce &amp; the dukes dyſtruccion. The byſhop was a man of great natural wyt, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye well learned and of honourable behaueoure, lackyng no wyſe wayes to wynne fauour. He was fyrſt vpon the parte of kyng Henry, whyle y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> parte was in wealth, and neyther left it nor forſoke it in no woo, but fled the realme with the quene and the prince. And while kyng Edward had kyng Henry in pryſon, he neuer retourned but to the felde at Barner. After whiche felde loſte &amp; vtterly ſubdued &amp; al parte takynges extynguiſhed, kyng Edward for his faſt faythe and wyſedome, was not onelye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to receaue hym but alſo wooed hym to come and had hym fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thenſforth both in ſecrete truſt &amp; ſpecyall fauoure, whom he nothyng deceaued. For he beyng after kyng Edwardes death fyrſt taken by the tyraunt for his truthe to the kynge, founde

meane to ſette the duke in his toppe, and ioyned gentlemen together in ayde of the erle of Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounde, whiche after was named kyng Henrye the ſeuenth.

But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former purpoſe, he by the long &amp; often alternate proffe, aſwel of proſperytee as aduerſe of fortune, had gotten by great experience the verey mother &amp; maſtreſſe of wyſedome, a depe inſight in pollytike worldlye driftes, whereby perceauynge nowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men with hym, fed hym w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fayre woordes and many pleaſaunt prayſes, and percea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyng by the grefe of their communicacions the dukes pryde nowe and then to balke oute a lytle brayde of enuye towarde the glorye of the kynge, and thereby feelynge hym eaſye to fall oute yf the matter were well handled, he craftely ſoughte the wayes to prycke hym forwarde, takynge alwayes the occaſyon of hys commynge, and alſo keepynge hymſelfe clooſe wythin hys ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, that he rather ſemed to folowe hym then to

leade hym. For when the duke beganne fyrſte to prayſe and boaſte the kyng and ſhewe how muche profite the realme ſhould take by his reigne. By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe Morton aunſwered, ſurely my lorde, folye it were for me to lye, for I am ſure yf I woulde ſwere the contrarye ye would not once beleue me, but yf the worlde would haue begone as I would haue wyſhed, that kyng Henryes ſoonne had had the croune and not kynge Edwarde, then woulde I haue bene his true and faythfull ſubiecte, but after that God had ordeyned hym to loſe it, and kyng Edwarde to reigne, I was neuer ſo madde with a dead manne to ſtryue agaynſt the quycke, ſo was I euer to kynge Edwarde a faythfull and true chapeleyn, and gladde would haue bene that his chyldren ſhoulde haue ſucceded hym, howbeit yf the ſecrete iudgemente of God haue otherwyſe prouyded, I purpoſe not to ſpurne agaynſte the prycke, nor laboure to ſet vp that God pulleth downe. And as for the late protectoure and nowe kyng, and with that woorde he left, ſauynge that he ſaide that he hadde alreadye medled to muche with the worlde, and would from that daye medle with his booke and bedes, and no ferther. Then longed the duke ſore to heare what he woulde haue ſayde, becauſe he ended with the kynge, and there ſo ſodeynlye ſtopped, and exhorted hym fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mylyerly, betwene theim bothe to bee bolde and to ſaye whatſoeuer he thought, whereof he fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye promyſed there ſhoulde neuer come hurte, and paraduenture more good then he woulde were. And that he hym ſelfe entended to vſe hys faythfull ſecrete aduyce and counſayle, which
<pb n="lxxxv" facs="tcp:3945:343"/>
he ſayed was the onlye cauſe for the whyche he procured of the kynge to haue hym in hys cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, where he myghte recon hym ſelfe at home, or elles he hadde bene putte in the handes of theim wyth whome he ſhoulde not haue founde lyke fauoure. The biſhoppe right humblye than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hym and ſayed, in good faythe my lorde, I loue not muche to talke of prynces as of a thynge not all oute of perell, althoughe the woorde bee without faute, but as it pleaſeth the prince to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtrue it. And euer I thynke on Iſopes tale, that when the Lyon had proclaymed that on payne of deathe there ſhoulde no horned beaſtes come into the wood, one beaſte that had a bonche of fleſhe growing oute of his hedde, fledde a greate pace: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Foxe that ſawe hym flye with all the haſte, aſked hym whether he fledde? In fayth ꝙ he, I neither wote ne recke ſo I were once hence, becauſe of the proclamacyon made agaynſte horned beaſtes.</p>
                  <p>What foole ꝙ the foxe, the Lyon neuer ment it by the, for that whiche thou haſte is no horne in thy hedde. No mary ꝙ he, I wote that well ynoughe, but yf he ſaye it is a horne, where am I then? The duke laughed merely at the tale &amp; ſaied, my lorde I warraunte you, neither the Lyon nor the bore ſhall pycke any matter at any thyng here ſpoken, for it ſhall neuer come nere their cares. In good faythe ſyr ſaied the Byſhoppe, yf it dyd, the thyng that I was aboute to ſaye taken aſwell as before God I mente, it coulde deſerue but thanke, and yet taken as I wene it would, myghte happen to turne me to lytle good and you to leſſe.</p>
                  <p>Then longed the duke muche more to were what

                  <p>And when he was in Brytayn, he receaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his frendes out of Englande knowledge that the duke of Buckyngham was behedded, and that the Marques of Dorceſtre with a greate nombre of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble men of Englande had bene there a lytle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſeke hym, and that they wer now in Veneti a cytie in Brytayne. The whiche thynges beynge knowen to the erle, he on the one parte did greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lament the death and euel chaunce of his chiefe and princypall frende, but yet on the other parte he greatlye reioyſed in that he had ſo many &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble menne to take his parte in the battayll.

<pb facs="tcp:3945:350"/>
that his purpoſe ſhoulde well frame and come to paſſe, determyned with hym ſelfe with all expedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to ſet foorth warde, and therupon wente to a place in Brytayn called Rhedon, and from thence ſent to the Marques with all the other noble men that they ſhould come vnto hym. Then when they hearde that Henrye was ſafe returned into Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne reioyſed not a lytle, for thei had thought he had landed in Englande, and ſo fallen into the handes of kyng Richarde, and they made not a lytle haſte tyll they wer come vnto hym.

And Henry ſware firſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſyng that aſſone as he ſhould poſſeſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croune of England, that he woulde marye Elyzabeth the doughter of Edward the .iiii. and after warde they ſware feaultie &amp; homage vnto hym eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as though he had already bene kyng, and ſo from that tyme foorthe dyd take hym, promyſyng hym that thei would ſpende bothe their lyfes and goodes with hym, &amp; that Richard ſhould no le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger reigne ouer theim. When this was dooen, Henry declared all theſe thynges to the duke of Britayne, praiynge &amp; deſyryng hym nowe of helpe, and that he woulde ayde hym with a greater nombre of menne, &amp; alſo to lende hym a frendly &amp; honeſt ſomme of moneye that he might nowe recouer his right and enheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce of the croune of England, vnto y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he was called &amp; deſyred by al the lordes &amp; nobilitee of

                  <p>After this he called a parliament wherin was deereed, that all thoſe that were fled oute of the lande ſhould be reputed and taken as enemyes to the realme, and all their landes and goodes to bee forfayte and confiſcate.

And by the authoryte of the ſame perliament, a peace was concluded with the Scot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, whiche a lytle before had ſkyrmyſhed with the borderers. Which thyng brought to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng ſuppoſed all conſpiracye to bee clene auoyded, for aſmuche as the duke with other of his compaig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie were put to death, and alſo certen other ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhed. Yet for all this, kyng Richard was day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye vexed and troubled, partelye myſtruſtynge his owne ſtrength, and partely fearyng the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of Henrye with his compaignye, ſo that he lyued but in a myſerable caſe. And becauſe that he would not ſo continue any lenger, he determyned with hym ſelfe to put awaye the cauſe of this his feare and buſyneſſe, either by pollecye or elles by ſtrength. And after that he hadde thus purpoſed with hym ſelfe, he thought nothyng better then to tempte the duke of Britayn yet once again eyther with money, prayer or ſome other ſpeciall rewarde becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had in kepyng the erle Henry, &amp; moſte chiefly, becauſe he knewe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was only he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might delyuer hym from all his trouble by delyueryng or impriſoning the ſayed Henry.

there beyng with hym, yf he woulde after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyte of the ambaſſadoures put theim in pryſone. The Ambaſſadoures beynge departed and come where the duke laye could not haue communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion with hym, for aſmuch as by extreme ſickneſſe his wyttes were feble and weake. Wherfore one Peter Landoſe his Treaſourer a manne bothe of pregnaunte wytte and of greate authoritee, tooke this matter in hand. For whiche cauſe he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde hated of all the lordes of Britain. With this Peter the Engliſhe ambaſſadoures had com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>municacion, &amp; declaring to hym the kynges meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage deſyred hym inſtantlye, for aſmuche as they knewe that he might bring theyr purpoſe to paſſe that he woulde graunt vnto kyng Richardes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and he ſhoulde haue the yerely reuenues of all the landes of the ſayed lordes.

                  <p>Then the earle Henry ſetting all his buſineſſe in as good ſtaye &amp; ordre as he mighte, talked lytle and made fewe a counſail herof, &amp; for the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedicyon hereof, he cauſed therle of Penbrucke ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cretly to cauſe all the noble men to take their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, diſſembling to ride vnto the duke of Bretain, but when they came to the vttermoſt partes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they ſhould forſake the waye that led theim to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the duke, and to make into Fraunce with all that euer they might.

                  <p>But within foure dayes after that the Earle was thus eſcaped. Peter receaued from kyng Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard the confirmacion of the graunte and promi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes made for the betreiyng of Henry and the other nobles. Wherfore the ſaide Peter ſente oute after hym horſes and menne with ſuche expedicion and ſpede to haue taken hym, that ſcacely the erle was entred Fraunce one houre but they were at his he<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les.

                  <p>But it happened contrary to theyr exſpectacyon for the duke of Britaine taking the matter ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyndely that Henry ſhould bee ſo vſed with hym that for feare he ſhoulde bee compelled to flee his lande, was not a lytle vexed with Peter, to whom (althoughe that he was ignoraunte of the fraude

When the earle ſawe his menne come and hearde this comfortable newes, he not a lytle reioyſed, deſiring the meſſengers that returned to ſhewe vnto the duke, that he truſted ere long time to ſhewe him ſelfe not to bee vnthankeful for this greate kyndneſſe that he nowe ſhewed vnto hym. And within fewe dayes after, the earle went vnto Charles the French kyng, to whome after he had rendred thankes for the great benefites and kind neſſe that he had receaued of hym, the cauſe of his comming fyrſte declared, then he beſought him of his helpe and ayde, whiche ſhoulde bee an immor tall benefite to hym and his lordes, of whome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallye he was called vnto the kyngdome, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they ſo abhorred the tiranny of kyng Ry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chard. Charles promiſed hym helpe and bade him to be of good chere &amp; to take no care, for he would gladly declare vnto hym his beneuolence. And the ſame tyme Charles remoued and tooke with hym Henry and all the other noble menne.</p>
                  <p>Whyle Henry remained there, Iohn Earle of Oxenford (of whome is before ſpoken) which was put in priſone by Edward the fourth in the caſtell of Hammes with alſo Iames Blounte Capteine
<pb n="xcv" facs="tcp:3945:353"/>
of that caſtell, and Iohn Forſkewe knyghte Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the towne of Caleies, came vnto hym. But Iames the capitain, becauſe he lefte his wife in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſtell, dyd furnyſhe the ſame with a good gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of men before his departure.</p>
                  <p>Henry when he ſawe therle, was out of meaſure glad y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſo noble a man and of greate experience in battayl, and ſo valiaunt &amp; hardie a knight, whom he thought to bee moſte feithfull and ſure, for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as he had in the time of Edward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth, continuall battail with hym in defending of Hen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry the ſyxte, thought that nowe he was ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that he coulde not deſire to bee better, and therfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated vnto hym all his whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, to bee ordred and ruled only by hym. Not longe after Charles the Frenche kyng remoued again to Paris, whome Henry folowed, and there againe moued and beſoughte the kyng as he had moſte fauourably &amp; kindely entreteigned hym all this time, not only in wordes, but alſo in dedes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it would lykewiſe pleaſe hym yet ſo much further to extend his fauoure &amp; beneuolence vnto hym that nowe he woulde ayde and helpe hym forwarde in his iourney, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> not onely he, but alſo all the lordes and nobilytee of Englande myghte iuſtely haue cauſe to knowlage and confeſſe that by the meane of his fauoure and goodneſſe they were reſtored againe to the poſſeſſyon of their enherytaunces, whiche withoute hym they coulde not well bryng to paſſe.</p>
                  <p>In the meane while, his fortune was ſuche, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> many Englyſhe menne came ouerdaylye oute of Englande vnto him, and many whiche then were

in Paris, amonge whome were diuerfe ſtudente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that fell vnto his parte bothe more and leſſe, and ſpecially there was one, whoſe name was Richard Foxe a Preeſt, beyng a manne of a ſynguler good wytte and learning, whome Henry ſtreyght waye reteigned and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted all his ſecretes vnto hym and whome alſo afterward he promoted to many hyghe promocyons, and at the laſte he made hym biſhop of Wincheſter.</p>
                  <p>Richarde then hearyng of all this conſpiracye and of the greate ayde that dayly wente ouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Henry, thought yet for all this, that if he might bring to paſſe that Henry ſhould not couple in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryage with the blood of king Edwarde, that then he ſhoulde dooe well ynoughe with hym and kept hym from the poſſeſſyon of the croune. Then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſed he with hym ſelfe all the wayes and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that myghte bee howe to bryng this to paſſe. And fyrſte he thoughte it to bee beſte with fayre woordes &amp; large promeſſes to attempte the quene whoſe fauoure obteygned, he doubted not but ſhortelye to fynde the meanes to haue bothe her doughters oute of her handes into his owne, and then reſted nothynge but yf he hym ſelfe myghte fynde the meanes after warde to marye one of the ſame doughters, whereby he thought he ſhoulde make all ſure and ſafe to the vtter diſapoyntinge of Henrye.

Thomas lorde Marques of Dorſet, of all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that coulde be deſyred. Theſe meſſengers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng men of grauitee, handled the quene ſo e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Kyng Richard (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quene Elizabeth was thus brought into a fooles paradyce) after he had recea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued al his brothers doughters from the ſanctuary into his palayce, thought there nowe remayned nothyng to be dooen, but only the caſtyng awaye and deſtroiyng of his owne wife, whiche thynge he had wholy purpoſed and decreed within hym ſelfe. And there was nothyng that feared hym ſo much from this mooſte cruell &amp; deteſtable murder as the loſyng of the good opynion y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he thought the people had conceyued of hym, for as ye haue heard before, he faigned hym ſelfe to be a good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and thought the people had eſtemed hym euen ſo. Notwithſtandyng ſhortly after, his foreſaide vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious purpoſe, ouercame al this honeſt feare.
<pb facs="tcp:3945:355"/>
And firſt of all, he abſteyned from beddyng or ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng with her: and alſo found him ſelf greued with the barre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neſſe of his wife, that ſhe was vnfruteful and brought hym forth no chyldren, complamyng therof very greuouſly vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nobles of his realme and chieflye aboue other vnto Thomas Rothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rame then archebiſhoppe of Yorke (whome he had delyuered a lytle afore oute of pryſon) the whiche byſhop did gather of this, that the quene ſhould be rid out of the waye, ere it were long after (ſuche experience had he of kyng Richardes complexcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who had practiſed many lyke thynges not longe before) &amp; theſame tyme alſo he made dyuerſe of his ſecrete frendes preuy of theſame his coniecture.</p>
                  <p>After this, he cauſed a rumoure to ronne amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the commen people (but he woulde not haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>toure knowen) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the quene was dead, to thentent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe hearyng this meruelous rumour, ſhould take ſo greueous a conceyt that anone after ſhe ſhould fall into ſome great diſeaſe, ſo that he would aſſay that waye, in caſe it ſhould chaunce her afterward to be ſicke, dead or otherwyſe murdred, that then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people might impute her death vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thought ſhe tooke or els to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſickeneſſe.

The kyng made aunſwere with a ſmi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyng and diſſimulyng countenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teryng

woordes, byddyng her to bee of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte and to plucke vp her heart for there was no ſuche thyng toward her that he knewe. But howe ſo euer it fortuned, either by ſorowe or els by poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonyng, within fewe daies after, the quene was dedde and afterwarde was buryed in the abbay of Weſtminſter. This is the ſame Anne, one of Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard the earle of Warwikes doughters whiche once was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracted to prince Edwarde kyng He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the ſixt his ſoonne.</p>
                  <p>The kyng beyng thus delyuered of his wife fantaſied a pace ladye Elizabeth his nice, deſiryng in any wiſe to mary with her: but becauſe that all menne, yee and the mayden her ſelf abhorred this vnlawfull deſire, as a thyng mooſte deteſtable, he determined with hym ſelf to make no greate haſt in the matter, chiefly for that he was in a pecke of troubles, fearyng leaſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of the noble menne ſome would forſake hym &amp; runne vnto Henry his part, the other at the leſte would fauoure the ſecrete con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpiracy made again hym, ſo that of his ende there was almooſt no doubte. Alſo the more parte of the commen people were in ſo greate diſpeare, that many of theim had rather to bee accompted in the noumbre of his enemies, then to put theim ſelfes in ieopardy bothe of loſſe of body and goodes in takyng of his parte.</p>
                  <p>And emongeſt thoſe noble menne whom he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, firſt was Thomas Standley and Wyllyam his brother, Gylbert Talbote, &amp; of other a greate nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, of whoſe purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though kyng Rychard was ignoraunt, neuertheleſſe he truſted not one of theim, and leſt of all Thomas Standley, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:3945:356"/>
he had maryed Henryesanother, as it maye well appeare by this that fol oweth. For when the ſayd Thomas woulde haue departed from the courte vnto his owne manſion for his recreacion (as he ſaide) but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truthe was, becauſe he woulde bee in a readyneſſe to receaue Henry and ayde hym at his commyng into the realme. But the kyng did let hym, and would not ſuffer hym to departe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll ſuche tyme he had left in the courte behynde hym George Strange his ſoonne and heyre for a pledge. And whyle kynge Richarde was thus wrapped in feare and care of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tumulte that was to come, lo, euen then tydynges came that Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye was entred into the lande, and that the caſtell of Hammes was prepared to receiue Henry, by the meanes of the erle of Oxenforde whiche then was fled with Iames Blunte keper of the caſtell vnto Henry.</p>
                  <p>Then kyng Rychard, thynkyng at the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to ſtey all this matter, ſent forth with all haſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he greater parte that were then at Calyce to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the ſaid caſtell again. Thoſe that were in the caſtell, when thei ſawe their aduerſaries make towardes theim, ſpedely thei armed theim ſelfes to defence and in al haſt ſent meſſengers to He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry, deſyryng hym of ayde. Henry forthwith ſent the erle of Oxenforde with a choſen ſorte of menne to aſſiſt theim, and at their firſt commyng they laid ſiege not farre from the caſtell. And whyle kyng Rychardes menne turned backe hauyng an yie towardes theim: Thomas Brandon with thirty valeaunt menne of the otherſide gate ouer a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in to the caſtell, to ſtrength theim that were
<pb n="xcviii" facs="tcp:3945:356"/>
within. Then thei that were within laid heard to their charge that were without, on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> otherſide, the erle of Oxenford ſo valiantly aſſayled them of the backeſide that thei were glad to make proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to theim that were within, that if thei would be content to geue ouer the caſtell, thei ſhould haue free liberte to departe with all that euer thei had. The erle of Oxenforde hearyng this, whiche came onely to ſaue his frendes from hurte, and namely Iames Bluntes wife, was contented with this condicion and departed in ſaufgarde with all his frendes returning backe to Henry, whiche was at Paris. After this, kyng Rychard was informed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Frenche kyng was wery of Henry &amp; his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paignie, and would doo nothyng for hym, wherby Henry was nowe not hable in maner to helpe him ſelf, ſo that it was not poſſible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhuld preuaile or goo forwarde in thenterpriſe that he thoughte to haue taken in hande agaynſt kynge Rycharde.</p>
                  <p>Kynge Rycharde beeyng brought thus into a falſe paradice, thought hym ſelfe to bee out of all feare, and that there was no cauſe why he ſhould beynge ſo ſure, ones to wake oute of hys ſlepe or trouble hym ſelfe any furder, and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led backe hys nauye of ſhyppes that then was redy vpon the ſea, whyche was fullye furnyſhed to haue ſcoured the ſeas. But yet for the more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retie leaſt he ſhould bee ſodenly oppreſſed, he gaue commaundemente to the greatte men dwellynge by the ſea ſyde (and ſpecyally the Welſhemen) to watche nyghte and daye, leaſte his aduerſaries ſhuld haue eny oportunitee to entre into the lande. As the faſhyon is in time of warre that thoſe that
<pb facs="tcp:3945:357"/>
dwell by the ſees ſide ſhould make bekyns in the higheſt places there about, whiche might bee ſene afarre of, ſo that when it ſhould chaunce their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes to aryue towarde the lande, by and by they ſhould fyre theyr bekyns and rayſe the countreye, to thentent that quickely from place to place they might be aſcerteyned of all the whole matter and alſo to arme theim ſelfes ſpedelye agaynſte theyr enemies.</p>
                  <p>And ſo to come to our purpoſe agayn, kyng Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard thorough the aforeſaide tydynges, beganne to bee more careleſſe and recheleſſe, as who ſaye, he had no power to withſtand the deſteny that honge ouer his hedde. Suche is the prouydent iuſtyce of God, that a manne dooeth leſte knowe, prouyde &amp; beware when the vengeaunce of God is euen at hande for his offences. And to go forth, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme when Henry the earle of Richemounte remayned in Fraunce entretyng and ſuyng for ayde &amp; helpe of the Frenche men, many of the chiefe noble men, which had the realme in gouernaunce (becauſe of the young age of Charles the kyng) fel ſomewhat at diſſencion, of the whiche variaunce, Lewes the prynce of Orlyaunce was the chiefe and hedde, whiche becauſe he had maryed Iohanne the kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſyſter looked to haue bene chiefe gouernoure of all the realme. By the which meanes it came to paſſe, that no one man had the princypall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of the realme. And therefore Henry the erle was conſtraigned to ſue vnto all the nobles ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallye one after another deſyrynge and praiynge theim of aide and helpe in his purpoſe, and thus the matter was prolonged. In the meane tyme
<pb n="xcix" facs="tcp:3945:357"/>
Thomas the Marques of Dorcet (of whome we ſpake afore) was preuely ſent for to come home by his mother, partely myſtruſtynge that Henrye ſhould not preuayle, and partly for the greate and large promeſſes that kyng Richard had made to her for hym before. Whiche letters when the ſayd Marques had receaued, he beleuyng all thynges that his mother wrote vnto hym, and alſo thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng that Henry ſhould neuer preuayle, and that the Frenchemen did but mocke and daylye with hym: he ſodeynly in the night tyme conueyed hym ſelfe out of Parys and with great ſpede made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes Flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders. The whiche thyng when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> erle and other of the Engliſhe lordes heard of, thei wer ſore aſtonned &amp; amaſed, &amp; with all ſpede purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Charles the kyng a lycence and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement that the Marques might by ſteyed wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he wer found w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the dominion of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce chiefly for that he was ſecrete of their councel and knewe all there purpoſe. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was quickly obteyned &amp; poſtes made forth euery waye, emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt whom one Humfrey Cheyncy plaiyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parte of a good blooddehounde ſo truely, ſmelled out and folowed the trace, that by and by he found out and toke the Marques: and ſo handled &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded hym with gentle and good woordes, that ſhortely after he was content to retourne.</p>
                  <p>Then Henry beyng delyuered of this chaunce, thought it beſt to prolonge the matter no farther leaſt he ſhould looſe both the preſent oportunytee and alſo wery his frendes that looked for hym in Englande. Wherfore he made haſte and ſet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde with a ſmall army obteyned of the Frenche
<pb facs="tcp:3945:358"/>
kyng, of whom he alſo borowed ſome money, and ſome of other of his frendes, for the whiche he left the Marques and Ihon Burchere behynde for a pledge. And ſo ſetting forward came to Roan, and whyle he taryed there and prepared ſhippyng at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hauen of Seyne, tydynges cam to hym y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng: Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardes wyfe was deade, &amp; purpoſed to mary with the lady Elyſabeth, kyng Edwardes eldeſt dough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter being his nice, &amp; that he had maried Cycile her ſyſter to a mannes ſonne of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de far vnderneth her degre. At the whiche thyng, Henry was ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſed and troubled, thynkyng that by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes al his purpoſe was daſhed, for that there was no other waye for hym to come to the kyngdome but only by the maryage of one of kyng Edwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des doughters. And by this menes alſo, he feared leaſt his frendes in Englande would ſhrynke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym for lacke of an honeſt title. But after thei had conſulted vpon the matter, thei thought it beſt to cary a lytle to proue if they might gette more helpe and make mo frendes. And among all other, they thought it beſt to adioyne the lord Harbarte vnto theim, whiche was a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great power in Wales and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhould be brought to paſſe by this meanes, for that the lorde Harbarte had a ſyſter maryable, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Henry would be content to mary, if he would take their part. And to bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g al this matter to paſſe meſſengers were ſent to Henry the erle of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humberlande, whiche had maryed the other ſyſter ſo that he ſhould bryng this matter about, but the wayes were ſo beſet that the meſſengers could not come to hym.</p>
                  <p>And in the meane ſeaſon, came veray good ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynges

from Ihon ap Morgan a temporall law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, whiche ſignified vnto theim that ſyr Ryce ap Thomas a noble and valiaunt man and Ihon Sauage, fauoured his parte earneſtlye and alſo ſyr Reynolde Braye had prepared a greate ſumme of mony to wage battayl on his parte and to helpe hym, and therfore he woulde they ſhould make haſt with all that euer they could, and make towarde Wales.</p>
                  <p>Then Henry ſpedely prepared hym ſelfe becauſe he would lynger his frendes no lenger. And after that he had made his prayer vnto almightye God that he might haue good ſucceſſe in his iourney, only with two thouſande menne and a fewe ſhyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes in the calendes of Auguſt he ſayled from the hauen of Seyne, and the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th daye after whiche was the .xxii. daye of Auguſt, he aryued in Wales aboute ſonne ſet &amp; la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded at Wilforde hauen, &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parte whiche is called the Dale, where he hearde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was dyuerſe layde in wayte for hym, to kepe hym backe.

Here he had contrarye tydynges brought to that he hearde in Norma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dy afore, that ſyr Ryce ap Thomas and Ihon Sauage wythal that euer they coulde make, were of kyng Richar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des parte.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtandynge, they had ſuche tydynges ſent theim fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the menne of Pembruche by a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe name was Arnold Butteler, that it reioyſed all their heartes, whiche was, that

yf all former offences might bee remitted, they woold bee in a redyneſſe to ſticke vnto there owne Geſpare the erle. Then Henryes company by this meanes beeyng encreaſed, departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Harforde fyue myle towarde Cardygane, and then while he refreſhed his menne, ſodenly came a rumoure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym that the lorde Harbarte whiche dwelled at Carmerdyne was nye at hande with a greate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye of menne. At the whiche rumoure there was a greate ſturre amongeſte theim, euerye manne tooke hym ſelfe to his weapon and made theim ſelfes redye if nede were, to fight, and a lytle while they were all afrayed, tyl ſuch tyme as Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye had ſent out horſemen to trye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truthe, whiche when thei came agayn, declared that all thynges was quiet and that ther was no ſuche thyng.

And becauſe he woulde aſcertayne his frendes in Englande howe all the matter went forwad with hym, he ſent of his mooſt truſtye frendes to ladye Margarete his mother, to Standely, to Talbot, and to other of his moſt eſpecial frendes with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain commaundementes. The effecte of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes were, that he intended with the helpe of hys frendes to paſſe ouer Seuerne and by Shreweſbury to make toward London. Ther fore he deſyred theim with thoſe that were of their councell in tyme &amp; place conuenient to mete hym. So the meſſaungers going forth with theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſyons: Henry went forward toward Shreweſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, and in the waye mette with ſyr Rice ap Tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mas with a great noumber of menne which came vnto hym and was of his parte. For two dayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Henry promyſed hym to bee chiefe ruler of all Wales as ſoone as he came to the croune (yf he would come vnto hym) which afterward he gaue to hym in dede. In the meane time the meſſengers executing the meſſage, dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly returned back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne with large rewardes of theim, to whome they were ſent and came to Henry the ſame day he entred into Shreweſburye and ſhewed howe all his frendes were in a redyneſſe to dooe the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte that laye in theim. This tidynges put Hen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry in ſuche greate hope, that he went forth with a courage and came to the towne of Newporte and there ſet vp his tentes vpon a lytle hyll, and there laye all night. That night came to hym ſyr Gyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berte Talbot with aboue two hundreth menne.</p>
                  <p>After that they went forthe to Stafforde &amp; whyle they were there, Willyam Standley came to hym
<pb facs="tcp:3945:360"/>
with a fewe after hym, and when he had talked a litle with him, retourned backe again to his hoſte whiche he had prepared. From thence he went to Lichfelde, and that nyght laye without the toune, but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning betime he entred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citee and was receiued honourably. A daye or .ii. afore, Tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mas Standley was there with fyue. M. men ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whiche when he knewe of Henries co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, forthwith went afore to a village called Aderſtone there to tarye tyll Henrye came. This he dyd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide ſuſpicion, beyng afraid leaſt kyng Richard knowing his intent would haue put his ſoonne to deathe, whiche as I telled you before was lefte w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hym as a pledge for his father. But kynge Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard in the meane tyme, which then was at Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham, hearing that Henry with a fewe more of baniſhed men was entred into Wales, ſo lightly regarded the matter, that he thoughte it was not muche to bee paſte vpon, for that he came in with ſo fewe in noumbre, and that the lorde Harbart &amp; ſir Rice, which wer rulers of all Wales, would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kyll hym, or elles take hym and bring hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue. But afterward, when he remembred him ſelf that oftentimes a ſmal matter in batel if it bee not looked vnto betymes, would make at the laſte a great ſturre: he thought it beſt to remedy the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter betimes and commaunded Henrye the earle of Northumberlande with other of the nobles of the realme (whome he thoughte had ſet more by hym then by their owne goodes) to rayſe vp an army &amp; to come to hym with ſpeede. Alſo he ſente dyuers meſſengers with letters to Robert Brakenburye keper of the Towre of London, commaundynge
<pb n="Cii" facs="tcp:3945:360"/>
hym to come vnto hym in all haſte, and to brynge with hym as felowes in battell, Thomas Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchere, Walter Hungerforde and dyuerſe other knyghtes, whome he dyd not a litell ſuſpecte.</p>
                  <p>In this tyme it was ſhewed that Henrye was come to Shrewiſburye without any hurte. With the which tidinges, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng beganne to rage and made exclamacion againſte theim, that contrary to their faithes they had vtterly deceiued hym, &amp; then he beganne to miſtruſt all menne, and wiſte not whome he mighte truſte, ſo that he thoughte it beſt to ſette forthe hym ſelfe ageinſt his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaryes. And forthwith he ſent out ſpies to knowe which waye Henry did take. They when they had dooen their diligence retourned backe again and ſhewed hym howe that Henry was come to Lich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld. The which thing after he knew, becauſe now there was a greate noumbre of ſouldyours come together, by and by his menne ſet in araye, he com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded theim forwarde, and to gooe foure and foure together, and by that waye which they kept they hearde ſaye, their enemies were commynge. The ſuſpecte perſones he putte in the myddes, he hym ſelfe with thoſe he truſted came behind, with winges of horſemen running on euery ſyde. And thus keping their order, aboute ſonne ſette came vnto Leiceſtre.</p>
                  <p>When Henrye in the meane ſeaſon had remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from Lichefelde vnto the nexte village called Tamworth, in the mydwaye he mette with Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hungerforde, Thomas Burſchier and many other more which had promiſed to aide hym afore And forbecauſe they perceyued that they were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpected
<pb facs="tcp:3945:361"/>
of Richard, &amp; leaſt they ſhould be brought violentlye vnto hym beyng their enemye they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke Robert Brakenbury their capitaine, and in the nyghte tyme ſtale priuely awaye and wente to Henry. Vnto whome there chaunced by the waye that was worthy to bee marked, whiche was that Henry, althoughe he was a manne of noble cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and alſo his companye dyd dailye encreaſe, yet for all that he ſtoode in great feare becauſe he was vncertayne of Thomas Standly whiche as I telled you before, for the feare of puttynge his ſoonne to deathe, inclyned as yet vnto no parte, &amp; that the matter was not ſo ſle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of kyng Richard as reporte was made to hym of his frendes.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore, as all afrayde withoute a cauſe, he tooke onely twenty menne with him, and ſtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his iourney as a manne in diſpaire and halfe muſynge with hym ſelfe what was beſte to bee dooen, and to aggrauate the matter, tidinges was broughte hym that kyng Richard was comming nere to mete hym with a great and houge hoſte of menne. And while he thus lyngered for feare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, his hoſte came afore to the toune of Tham worth, and becauſe it was then darke night, he loſt bothe his company and alſo his waye, then wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dryng frome place to place, at laſte came to a lytle village .iii. myle from his hoſte being full of feare and leſte he ſhould fall into the daunger of ſcoute watche he durſte not aſke a queſtyon of any man, and partly for the feare that was preſente, partely for that was to come he laye there that nyght and tooke this for a ſygne or a pronoſticacyon of ſome greate plage that was to come, and of the other
<pb n="Ciii" facs="tcp:3945:361"/>
parte his hoſte was no leſſe abaſhed ſeyng his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence for that tyme. When in the morning Henry came to theim in the light of the daye he excuſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter that he was not abſent becauſe he had loſt his waye but rather of purpoſe, becauſe he would commen w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his preuy frendes which would not be ſene in the daye. After y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he went priuely to Ader<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone where Thomas Standley &amp; Willyam his brother dyd dwell. Here Henry, Thomas, &amp; Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyam mette and tooke other by the hande with lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſalutacions and were glad one of an other. Then after, they counceled together of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng with kyng Richard whome they perceyued then not to bee farre from theim. That day when it drewe toward night, in the euening Ihon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage Brytanne Sanforde, Simon Digby with many other had forſaken, kyng Richarde &amp; came to Henry w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a great power of men, whiche thyng both with power and ſtrengthe ſate Henry alofte again.

Afore he went to bed he made an oration to his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye with greate vehemence, perſwading &amp; exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting manfully to fight. And afterward, as it was ſaied he had a terrible dreame in his ſlepe ſeming that he ſawe horrible deuilles appere vnto hym &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:3945:362"/>
pulling and haling of hym that he coulde take no reſt, which viſyon fylled hym full of feare &amp; alſo of heuy care when he waked. For by and by after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſore greued in his minde, he did prognoſticate of this dreame the euill luke &amp; heuy chaunce that after came to hym, and he came not with ſo cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a countenaunce vnto his company as he was wonte to dooe. Then leeſt they ſhould thinke that he had this heauineſſe for the feare of his enemies he ſtoode vp &amp; reherſed vnto theim all his dreame. But I thinke that this was not a dreame, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his conſcience pricked with the ſharpe ſtynge of his miſcheuous offences, which although they dooe not pricke alwaye, yet moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menly they wil byte moſte towarde the latter daye, repreſentyng vnto vs not onely them ſelfe, but alſo the terry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble punyſhement that is ordeined for the ſame, as the ſyghte of the deuill tearyng and haling vs, ſo that therby (if we haue grace) we may take an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſyon to bee penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or elles for lacke of the ſame dye in deſperacyon. Nowe to come to my purpoſe again, the nexte daye after, kyng Richard hauing all thynges in a redyneſſe went for the with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my oute of his tentes, &amp; beganne to ſette his men in araye: fyrſt the forward ſet forth with a merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous lengthe bothe of horſemen and alſo of foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, a veray terrible companye to theim y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhould ſee theim a farre of: and in the formoſt parte of all he ordered the bowmen as a ſtronge fortreſſe for theim that came after, and ouer this Iohn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Norffolke was hedde capitaine.

He ſent hym woorde again that he ſhould ſet his menne in an ordre tyll he came, with the which anſwer otherwiſe then he had thought or then the mater dyd require, he was not alitel abaſhed and ſtoode as it were in doubte. Yet for all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he taryed not but with all ſpede ſet his menne in an ordre, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forward was but ſlender, becauſe his nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber was but fewe, the archers were ſet in the formoſt parte Ouer theim Iohn the earle of Oxford was hedde capitain.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twyxte bothe hoſtes, there was a marreſſe whiche Henrye lefte on his ryghte hande purpoſelye as a defence of his menne, he found the meanes alſo to haue the bryght ſunne on his backe, that it myght daſyll the eyes of his enemyes.</p>

On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſyde they paied theim home manfully again with the ſame. But when they came nere together they laied on valeauntly with ſwerdes. The earle of Oxforde fearing leaſt in the meane time kyng Richardes multytude ſhould haue compaſſed in his menne whiche wer but a fewe, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded theim by fyues they ſhould not moue forwarde paſte ten fote the whiche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement knowen when they knitte theim ſelfes together and ſeaſed not in fyghting: their aduerſaries beyng afrayed ſuſpected ſom crafte or guyle &amp; began to breake of and many of the ſame parte wer not much greued therwith, becauſe they wer as glad y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king ſhould be loſte as ſaued, &amp; therfore they fought with leſſe courage. Then the erle of Oxford with his menne thicke together ſtroke on more freſhlyer. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the other parte dyd likwyſe the ſame. And while the firſte wardes of the batell had fought ſo manfully. Richard perceiued by his ſpies Henry a farre of with a fewe companye of armed menne.

On the other ſyde, Henry perceiuing hym commyng, was very deſyrouſe to mete hym. Richard at the fyrſte ſetting forth, kyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led diuers that ſtode, again he threwe doune Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his banner and Willyam Brandon the bearer alſo, he ranne at Cheyny a manne of great mighte

There were ſlain at this conflicte not many more then one thouſand, of the whiche theſe were noble menne.

But as ready as he was to prouoke, ſo readie wer thei of their owne courage to come foorth: ſo that of bothe parties thei ranne to battaill and fought moſte egerly, in whiche to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicte it did euidently appere that the Germaines whiche were ſette in the forewarde, whoſe capitain was Martine Swarte, were nothyng woorſe in manlyneſſe and cheualry (which thei gotte chiefly by daily and long exerciſe) then the Engliſhemen. And the Ireſhmen although thei fought verie lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtely, yet by the reaſon that thei ware not harnes (accordyng to their faſſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and cuſtome) were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfcited and beate downe bothe more in no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, and ſoner then all the other.

                  <p>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was Lambert, the child whiche was falſly reported to bee the Dukes ſoonne of Clare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and his maiſter ſir Richard Simond preeſt, both ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but neither of theim putte to death, becauſe Lambert was yet but a child and did ſeme to dooe that, more by compulſion of his maiſter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his owne will, and the other was a preeſt whiche for his defaulte was caſt into perpetuall priſone.

                  <p>Kyng Henry when he had all thynges brought thus to paſſe, and vtterly vanquiſſhed theſe his enemies, thought hymſelf at one tyme deliuered from twoo eiuils together, that is to ſaie, from bothe feare that was preſent, and alſo that was to come.

When the Ambaſſadoures hearde this, they tooke the

                  <p>Shortely after, the kyng departed thence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde London, and in the waye at Leicetre mette hym Abaſſadoures from the Frenche kyng which ſhewed hym, that their kyng Charles had recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many tounes and cyties, whiche before were poſſeſſed of kyng Maximilian, and that he kepte battayle nowe with Fraunces the duke of Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, becauſe he kepte and ſocoured in his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion certaine that were traytours and rebellions againſt hym, of the whiche the chief was Lewes duke of Orlyance, and therfore he deſyred hym of his frendſhip &amp; familiaritie, that either he would helpe hym orelles medle of neyther partie. But kynge Henrye, althoughe he had founde muche frendſhip at the Frenche kynges hande, yet for as muche as he ſpyed whereof this ſtryfe beganne, with this meſſage was not well contente. For the cauſe that the Frenchemenne tooke battayle, was becauſe they ſawe that the Duke was an olde manne and had neuer a chylde, and thereby that they myghte brynge that Dukedome into their ſubieccion.</p>
                  <p>When kyng Henrye perceiued this, and alſo howe louyng the Brytaynes had been euer to Englande, and finally remembred the tendre loue which was betwene the duke and hym, thought it beſt, if nede wer, to helpe the Britaynes, Yet for as

muche as he had founde the Frenche kyng veray kynde in tymes paſt, and had partely by his helpe recouered his kyngdome, he was veraye lothe to medle: in ſo muche that he coulde not well tell what was beſt in this mattier to bee dooen. But at the laſte he fully purpoſed, if neceſſitie ſhoulde require, to helpe the duke in all that he might. Yet, leaſt he ſhould make of his highe frende hys extreme enemie, his aunſwere was to the ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoures, that he did intende to make their kyng and the duke frendes again. Wherfore aſſone as the Frenche kynges ambaſſadoures were dimiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he ſent on meſſage Chriſtopher Vrſwycke to Charles the kynge of Fraunce. Firſte to certifye hym, that he was veraye glad of the victorye that he had vpon Maximilian, ſecondarely what tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multe and inſurreccion was made here in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thyrdly and eſpecially to deſyre hym to bee at one againe with the Duke of Brytayne.

                  <p>But when the kyng was come againe to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, there was ioye and myrthe for the victorye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he had on euery ſyde. For not onely the kyng, but alſo euerye one of his cytezyns reioyſed veraye muche. Wherfore the kyng ſhewed hym ſelfe both beraye humane and courteous toward all menne, and alſo rewarded all theim that tooke paynes in that battaile moſte bountefully.

In the meane ſeaſon Chriſtofer Vrſwicke was come to the frenche kyng, &amp; of hym, after the moſt louing faſſion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> coulde bee, receiued.

<pb n="Cxxiii" facs="tcp:3945:381"/>
whiche Philip did ſend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> letters to hym, before he came into the countre hymſelf, wherin he ſignified that he would take ſuche paines in bryngyng his purpoſe about, that he would if it ſhould ſo pleaſe his grace, reconcile bothe hym and their kyng to loue eche other as thei haue dooen heretofore, and ſaied that it ſhould bee for his honour to take theſame condicion, whiche condicion if he would ſend certain of his capitains to mete with hym in any parte of Fraunce, and there to determine of it he ſhould haue it there promiſed &amp; hereafter duely to bee performed. The kyng after he had red theſe letters, did ſend the biſhop of Exceter, and Giles Dabeney to the forenamed Philip for peace to be agreed vpon &amp; concluded, the whiche after a ſpace determyned vpon certain condicions whiche here after ſhalbee ſhewed, that peace ſhould bee had on bothe parties. When thei were thus conſultyng, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng hauyng his hoſte at Caleis, remoued from that place to Bononye, &amp; there pitchyng his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes beſeeged the toune with all the power he might, whiche toune becauſe it was ſtrongely defended &amp; furniſhed with all thynges neceſſarye for warre, it could not bee ouercome without greate labour, &amp; before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he either could or did ouercome any parte of it, woord was brought, that a peace was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and made, whiche heard, as it was pleaſure to the Frenchemen, ſo it was ſorowe to the Engliſhe men, for thei cried out of the kyng and ſaied it was not for his honour ſo to dooe, but the kyng as a wiſe manne &amp; moſte prudent prince, ſaied it ſhould be the death of many noble &amp; puiſaunt capitaines if he ſhould continue theſame battaill, &amp; therefore
<pb facs="tcp:3945:382"/>
it might be to his ſore reproche, if it wer in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, not to tendre aſ well the health of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons as his owne, whiche ſaiyng did ſomewhat coule &amp; pacifye their grief.

kepe hym, leaſt that ſome inconueniencie or cauſe of ſtrife ſhould chaunce thorough it.

Alſo after this rumour blaſed abrode, aſwel in England, Fraunce, as Flaundres there beganne great ſedicion to ſpryng, and firſte they that were long in ſanctuary for the greate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences that they had commytted, and other that wer caſt in pouertie, gathered a compaignie of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſayled ouer into Flaunders to the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faicte Edwarde, otherwiſe named Peter, alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the noble men conſpired together, and to the entent they might bryng their purpoſe wel about, they did ſend certain to the Quene Margarete, to knowe when theſame Edwarde might come con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently into Englande, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thei beyng certified of theſame might y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more eaſely receaue &amp; bryng hym into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realme.

Whome the Quene did accepte gladlye, and perſuaded theim, that it was true that was publyſhed of Rycharde the duke, and ſtreight vpon ſhewed theim theſame

Peter, whiche was muche lyke Richarde, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng his vertues and qualitees that he had, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfullye.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid Robert, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſeen theſame you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g manne, beleued ſurely that he was of the kynges bloode, and wrote to Englande to his coumpaig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye and felowes of his conſpiracie, that he knewe hym to bee the kynges ſoonne by his face &amp; euery proporcion of his body. And when theſe letters came vnto Englande, the chief capitaynes of this buſineſſe did openly diuulgate and publyſhe, that it was trewe that was ſpoken and ſaied abroad of the Duke, but it was dooen by ſuche a crafte, that no manne coulde tell who was the authoure of that rumoure.</p>
                  <p>When the kyng perceiued that many men did geue credence to his vaine fable, he thought beſte for his owne ſafegard to prouide a remedy for it, &amp; alſo myſtruſting that ſome conſpiracye had bene made bicauſe that ſir Robert Clifford had fled pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uely into Flaundres, commaunded certain knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes that were choſen and piked menne of warre w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a bonde of menne to kepe the borders ſurely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> no manne might eſcape or ſayle ouer the ſea without a paſporte or licence geuen by hym. Alſo that men myghte not contynue in the falſe perſwaſion and belefe that they had conceyued of the duke, he cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed certain ſpies to ſearch in all the citees of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike, to knowe of what progenie this myſnamed Richarde was, and to geue theim highe rewardes that would ſhewe the verite and truth of the ſame matter. So that they ſailynge into Fraunce, euerye manne dyd gooe into a contraye quarter,
<pb facs="tcp:3945:384"/>
and enquired diligently for hym, and at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> length, certain of theim came to a towne called Tornace and there were certifyed by the teſtymonye of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honeſt menne that he came but of a lowe and courſe parentage, and he was named Peter War becke, whiche thing alſo the kynges frendes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified hym by their letters and writynges to hym more plaine and euidentelye. Therfore when the kyng had knowen the matter wholy, aſwel by his frendes as by his ſpies ſent foorth purpoſelye for the ſame, he cauſed it to bee proclaimed openly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in other regions &amp; countrees as in England that the diſceate and deueliſh crafte might appere euident to euery manne. And firſte he ſent ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours to Philyp the chiefe capitaine in Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres, and to his councell, becauſe he was but of a younge age, whiche were ſir Edward Poninges knight, and ſir William Varame preeſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, that they might ſhewe euidently howe falſely the younge manne hath vſurped the name of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde duke of Yorke whiche was kylled with his brother Edward in the Towre of London, at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement and will of kyng Richard his vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cle, as euery man coulde teſtifye and affirme moſt ſurely.</p>
                  <p>Alſo that he was borne of a poore ſtocke, and an obſcure famulie in Tornace, and there named Perkin Warbecke, and therfore that it woulde pleaſe hym &amp; his councel not to ſuffer theim ſelfes to bee blynded or ſeduced with ſuche mere impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and craftie illuſions, nor yet to aide hym at any hande to cauſe ſedicion or ſtrife, conſideryng that he had no iuſte title to the enheritynge of the

ſame. And that they would the rather bee his fren<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des nowe, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he helped Maximilian theyr kyng the yere before againſte the power and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencye of the Frenche menne, where as he of hym ſelfe was not hable to refyſte theyr myghte and ſtronge power. When the Ambaſſadours had dooen their meſſage, they were gentely entretay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of hym, and had their requeſt, that he woulde not (for the loue that he oughte vnto the kynge) no nor any of his counſaile helpe theſame Perkin any thinge at all.</p>
                  <p>Neuertheleſſe, yf the quene Margaret would perſiſte and continewe in her malice towardes the kyng (whome the Ambaſſadour ſir William Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rame had reproued and checked ſore, for bringing vp of ſuche monſters and commune plagues, to the publike weale in his oration that he made vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Philippe and his counſayle) it was not in their power to withſtande it, for becauſe that ſhe might doo in her owne herytage all thinges at her owne wyll and pleaſure. Whiche quene entended fully to arme this Perkin with a ſtronge compaignye of menne againſt kyng Henry.</p>
                  <p>After that kynge Henrye dyd heare of this, he purpoſed to pacyfye all this buſyneſſe that was like to chaunce, by wytte and policye, and ſtreight dyd ſende foorthe certaine ſpies, whiche ſhoulde fayne theim ſelfes to haue fledde vnto the Duke, and by that meanes ſearche foorthe and knowe the whole entente of theyr coniuracion, and after what waye they framed theyr matters.</p>

Barley for their offence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the kyng. And when they had ſo dooen, many of theim retur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned to Englande, and broughte the names of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne that were chief of the ſame conſpiracye, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taried vntyll ſuche tyme that ſir Robert Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde came to Englande agayne. And when the kyng had knowen the chief capitaines of this tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multe by his ſpyes that were there with theim, he cauſed all them to bee attached &amp; brought to Lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don before his preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whoſe names wer ſir Iohn Ratclyffe, ſyr Simon Monforde, ſyr Thomas Thwarte knightes, William Dabeney, Roberte Ratcliffe, Richard Leſey, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many other.

Other that were giltie of the ſame crime, hearing that many of their compaignie wer taken, fledde and did take ſanctuarye. And the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that were taken wer condempned all of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche there was heded ſir Simon Mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ford, ſir Robert Ratcliffe, and William Dabeney as authours &amp; chiefe capitaines of this buſines. The other were pardoned, and the Preeſtes alſo for their order that they had taken. Alſo ſir Iohn Ratcliffe was pardoned of his lyfe, but after that he came to Caliſſe, &amp; there caſte in priſone, he was behedded, becauſe he corrupted the kepers w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny promiſes to haue eſcaped out of the ſame. Shortly after, ſir Robert Clifford truſting to find fauour &amp; grace at the kynges hande, came to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, of whoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng was certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="Cxxvi" facs="tcp:3945:385"/>
he went ſtreight to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towre of London, &amp; there taryed tyll ſuche tyme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſyr Robert Clyfford came whiche thyng he vſed vnder this pretence, that yf ſir Robert Clifford had accuſed any man to hym of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> treaſon, that then euerie ſuche perſon mighte bee called thether withoute anye ſuſpectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of anie euel, and there ſtreight to bee caſt in holde, but be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore I goo furder, I wyll ſhewe the opinion that many men conceaued of the knightes goynge to Flaunders. Some men helde this opinion, that kyng Henrye dyd ſende hym as a ſpye to Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and therfore he came the ſoner into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure. Neuertheleſſe, this is not lyke to bee true by diuerſe reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Fyrſt that it tourned to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great infamye and hurt, both of hym ſelfe and his fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Secondarly that he was not in ſo greate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure with the kyng, as he had ben in tymes paſt for becauſe that he was giltie in that part. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaied ſir Robert now comming to the king after his retourne into England, kneled mekelye downe at his feet, and deſired pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his grace and after that beyng enquired of the coniuration and examined who wer the authours of this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, he pronounced &amp; ſaied that William Sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whome the kynge made Earle, was one of the chief, when he had ſo ſaied, the kyng was greatly diſmayed &amp; greued, that he ſhould offend, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had made chief of his priuie chamber, conſidering alſo that he had founde great kindenes hertofore at his hande, and that he dyd ouercome kyng Ry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chard chiefly by his helpe and meanes. So that the kyng coulde not bee perſwaded, that he was any ſuche offender, had not it bene ſhewed him af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:3945:386"/>
by manifeſt tokens and appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t argumentes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it was true as he ſaied. Whom the king the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed to be taken and examined of the matter, after the which examinacion he was proued to be an of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fender. Then the kynge doubtynge what to dooe with him, dyd conſult and breath a lytle with him ſelfe, for he feared, that his brother lord Thomas by whom he had ſhewed great kyndneſſe woulde take it greuouſly, alſo &amp; yf he ſhoulde remitte that faulte, other would abuſe his lemtee, and treſpace more highly. Albe it, at the laſte he wylled that he ſhoulde ſuffer for his offence, and ſo cauſed hym to bee behedded. The cauſe that their loue (as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reporte) dyd chaunge into hatred was this. The lorde Wyllia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſideryng that he ſaued the kyng and brought hym to this realme to be gouernour thought he could neuer bee recompenſed for hys ſo doyng, and wher as the kyng alſo remembring this benefyte, dyd make hym his chiefe chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layn, and gaue hym the hygheſt promocions that he had, he lytle regarded them and loked for ſome greater rewarde, wherfore, the king perceauynge that, was ſore greued with hym, and ſo thei bothe dyd fall at debate and hatred eche wyth other.</p>
                  <p>Alſo at this time the king thought beſt to vſe ſome aſperite in correcting the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſome had taken ſuche heart and audacitee to them, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thei feared not to ſpeake euel of his maieſtie with moſt ſpiteful and contumele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wordes, truſting euer that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayned Rychard duke of York, now lately ryſen from death to lyfe on gods name, ſhould claime the crowne, &amp; enhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret his counterfeted fathers poſſeſſions, &amp; when

ſuch perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had ſuffered due poniſhment for their offences, other learning by their neighbours miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce to beware, dyd frome y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme beare theim ſelfes as true &amp; faithfull ſubiectes, &amp; aſſyſted him with al their power, at what time he required help of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. After the death of this William Stanley, Giles Dabeney was choſen and made chiefe cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And this was the firſt commocion &amp; buſines of the Scottes againſt the Engliſhemen. When the Scottes were thus gone, and the kyng certified of it, he thought not to ſuffer theim lenger, leſte that by long tariyng &amp; deferryng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter, thei ſhould take heart, and ſo with more fearſenes inuade the realme again.</p>
                  <p>And aſſemblyng his counſaill together, ſhewed theim that it was for the proffite of the publique weale to warre againſt his enemies, to whom thei all agreed right gladly, and for the mainteinyng of this battaill, there was leuyed a certain ſumme or tribute to be paid on euery mannes hed, whiche paiment although it was but eaſie and ſmall, yet many of the commen people grudged to paie it. At this parliament alſo and conuocacion there was certain lawes, actes and ſtatutes confirmed and made, as thought moſte expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique weale. And after this was dooen, the kyng prepared to fight in all the haſte, and gatheryng an armie, made Giles Dabeney graund capitain ouer theim, and in his goyng to Scotlande, there beganne ſodenly ciuile battaill in the realme, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was for the paiment of this money, for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Corniſhemen, (whiche made this inſurreccion) beeyng but poore, could not well paie this tribute.

                  <p>Thus they preparyng theim ſelues to warre, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had aſwell ſufficiente viandrye as all other thynges ready, they tooke theyr iourney to Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and from thence entended to go to London, When the kyng was ſhewed of this by his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, that they wer vp, and that the lorde Twy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet, and the lorde Audely with other of the noby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litee had taken their partes, he thought fyrſte to ſcoure his realme of ſuche rebelles and traytours ere he would fight againſt the Scottes.

Alſo leaſt that the Scottes might nowe (hauyng good oportunite) inuade the realme again (in this time of ciuile battyle) he cauſed lorde Thomas erle of Surrey, a puiſſaunt and moſt redoubted warryer whome he had taken pryſoner, at the ouerthrowe of kyng Richard, and a litle before that, had ſet at libertie, and made treaſourer of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, after the death of Iohn Dynham, to gather a bond of men at Durham, &amp; there to kepe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scottes, yf they

                  <p>With many other Capitaynes, althoughe not ſo noble in degree, yet as valiaunte in martiall fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes and proweſſes of warre. The Scottes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Earle of Surrey that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming and at hande with a greate power, then beſeging this forenamed Caſtell, whiche they coulde by no meanes ouercome, they fledde ſtreighte backe to Scotlande, whome the Earle folowed as longe as his vyttailles ſerued, and after that returned backe to Durham, theyr abiding vntyll ſuch time he knewe furder of the kynges pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>And in this meane ſpace, one Henrye Hailes was ſente Ambaſſadoure frome Ferdinand vnto the kyng of Scottes for a generall peace to bee had with hym and the Kyng of Englande, for he loued hym well, and kyng Henrye alſo to whoſe ſoonne the younge Prynce Arthure, he woulde haue geuen his doughter Ladye Katheryne in
<pb n="Cxxxiiii" facs="tcp:3945:392"/>
mariage that by affinytee and kyndered of blood their loue might continue for euer.</p>
                  <p>So this Henrye entreated hartelye the King of Scottes for a peace, and when he had ſome hope in it, he wrote vnto the kyng of Englande, that it would pleaſe hym to ſende one of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to helpe to conclude this matter with hym and the Scottes. The kyng becauſe he had been in greate trouble and then veraye deſierous of peace, he ſent the byſhoppe of Durham to hym in all the haſte. So that this Henrye and the biſhop reaſoned with the Scottyſhe ambaſſadours as concernyng this peace to be had, albeit thei could not agree, becauſe that kyng Henrye deſiered to haue Perkyn Warbecke that was the cauſe of all this buſynes, and had ſo greatly diſquieted his realme, whome the kyng woulde not delyuer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he might of ryghte, conſideryng his falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode and deceyte that he had vſed with hym.</p>
                  <p>Therfore, after that they had reaſoned much of this matter, &amp; could bring it to no ende, yet a truce was taken for certain yeres of this condicion, that the ſame Perkin Warbecke ſhould bee conueyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed oute of Scotland, &amp; not to tary there longer. Whyle this was dooinge, kyng Henry cauſed the Ambaſſadours of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Frenche kyng to bee brought to hym, which as it is ſhewed before, wer ſtopped at Douer of their iourney, vntill ſuche tyme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the inſurreccion of the Eorniſh men was ceaſſed, and hearing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they came for a peace and league to bee made, grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted theim it right gladly. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nowe bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g reconciled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> .ii. kynges, &amp; theſame his neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bours, he thanked Fernand &amp; his wife Elizabeth
<pb facs="tcp:3945:393"/>
for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they cauſed this peace to bee made betwixte hym and the Scottes, and rewarded the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoure moſte worthely after a princely maner.</p>
                  <p>And the tyme that this vnitee and concorde was made, it was the yere of oure Lorde a thouſande foure hundreth foure ſcore and eighten, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .xii. yere of kyng Henry his reigne.</p>
                  <p>And the kynge of Scottes kepte his promeſſe <note place="margin">The .xii. pere of He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For when he perceiued manifeſtly that he was deluded, he called vnto hym Perkin Warbeck, and firſt declared his benefites &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that he had dooen vnto hym, and then coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſailed hym to gette hym vnto ſome place where he mighte byde in ſafegarde, and come againe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time when he ſhoulde haue more oportunitee But neuer after to looke for any helpe at his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, partely becauſe he had made peace with the kyng of Englande, and partely becauſe he ſawe that no Engliſhemen came to take his parte, wherfore he deſired hym not to bee miſgreued that he did thus leaue hym, &amp; alſo counſailed hym to goo into ſome other place or regyon, wherfore this Perkin was veraye ſorye &amp; (as the kyng had counſailed hym) departed thence with his wife, and went into Ire<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land, determining with hym ſelfe if he might haue no helpe of the menne of Cornewale, to retourne thence as faſte as myghte bee home to his greate mailres &amp; aunte Margaret into Flaundres. But he was no ſoner come thither, then he heard by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers meſſengers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they of Cornewale were as rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy to fyght againſt kyng Henry as euer they wer before, of hoope of the whiche he went ſtreyght in to Cornewall &amp; there dyd ſturre vp their heartes
<pb n="Cxxxv" facs="tcp:3945:393"/>
with gyftes and promyſes, that all immediatelye called him their capitain &amp; ſaied that thei woulde folow hym and in all thinges obey promptly hys commaundementes. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was Perke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in as good hoope as euer he was, and (becauſe he would do nothynge raſhelye and withoute aduiſemente) he purpoſed fyrſte to ouercome citees and all wel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded places that lay in his way, and ſo to get as many as he coulde to folowe hym and to take his part, and incontinently, to buckle with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynges hoſt. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had thus deliberate, he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſtreight to Exeter which was the next citee that he coulde come vnto and beſieged it, and becauſe he had no gunnes to breake downe the walles, he laboured all that myght bee to breake the gates, but when he ſaw that thei could not eaſely be betten downe with any thyng, ſtreight with he ſet fyre on theim.</p>
                  <p>Whereof, the citezins were veray, ſore afraied and priuely in the night let downe diuerſe ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles with ropes to go certifie the kyng of their trouble, and in the meane tyme whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei ſaw that their enemies had almoſt bre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vp the gates of the one ſide, tooke great blockes and ſet them on fyre on the other ſide, for none other cauſe but that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well their enemyes therby might be excluded, as thei them ſelfes included. And thei not truſting to this only, made alſo w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in great ditches &amp; other thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the inuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the rebelles When Perke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaw this, he got ladders, and would by that meanes haue come into the citee, but they came not ſo ſone vp, but thei were beate downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and by this meanes many were there ſlayne þet would he not thence depart, but truſted ſurely
<pb facs="tcp:3945:394"/>
at the laſte that thei ſhould be glad to yelde theim ſelfes al that wer within for lack of viandrie. But as ſone as the kyng hearde of this, he haſted with his hooſt toward Exeter as faſte as was poſſible and ſente dyuerſe ſouldiours beefore to certifie all menne of his commyng and preparaunce, for at that tyme there was ſet forth to helpe theym of Exeter, Thomas Trencherd, William Corteney Walter Cortney, Edmond Carre, Ihon Halemel Peter Eggecomb Thomas Fulford, Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Crook William Saintmaur, with a great hoſt whoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pitain was Edward Corteny erle of Denſhire, &amp; his ſonne William, whiche was a young man of mooſte noble courage, whiche thyng when Peter heard tell of, he left beſiegyng of Exeter and went to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nexte towne whiche is called Tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tun &amp; there vieued his hooſt and ſet it in aray redye to fyght, howbeit,, he had but lytle affiaunce in the ſame, becauſe many of his ſouldiours were ſo ſlenderly harneiſſed, and no better ſkylled in warre.

                  <p>But the king when he came nygh to the towne ſente before to begynne battayle, Roberte Broke, Lorde Rycharde Thomas, and Giles Dabeney with a great and ſtronge hooſt, to the entent that he hym ſelfe with his ſouldiours myght ſet vpon them behynd. But this deuiſe and purpoſe of the kyng was al ſuperfluous. For Perkin, ſo ſone as he eſpyed that the kyng was redie to fight, fledde priuely in the nyght into a ſanctuary at Bellylo abbey, and there lurked. But whether this Perke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo dyd for feare leaſt his men ſhould forſake hym or for the timeditie of hym ſelfe, it is as much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayne, as it is probable and ſure that the kyng tooke by hys flyght greate commoditee.</p>
                  <p>For the Corneſhe menne were ſurelye purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eyther to wynne and ouercome theyr enemies or elles not one of theim to haue lyued anye daye lenger. When kynge Henrye knewe that Perkin was gone, he ſente after hym many horſe menne that yf it myghte bee, they ſhoulde ouertake hym in hys iourney and brynge hym backe.</p>
                  <p>But Perkyn Warbecke made ſuche ſpede, that he was not ſeene before he came into the Sanctuarie, but his petie capitaines coulde not ſcape ſo clene. For of theim, the mooſt part were ta

ken and brought backe againe to the kyng. The reſidue of the ſouldiours when thei vnderſtode y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Perkyn their chief capitain was fled and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other taken, gaue vp theim ſelfes by and by to the king without any more buſines, and of hym moſt gent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly wer forgeuen. When all was dooen, the kynge went again to Ereter and there both gaue great thankes to ſuch as wer worthy, and puniſhed the authoures and ſturrers vp of this inſurrection mooſt ſtraitlye. And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane tyme many of the ſouldiours road to ſ. Mighels mounte &amp; there (as chaunce was) found Katherin Perking wife, and brought her ſtreight like a bond woman and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to the kyng. And the kyng ſent her by and by accompanied with a goodly ſort of matrons (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was ſo goodly a young woman) to Lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don to the quene as a true and ſure token of vyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. And whiles he taried there at Exeter ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyng with him ſelfe, that he could haue no perfect victory vntyl he had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Perkin him ſelf, which was the beginner of all this ſedicion and ſtrife, ſent forth two companies of menne to beſiege the ſanctuarye wher Perkin was, that by no meanes he myght ſcape away, and ſent him worde alſo by certain truſtie meſſengers that yf he would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie ſubmit him ſelfe, he ſhould be forgeuen of all that was committed. Wherfore, Perkin now ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge and ponderynge the ſtate of miſerie, that he was in, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t voluntarily out of the ſanctuary and commytted hym ſelfe to the kynges pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Then was the kyng weray glad and toke his iourney immediatly after towarde London, not without the great metyng of people whych came
<pb n="Cxxxvii" facs="tcp:3945:395"/>
out of euery quarter to ſe this feloe as he were a monſtre, becauſe he beyng but an aliente durſt bee ſo bold to come in to this ſo noble a realme to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke battaill, and delude noble menne after ſuche a faſſion. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kyng was come to London he appointed certain menne to kepe hym bothe night &amp; daie verie vigilantly, to thentent that he might neither conueigh hymſelf out of the lande, ner goo any whether within this realme to make any like perturbacion and diſquietnes.</p>
                  <p>After this the kyng perceiuyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> there were ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny as well in Somerſet as in Deue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſhire, whiche were helpers of the rebelles greatly, bothe goyng foorth &amp; commyng homeward, thought it good to puniſhe theim alſo, leaſt peraduenture thei might be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more bold to dooe a like thyng after. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he committed this buſines to Amis Paulet knight, and Robert Sherburne deane of Poules to be dooen. Which in ſerchyng out all ſuche tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweout bothe the ſhires, wer verie exacte and dili<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gent, but thei wer fauorable to al ſuch as did it for feare or compulſion. Yet were thei to none ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorable but thei were thought for their defaultes indifferently to be puniſhed. So that equitie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was verie well executed.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame yere of a ſmall matter befell greate ſtrife betwene kyng Henry and Iames kyng of Scotlande, whiche ſtrife beganne of this faſſion. Certain younge menne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scottes came armed vnto Dureſme caſtell, &amp; beheld it wonderous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly as though thei had been deſierous to know what was there dooen. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kepers of the caſtle could not perceaue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei went aboute
<pb facs="tcp:3945:396"/>
any hurte or diſpleaſure, &amp; ſeing theim go awaie of their owne accorde, thei made no woordes but let theim alone. But when thei came again the nexte daie &amp; vieued it likewiſe, the kepers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid caſtel demaunded of theim what was their intent. Thei au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered theim (like rude and vnmanerlie ientle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menne) as frowardly as could bee thought, in ſo muche y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at the laſte through muche altercacion of bothe parties, thei fell together by the eares, and there were ſome of the Scottes ſlain &amp; the reſidue put to flight. Which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei came home certified their kyng of theſame. Wherwith he beyng ſore moued to angre, ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t woorde to kyng Henry that he would w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out doubt reuenge his querell, wherfore kyng He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry being verie ſorie, not ſo much forfeare, as for to liue in quietnes &amp; peace in his age, made him au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwere y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was not doe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through his default or cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaill, but rather by the raſheneſſe of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes whiche if thei could bee ꝓued guiltie ſhould be accordyng to the faulte puniſhed. Wherfore he deſired him moſte louingly to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. But this was not hable to mitigate or ſwage the Scottes angre &amp; outrageouſneſſe. For the whiche cauſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chard biſhop of Dureſme whiche was more heuie then all other, becauſe his ſeruu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ates were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of this diſcord, wrote many letters to kyng Iames to deſire hym to kepe peace &amp; bee at quiet. With the whiche letters the kynges rage was ſo quenched, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he bothe ſent verie kynd letters again to hym, and deſired hym hartely to come ouer and talke with hym. Of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche tydynges the biſhop was verie glad, and went ſtreight to kyng Henry to ſhewe hym the matter and had leaue of hym in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continenly
<pb n="Cxxxviii" facs="tcp:3945:396"/>
to go ouer to hym.</p>
                  <p>When he came into Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, he was receiued as louyngly as coulde bee thought of the kyng hymſelf, at an abbey called Melroſe, and there af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had complained muche of the crueltie that was vſed toward his menne here in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de he beganne to commen ſecretly of other matters, and eſpecially of the amitie betwene kyng Henry and hym, the whiche to bee for euer ſtabliſhed and confirmed, he deſired y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kinges doughter Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret in mariage. Of the whiche thyng albeit the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was glad in his heart, yet he would make no perfect aunſwere or ſheweforth any ſure hope of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, but ſaied that when he came home, he would dooe the beſt in the matter that laie in hym. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the kyng ſhortly after dimiſſed hym, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hym erneſtly to breake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame matter to kyng He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was come home, ſo he did, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proffer pleaſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng verie well, becauſe he was a manne whiche was alwaies more delited w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> peace &amp; quietnes then w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the troubleſomneſſe, of battaill.</p>
                  <p>And now did approch y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Perkin War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck, and of Edwarde erle of Warwicke whiche had ſo long lyen all readie in the tower. But Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thought that he would ſaue hymſelf, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on a tyme he tooke his leggues and ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, but ſo ſone as the kyng harde tell therof, he made menne after hym with all the ſpede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> might bee, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whoſe clamours and ſhoutes Perkyn was ſo feared, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of neceſſitie he was compelled to go to an abbaie which was called Bethele<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ther intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abbot of the place to deſire the kyng of his pardon that he might not dye. Whiche thyng the
<pb facs="tcp:3945:397"/>
abbot did for hym and obteined it. Wherfore Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken was brought bounde &amp; feitered, to Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and there ſtoode an whole daie in the ſight of all menne to the great ſhame and reproche of hym ſelf. And after (partely becauſe the kyng had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed hym his life, and partely becauſe he ſhould no more renne awaie) he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towre. Where his wickednes boylong ſo hote within his breit, would not ſuffre hym to eſcape the ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; puniſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, but ſhortly after was moſte iuſtly &amp; worthely put to deathe as herafter ſhalbe ſhewed. Then it chaunſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> a monke whoſe name was Patricke had a ſcholer, whome he promiſed if he would folowe his counſaill, ſhould eaſely come to the kyngdome of Englande. Whiche ſcholer when he had ones heard his maiſters mynd, was verie inſtaunte in the matter and deſired his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, not to forget his purpoſe, but rather begynne it as ſone as was poſſible. Wherfore, when thei be twene theim ſelfes had taken deliberacion and counſailled of the thyng how it ſhould be brought to paſſe, thei went bothe together into Kent. And there beganne this young feloe to tell priuely to many that he was the erle of Warwicke, and had gotte out of the tower by the helpe of this monke. To the whiche, when he perceiued credence geuen he declared it openly, and deſyred al men of helpe.</p>
                  <p>But or euer this ſedicion beganne to goo fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the heddes and principalles of theſame wer taken and caſle into pryſone. Of whiche the one was condempned to death, and the other conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to perpetuall pryſon and darkeneſſe. For at that tyme here in Englande was ſo muche attry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted

to preſtes, and al religious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that though they had committed felonie, murder, yea or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they ſhould not haue bene therfore condemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death. Moreouer, whoſoeuer could reade, though it wer neuer ſo lytle, what crime ſoeuer he had committed (ſaue treaſon) ſhould by his booke bee ſaued, and therfore it was inuented, that if the default wer ſo great, that another manne ſhoulde ſuffer death for theſame, he ſhould onely be burnt in the hande, wherfore he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> had committed thefte, ſhould bee marked in the hand with this letter T. if he had committed murdre, with M. and after that, yf he were deprehended in lyke cryme, then there ſhould no fauour at all, more then to other menne, bee ſhewed. Whiche acte was made and confyrmed, by this kyng Henry in the ſecond yere of his reigne, and take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Frenchemen, whiche are wonte if thei take any ſuche, to cutte of one of his cares and let hym go. Whiche priuiledges of bookes made thefes both bolde, &amp; plentie thorowe out all the coaſtes and parties of this his realme of Englande.</p>
                  <p>But nowe to my matier again. Perkyn, of whom we ſpake muche before, whyles he was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towre corrupted many of the kepers, partly with giftes and partely with fayre promyſes, ſo that they were all agreed (ſaue the leuetenaunt, whome he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined to kyll) that he and the erle of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wike ſhould gooe theyr waye out of the toure and afterwarde to make the beſt ſhyfte that they could for theim ſelfes. But this his purpoſe came not to full effecte. For it was knowne within ſhorte tyme after, for the whiche he and his felowes all of the
