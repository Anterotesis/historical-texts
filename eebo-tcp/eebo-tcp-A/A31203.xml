         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It would have been matter of great content unto us, to have

Nation having given for almoſt a century of years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

the great tenderneſs of this State to avoid every
thing that might lead to a Rupture, ſaving the undoubted
Rights and Dominion of this Nation, and the Juſtice they
ought to adminiſter to their People, thereby enforcing us to
ſome engagement; and ſeeing how neceſſary it is in ſuch
times as theſe, that the People be rightly informed in the ſtate
of things, I have briefly placed a few things together as the
ſtate of the Caſe, whereby the People of <hi>England</hi> may know,
how much it concerneth them to look about in this preſent
Juncture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48029:3"/>
When the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was likely to have ſwallowed up the
People of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> their Libertie and Exerciſe of
the Proteſtant Religion in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and
the ſad groans of thoſe <hi>then diſtreſſed States;</hi> were by their
Publick Miniſters breathed forth to the State of <hi>England;</hi>
though the conſtitution then of this Nation was under
Monarchy; Though the Nation had but then abandoned
the practiſe of the Popiſh Religion profeſſed therein for many
hundreds of years before, which greatly diſſetled the Peace
thereof, and cauſed many Rebellions; Though this Nation
was then engaged in War with <hi>Ireland</hi> and the Countreys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
Though the chief Government thereof was by a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
matter of encouragement to Enemies both abroad and
at home to deſigne upon <hi>England;</hi> Though all theſe were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great grounds, wherefore <hi>England</hi> ſhould have looked to
her ſelf, and not empty her Treaſures, and weaken her Force
for the preſervation of others, eſpecially when that thereby
ſhe was likely to provoke the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Powers againſt her ſelf
(as it afterwards fell out in 1588) yet ſo open was the heart of
the People of <hi>England</hi> to receive the cries of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi>
ſo tenderly did they reſent their Condition, that as if
it were not now the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but the condition of <hi>England;</hi>
they willingly eſpouſed their Quarrel, undertook their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection:
the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> advanced Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
ſeveral ſubſidies for this work, and <hi>England</hi> enabled her
to lend the <hi>Dutch</hi> eleven hundred thouſand Pound Sterling,
(which was a great ſum of mony in thoſe days, and to them
eſpecially, who could then hardly raiſe any conſiderable ſum
for the management of ſo great an affair in all their Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
ſhip'd them over many thouſands of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, when
their own Countrey afforded very few Souldiers: and all
this when neither League, Amity, or Reciprocall kindneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
them thereunto; and which through the goodneſs of
God) put a preſent ſtop to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who was breaking in
upon them like the breach of the ſea; and in time helped
them into that condition which hath occaſioned them to give
themſelves the title of <hi>High and Mighty States;</hi> and aſſiſted
their Nation ſo, not for a year, but for above four ſcore years;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48029:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not in the beginning of their Wars only, but till the laſt year,
that by Peace there was an end of War; not when their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
had a probable dreſs of advantage upon it, but when it
was under the greateſt improbabilities: and this not
with a thouſand mens lives onely, but with the lives of many
thouſands, whoſe blood was ſhed in their Wars. Nor did the
neceſſity of our Engagements with Rebels within, and the
neighbour Nations round about, cauſe us to withdraw our
help from them; but ſo dear were their Liberties and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the Proteſtant Religion with them to us, that it
ſeem'd to be but one Nation, one Cauſe and quarrel; being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by us with the affections of Brethren, the love of
Friends, and the reſpects of Neighbours and Allyes; nor have
we envyed at, but rejoyced in their welfare and proſperity.</p>
            <p>In proceſs of time when the late King of <hi>England,</hi> thought
fit to put in execution, what had been before contrived in his
<hi>Father's</hi> days; to wit, the enſlaving of <hi>England;</hi> and to that
end advanced his prerogative, above the Law, by which he
ought to have ruled, both by his oath, and the conſtitution of
this Nation, and his power upon the conſciences of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in the Injunction of ſuperſtitious Innovations in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Services (which with his tolleration of Popery, permitting
of many Jeſuits, and the Popes Nuntio in <hi>England,</hi> himſelf
being ſometimes ſeen at Maſs) were black ſymptomes of the
Antichriſtian darkneſs coming upon us: and to advance this
end levied Arms againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> who (then) both ſaw and
oppoſed thoſe growing miſchiefs; when theſe things anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not his expectation, but rather turned both Nations into
union to withſtand ſuch proceedings, he countenanced, if
not commiſſionated that horrid, and not to be parallel'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the blood whereof is not ſtopt to this very
day; and yet when he ſaw the Parliament more reſolved to
oppoſe his wicked and Tyrannicall proceedings, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would ſerve them, but Juſtice on his evil Councellors,
and ſecurity for their Laws and Liberties, being grieved that he
had condiſcended to any thing (though it was their due, and
what was forced from him) that concern'd their Liberty; and
that he might recover all that the People of <hi>England</hi> had got
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48029:4"/>
of their own of him and his Predeceſſors, at once by the
Sword; he ſet up his Standard at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> bidding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
defiance to the Parliament, and the Laws of <hi>England;</hi>
whereupon the flames of War broke forth in every part, and
nothing but the levying of Arms, and the ſad calamities of
War abounded in all parts of this Nation: When the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
were thus enforced to wraſtle with the powers of the
King, the Malignity and oppoſition of moſt of the Nobility
and Gentry; the whole Prelaticall and Atheiſticall party, the
Court, and Monopoly Dependants; the name of a King which
had then ſome awe amongſt the people, the Treachery and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy
of many of their Members and Officers in Civil and
Military Imployments: The War of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of forraign Kingdoms, who in point of Intereſt might be
expected to ingage againſt them; and that through the blood
of the People, and the hazards of War, they were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to proceed for the obtaining of that Liberty, which the
King was in duty to have preſerved From whom could they
expect any affections, but from the <hi>Dutch?</hi> who in point of
Intereſt, being themſelves a Commonwealth, but even now
torne out of the Jawes of Monarchy through a ſea of Blood,
and millions of Treaſure: In point of preſervation, we being
the Generations of thoſe, who took their Cauſe, out of the
duſt, and ſet it in the Throne; and who ballanced always the
late Kings envy and malice to that State: themſelves alſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the deſignes of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in their own Bowels,
working up towards the height of that Tyranny, which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
ſword would have ſet up in <hi>England.</hi> And in point of
gratitude to thoſe people, who had choſen the Neatherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
before their own ſafety, in theirs and the Neatherlanders
greateſt times of danger, were ſo deeply engaged. One
would think that their affections, their bowels, their money,
their force, and their very ſouls ſhould have been ready, to be
powred out for the Parliament, whom God made formerly
the very Inſtruments of their beeing, and upon whom they
might write the Foundation under God of their Proſperity, at
leaſt that they ſhould not maligne their Cauſe, or advantage
their Enemy. But inſtead thereof their Envy to our Nation,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48029:4"/>
Malignity to our Cauſe, aſſiſtance to our Enemy, affronts and
ſcorns to us and our friends in the day of our calamity, have
exceeded; Shall I ſay any, nay all our neighbours round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;

Magazine for Armes and Ammunition, their Arſenall for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,

conſideration of their great advantage in getting the Trade
and <hi>Riches</hi> of <hi>England</hi> into their hands by our wars, perſwaded

            <p>Nor did theſe things ſatisfie them, as if they thought they

and <hi>Mr. Strickland</hi> were lately ſent over Ambaſſadors after
the death of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (upon whom as a cauſe ſome
of the former injuries againſt us were laid) how were they
affronted, and endeavoured to be miſchieved by Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
who called them <hi>Doggs</hi> to their faces; and <hi>Apſley</hi> who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48029:5"/>
deſigned to ſtrangle the Lord <hi>Saint John</hi> in his chamber (to
ſay nothing of all the abuſes attempted upon them by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed
multitude, &amp; on their followers, and the aſſaults on
their houſes) and though they were ſome days in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
after complaints and demands of juſtice made, yet were
not ſecured, and brought to juſtice, or proſcribed to this day;
which being added to the former affronts and injuries, and the
delayes in the treaty, though it provoked not the Parliament
to a demand of preſent reparation (ſo tender have they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
been of a breach with them) yet they ſo ill reſented
it, that it was one reaſon wherefore they recalled thoſe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors.</p>
            <p>It will be too long to reckon up the ſeverall ſupplies of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
Souldiers, Arms, Ammunition, Artillery, Money, Ships,
and Proviſions, that have been iſſued from thoſe Countries for
the aſſiſtance of the late King, and the then King of <hi>Scots</hi> his
ſon, in their warres againſt the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in
<hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> particularly the 20000 Arms,
26 Field Guns, and 250 Barrels of powder, ſhipt aboard two
ſhips at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> for <hi>England;</hi> when the King of <hi>Scots</hi> was
lately at <hi>Worceſter</hi> with his Army, and at the ſaid Kings deſire.
Likewiſe, the many intollerable injuries, depredations and
Murthers committed on ſeverall of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, as in
the caſe of <hi>Amboyna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1622.</note> ſufficiently known to the world, &amp; which
was perpetrated even when the people were alive that ſaw what
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had done for them in the dayes of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
and ſoon after a ſolemn Treaty and Agreement made of
all differences between the Nations in thoſe parts: The many
high Inſolencies and affronts given this Nation at Sea, in drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Colours of <hi>England</hi> under the Sterns of their ſhips,
after they had moſt injuriouſly taken their ſhips and goods
from them, and caneing the Seamen for being (as they call'd
it) againſt their King; ſome of this practiſed on ſeverall <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
but the laſt Summer, and the robbing of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of their ſhips and goods at Sea to very great values.
Such things being fitter for a Volume then a few ſheets of
paper.</p>
            <p>It will take up too much time alſo to particularize their late
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48029:5"/>
ſecuring our ſhips and goods ſeverall times that were within
their coaſts, there being no cauſe given by us for ſuch procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;
The marching of their Forces to their frontier Towns,
beating up of Drums for Voluntiers to man 150 ſail of ſhips
of Warre, which they declared to us they were providing;
their people calling for Arms againſt us, and raging after ſuch
a manner, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants went not without danger
in their ſtreets, and all this when their Ambaſſadors were trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with us here for a ſtrict League and Union, and when we
had no thoughts of engaging againſt them, or began any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
to reinforce our Navy, though it was high time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuch alarms as thoſe, for the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the ſecurity of their Seas and Traffick.</p>
            <p>And that they might indeed ſhew their good will to this
<hi>Commonwealth,</hi> after much time had bin ſpent in treating for a
more ſtrict Union, and things were drawing to ſome concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is it not manifeſt that they meant nothing leſſe then a
peaceable accommodation, and intended their treaties as the
diſguiſed Uſhers of treachery and warre; in that <hi>Trump</hi> on the
19 of <hi>May 1652.</hi> with 42 ſhips of warre, came up to the
<hi>Downs,</hi> and there aſſaulted our Generall <hi>Blake,</hi> who riding
neer <hi>Foulſtone</hi> with fourteen ſhips only, was enforced for ſome
time by himſelf and afterwards with the reſt of his Fleet, to
maintain four hours ſharp fight till night parted them. In
which the providence of God mightily appeared, in preſerving
our Fleet, and repelling the enemy to his loſſe &amp; diſhonor and
therby delivered this Iſland at that time from the deſign, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
domination and cruelty of thoſe people, who when their
tongues were ſmoother then oyl, prepared war in their hearts,
and with their hands put it in execution. Nor can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
underſtood then a deſigned engagement, if ſo be his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring
in <hi>Dover</hi> Road with his Fleet, when extremity of
weather did not enforce him; his refuſing to ſtrike, when <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
Caſtle by their ſhot ſummoned him thereto: the denying
the Merchanrs of <hi>Dover</hi> the night before the fight, to perform
their accuſtomed civility to viſit their Fleet; his ſending two
of his ſhips to Major <hi>Bourn,</hi> who lay there onely with eight
ſail of ſhips, the ſtriking of thoſe ſhips, and their endeavours
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48029:6"/>
ſeemingly to excuſe <hi>Van Trumps</hi> coming ſo neer, and alledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the reaſon why he came no neerer, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to avoid giving
offence, in regard of the controverſie (as he called it) of the
Flag; and that he intended no injury to the <hi>Engliſh Nation:</hi>
which made Major <hi>Bourn</hi> jealous that they intended ſome
miſchiefe; therefore he commanded out two ſhips to attend
their motions, and ſent Generall <hi>Blake</hi> notice of their being
there: His moving the next day towards the <hi>French Coaſts</hi>
when Generall <hi>Blake</hi> came in ſight of him, and upon ſpeaking
with a <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſell, which made all the ſail ſhe could to
him, and wafted her Flag to ſignifie as much; his comming up
preſently with full wind and ſail to Generall <hi>Blake,</hi> who rode
alone from his other ſhips; his refuſing to ſtrike (the ancient
and undoubted acknowledgement of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> right and
ſoveraignty in the adjacent Seas) when Generall <hi>Blake</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
him thereunto by a Gun without a Ball, another with
a Ball, his fiering through Generall <hi>Blakes</hi> Colours, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon him with a broad ſide immediatly without any parly,
before Generall <hi>Blake</hi> gave him a broad ſide; his ſetting up
preſently a red Flag, which being the ſigne before given; the
reſt of his ſhips fel on our General, and maintained with him &amp;
his other ſhips, a very hot fight, as aforeſaid, and as by the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
of the engagement, and the examinations of his own Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
and letters relating thereunto, printed by order of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and ordered to be given unto their Ambaſſadors, as
an anſwer to their Papers and Deſires for the proceed of the
Treaty doth appear. Together with his being angry with one
of the ſaid <hi>Captains</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> becauſe he ſtruck ſail to our
Friggats, as he came from the <hi>Streights,</hi> as the ſaid Captain
and the Lieutenant now taken priſoners, upon their examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
acknowledge; beſides what other accounts we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of their debates, and preparations to engage our
Fleet.</p>
            <p>Now what hath <hi>England</hi> done to theſe people, that might
occaſion any ſuch diſingenuous and hoſtile proceedings? Oh,
that they would produce their cauſe, that we might anſwer
thereunto, and leave it to the world to judge! Certainly had
they any reall cauſe to aſſign, that might bear weight in the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48029:6"/>
ballance we ſhould have heard thereof ere now; for they are
a people that are ſeldom wanting in things of that Nature.</p>
            <p>Only we heard that the granting of Letters of Mart by us,
hath been made uſe of to incenſe thoſe people againſt this
State, and by making of them mad, under that pretence to
ſhed their blood in an unjuſt war, and to haſten their own and
the deſtruction of their Countrey. There is nothing more
clear then that the granting of Letters of Mart, in caſes where
Juſtice is denied to be done, after it hath been duely ſought
(as is our caſe) is a neceſſary, lawfull, and juſt way, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Reaſon; and the Laws of Nations, practiſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the world, and by themſelves; and that ſuch Letters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſall
are ſo far from being the occaſion of War, that they
are in ſuch caſes the ultimate Preſervatives againſt Nationall
Engagements (otherwiſe for Injuries done to the Subjects of
any Nation by a Forraign People, War muſt effect the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
or it may be lawfull for any to rob and ſpoyl on the
Seas, that are enabled with power ſo to do) it might occaſion
ſome diſcourſe of that nature at large, and the quoting of their
own, as well as the practiſes of other Nations for Inſtances:
but thus hath been the caſe with us, that for very great Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Blood, and after above twenty years waiting in ſome
caſes for Juſtice of them, which being denyed, the Juſtice of
this State renewed but one Letter of Repriſall upon them in
the caſe of Miſtriſs <hi>Paulet,</hi> granted by the late King for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence
of 20000 l. principal, beſides charges, of 20 years ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
her ſelf and Family being brought thereby to a morſell of
bread; yet when that was underſtood to be made uſe of by
ſome Malignant ſpirits, to prevent that Union, which was
ſaid to be endeavouring by their Ambaſſadors in their Treaty,
that all occaſion might be taken from thoſe that ſought occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of difference, this State ſuſpended that Act, before it was
fully ſatisfied; and not only ſo, but all Letters of Repriſall upon
the French, who had ſo notoriouſly, and to very great damages
injur'd the Merchants of <hi>England;</hi> notwithſtanding that
theſe wronged men had been at a great deal of coſts to ſet
out ſhips for recompence, and had not accompliſh'd it, being
thereby enforc'd to ſit down by the loſs of thoſe charges alſo.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48029:7"/>
And all this to remove any occaſion of clamour, that might
unduely happen upon the ſearching of Dutch Ships for French
Goods; though it is a known thing that the French covered
their Goods in Flemiſh bottoms, to avoid giving the Engliſh
ſatisfaction: and this we did, notwithſtanding that we paid
the Dutch for the fraught of the French Goods found aboard
them, without taking any of their goods at any time: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
whereof our Merchants have found, when as the Dutch
have taken not only the Portugall Goods found aboard the
Engliſh, but ſuch Engliſh Ships and Goods alſo, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of ſatisfaction to this day, of which we have pregnant
teſtimonie; yet the ſearching for French Goods aboard
their Veſſels, is ſo equitable and neceſſary, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(unleſs we land Armies in <hi>France)</hi> to have any reparation,
ſo long as the French may wholly manage their Trade in
Dutch Veſſels.</p>
            <p>But to any rationall man, this cannot be the cauſe of the late
tranſactions of thoſe people to us; for firſt a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any Letters of Reprizall were granted, they performed all
thoſe evil Offices aforementioned in the generall; and ſince
thoſe Letters of Reprizall both on themſelves and French
for their ſakes, have been ſuſpended: their Admiral with his
Fleet came to our Borders; and whilſt we lay ſecurely, in a
time of friendſhip and Treaty, came upon and aſſaulted part
of our Navy, as is formerly mentioned at large; whereby it
appears, that as they formerly helped on our deſtruction ſo
far as it concerned their profit, and to lay us, and our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
at the feet of a bloudy Tyrant, ſo it is now their reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as they are able, to bring down this Nation to ſerve their
Luſts and Cruelty; and this as a reward for our ſaving of
them from the ſword of Spain, and ſpilling our blood and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
on the ground to lay the Foundation, and ſecure the
ſtructure of their Riches and Proſperity. The Blood of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna</hi>
ſhewed formerly how ſuch things reliſhed their Pallats;
and the clapping Captain <hi>Green</hi> and his men in Chains of late:
together with the outrages committed on our Ambaſſadors,
and ſeveral Engliſh people in their Territories: their ſeverall
Arreſts on our Ships and goods in their Ports, and the late
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48029:7"/>
Engagement of <hi>Van Trump</hi> do now clearly demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>Though every weeks occurrences fild our ears with the noiſe
of their preparations, and the ranting and vile expreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this State: the abuſe of the Engliſh there, and their
Ambaſſadors giving our Councell of State and Parliament,
Papers of their Reſolutions of ſetting forth one hundred and
fifty ſhips of War, extraordinary (which we might then very
well conclude, and have cauſe now to be aſſured, were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
againſt us) yet till thoſe Papers came, the Parliament mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not at all, in any extraordinary preparations: and then
how requiſit it was for this State to prepare, for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their Seas, and of that part of the ancient and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Dominion of <hi>England,</hi> let the world judge. Yet, ſo
did they prepare, as only to ſecure their own Right, and what
high time it was ſo to do, the forementioned inſolent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile
behaviour of ſome of their ſhips to Captain <hi>Young,</hi> for
which the States gave one of the Captains a chain of gold, and
of <hi>Van Trump,</hi> to our Navy, whom they continue ſtill in his
Imployment, thereby owning his late action is evident to all
men.</p>
            <p>It is worthy obſervation to conſider unto what a height of
Ingratitude, Injuſtice and forgetfulneſs, the pride of theſe
men hath lifted them up; It is not unknown to the world,
and to themſelves, though they would willingly forget it,
what was their condition, when <hi>England</hi> firſt undertook their
protection, and what <hi>England</hi> hath done for them; how they
have permitted them to paſs through their Seas, to manage
their Merchandiſe, and required only their ſtriking to our ſhips
and Caſtles in acknowledgement of our Soveraignty. And to
fiſh in our Seas, ſometimes upon the requiring of a certain
Tax, ſometimes freely, and yet ſo bold are they upon our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Indulgence, and condiſcentions as to come up to our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dores, and by treachery and force endeavour to ſnatch the
Dominion thereof out of our hands, though they cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
one particular, wherein the Engliſh hath deſigned or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
any incroachment upon their Rights and Priviledges;
but have maintained them againſt all their oppoſers. And no
doubt but thoſe men, who with ſo much impudence and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48029:8"/>
have attempted, to diſpoyle us of ſo antient and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable
a Right, whereby our very defence (for thoſe Seas,
and our Ships, are the outwalls and Bulwarks of this Iſland)
is endeanoured to be broken; will alſo as they have oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
labour to diſpoſſeſs us of our Land Inheritance.</p>
            <p>But as the former Kings of <hi>England</hi> took a ſevere courſe
to chaſtiſe and cut off ſuch luxuriant Exorbitances, and as the
Providence of God hath in their late Engagements given
them a very great check, ſo we doubt not but the Wiſdom and
Juſtice of the State (through the aſſiſtance of God) will ſo
effectually proceed in the vindication of ſuch wrongs, as ſhall
let them know, what Right of ours they have encroached up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and by effectual ways perſwading them from attempting
ſuch uſurpations for the future. What high time it is to take
order with ſuch men, and reduce them to their proper bounds,
let the World judge; and if that hereafter this State exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a more ſtrict Command over their own Juriſdiction, in
letting thoſe men know at what rate they ſhall buy their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment
on our Liberties, they may thank themſelves for
ſuch experience.</p>
            <p>It is not the bare Complement of ſtriking the Flag, that hath
been the occaſion of theſe late conteſts, as they would ſeem to
pretend, to gull and cheat well minded people, as if ſo be for
ſuch a ſlight thing, as the putting off a mans hat, or the not
putting it off, were the ground of the late engagement, or of
what ſhall enſue thereupon; In vain is ſuch a ſnare as this ſet
in the ſight of <hi>England;</hi> But it is the abſolute and ſubſtantial
Soveraignty of the narrow Seas, which on our parts by ſuch a
deportment as the ſtriking of the Flag, or Topſail to our ſhips
on thoſe ſeas, is required to be acknowledged, and ſo hath
been for many hundred years, underſtood, agreed unto, and
acknowledged by the Nations of <hi>Eruope,</hi> which the <hi>Dutch</hi> by
refuſing to ſtrike would deny.<note place="margin">O d. Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mons in in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, April 5. 1643.</note> A thing of ſuch high impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that the former Kings would never endure, but in their
Commiſſions to their Captains at Sea, commanded them to
require obedience thereto by all, or to fire, ſink, or deſtroy
them; and which both Houſes of Parliament in their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to that purpoſe, commanded their Maritin Officers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48029:8"/>
Now the <hi>Dutch</hi> refuſing to ſtrike, do deny our Title, and
by their armed Fleets endeavour to take poſſeſſion of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance:
therefore though to extenuate their hoſtility, and
cover their deſignes, they would fain make the ſtriking of the
Flag a frivolous thing; yet it is of as much concernment to us,
as the Dominion of thoſe Seas, and therin of our defence, and
the commodity of Fiſhing, which thoſe Seas yeeld in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;
and which themſeves have found to be of ſo vaſt an
advantage, as that they know it to be the great ſtaple of their
Trade and Merchandize, and the food of many Families; the
ſweetneſs whereof they having taſted through our former Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences,
and our late neglect by reaſon of our Warres, would
now to ſettle it upon themſelves, force into their own hands.</p>
            <p>And this together with the managing of our Trade for our
beſt advantage, held forth in the Act for <hi>Navigation;</hi> and
what elſe may be found convenient for ſuch an end, may be
ſtrongly preſumed to be the true grounds of their quarrell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, and of the late engagement, though the aſſignment
of the latter is too groſſe for them to hold forth to the world:
for that is as much as to take upon them to give law to
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, what through the negligence of former Kings,
and the corruption of their Miniſters of State, the overlooking
the ſubtilties and encroachments of theſe people, the ties of
gratitude and friendſhip that were ſuppoſed to be upon them,
and the confuſion of our late warres, they had not only got
a Staple of Trade as aforeſaid; but had almoſt ingroſt all our
Trade, and thereby ſpoyled us of our Navigation and Maritin
Defence. Our long voyages about the world, which carried
the reputation of <hi>England</hi> through all the parts thereof, being
curted to their borders, and moſtly in their own ſhips, to fetch
from their ſtores at the ſecond hand, and to retail it in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
by reaſon of which, our gallant ſhips being drawn up
and neglected, in a little time, we might inſenſibly have thoſe
locks of ours cut off, and be fallen upon by them, when we were
not in a capacity to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is through the
mercy of God, brought out of its <hi>war</hi> &amp; <hi>blood;</hi> &amp; through dear
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48029:9"/>
experiences taught to mind its own concernment, and to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
and avoid ſuch ſnares as theſe. And becauſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſee
themſelves prevented of <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>aking our Markets, emptying our
Pockets, and fiſhing in our troubled waters, as they had done
for many years before, therefore are they offended, and would
now by force, if they could, conclude us under that &amp; a worſe
neceſſity, and rather then fail, embroyl us and their people in a
bloody warre, which themſelves have already begun, And this
is the true reaſon wherefore they have all along aſſiſted the
late: King and his ſon in all our warres, and have been troubled
at the late rout at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and our other ſucceſſes, as much
as the <hi>Gavalier;</hi> becauſe they knew that a <hi>Commonwealth</hi>
would deprive them of thoſe ſweet Bits, and might be expected
to purſue things for their own advantage.</p>
            <p>Beſides, they had large experience what their gold could do
at <hi>Court,</hi> which in a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> well ordered would be of
little effect: &amp; no doubt theſe things had prevailed with them
openly, to have aſſerted the Kings intereſt, had not (as I have
ſaid before) the advantage of trading to all our ports during
our warrs, blinded them into a ſeeming Newtrality.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, <hi>Nature</hi> hath ſhut them up from all Merchandize,
if our paſſage through the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> Seas were denied
them; therefore hath this Nation made their Seas ſo far open,
as to give them liberty through them to paſſe unto their traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick;
and that they may ſafely paſſe, have been at the vaſt
coſts of ſtrong <hi>Navies:</hi> but muſt they therefore deny our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
thereof, and to make ſuch acknowledgement as ought
to be, and hath been time out of mind agreed upon, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed
to by all Nations? Or muſt therefore the Riches in
thoſe Seas be as much theirs as ours? This, were it in their own
caſe, would be ſaid by them to be an inference very forraign,
&amp; would not be indured, nor indeed ought it ſo to be. Becauſe
a man permits a thorough-fare through his ground for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
of Travellers, or the Countrey, ſhall the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
therefore refuſe to acknowledge the propriety of the
owner to his land? Shall he refuſe to perform ſuch a thing, as
he ſhall require for the acknowledgement of his propriety,
leſt in time it become common through preſcription? ſhall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48029:9"/>
the Herbage, Corn, Wood, or whatſoever grows upon it, or
the Mines under it, be by him claimed with as equall a right
as the Proprietor? Or will it be good manners or honeſty for
ſuch a paſſenger with armed force, to deny the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the right of the owner, and to endeavour the making
common the ſaid land, and what growes upon it, or within it?
If the Proprietor hereupon ſhall to ſuch perſons ſhut up his
paſſage, and with armed force ſecure the growth of his Land
from ſuch intruſion, and blood ſhould be drawn thereupon;
whom will you judge in ſuch a caſe to be the occaſion thereof,
the Proprietor, or ſuch an ungrateful and injurious paſſenger?
This, upon due conſideration, wil appear to be much our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
caſe, and which I ſhould be more large in; but that a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Treatiſe on that ſubject, will be ſhortly brought forth to

their <hi>undoubted Rights,</hi> or loſſe of time in proſecuting their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
for ſatisfaction and ſecurity: in regard that both by

may lay a <hi>Foundation</hi> for us to pitch upon in that particular, &amp;
where we cannot be aſſured of that, as a <hi>Foundation;</hi> to what
advantage wil the concluſion of any thing bee, or what encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
is there for any proceeds in things of that nature?
For though Leagues are confirmed with all the ſacredneſs that
man knowes of to bind the performance, yet if advantage be
Paramount to ſuch ſtipulations, when a fair opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is preſented, no bonds be they never ſo high and

Homage to the ſupream <hi>Deity</hi> of <hi>Gain</hi> &amp; <hi>Profit.</hi> Principles that

one, <hi>That Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks.</hi> And
upon ſuch Quick-ſands, the <hi>Foundation of true Peace</hi> cannot be

I wiſh that our Neighbours of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> had
adminiſtred nothing of this nature to us, whereby we may be
rationally put to a loſſe in this particular. Certainly their
carriage in the buſineſſe of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> within a year or two
after the concluſion of the <hi>Treaty</hi> in the year 1619. and their
not making ſatisfaction to this day, though it ſhould have
been by the year 1625. their chuſing Arms rather then ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for other injuries done by them to us, and the late aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
of <hi>Trump</hi> on our Fleet upon our Borders, whilſt we were
in Amity, treating for, and neer a concluſion of a ſtrict
Union, gives us juſt ground ſo to underſtand them: and we
wiſh that the ſerious reflects on what their carriage hath been
to other <hi>States</hi> in this particular, mentioned in the later end of
this diſcourſe at large, beſides our own experience, to ſay no
more, gave us not fair warning how we truſt thoſe, who when
<hi>they ſpeak of Peace, have War in their hearts;</hi> If their former
ill Offices to this <hi>State</hi> had been reflected on, as they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
there would have been occaſion enough wherefore this
<hi>State</hi> ſhould have refuſed any <hi>treaty</hi> with them, til ſatisfaction
had been firſt given, and ſecurity. But notwithſtanding all,
the Parliament hoping that their own former actions had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
them, and being willing to take all opportunities to
continue friendſhip between them and us, as they had alwayes
done heretofore, paſt over all other conſiderations, and having
given their Ambaſſadors honorable and friendly <hi>Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
ordered the <hi>Councel of State to treat with them;</hi> in which
there was an uninterrupted proceeding, till by the late hoſtile
aſſault of our Navy by <hi>Van Trump,</hi> themſelves cut the Cords
thereof, and gave us to underſtand what dealing we were to
expect at their hands.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, when a little after the ſaid aſſault, the
Lord <hi>Pauw</hi> came over to <hi>England</hi> as an extraordinary Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador,
pretending that he had full power to accommodate all
things. The <hi>Parliament</hi> gave his Lordſhip honorable <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,</hi>
and the <hi>Councell of State,</hi> notwithſtanding their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great occaſions, were rather before hand, then otherwiſe,
in the management of the <hi>Treaty,</hi> deſiring if it might have
been rather an accommodation then a warre; Yet during the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48029:10"/>
ſpace of almoſt three weeks, the time that he was here, he
neither agreed with the <hi>Parliament</hi> in the matter of Fact of
the late <hi>Aſſault,</hi> nor propoſed any thing in way of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
nor in compliance with that one Demand of
the <hi>Parliament viz. To have ſatisfaction for their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
charge they had been put to by their late Preparations
and Aſſault.</hi> Nor produced full power to conclude what
ſhould be agreed upon; But deſired that the matter of the
<hi>Aſſault</hi> might be paſt over, or put into examination: And
that there might be a ceſſation of Arms whilſt thoſe things
were treated on; though when the <hi>Spaniſh Plenipotentiaries</hi>
at <hi>Munſter</hi> did earneſtly deſire a ceſſation of acts of <hi>Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
both by Sea and Land, whilſt the late <hi>Treaty</hi> was at
<hi>Munſter:</hi> The <hi>States Plenipotentiaries,</hi> particularly, the
Lord <hi>Pauw</hi> himſelfe anſwered, <hi>That it was not uſuall for
States to make any Ceſſation of Arms during a Treaty,</hi> and
was utterly againſt it. Though that ceſſation was deſired by
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe Government the <hi>States</hi> had ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off, and the war was on that Foot: And the ceſſation
which the Lord <hi>Pauw</hi> deſired of us, was in the name of that
<hi>State,</hi> whoſe Navy in the time of <hi>Amity</hi> and <hi>Treaty</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to have ſurprized our Fleet at our doors.</p>
            <p>And when he heard that our Fleet was ſet ſail, <hi>June 26.</hi> It
ſtaying in the <hi>Downs</hi> all that time he had been here, expecting
what concluſion ſhould be made, the next day he deſired a
Paſſe and ſafe convoy for himſelfe and the reſt of the <hi>Lords
States Ambaſſadors,</hi> becauſe as he ſaid a ceſſation of Armes
was not granted; though the <hi>Parliament</hi> put the ceſſation one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the paying or giving them ſecurity for the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
charge they had been put to by them as aforeſaid, as the
<hi>Parliament Declaration</hi> mentions at large. And having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
their leave of the <hi>Parliament</hi> on the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> after, they
departed towards <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and ſo for <hi>Holland.</hi>

            <p>Now let all <hi>Europe</hi> judge between us and the Neatherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;

This hath been the dealing of <hi>England</hi> towards

of Friends only, but with the love of Brethren, not
for our advantage to give Law to them, poſſeſs their Towns,

but to enable them to give Law in their own Borders, to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
their Habitations, and Eſtates in ſafety, and to make them
not only diſtinct from their Enemie; but entire, ſtrong, and
abſolute in their own Juriſdiction: we picked no Quarrels, or
made pretences to keep their Cautionary Towns, no, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
them; though all our money is not paid to this very
day. We made not our ſelves a third party to ſerve our ſelves
upon them, or have we joyned with their Enemie. We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
not their Proſperity or Riches, but rejoyced in their good
condition. We wiſhed not them broken, that we might be
repleniſhed; nor hath ſo much as a thought to deſtroy them,
come into our hearts: we have not beat the Drum, or ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
firſt the Alarm of War to them, or made the firſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
thereunto, though we have been thus ill requited by
them, for all our Love, Money, our powring forth of our
Blood for them, and hazarding thereby our own beeing,
though we have been thus maligned and hated, even beyond
the meaſure of the Cavaliers hatred, Envy and Malignity. Thus
endeavoured with the exerciſe of our Religion, Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Wives, Children, Eſtates, and all that's pretious and dear
to us, in the world, to be delivered into the bloudy power of
that Tyrannicall King, who had wanted not a will to betray
even themſelves to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as he did thoſe Nobles of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> who had ſent to him for protection, and whoſe

by their Ambaſſadors in the year 1645. who to their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48029:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
faces gave the Juſtice on the Kings ſide. Thus ſhut out of
dores, when our Agent <hi>Strickland</hi> could not have audience
with the States General, though he waited for it a year and
a half. Thus murthered barbarouſly when our Reſident <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſlaus</hi>

by Prince <hi>Edward</hi> to our Ambaſſadors faces, and deſigned to
be ſtrangled by that vile <hi>Apſley,</hi> when our Ambaſſadors were

we were treating with them for a more ſtrict Union Thus
ſlighted in that ſlow Treaty to no purpoſe; and the plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of their looking for a <hi>Scotch</hi> line to meaſure our

Plundred and robb'd in the taking of our ſhips

their bloud, their hardſhips for you? What is it that hath
made you to affect and aſſiſt that curſed thing of Monarchy
in theſe Nations, which you before us, ſaw to be a Plague,
and adventured your <hi>All</hi> to be rid of it, and which hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
all its ſupporters; and which God hath made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be an accurſed thing as clear as the Sun at noon day?
What is it that makes you retrograde to your Principles of a

            </p>

Countery, and to improve, what God in nature, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and by the dreadfulneſs of War, hath handed to us?
Why ſhould you covet our Trade, and Riches, and not rather
be contented with what God gives you, though it were with a
ſparing hand? Why ſhould you rather delight to ſee us in
our Blood; our Cities and Habitations laid waſte; Our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Wives, Virgins, proſtituted to the mercy of the Bloody
Enemies of God and us: and rather then fail, endeavour it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48029:13"/>
with your own hands, then that you ſhould be diſappointed
of the ſweetneſs of that gain, you got by our Loſſes and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines?
Why ſhould you be grieved at the heart, that you did
not fully aſſert the King of <hi>Scots</hi> intereſt, when as you ſee
God is againſt him, and againſt his bloudy Houſe; And the
Lord knows how much you are under vengeance, for what
you have done for him, already? Would you be thus meaſured
to your ſelves?</p>
            <p>Doe you think that the Cauſe here which hath in its weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

will not quit it ſelf againſt your unrighteous Attempts?</p>
            <p>Think you that this State, who to do their People Right,
have not ſpared King, nor Conſtitution, Friend or Brother;
but have travelled through ten years bloudy Wars; waiting
upon God for ſuch a day as this, Even in the way of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which he hath brought forth; Ought or can with a
<hi>Salvo</hi> to their Duty, and a due regard to the preſence of
God, with them in purſuing Right, and the Reputation hee
hath put upon them, permit the People of <hi>England</hi> to be ſo
groſſely injur'd? No, no, ſhould they, which I truſt never will
be; the Lord will finde a way, to preſerve his Cauſe amongſt
Us, and right Us on our Enemies; for it is God that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageth
our Cauſe and Intereſt, whoſe wonted Preſence as
we found it upon your late Aſſault; So we doubt no, but that
he will Signally manifeſt that he is with Us upon our future
Engagements.</p>
            <p>In the humble confidence of which, we go forth, and wait
upon him for a Bleſſing on our Undertakings.</p>
            <p>I had thought here to have concluded; but ſithence the
States of the United Provinces, and their Abettors talk ſo
much, of the Reformed Proteſtant Religion, and of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and endeavour to inſinuate ſome Indearment upon the
hearts of many, upon that account: It ſeems to mee to bee
worth the while, and very neceſſary a little to diſcourſe, how
far thoſe States, have by their Actions appeared conſiderable,
at to thoſe two grand and noble Intereſts, and thoſe things
being well weighed, together with the Cauſe now on foot
in <hi>England,</hi> their Carriage to other States in point of Leagues,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48029:13"/>
Treaties and Amity, and particularly with this Nation, how
far it is ſafe for <hi>England</hi> to enter into a ſtrict League and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with thoſe People.</p>
            <p>Intereſt is the true <hi>Zenith</hi> of every State and Perſon, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to which they may certainly be underſtood, though cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
never ſo much with the moſt ſpecious diſguiſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Juſtice and Neceſſity: And Actions are the effects of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
from whom they proceed, and to whom they tend
naturally as the ſtone doth downward. So that unleſs it be
in ſome things ſeemingly contrary Acted, now and then, the
better to work about the grand End: (for the Devil himſelf
moſtly deceives, when he appears as an Angel of Light) and
in caſes of neceſſity where force and power conſtrain another
Courſe, (which will return into the old Channel, the firſt
opportunity) thereby the meaſure of every ſtate and perſon
may be taken and determined. Therefore it will be requiſite
to inſtance in ſome of the practiſes of the United Provinces
in reference to the things propoſed; where by ſome Judgment
may be given therein; And if ſuch Preſidents be not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to what they do pretend, yet it is but their own Picture,
by which if they would not have themſelves known, they
ſhould have forborn by ſuch Practiſes, to have ſet it forth to
the world, or by their late Actions to neceſſitate Us in point
of our ſafety and intimate concernment, to ſet forth any thing
of that nature, for a warning to <hi>England:</hi> It being ſo farre
from us to delight in the uncovering of their nakedneſſe, that
we wiſh (if the Lord had pleaſed) that there had been no
ſuch things done, or any occaſions offered us, to take notice
thereof, ſince we have wiſhed ſo well to, and done ſo much
for their advantage.</p>
            <p>Firſt, concerning the Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion:
True it is, that it hath been there for many years profeſſed,
and exerciſed; and with the fruit of the power of Godlineſs,
in many afore time, and wee hope at this preſent that ſome
are there eminent for the profeſſion thereof: and they have
been a place of Refuge to many precious Saints, from the
bitter perſecutions of the Enemies of God, and true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Iſay. 16. 4.</note>
which God hath always taken well even of <hi>Moab,</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48029:14"/>
hath rewarded it with long and many kindneſſes, and for his
peoples ſake, and the hiding of his out-caſts, hath lengthned
the tranquillity of places, who otherwiſe have been the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of his wrath: And if any thing prevail with God to ſave
them from deſtruction, certainly this will be a chief one: but
withall it is to be conſidered,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all other Religions, have had their profeſſions
there as well as the Proteſtant, and the Exiles thereof recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and protected, even of what is moſt contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Exerciſe and Protection aforeſaid is upon a State
principle of advantage, not upon a principle of true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereby they not only keep quiet at home, but draw all
ſuch people to their quarters. (It being the only place of ſuch
priviledge in the world) and thereby have been poſſeſſors of
their Vertues, Ingenuities, Friends, Occupations, Perſons,
and Eſtates.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the 36 Articles that themſelves propoſed to <hi>England,</hi>
as the matter of a Treaty for a ſtrict Union formerly, and in
their late Treaties here, they have neither mentioned, nor
propoſed any thing concerning Religion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In point of gain, they have not only deſerted the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of effecting the liberty of the true Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in other places, which they might have done by their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and intereſt; and particularly their own fleſh and bloud.
Contrary to their holy and perpetual Union (as it is ſtyled)
but have aſſiſted Popiſh Princes againſt the poor Proteſtants;
when they have been contending in bloud for their Religion
and Liberty, as by the following inſtances may appear.</p>
            <p>In the 13 Article of the Union of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tricht,</hi> in the year
1579. it is ſaid; That what concerneth the point of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Thoſe of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> ſhall diſpoſe of it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their pleaſure, and the other Provinces of this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
may regulate themſelves according to the intention of
the Treaty of Peace about Religion made between Archduke
<hi>Matthias,</hi> Governour and Captain General then of theſe
Lands, with thoſe of his Councel of the States General in the
year 1558.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48029:14"/>
In the firſt Article of the ſaid Union is promiſed an Eternal
Union, and never to ſeparate, (conſequently never to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the members that have ſigned the ſaid Union; Amongſt
thoſe that ſigned the ſaid Union, are alſo thoſe of <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
thoſe of <hi>Gant,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Bruges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Contrary to this Union thoſe of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> made
a Truce with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the year 1609. for 12 years, and
a peace in the year 1648. and left out the ſaid Towns of
<hi>Antwerp,</hi> &amp;c. notwithſtanding that there was all likelihood,
that they might have delivered thoſe Towns, from the yoak
of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and have obtained freedome, if they would
for thoſe of the Proteſtant Religion in thoſe Towns, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for <hi>Antwerp,</hi> as by what follows may appear. For the
Town of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> 'tis true it was taken by the Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
and in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> poſſeſſion; but how eaſily it might
have been re-taken, will appear, when as it is conſidered, that
upon a new League and Agreement made with <hi>Lewis 14.</hi> King
of <hi>France,</hi> and the States of the United Provinces to purſue
the War againſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> conjointly: the ſaid King drew
20000 Foot, and 4000 Horſe into the Field in <hi>Flanders,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the third Article of the ſaid League, infeſting the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> on the one hand, whilſt the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> drew
his Army forth towards <hi>Antwerp,</hi> upon the ſame Article, to
aſsiſt the taking in of which, the <hi>French</hi> over &amp; above the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
agreement of men and money, lent them 3000 horſe and
3000 foot, which alſo were ſhipped and landed, as deſired,
ready to join in performance of that exploit. The Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> having taken in the Caſtle of <hi>Teemche,</hi> lying by the
<hi>Scheld</hi> beyond <hi>Autwerp;</hi> The <hi>French</hi> the Town of <hi>Dunkerk,</hi>
might eaſily have made himſelf Maſter of the Town of <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp;</hi>
they within having as good as tendred themſelves up
to him; yet the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> neither beſieged nor aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ſaid Town: but having left the Caſtle of <hi>Teemche,</hi>
aſſoon as he had taken it, in a manner, the deſign pretended
againſt <hi>Antwerp</hi> vaniſht, to the great diſcontent of the <hi>French,</hi>
whoſe 6000 ſupplies were not made uſe of, and committed
many outrages, in the County of <hi>Waes,</hi> and the leaving that
Town in the hands of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the poor Proteſtants
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48029:15"/>
there, their owne fleſh and blood (called in diriſion <hi>Brothers)</hi>
to the oppreſſion of the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> and other miſchiefes to
this very day; contrary to the Union aforeſaid, whereby
they were obliged to redeem them (if taken) out of the hand
of the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How eaſie it was for them to have poſſeſſed <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
the forementioned particulars do evince; and the whole Army
of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> that were there know, and the world
is not ignorant thereof: And all this for no other reaſon, as
can be imagined, but that the Town of <hi>Antwerp</hi> being thus
reduced, would have drawn to its ſelfe its ancient and great
<hi>Trade,</hi> which <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> enjoyes, whilſt <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi>
continues in the hand of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the <hi>Scheld</hi> ſhut up.</p>
            <p>In the year 1624. preſently after the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Campeigne,</hi>
made between <hi>Lewis 13.</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> of
the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> concerning a Subſidie againſt <hi>Spain;</hi>
another little <hi>Treaty</hi> was at the <hi>Hague,</hi> between the King of
<hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>States,</hi> wherein the <hi>States</hi> agreed to furniſh
the King of <hi>France</hi> with 20 ſhips under the command of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
<hi>Haultaine</hi> in a deſign to ſhut up <hi>Genoa</hi> by water, whilſt
the Conſtable <hi>Leſdigueries</hi> ſhould beſiege it by land.</p>
            <p>The War between the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> of which <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi>
was the chief, and the King of <hi>France</hi> falling out in the
mean time, the ſaid King agreed alſo by his <hi>Ambaſſador Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
de Belluion</hi> with the ſaid <hi>States</hi> for 20 ſhips againſt the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> whereof having received 8. the <hi>French</hi>
King by his Ambaſſador <hi>Monſieur d'Eſpeſſes</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi>
moved the <hi>States,</hi> that in regard he had preſent need of the
other twelve ſhips, which were not yet ready, that the
<hi>States</hi> ſhould let him have twelve of the twenty that were
deſigned for <hi>Genoa,</hi> to be commanded by <hi>French</hi> Officers,
though the Lords <hi>States</hi> judged it better, that they ſhould be
commanded by their own. And theſe ſhips were to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt the Duke of <hi>Sonbize</hi> principally, who was tending
to <hi>England</hi> for reliefe: Whereupon the Lords <hi>States</hi> deputed
the Lords of <hi>Eſſen, Noortwyck,</hi> and <hi>Bootelar,</hi> to enter into
conference with the ſaid <hi>Ambaſſador;</hi> who after many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48029:15"/>
the 12. of <hi>Aprill 1625.</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> did finally agree
and conclude, Firſt, That the 20 ſhips ſhould he forthwith
ſent to Sea, and that the Admiral <hi>Haultain,</hi> that ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them, being come to the height of <hi>Callice</hi> and <hi>Dover,</hi>
ſhall give advice thereof to his Majeſties Troops being at
<hi>Haure de Grace,</hi> That they may there imbarque themſelves,
and that they then doe joyn with the Fleet, and conjunctly
ſteer their courſe to the Iſle of <hi>Wight;</hi> where being informed
where the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> did keep himſelf, and what For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
he might have: And having firſt reſolved how they might
ſet upon him, then they ſhould put aboard the <hi>French</hi> Foot
into 12 of thoſe ſhips, which afterwards ſhould be commanded
by <hi>French</hi> Officers, under the conduct of the Admirall <hi>Haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
and this notwithſtanding without removing out of the
ſhips, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Captains, Officers, or Mariners: but in caſe
they ſhould be informed, That the Duke of <hi>Sonbize</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to obedience, or that the 12 ſhips of Supplies were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
then the ſaid 20 ſhips ſhall remain under the conduct
of their Captains; and the laſt 12 arrived ſhips ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>French</hi> Captains; and then the 20 according to
<hi>Treaty,</hi> might paſſe, as it was agreed on.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſhips were imployed againſt the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> and
the charge defrayed by the <hi>French</hi> King; and if any of the
ſaid ſhips came to miſcarry in the <hi>French</hi> ſervice, the loſs was
to be made good by the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Admirall<hi> Haultain </hi>was at Sea in the Deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
a Gentleman came to give his wife a viſit; who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her how ſhe did, ſhe told him,<hi> That ſhe was very much
perplext, and troubled in herſelf, not being able to ſatisfie her
own Conſcience: For if ſhe prayed for the proſperity of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
then ſhe ſhould pray againſt her owne Religion: For her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
ſerved againſt the Proteſtants: And on the other ſide, if ſhe
prayed for the Proteſtants, then ſhe ſhould pray againſt her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet it is obſervable, how God croſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> in point of
advantage in this buſineſs: For though the ſhips performed
very great ſervice for the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the poor <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi>
were utterly ſubdued; yet the King of <hi>France,</hi> or the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48029:16"/>
Cardinal <hi>Richelieua</hi> little after ordered a great number of their
<hi>Merchant ſhips</hi> to be kept by force in the <hi>French Harbours,</hi> and
altogether, ſome with their Cables, Anchors, Lading, and
what elſe belonged to them, were ſunk in the Channell of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell;</hi>
for which great loſſe and charge, the <hi>Dutch</hi> were not
paid in many years after. And when they were paid, it was
by piecemeals, being enforced to give great Bribes and Preſents
for the accompliſhing thereof.</p>
            <p>And to all this I might add, what they have done in aſſiſting
the late King of <hi>England</hi> and his ſon againſt the truly godly of
this Nation. But this is already diſcourſed.</p>
            <p>When a people come to be bold on God,<note place="margin">5.</note> and in preſumption
of his favour, upon ſome good act or other of theirs; take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to commit all manner of wickedneſſe, even to the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out the face of<hi> Religion, </hi>ſuppoſing that God is engaged
to paſſe by their iniquity, becauſe of ſome acts of righteouſnes,
and make ſuch uſe of his patience and long-ſuffering, which
ſhould lead them unto repentance,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 9.</note> as to think he delayes his
coming, and therefore fall on beating their fellow-ſervants, and
eat and drink with the drunken, and of his holding of
his peace, and permitting of them ſucceſs, that he is one like
unto themſelves, and approves of their falſneſs and wickedneſs.
Here what the<hi> Scripture </hi>ſaith in this particular,<hi> Pſal. 50. 21, 22.
Theſe things haſt thou done, and I kept ſilence, thou thoughteſt
that I was altogether ſuch a man as thy ſelfe: But I will reprove
thee, and ſet them in order before thine eyes. Now conſider this, ye
that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

before me in this Houſe, that is called by my Name, and ſay,
We are delivered to commit all theſe abominations. Behold, even

               <hi>And now becauſe you have done all theſe works ſaith the Lord,
and I ſpake to you riſing up early and ſpeaking, but you heard
not, and I called you, but you anſwered not: therefore will I doe
to this Houſe as to </hi>Shiloh,<hi> and I will caſt you out of my ſight, as
I have done your Brethren. Therefore pray not thou for this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
neither lift thou up cry nor prayer for them, neither make

50, 51.<hi> But and if that evill ſervant ſhall ſay in his heart, My
Lord delayeth his coming, and ſhall begin to ſmite his fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and to eat and drink with the drunken: The Lord of that

            <p>2. For the Intereſts of Libertie, it is true, they are in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Free State; but ſo far from eſtabliſhing others in the
ſame condition, who have groaned under the ſad oppreſſion of
Tyrants; that it is known to <hi>Europe,</hi> how their great deſigne
hath been to be Free Men themſelves, and to make the world
(as far as they are able) their ſlaves and vaſſals. So far have
they been from the true Principles of Freedom, which is ready
to make others as free as it ſelf.</p>
            <p>We need not run far for Inſtances of this nature, nor mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
them: Our own late experience will be enough to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
this particular. The kindneſs, blood, and money afor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> in the days of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1575</note>
put them into the condition of Liberty from the
Sword of <hi>Spain:</hi> The power and interpoſition of <hi>England</hi>
in the days of King <hi>James,</hi> cauſed them to be declared a Free
State.<note place="margin">1609</note> The Valour and Arms of <hi>Engliſh men</hi> hath ſtood by
them, to ſeucure their Freedom. Yet when the Parliament of
<hi>England</hi> were enforced to contend in blood for Libertie and
Religion, againſt the Armies of our late Tyrant, and his ſon,
who ſought to deſtroy both, and had the influence of the ſame
deſignes, upon themſelves by the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> Yet none
contributed more aſſiſtance to that King and his ſon, then the
United Provinces: and none more ſcorned, abuſed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
the Parliament and their Friends, then the <hi>Neatherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:48029:17"/>
In ſo much that they appeared as one body, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the ſame deſigne as members thereof, and that the
ſame ſoul poſſeſſed them, appears in what they have lately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
upon this Nation, as hath been at large mentioned in
the former part of this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Much might be alſo ſaid concerning their endeavour to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolize
all Trade into their own hands; having by their
League with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> begun in the year 1649.
and ratified in the year 1651. which was managed by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lefeld,</hi>
Ambaſſador for that King, agreed with the ſaid King for the
paſſage of the Sound at 140000 <hi>Pattacoons,</hi> or <hi>Dolors
per annam</hi> for certain years to come, and that the ſaid King
ſhould not (during thoſe certain years) let it at the ſame rate
to any other Nation: whereby they have in effect excluded
all other Nations from the <hi>Baltick</hi> Trade; The <hi>Eaſtland</hi>
Trade. The Trade of <hi>Sweden, Lyfeland, Pruſſia, Poland,
Pomerania, Sileſia,</hi> &amp;c. in regard they have the paſſage of the
Sound at ſo low a rate, and that others muſt not only pay the
King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s old Toll: ſhew their Paſs to the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Commiſſary; but pay the ſame Toll over again, if they come
to <hi>Holland:</hi> alſo all other ſhips, that formerly uſed from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to Trade through the Sound, or return through the
Sound to <hi>Holland,</hi> or other places. And in effect have forced
the Merchandize of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea (viz) Maſts, Pitch, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
Iron, Copper, Braſs, Clapboard, Tar, and other Stable
Commodities, to their own Markets, where they put their
own prices upon them, and it is at their choice, whether they
will part with them or no.</p>
            <p>Alſo by their denying all Nations to ſail or trade to <hi>Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
Dunkirk, Newport, Oſtend, Blackenbergh;</hi> they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to themſelves all the Commerce of <hi>Flanders</hi> and thoſe
parts; during their war with <hi>Spain,</hi> and in the mean time
themſelves did furniſh thoſe of <hi>Brabant, Flanders, Conſen,
Dunkirk,</hi> and <hi>Graveling:</hi> And by their treacherous, cruel,
and inhumane dealing with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Amboyna</hi> in the
year 1622, and diſpoſſeſſing of them out of thoſe Iſlands;
have monopolized the Trade of Nutmegs, &amp;c. from all the
world, and wickedly have raviſhed, and detained it from the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48029:17"/>
Engliſh; but I ſhall forbear further diſcourſing hereof; it being
beſides my purpoſe largely to treat concerning theſe things;
onely this may be taken notice of; that where they have ſeen
any thing of advantage, if by cunning, force, or fraud, they
have been able; no conſideration of Right, Friendſhip,
Leagues, Humanity, or Religion, have held them from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
the accompliſhing of the ſame.</p>
            <p>For their carriage in point of Leagues, and Treaties, I ſhall
onely give ſome inſtances, of latter years, for proof of which
we ſhall not be enforced to hiſtory; but to the living Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the preſent times, in which I ſhall be neceſſitated to
be a little large. My firſt ſhall be of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1627 a Treaty of Confederacy or Alliance was
agreed on at <hi>Paris, Auguſt 28.</hi> between <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th.
King of <hi>France,</hi> and the States of the United Provinces, to
relieve each other, and to ſecure the Trade and Commerce
of each other; but this was not ratified, till the yeer 1630.
At this Treaty it was agreed on, likewiſe, 
</p>
            <p>
               <q>That if the King of
<hi>France</hi> did enter into a war with <hi>Spain</hi> the Dutch were to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
him; and the King of <hi>France</hi> was to do the like: as long
as the Dutch continued the war with the Spaniard; alſo both
parties coming to break; they were not afterwards to make
Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> directly or indirectly, but conjoyntly, and
with the conſent of both parties, and that under the word
Peace was comprehended alſo, a Truce or ſuſpenſion of Arms,
as by the third Article thereof doth at large appear.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
This was

<hi>de Beangy,</hi> Ambaſſador of the King of <hi>France:</hi> and the
Commiſſioners of the Lords States of the United Provinces;
and ratified to continue for the ſpace of ſeven years; being
occaſioned by ſeveral offers of the King of <hi>France;</hi> both
of men and money; in caſe the Dutch ſhould continue the
War with <hi>Spain;</hi> and not to make a Peace or Truce without

            <q>A million of

2 That in caſe he came to break with <hi>Spain,</hi> he would enter
the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> with a powerful Army, which the Dutch
ſhould reinforce with 10000. Foot, and 1500. Horſe; </q>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48029:18"/>
ſhould make on their ſide a powerful onſet, on the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on, with 30000. Foot and 4000. Horſe. 3. That if
good Conſiderations move the States to continue the war;
that he would give them a greater ſum of money then a milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as long as the war ſhould laſt.</p>
            <p>The Lords Commiſſioners of the States in anſwer, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould break with <hi>Spain,</hi> and
fall into the Country of <hi>Artois</hi> and <hi>Henault</hi> with 40000 men;
and that they would then fall upon him with all the power
they could make.</p>
            <p>That till ſuch time that as the King of <hi>France</hi> did fall into
open war into <hi>Artois,</hi> &amp;c. the Lords States ſhould be free to
make a Truce or Peace with <hi>Spain;</hi> but after they are joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entred into a war, neither ſhall make Peace or Truce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
they other.</p>
            <p>That if the Lords States ſhall not think fit to yeeld to a
Peace with <hi>Spain;</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhall give them two
millions French money to be paid at <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Venice.</hi>
               <note place="margin">200000. l. Sterling.</note> But
the States having a minde to continue war with <hi>Spain;</hi> ſtruck
up immediately into an Alliance, as aforeſaid. Notwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which, the States did endeavour to make a Peace or
Truce with <hi>Spain,</hi> and the States of <hi>Flanders,</hi> without the
advice or conſent of <hi>France;</hi> as appears by ſeveral paſſages, of
the underhand dealing of the Dutch with the Spaniards,
in a Complaint made by the French Ambaſſador to the
States:</p>
            <p>It is true, this Treaty with the Spaniard took no effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they could not get their ends of the Spaniard, and the
State of <hi>Flanders,</hi> though they had been contriving to make
a Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> two years together.</p>
            <p>When the ſaid Treaty was broken off, the States of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
Provinces began preſently to treat with Monſieur <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſe,</hi>
Ambaſſador for <hi>France,</hi> about a League Offenſive
and Defenſive; which though the Province of <hi>Holland</hi> liked
not, becauſe being rid of the Spaniard, they expected the
French as a more powerful Enemy; and therefore proteſted
againſt it; yet that prevailed not; but at the <hi>Hague, April
15. 1634.</hi> an Offenſive and Defenſive League was concluded
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48029:18"/>
on; wherein no Peace was to be made with <hi>Spain,</hi> entring
upon war conjoyntly. And that the preſent Treaty ſhall no
waies prejudice that which was made the 17th. of <hi>June 1630.</hi>
but to remain in full force and power in all things. And this
Treaty was made for the ſpace of ſeven years; to begin from
the day agreed on, as alſo the preceding Treaty of the year
1630. ſhall continue for the time that is therein agreed on;
and that this Treaty ſhal be renewed at the end of ſeven years,
if both parties were willing to it, as by the 6, 7, and 10th. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the ſaid Treaty doth appear: Signed and ſealed by
<hi>Charnaſſe,</hi> and the Lords Commiſſioners of the States.</p>
            <p>In the year 1635.<hi> February 8. </hi>A League Offenſive and
Defenſive was concluded and ratified by<hi> Lewis </hi>the 13th, and
the States General of the United Provinces; where the ninth
Article ſaith expreſly:<hi> That in caſe after the ſigning, ſealing,
and ratifying of this Treaty for a breach with </hi>Spain;<hi> either
Party ſhould come to make a Peace, Truce, or Suſpenſion of
Arms, that then this ſhall not be done, but by a conjoynt conſent
of the King of France, and the Lords States of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited
Provinces: likewiſe both Parties are obliged to break con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyntly,
and to enter into a War againſt the Spaniards, and
their Adherents; as often as they happen to break or to violate
any of the Conditions agreed on in the Treaty of Peace, or
Truce, which ſhall be made; without which neither Party can
afterwards make any new Treaty of Peace or Truce, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyntly,
or by common conſent, conditionally that if it come to
be violated, his Majeſty and the Lords Eſtates ſhall enter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyntly
into open war, againſt thoſe that are the brekers thereof;</hi>An in the 14. Article it is agreed on both ſides:<hi> That this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Treaty ſhall no waies derogate from any thing that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on in the former Treaties of the 15. </hi>April, 1634.<hi> ma<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be executed in all points.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Preſently after this Treaty both Armies joyned hard by
<hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and took <hi>Tienen,</hi> and beſieged <hi>Loven;</hi> and the
State loſt <hi>Schenchen Schans;</hi> to recover which both Armies
came and incamped; and it was retook afterwards by the
Dutch.</p>

Notwithſtanding all this, preſently after the ratifying of
this ſolemn Treaty; and that the war was already begun with
<hi>Spain,</hi> and the French had entred into it partly for their ſakes;
there were more Overtures made by the Spaniſh ſide concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a Peace with the Dutch; who preſently began to enquire
after them ſo far; as that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the States
General, ſent their Atturney General <hi>Muſch</hi> to <hi>Craneberg</hi>
to ſpeak with Don <hi>Martín Axpe,</hi> Secretary to the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> about it, and this without the conſent of the French, who
coming there found that this Secretary had no ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curation
from the King to Treat; beſides the Spaniards were
too ſtrange and exorbitant in their demands, that there was no
hope of gaining any thing; whereupon <hi>Muſch</hi> returns, and
makes report of it to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
whereupon this Treaty was broken, and the war carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on very fiercely, but the Dutch would never confeſs any of
this to the French Ambaſſador <hi>Charnaſſe,</hi> when he told them
of it, but denied it, ſaying, <hi>there was no ſuch thing;</hi> and this was
told the Lord <hi>Pauw,</hi> who preſently after went Ambaſſador into
<hi>France,</hi> by the King of <hi>France;</hi> who likewiſe denied it; there
the King told him plainly, <hi>That theſe ſecret proceedings did
contradict their ſolemn Treaty; and how much it did differ
from the juſtice his Majeſty had uſed towards them.</hi> The
Dutch, to excuſe themſelves, ſaid, <hi>That they had communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it to Charnaſſe;</hi> but it was after they had notice given
them, that their deſign would not take, and that the Spaniard
ſtood too much on Tipto.</p>
            <p>This League Offenſive and Defenſive concluded in the year
1635. was renewed in the year 1636. where in the tenth
Article it is expreſly ſet down that this preſent Treaty ſhall no
waies derogate from the former Treaties made beween the
King of <hi>France</hi> and the ſaid States, dated at the <hi>Hagne Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember
6. 1636.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1637, there was another Treaty, where the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,

but ſhall all remain in force and vigour, to be Religiouſly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and effected on both ſides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1639, where in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article it is expreſſed,<hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:48029:19"/>
that it ſhall no ways derogate from the things concluded on in the
former Treaties; but ſhall remain in their full force and vigour

April, 1639.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the <hi>Dutch</hi> Treat again with the <hi>Spaniard;</hi>
whereupon in the year 1640. <hi>Monſieur de la Thuillerie</hi> was
ſent Ambaſſador into <hi>Holland</hi> to let the States know, that they
could not conclude a Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> but conjoyntly; His
Commiſſion being to hinder a Peace or Truce without
<hi>France:</hi> to tell them, that they were not capable to make a
Peace or Truce without his conſent: that it would be quite
contrary to their Treaties, Honour, and Intereſt: and that if
he perceived any ſuch inclination in them, to proteſt againſt
them for breach of Leagues and Covenants.</p>
            <p>Whereupon in the year 1641, was made another Treaty:
the 6 Article of which ſaith,<hi> that it ſhall no ways derogate
from any thing that hath been formerly agreed on: all which ſhall
remain in their full force and vigour to de Religiouſly obſerved
on both ſides. </hi>Made at<hi> Paris, Feb.</hi> 14. 1641.</p>
            <p>In the year 1642. there was another Treaty made, where in
the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article you have the ſame as is mentioned before in the
ſixt Article, 1641. made at St <hi>Germains, Jan. 7. 1642.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1643 there was another Treaty, in the ſixt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of which is expreſly ſet down as in the forementioned
1642. made at <hi>Paris, March 3: 1643.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King hapning to die in <hi>May</hi> following, his ſon <hi>Lewis
14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> ſucceeding him, this Treaty was reconfirmed by him,
<hi>Auguſt 30. 1643.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this year 1643, the Lords States of <hi>Holland</hi> began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of ſending to <hi>Munſter,</hi> to treat of a Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the conſent of <hi>France:</hi> at which the other States were
offended; and <hi>Monſieur de la Thuillerie</hi> was no ways back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to perſwade them from making a Peace, but <hi>pari paſſu,</hi>
according to the Treaties.</p>
            <p>Therefore whilſt the Lords States were buſie in ſending
<hi>Plenipotentiaries</hi> to <hi>Munſter,</hi> there was a Treaty made in the
year 1644. called <hi>Ligue Guarantie.</hi> In the third Article of
which Treaty are expreſly the words of the ninth Article of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48029:20"/>
the Treaty made with <hi>Lewis</hi> thirteenth, and the ſixth Article
ſaith, <hi>that this Treaty ſhall no ways derogate from any thing that
hath been concluded on, in former Treaties, which are to be vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
and religiouſly obſerved by both parties.</hi> made at the <hi>Hague
March 1. 1644.</hi> and the 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. Articles ſpeak ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,
<hi>that no Peace ſhall be made directly or indirectly, without
the conſent of both,</hi> in very full and Emphaticall expreſſions,
which I forbear to mention, becauſe of brevity.</p>
            <p>In the year 1645. another Treaty was made for the <hi>carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of the War conjoyntly, and not to make any peace without
the conſent of each other: abrogating nothing that concern'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Treaties; but all thoſe things remaining in full force and
vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> underſtanding that the States of the
United Provinces were reſolved to make a Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi>
in the year 1646. offered the <hi>Dutch</hi> a greater ſumm of mony,
and more men then ever was agreed on formerly; in caſe the
<hi>Dutch</hi> would ſtick to their Treatie of <hi>Ligue guarantie</hi> in the
year 1644. and that neither party ſhould make peace without
the conſent of the other: conformable to theſe Articles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1. That the King ſhould aſſiſt during that year the States
General with 1200000 livers,<note place="margin">ſterling. 120000l.</note> for no other uſe then to maintain
an extraordinary ſupply of Souldiers, whereupon the States do
promiſe faithfully and Religiouſly to aſſault their Enemies with
all their force and power. 2. That the King of </hi>France<hi> ſhall
give aſſignations for the ſaid money, to be paid all of it before
the end of </hi>October<hi> following. 3. In conſideration whereof the
States do oblige themſelves, to raiſe a ſtrong Army, and to bring
them in the field; and to make ſome conſiderable enterprize:
the King of </hi>France<hi> alſo promiſeth the ſame in the Low Countreys,
to diſadvantage his enemies as much as lyes in his power. 5. This
Treaty ſhall no ways derogate from the former Treaties, which
ſhall be faithfully and religiouſly obſerved and effected. </hi>Signed
and Sealed at<hi> Paris, April </hi>6. 1646.</p>
            <p>In explanation of the third Article, the King of <hi>France</hi>
was to bring an Army into the field of 18 or 20000 foot, and
4 or 5000 horſe, by the fourth of <hi>May</hi> following. The States
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48029:20"/>
obliged to ſet to ſea 30 men of war of 2, 3, 4, and 500 tuns to
hinder the enemy from entring into <hi>Flanders</hi> by Sea, and to
inveſt ſuch Towns by ſea, as the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhall beſiege
by land, hindring relief to ſuch Towns, either from the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> or any other: alſo to keep their Armie in the field,
ſo long as the good of the common Cauſe ſhall require it, and
the ſeaſon of the year will permit. According hereunto both
armies drew into the field: but the <hi>Dutch</hi> held the <hi>French</hi> in
ſuſpence, appearing well in the field with their armie; but
when they were deſired to undertake ſome notable Enterprize,
they put the <hi>French</hi> off with delays, of which the <hi>French</hi> King
complains, but to little purpoſe; for not long after, the <hi>Dutch</hi>
begin to treat with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> without the conſent or adviſe
of the <hi>French,</hi> which was chiefly ſet on by <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then comes the Marquiſs <hi>de Caſtel Rodrigo</hi> from <hi>Bruſſels</hi>
to the States with a full power to treat, the ſame was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from <hi>Munſter:</hi> the Earl <hi>Penneranda</hi> ſends word of it by
his Secretary to the States Ambaſſadors at <hi>Munſter,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
Le Brun,</hi> the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Ambaſſador came perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the <hi>Hagte,</hi> and ſhewed the Originall Copie of the ſaid
power to the States, dated <hi>June 7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſtir'd up many to conclude the Peace ſuddenly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador made ſeveral complaints hereof to
the States, alſo that the Catholick Religion was not permitted
at <hi>Hulſt,</hi> according to the Treaty in the year 1635. deſired
their reſolution in writing for the tolleration of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Religion in thoſe Towns that ſhould be taken that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Monſieur le Thuillerie</hi> went to <hi>Breda</hi> to conſult about
marching of the armies, which was carried on but coldly,
though there ſeemed great advantage to offer it ſelf, and all
likelyhood to carry <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which <hi>France</hi> urged very much.
The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> replyed, That they had not men enough;
ſecondly, he knew not, in caſe the Town ſhould be taken, how
to ſatisfie <hi>France</hi> in point of Religion; <hi>France</hi> willing to give
them any content, thereby to take them off from making Peace
with <hi>Spain,</hi> freely offered them a ſupernumerarie of 3000
horſe, provided that upon reducement of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48029:21"/>
Religion might there be tolerated. Signed <hi>D' E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrades</hi>
at <hi>Breda, June 22.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lords Commiſſioners accepted with all humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
the tender of 3000 Horſe, but withal deſired
the loan of 3000 Foot, <hi>June 29</hi> following. The Duke of
<hi>Orleans</hi> by Captain <hi>Remond</hi> ſent this anſwer, wherein he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their deſire both of 3000 Horſe and 3000 Foot, provided
that the Catholick Religion be allowed as aforeſaid. Made
at <hi>Breda, July 4. 1646.</hi> Signed <hi>Remond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon the Lords Commiſſioners promiſed to the King
of <hi>France</hi> and Queen Regent, that the Town of <hi>Antwerp</hi>
falling into their hands, they would leave there the exerciſe of
the Catholick Religion free and publick. Made at <hi>Breda,</hi> the
11 <hi>July,</hi> 1646. and ſigned by the Commiſſioners, and in expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the ſaid agreement, the Churches left for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſhall be four.</p>
            <p>But that it may appear, not onely how the <hi>Dutch</hi> did one
while Treat with the <hi>French,</hi> and make a ſhew of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and that they would not break their Leagues with the
<hi>French,</hi> yet did deal under-hand with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for the
concluſion of a Peace, as I have ſhewed already. I ſhall
now ſhew you how unhandſomely they ſerved the <hi>French,</hi>
after the grant of theſe ſupplies, and how they might have
taken <hi>Antwerp,</hi> if they had pleaſed. Upon the ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the former things, the Army of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
advanceth towards <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and he was with his Army the
26 of <hi>July</hi> at <hi>Stechen;</hi> then at <hi>Loqueren,</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
Supplies came according to Promiſe. <hi>Teemche</hi>
Caſtle lying by the <hi>Schelde,</hi> beyond <hi>Antwerp,</hi> was
taken in; the people of <hi>Antwerp</hi> did as good as offer up
the Town to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> The <hi>French</hi> in the mean
time had taken <hi>Dunkerk, Antwerp</hi> would have followed with
eaſe; But the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> left <hi>Teemche</hi> Caſtle aſſoon as
he had taken it, though that was the time to have taken <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi>
and never beſieged or aſſaulted the ſaid Town; but
the deſign thereof ſoon vaniſht, and the 6000 Auxiliaries not
made uſe of, to the great diſcontent and dammage of the
<hi>French;</hi> who by ſparing ſuch a number, were diſinabled to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48029:21"/>
undertake any conſiderable thing that Summer, and to the
ruine of the poor Proteſtants there, as I ſaid before;
and the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> went on,
without the notice or conſent of the <hi>French.</hi> And the <hi>French</hi>
Ambaſſador told the States, that ſome of the State-Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries
at <hi>Munſter,</hi> had been with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries,
and aſſured them, that although the Army of the
States General ſhould march into the field, yet they ſhould on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lie ſtill, and effect nothing to the prejudice of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
Alſo the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors ſhewed the States ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which they had received from <hi>France,</hi> making mention
of ſome Letters intercepted of <hi>Pennerandas,</hi> wherein <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee
writes, <hi>That the Peace was agreed on, without having any
regard to the</hi> French <hi>Intereſt, which was not ſo much as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the</hi> Dutch; <hi>and though the other Provinces ſhould hee
againſt it, yet becauſe</hi> Holland <hi>was for it, they would ſoon
bring the other Provinces to a compliance, as it did appear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed, the War being carried on againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>
conjointly from the year 1635. to the year 1647. It
brought the King of <hi>Spain</hi> very low: Who thereupon ſent
his Ambaſſadors; The Lords <hi>Conde, De Penneranda,</hi> and <hi>A
Brun,</hi> to ſollicit the <hi>Dutch</hi> to a Treaty of peace; who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the forementioned Leagues and Treaties to
be faithfully and religiouſly kept, that no Peace or Truce
ſhould be made with <hi>Spain</hi> without the conſent of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
having entred into a <hi>Ligue Guarrantie</hi> ſeveral times for
that purpoſe; the <hi>French</hi> being thereby deeply engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and having begun theſe Allyances and
War upon the deſire of the <hi>Dutch;</hi> yet they entred upon
a Treaty of Peace without the conſent of the <hi>French;</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the ſeveral ſpeeches of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors;
the Letters of the King, and at laſt the Ambaſſadors Proteſt;
the 30 <hi>Januar,</hi> 1648. A Peace was ſigned, ſealed, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

               </hi> between <hi>Philip 4.</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the States

            <p>I ſhall only give you a touch of the proceeds of the <hi>French</hi>

            <p>The States General having taken their final reſolution for
a Treaty of peace with<hi> Spain, Monſieur de Thuillerie </hi>the<hi>French </hi>Ambaſſador Extraordinary, the<hi> 15 November 1647.</hi>preſented a paper to the ſaid States, wherein hee told them,</p>

upon, but by joint conſent of both parties: that for the

to the Aſſembly, to let them underſtand how highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
the King his Maſter was, with their proceedings in
making a peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> without his conſent, (quoting
their Leagues) and that if they proceeded on in that Treaty,
as they had begun, his Maſter would be inforced to let the
world know how unhandſomely the Lords States have dealt

had dealt with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to his prejudice, contrary to the
Treaty 1635. renewed 1644. where they were to proceed <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri
paſſu,</hi> both in war and peace. That if the <hi>Dutch</hi> had a
mind to conclude a peace, that they would communicate to

proceeded in their Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> (which they had not

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48029:24"/>
one of the Articles,</p>
            <q>
               <p>That they ſhall communicate their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
conjointly, if they enter into a Treaty of peace at
any time with <hi>Spain;</hi> which muſt be alſo with the conſent
of <hi>France:</hi> Therefore he humbly deſired them to write to
their Plenipotentiaries to communicate their proceedings in
writing to the French Plenipotentiaries, as their loving friends
and allies: and alſo that his Maſter did deſire them to deſiſt
from Treating according to former agreement aforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
till both parties agree to carry on the Treaty again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointly,
which the Lords Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> had done
being ſent to by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to Treat, which they refuſed
to doe, becauſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> had minded them of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
therefore his Maſter deſired them to do the like by
him.</p>
               <p>All this (ſaid he) was laid open to the Plenipotentiaries of
this State at <hi>Munſter,</hi> by the French Plenipotentiaries, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the ſaid Plenipotentiares came confidently the
next day to the Plenipotentiaries of my Maſter, and told
them that they would proceed very ſpeedily to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of their Treaty with the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> whereupon the
French Plenipotentiaries could do no leſs then proteſt againſt
their proceedings, who have formally declared at <hi>Munſter,</hi>
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have broken the Treaties made between them
and <hi>France.</hi> And that they have proteſted againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of ſuch an Act, ſo contrary to all Publick Faith, and
all manner of Reaſon and Decency: And what ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
ſhould follow that buſineſs, are to be imputed to the
Contrivers and Abettors of that unworthy action, of conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a peace without the conſent of both parties according to
the Articles of agreement; and this the Plenipotentiaries of
<hi>France</hi> have been fain to do, to prevent a Rupture in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
between <hi>France</hi> and the States of the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and to clear their Conſciences and Duties towards his
Majeſties of <hi>France,</hi> who could never perſwade themſelves
(if the preſent Oppoſition and Proteſtation had not been
made,) that in a buſineſs, in which there is only treated to
keep to an Enemy ſome ſecret promiſes, or to accompliſh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Treaties ſo ſolemnly made with an ancient friend, the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48029:24"/>
                  <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould have had more power over the Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries
of the ſaid Lords States of the United Provinces to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
them to a breach, then thoſe of <hi>France</hi> have had to
perſwade them to obſerve the agreements and treaties made
between <hi>France</hi> and the Low Countries.</p>
            </q>
            <p>But this Propoſition having taken no effect, the next day
Monſieur <hi>de la Thuillerie,</hi> put in another Paper into the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,</p>
            <q>That they would be pleaſed to ſend thus much to
their Plenipotentiaries, that they ſhould not ſign their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> till <hi>France</hi> had likewiſe made an end
of their Treaty of peace with <hi>Spain.</hi> This the aſſembly
would not do, becauſe it was to the prejudice of their affairs.</q>
            <p>Thus all along till the treaty at <hi>Munſter</hi> was concluded and
ratified, the French Ambaſſadors at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and the
French Plenipotentiaries at <hi>Munſter,</hi> never gave over pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
to the States, what wrongs the States of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces had done, and the Crown of <hi>France</hi> had ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by their breach of Contracts, ſolemn Leagues and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
but none of them prevailed, though <hi>France</hi> at their
deſire had begun and proſecuted the Warre againſt <hi>Spain,</hi>
whereby <hi>Spain</hi> was brought low; which contrary to their
many ſolemn Contracts, to Ingenuity and Gratitude, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up by the States, and made uſe of to ſerve their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
leaving <hi>France</hi> alone to contend with <hi>Spain</hi> to this
day; refuſing to lend the King of <hi>France</hi> ſupplies of money,
whereof he had occaſion, according to the treaty of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peigne,
1624.</hi> when the French King ſupplyed them; and
having tyed up their hands from aſſiſting the French againſt
the Spaniard by their League <hi>de non offendendo.</hi> The Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentaries
of the States of the United Provinces that tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this affair, were <hi>Bartolt, Van Gent. John</hi> of <hi>Mateneſſe.
Adrian Pauw. I. Knuyt. G. Van Reed. J. V. Donia. Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Ripperda. Adr. Claut.</hi> Notwithſtanding theſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with the Spaniard, the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Ambaſſador <hi>Le
Brun,</hi> complains that the States have broken 17 Articles of
the late treaty at <hi>Munſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been the larger in this, becauſe it is ſo full neceſſary,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48029:25"/>
and pregnant an Inſtance, whereby at once the States inſide
is turned outſide exactly; and a rare Preſident and Caution
given to this Nation and all Princes, to diſcern theſe ſerpents
under all their green and ſmooth expreſſions of friendſhip;
and their moſt ſolemn ſtipulations for that purpoſe; of which
in my judgment I could omit nothing: I ſhall therefore be
more brief in the following Inſtances, and forbear the quoting
as many as I intended, leaſt by too much prolixity I might
offend.</p>
            <p>The next that I ſhall produce, is <hi>Portugal,</hi> who whilſt under
the Command of the Spaniard, were underſtood and Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
as Enemies by the Dutch, becauſe one with <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the year 1640. the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> making
themſelves free and diſtinct from <hi>Spain,</hi> all good Patriots
in the united Provinces did look upon it, as a buſineſs of great
good and welfare, and an order was made for a ceſſation of
Arms at Sea againſt the <hi>Portugal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thoſe of the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indie</hi> Companies (true Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criones)
ſhewed their regret at this publick joy, foreſeeing
by this that their Piracies exerciſed againſt the <hi>Portugals</hi>
there muſt come to an end; and the conqueſts alſo, that they
had promiſed themſelves over the <hi>Portugal</hi> in the Eaſt-<hi>Indie</hi>
and <hi>Brazil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This beginning of friendſhip in the ceſſation of Arms plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the <hi>Portugal</hi> extremely, who ſent an Ambaſſador to the
<hi>Hague;</hi> where there was a truce concluded on between the
<hi>Portugal</hi> and the United Provinces for twelve years:</p>
            <p>But the craftineſs and cunning of the Dutch, is worthy
obſervation; for becauſe the Eaſt <hi>Indie</hi> and <hi>Brazil</hi> were ſo
far off, the Hollanders cauſed this clauſe to be inſerted; <hi>That
the Truce ſhould not begin in the Eaſt</hi> Indies, <hi>till within a year,
and in</hi> Brazil <hi>till within half a year after the ratification
thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the Hollander, before, and in the time,
gave order and expreſs advice to their men at <hi>Brazil</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
to do their beſt to take all they could get from the
Portugals, as indeed they did, for they took <hi>Angola,</hi> St <hi>Tomce,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:48029:25"/>
and <hi>Marinſan;</hi> and in the Eaſt <hi>Indies</hi> they took <hi>Mallacca:</hi>
alſo in <hi>Brazil</hi> they took and confiſcated divers Portugal
ſhips, coming to honeſt and Cordial friends, as the Dutch.</p>
            <p>The Truce being made; and both Parties as well the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,
as the Hollanders, having ful notice of it; the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals
at <hi>Angola</hi> relying upon the Truce, admitted the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
as friends with a great deal of joy and alacrity into the
Caſtle, but the Dutch being no ſooner entred, they took and
turned out the Portugals, and having boarded them in an ugly
rotten Bark unprovided of proviſions, ſent them to traverſe
the ſea in a thouſand dangers; with the ſame deceit they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the Iſlands of <hi>Marinſan</hi> and St. <hi>Tomce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ambaſſadors were ſent from<hi> Portugal </hi>to demand theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the Hollanders produced the ſaid clauſe of the Truce;
which was all the Portugal could get from the Hollander; for
ſaid they,<hi> There is no wrong done, in regard, that in that
clauſe is ſaid, That each ſide ſhall hold and keep, what he can
take and in ſuch a time: </hi>Whereupon the Portugal Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
ſaid to them very well;<hi> That that muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood</hi>Bona fide (viz)<hi> That which ſhould be taken without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any knowledge of the Truce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thoſe of the Weſt <hi>Indie</hi> Company, and thoſe that were
in their ſervice, had full knowledge of the Peace or Truce,
and nevertheleſs had treacherouſly faln upon the Portugals,
and taken from them thoſe places; who no waies ſuſpected
any ſuch cheat, but admitted the Dutch as friends. The
Dutch having made the buſineſs leſs ſuſpected, in regard they
expreſſed great love to the Portugal, and ordered a ceſſation of
Arms, before the Portugal had deſired them; but for what
end the world may judg: which action was the more cruel and
treacherous, in regard that the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> had but
then torn himſelf from the Spaniard into his own rights, and
in this Infancy of his Government was thus dealt withal.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, the Government of the Dutch in <hi>Brazil</hi>
hath been ſo ungodly, unjuſt, and full of tyranny (the moſt
part that were ſent over thither, being broken Merchants, loſt
and undone men, Roagues and Whores) who muſt make their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48029:26"/>
fortunes by the Portugal; made the Portugal diſpair of ever
being well ruled by ſuch a Rabble, and cauſed them to revolt
againſt the Hollander, having moſt juſt cauſe ſo to do.</p>
            <p>And it is not to be omitted, how juſtly God hath puniſhed
the Weſt <hi>Indie</hi> Company in <hi>Holland,</hi> who are brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and what ſupplies ſoever (to their infinite great charges)
have been ſent thither, they have either miſcarried, been beaten,
or loſt one way or other. And the places aforeſaid taken from
the Portugal by treachery, are in the Portugals hands again;
ſo that God ſeems to have blown upon that Company and
Deſign.</p>
            <p>The Portugal Ambaſſador could never obtain any ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or ſo much as reaſon from the Hollanders for what they
had done.</p>
            <p>My third Inſtance ſhall be <hi>Sweden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to the Treaty between the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
and the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, as Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> and
<hi>Zealand,</hi> made at <hi>Splers 1554.</hi> and according to the ancient
cuſtome; the Dutch were to paſs the <hi>Sound,</hi> onely paying a
Roſenoble; the ſhips, being then never known to be viſited or
ſearched; and this was paid becauſe of the Lights, Tuns, and
marks at ſea, preſerved by the King of <hi>Denmark:</hi> which Treaty
after the ſeparation of the United Provinces from <hi>Spain,</hi> the
King of <hi>Denmark</hi> obſerved not; making what rules and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
he pleaſed, &amp; breaking them when he would; ſearching
the ſhips alſo, through which many came to be confiſcated: for
having contraband goods, or any commodities that they gave
not account of to his Officers in the <hi>Sound:</hi> and as the Dutch
were ſtrong or weak in their Convoyes, the Cuſtomes or Toll
was increaſed, or diminiſhed, and ſometimes they paſt free,
the Swede alwaies.</p>
            <p>The Dutch being no longer able to controle the King of
<hi>Denmark</hi> (being the onely King at Peace then in <hi>Europe)</hi>
they ſend three Ambaſſadors to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who at
the onely requeſt of the States General,<note place="margin">1640.</note> made a League of
Allyance with the ſaid States in the ſame year, and confirmed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48029:26"/>
it again in the year 1645. being by them called a League <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantie,</hi>
purpoſely to keep the <hi>Dane</hi> in awe, being beſides the
League of Commerce.</p>
            <p>The Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> in the year 1643, and 1644. entred
<hi>Denmark,</hi> and made war againſt it: The <hi>Dutch</hi> according to
their League (which was to aſſiſt one another, in caſe the <hi>Dane</hi>
ſhould aſſault either of them, with 4000 men, or ſhips to
the proportion of the charge of ſo many men) ſent relief to
the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> or rather 50 ſhips into the Sound: and
at the ſame time an Ambaſſy, (viz) <hi>Schaep, Zoneck; Andree;</hi>
to let the <hi>Dane</hi> know, <hi>ſi tu non vis, hic faciet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dane</hi> not knowing how to turn himſelf, in dealing with
them both, entred into a Treaty, as well with <hi>Sweden</hi> as the
States of the United Provinces.</p>
            <p>The Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> had full ſatisfaction given her: but
the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> by reaſon of the practiſe of the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> who was allyed to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> by his
marriage of the King of <hi>Englands</hi> daughter, could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their full liberty for their paſſage of their ſhips through
the Sound: nor have the Treaty of <hi>Spiers</hi> made good to
them, though the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> adviſed them to ſtand to
the Treaty of <hi>Spiers,</hi> and ſhe would maintain them in it: yet
they obtained a reaſonable rate, and that their ſhips ſhould
not be viſited, ſhewing their Paſſes from the Admiralty, and
by word of mouth, telling what they had in their ſhips: with
which the <hi>Dane</hi> was forced to be content, and never could
afterward, cauſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhips to be viſited: whereby the
<hi>Hollander</hi> had a great advantage, and paid no more then he
had a minde unto.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> being by this means brought ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
low, and the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> high, having made peace
with him and the Emperor, <hi>

and ſlighting the <hi>Hollander,</hi> he ſhould court and cajole them,
by giving them hopes of gain and profit: whereupon the King

them much, repreſented how formidable <hi>Sweden</hi> was, and

(though there was little likelyhood of this in regard the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>

<hi>Ex quibuſcunque cauſis bello involvatur.</hi> Of which the
<hi>Swediſh</hi> Miniſters have made ſeveral complaints to the States
Generall.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add no more but what our own experience of their
carriage to <hi>England</hi> doth afford us; and that onely in a few
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48029:27"/>
words, leaving the full diſquiſition thereof, and of their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
&amp; horrible cruelties in the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> (chiefly under <hi>Coene)</hi>
as extortions, impriſonment, killing, &amp;c. upon the innocent
inhabitants, beſides the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to ſome other Pen, it being ſo
well known to us whom this concerns and I having been neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
ſo large already in other particulars.</p>
            <p>What <hi>England</hi> hath been to them, and how they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited
it, is afore diſcourſed: Many complaints were made
againſt them in point of Trade in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> and other
parts, which occaſioned ſeverall <hi>Treaties</hi> between them and
us, and in the year 1619 all things were concluded. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which in the year 1622. was committed that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and wicked murther on our <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and the
diſpoſſeſſing us of thoſe Iſlands of Spices to this day; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making any ſatisfaction for the blood then ſhed, the ſpoils
then committed, the breach of the <hi>Treaty</hi> then made, and the
Merchandize then and ſince taken from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> though it
amounts to great ſums, and ſhould have been perfected in the
year 1625, or before it, to ſay nothing of any other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
Certainly the Judgement of God, and the Juſtice of
Man will have a time to purge ſuch blood from the Earth,
which it hath defiled, and render unto them according to their
deſerts.</p>
            <p>But paramount to all, was <hi>Van Trumps</hi> late aſſault, when we
were in Amity, upon their own offers, treating for a more ſtrict
Union; as is elſewhere mentioned at large in the <hi>Parliaments
Declaration:</hi> from the miſchiefs and ſadeffects of which, God
alone by his great mercy and providence, hath delivered us.</p>
            <p>And to all this let it onely be added, That they are already
in a League Defenſive and Offenſive with <hi>France;</hi> a League
<hi>de non offendendo</hi> with <hi>Spain;</hi> a League Defenſive with <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
againſt <hi>Denmark,</hi> and Defenſive with <hi>Denmark</hi> againſt
<hi>Sweden,</hi> and all other Nations.</p>
            <p>To ſum up all; If ſo be by the inſtances mentioned, and
what elſe may be brought of the ſame nature; thoſe of the
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> have made it to appear (as it ſeems to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
clear) that they have been ſo far from aſſerting, (though
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48029:28"/>
they pretend nothing more) the true reformed <hi>Proteſtant
Religion,</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> that they have not onely deſerted
ſtrangers, that have profeſſed and contended for the ſaid Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
but their own Fleſh and Blood, contrary to their holy
and perpetuall League and Union, called the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi>
in the year 1579. as in the caſe of <hi>Antwerp, Gant, Bruges;</hi>
but have aſſiſted the Popiſh Princes in the warres againſt their
Proteſtant Subjects, as in the caſe of <hi>Rochell;</hi> and tyrannicall
Princes in their warres againſt their Proteſtant Parliament and
People, contrary to the fundamentall Lawes of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
as in the caſe of <hi>England;</hi> and furniſht bloody Rebels
with Arms, and Ammunition, and all other proviſions, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the moſt helliſh maſſacres upon the Proteſtants, as in the
caſe of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſo be that their ſole buſineſſe is to be free themſelvs, and to
have all the world their ſlaves, as they are able, as is manifeſt
by the whole proceed of their affairs; and to ſhut up the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of the world from any but themſelves, as in the caſe of
the <hi>Sound, Eaſt Indies, Amboyna, Antwerp, Flanders, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſo be the ſtrongeſt and moſt ſacred Stipulatious, and
Leagues ſolemnly ſworn before God, and oftentimes renewed
upon the ſame ſacredneſſe, made upon their own deſires, and
neceſſity, and grounded upon old and new curteſies and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and upon their own intereſts; others have quitted Peace
for their ſakes onely, and weltred in blood to effect their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
have been broken as two before the fire, and of no vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
as in the caſe of <hi>France, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> and where
they have made ſhew of tenderneſſe and affection, to help up a
Kingdom riſing from the ground, and yet deſign it onely as
a cover, to poſſeſſe their ſtrength and riches, as in the caſe of
<hi>Portugall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſo be they can eaſily ſwallow down Leagues contrary
one to another, as Earth is to Heaven, as in the caſe of <hi>Sweden,
Denmark, France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſo be that when they ſeem moſtly to deſire Peace and
ſtrict union, they intend it as a diſguiſe to cover their deſigns
of treachery, and ſurprize, as in the caſe of <hi>Trumps</hi> late aſſault.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:48029:28"/>
If ſo be the Baſis of their actions Divine and Humane, and
the whole of what ever they do attempt, be advantage and
profit; and that <hi>Religion, Liberty, Principles, Leagues, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Friendſhips, Aſſiſtance,</hi> muſt ſerv as oft as they judg it fit,
and think themſelves able to accompliſh it, though never ſo
contrary to the being of Humanity, and all the Rules of
Honeſty and Faithfulneſſe in the world, as in the inſtances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, if ſo be we of this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> do believe
