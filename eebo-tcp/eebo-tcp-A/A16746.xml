            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE SCHOOLE of Fancie.</head>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>E thinkes I sée you smile, before you gin to réede,</l>
                  <l>At this same title of my tale: but, for you shall not néede</l>
                  <l>To maruaile at the same. First read it to the ende,</l>
                  <l>And marke yee stil through all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tale, wherto eche point doth tende,</l>
                  <l>And you shall sée I hope, that this same title serues</l>
                  <l>Fit for the tale, els sure my minde from reason greatly swerues.</l>
                  <l>Who is expert in any Art doth beare a Maisters name:</l>
                  <l>Then hée who chéefe is in an Art, doth well deserue the same.</l>
                  <l>Of Art of luckles <hi>loue,</hi> first <hi>Fancy</hi> is the ground,</l>
                  <l>Although that <hi>Cupid,</hi> with his dart, doo giue the deadly wounde.</l>
                  <l>First, <hi>Fancy</hi> liking bréeds, and liking bréedeth loue,</l>
                  <l>And loue then bréeds, such passing panges, as many louers prooue:</l>
                  <l>And when the troubled minde, with torments is opprest,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Fancy</hi> doth finde some secret meane, to bréede the hart some rest:</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Fancy</hi> shée sometime to breed the louers ioy,</l>
                  <l>A thousand sundry waies (at least) doth still her paines imploy:</l>
                  <l>She thinkes on this and that, shée teacheth how to loue,</l>
                  <l>And tels the Louer, what to doo, as best for his behooue.</l>
                  <l>But least I go to far and run to mutch at large</l>
                  <l>Out of the way and take no care what thing I haue in charge,</l>
                  <l>I will begin to show, what kinde of <hi>Schoole</hi> this is,</l>
                  <l>What orders too shée kéepes therin. First lo, the <hi>Schoole</hi> is this.</l>
                  <l>The roome both large and long, and very darke of sight,</l>
                  <l>The most sight that her Schollers haue, is chiefly by fier light:</l>
                  <l>Which fier doth burne so bright, as giues them light to see</l>
                  <l>To read such books, as there are taught: but what this fier may bée</l>
                  <l>Now therby lies a case. Well marke what I doo wright,</l>
                  <l>And you shall know, for I my selfe, haue séene it burning bright.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:5031:6"/>First <hi>Fancie</hi> fetcheth coales, and calles for <hi>Deepe desire</hi>:</l>
                  <l>By him shée setteth <hi>Vaine delight</hi> and biddes them blowe the fire:</l>
                  <l>And when the fire once burnes, for to maintaine thesame,</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Colier Care,</hi> hee brings in coales vnto this dainty dame.</l>
                  <l>Hee makes his Coales of wood, that growes on <hi>Hare braine hill,</hi>

                  <l>The wood is of small groth, but stickes of <hi>Stubborne youth,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Which serues as fittest for that fier, god wot, the greater ruth:</l>
                  <l>Lo thus, this fire doth burne, and still doth giue the light</l>
                  <l>To Fancies schollers in her schoole, they haue none other sight.</l>
                  <l>Now Sir, in this hot schoole, first <hi>Fancie</hi> highest sittes,</l>
                  <l>And out of all her schollers still, shée takes the wildest wittes.</l>
                  <l>And those shee takes in hand, to teach <hi>the Art of loue,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>which being taught in that vayn Art, do soone fine schollers proue.</l>
                  <l>Shée teatheth them to mourne, to flatter and to faine,</l>
                  <l>To speake, to write, and to indight, to labor and take paine:</l>
                  <l>To go, to run and ride, to muse, and to deuise,</l>
                  <l>To iuggle with a déerest freend, to bleare the parents eyes.</l>
                  <l>To spend both landes and goods, to venter Lim and life,</l>
                  <l>To make foes frends, and twixt dere frends, to set debate &amp; strife:</l>
                  <l>To doo and vndoo too, so that they may obtaine</l>
                  <l>Their mistresse loue: and neuer care, for taking any paine.</l>
                  <l>To iet in braue attire, to please their mistris eye:</l>
                  <l>Although perhaps they vtterly, vndoe themselues therby.</l>
                  <l>To learne to sing and daunce, to play on Instruments,</l>
                  <l>To speake choyce of straunge languages, to try experiments</l>
                  <l>Straunge, seldome had in vse: in fine, to tell you plaine,</l>
                  <l>To doo almost they care not what, there ladies loue to gaine.</l>
                  <l>And thus in tracte of time, by sutch instructions,</l>
                  <l>Shee makes them tread, the perfect path to their distructions:</l>
                  <l>Some other schollers now, are taught within her schoole</l>
                  <l>By <hi>Vsshers</hi> that teach vnder her, of which one is a foole</l>
                  <l>By nature and by name, for <hi>Follie</hi> men him call:</l>
                  <l>And hee will teach his scholler soone, to proue a naturall.</l>
                  <l>The second <hi>Frenzie</hi> is, in teaching too as bad,</l>
                  <l>For hee will teach, his schollers most the way to make them mad:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:5031:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>The <hi>Vssher follie</hi> first, hee teacheth to be bould,</l>
                  <l>Without aduice to giue no eare, to counsaile that is tould</l>
                  <l>To take delight in gauds, and foolish trifling toies,</l>
                  <l>In things of value, litle worth, to set his chiefest ioyes.</l>
                  <l>To prate without regard, of reason in his talke,</l>
                  <l>To think blacke white, &amp; wrong for right, &amp; know not chéese from chalke</l>
                  <l>To loue the things in deede, which most hee ought to hate:</l>
                  <l>For triflyng toyes, with deerest freends, to fall at dire debate.</l>
                  <l>To loue to play at dice, to sweare his blood and hart,</l>
                  <l>To face it with a ruffins looke and set his hat a thwart.</l>
                  <l>To haunt the Tauerns late, by night to trace the streetes,</l>
                  <l>And swap ech slut, vpon the lippes, that in the darke hee meetes:</l>
                  <l>To laughe at a horse nest, and whine too like a boy,</l>
                  <l>If any thing do crosse his minde, though it be but a toy:</l>
                  <l>To slauer like a slaue, to lye too like a dog,</l>
                  <l>To wallow almost like a Beare, and snortle like a Hog.</l>
                  <l>To féede too like a Horse, to drinke too like an Oxe,</l>
                  <l>To shew himselfe in eche respecte a very very coxe.</l>
                  <l>But sutch a scholler now, is chosen of grose wit,</l>
                  <l>Because that <hi>Beetle heddes</hi> do serue for such instructions fit.</l>
                  <l>The other Usher now, that <hi>Frenzie</hi> hath to name,</l>
                  <l>His kinde of teaching, hée againe another way doth frame:</l>
                  <l>Hée teacheth how to rage, to sweare and ban and curse,</l>
                  <l>To fret, to fume, to chide, to chafe, to doo all this and worse.</l>
                  <l>To teare his flesh for griefe, to fill the aire with cries,</l>
                  <l>To harbor hatred in his hart, and mischefe to deuise:</l>
                  <l>To hate all good aduice, to follow witles will,</l>
                  <l>And in the ende for want of grace, to seeke himselfe to kill.</l>
                  <l>And sutch his schollers are, ripe wits, but wanting grace,</l>
                  <l>And sutch vngracious graffes, doo learne, sutch gracelesse geare a pace:</l>
                  <l>These schollers all are young, except that now and than,</l>

                  <l>Who when that hée a while, hath bin in Fancies schoole,</l>

                  <l>And sutch there are sometime, (more pittie) for to see,</l>
                  <l>That in their crooked doting age, would faine fine louers bee.</l>
                  <l>

                  <l>My selfe can tell too well, for I haue séene the schoole,</l>
                  <l>And learned so long there till I prou'd more halfe a very foole.</l>
                  <l>First <hi>Fancy</hi> dandled mée, and held mée in her lap:</l>
                  <l>And now and then, shée would mée féede, with worldly pleasures pap.</l>
                  <l>Shée tould mee I was young, and I my youth must spend</l>
                  <l>In youthful sporte, I did not know, how soone my life would end:</l>
                  <l>Be merry while I mought, set carke and care aside,</l>
                  <l>How mad were hée that mought in blisse, and would in bale abide?</l>
                  <l>Such sugred speach of hers had soone intrapt mee so,</l>
                  <l>That I did thinke, that did mée good, that wrought (in déed) my wo:</l>
                  <l>Remayning thus a while, at last I had an eye,</l>
                  <l>To see how <hi>Folly</hi> taught his Youthes, and some rules by and by</l>
                  <l>My selfe began to learne: First this, for to be bould,</l>
                  <l>And to refuse to lend my eare, where good aduise was tould.</l>
                  <l>In foolish trifling toyes to take a great delight:</l>
                  <l>To take in hand to prate of that, wherin I had no sight.</l>
                  <l>These rules I soone had learnd, but when I came to that,</l>
                  <l>Where Ruffins card &amp; dice, and sweare, and ware aside their hat</l>
                  <l>I read no farther then, but vp againe I went,</l>
                  <l>Unto my mistris <hi>Fancie</hi> fine: and straight downe shee mee sent</l>
                  <l>Unto the nether ende of all her schoole below,</l>
                  <l>Where <hi>Frenzy</hi> sat: and sweting hard, hee gan to puffe and blow.</l>
                  <l>He litle likte my minde, yet would I ye or no,</l>
                  <l>I learnd some of his raging rules, er I away did go:</l>
                  <l>I learnd to fret and fume, though not to ban and curse,</l>
                  <l>And oft for griefe to sigh and sob and many times doo worse,</l>
                  <l>But yet I thanke my god I neuer had the will:</l>
                  <l>In greatest franticke fit I felt, to seeke my selfe to kill.</l>
                  <l>But to make short my tale, his lessons likte me not,</l>
                  <l>But vp agayn in haste I went, to <hi>Fancie</hi> fond, god wot.</l>
                  <l>And lying in her lap, I fell a slepe anon,</l>
                  <l>Where slepinge so I dreamed sore that I was wo begon:</l>

                     <pb facs="tcp:5031:18"/>Why, <hi>Fancie</hi> is the thinge, that moueth men to loue,</l>

                  <l>MY friend, who so thou bee, that faine wouldst buy this booke,</l>
                  <l>so passe away the time thereon, in ydle times to looke:</l>
                  <l>If so thou fyndste that like thee not, yet pardon graunt to mee,</l>
                  <l>And wish me from thy harte no worse, then I wish vnto thee.</l>
                  <l>Against my will it shall be much, if many I offende,</l>
                  <l>With these rude rymes which I haue made, vnto none other ende</l>
                  <l>But as I sayde before, for want of other glee,</l>
                  <l>For pleasaunt heads to looke vpon, when they at leysure bee.</l>
                  <l>But some there are I must confesse, gainst whom in great despight,</l>
                  <l>Some running rymes which here you see, I chaunced to indight.</l>
                  <l>But such I count my deadly foes: and such one if thou bee</l>

                  <l>That there you fynde: and thinke it is for want of better Arte.</l>
                  <l>Then here with right good will, I offer it to thee,</l>
                  <l>And doe but thanke me for my paynes, it is ynough for mee.</l>
                  <l>Of troth I promise yee, t'is not for want of will,</l>
                  <l>That rudely thus in rymes I run, but want of better skill.</l>
                  <l>For if that I had Ouids pen, ech worde in printe to place,</l>
                  <l>Or Homers excercyse I had, to giue my verse a grace.</l>

                  <l>But small (God wot,) and that too small, as you may plainly see.</l>
                  <l>But since you see my simple head, vnhooded (as it is,)</l>
                  <l>Accept the symple fruict therof, and be content with this.</l>

                  <l>Which when I kill, you shall be sure to taste some of the same.</l>

                  <l>With better game hereafter I, perhaps will flye away.</l>
                  <l>And lyke a very Churle, then will I parte with none,</l>

                  <l>ALthough the harte a sléepe, the bones be all at rest,</l>
                  <l>Yet man asléepe, his minde his ofte with many thoughts opprest.</l>
                  <l>He dreames of this and that, sometime with trifling toyes,</l>
                  <l>His only mynde is troubled sore: sometime of pleasaunt ioyes</l>
                  <l>His minde doth run in sléepe: sometime he dreames of Kinges,</l>
                  <l>Of Princes Courts, &amp; princely feates, &amp; of such galant thinges.</l>
                  <l>And by and by, is out, in midst of all his dreame,</l>
                  <l>And from the court, to country Clowns, &amp; of a messe of creame:</l>
                  <l>Of Cattle in the feelde, of woods and pasture groundes,</l>
                  <l>Of Hawking, fyshing, Fowling too, &amp; hunting hare with hou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds.</l>
                  <l>And sodeinly vnwares, he leaues his countrey sport,</l>
                  <l>And from the countrey by and by, to cittie doth resort.</l>
                  <l>And there a thousand thinges at once, runs in his minde,</l>
                  <l>The gallant shops of sundry sortes, and wares of sundry kinde.</l>
                  <l>The precious pearles &amp; stones, on Goldsmiths shops that shine:</l>
                  <l>And then the Horsehead, but hard by, and then a cuppe of wyne.</l>
                  <l>Besides all gallant showes, yet one aboue the rest,</l>
                  <l>The Marchants wyues, with other dames, in fine attire adrest,</l>
                  <l>That at their dores, sometime on Sundayes vse to sit,</l>
                  <l>This when some doe behold by day, by night they dreame of it.</l>
                  <l>And then they fall in loue, although their sute be small,</l>
                  <l>For in the morning once awakte, they haue forgoten all.</l>
                  <l>Some dreame of cruell warres, of men slayne here and there,</l>
                  <l>And all the fieldes with bodyes dead, nie couered euery where.</l>
                  <l>And by and by the warres, not scarcely halfe begon,</l>
                  <l>But who doth get the victory, and then the warres are done.</l>
                  <l>And sodeinly agayne, he cannot tell which way,</l>
                  <l>He is at sea, and there he sées great Fyshes gin to play.</l>
                  <l>And strayght a tempest comes, that makes the waues to rore,</l>
                  <l>And then he seeth how the Ships, doe sayle in daunger sore.</l>
                  <l>Anon he sées his ship, with billowes beaten so,</l>
                  <l>That comes at last a sodeine waue, that doth her ouerthrow.</l>
                  <l>

                  <l>He onely is at shore, when all the rest are lost,</l>
                  <l>And there he sées how other ships, with tempests like are tost.</l>
                  <l>And there he stands not long, but straight a suddayne chaunge,</l>
                  <l>He carryed is, he knowes not how, into a countrey straunge.</l>
                  <l>And there he speakes a spéech, he neuer spake before,</l>
                  <l>And once awake, agayne perhaps, he neuer shall speake more.</l>
                  <l>A thousand things too more, a man doth thinke to sée</l>
                  <l>In sléepe sometimes, that neuer were, nor yet are like to bée.</l>
                  <l>For I my selfe, haue dreamde in sléepe, of sightes so straunge,</l>
                  <l>And in the midst of all my dreame, of sodayne sundry chaunge.</l>
                  <l>That in the morne awake, I could but merueile much,</l>
                  <l>What cause by day, by night should dryue, me into dreaming such.</l>
                  <l>But sitting so a whyle, sometyme I call to mynde,</l>
                  <l>A prouerbe olde, which some count true, but I méere false doe fynde.</l>
                  <l>That is. <hi>That man a sleepe doth lye at quyet rest,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>For many sléepe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue their minds, with many gréefs opprest</l>

                  <l>Some dreame of sorrowes to insue, and pleasures at an end.</l>
                  <l>And dreaming so I thinke, that man is not at rest,</l>
                  <l>Although he sléepe, his harte is yet, sore troubled in the brest.</l>
                  <l>The Boye that goes to Schoole, doth dreame of Rods by night,</l>
                  <l>His bréech too ready for the rodde, and in a sodaine fright</l>
                  <l>He starteth in his sleepe, and waketh therewithall,</l>
                  <l>And then say I, although he sléepe, his rest can be but small.</l>
                  <l>Some thinke in sléepe they are, in field with foe at fight,</l>
                  <l>And with their fysts, they buffet them, that lye with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by night</l>
                  <l>And are they then at rest? although they sléepe say you,</l>
                  <l>In déede they haue a kynde of rest, but rest I wot not how.</l>
                  <l>And many causes moe, of great vnquyet rest,</l>
                  <l>I could declare that are in sléepe, but these that are exprest</l>

                     <l>To that opynyon contrary, alleadged reason thus.</l>

                     <l>And any other sporte, but put him to his booke withall:</l>
                     <l>And when he is abroade, if fayre he doe not shoote,</l>

                     <l>And when in feeld he drawes not cleane, his arrow in his bow,</l>
                     <l>Knocke him vpon the fyngers harde, and you shall sée I trow,</l>
                     <l>That in a whyle his fyngers ends, for feare will quiuer so,</l>
                     <l>That he will neuer learne aright, to let his arrow go.</l>
                     <l>Now if he be harde at his booke, although he learne not well,</l>

                     <l>Him of his faulte, and if that he doe plye it harde,</l>

                     <l>Wherefore by reason thus I prooue, that children be not bent,</l>
                     <l>But that their natures much are made, by Tutors gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</l>

                     <l>I lyke not that, for tis to some, at fyrst to great a fright.</l>
                     <l>Their eyes are so vpon the rodde, they little minde their booke,</l>
                     <l>For childish feare will cause them still, vpon the rodde to looke.</l>
                     <l>And so their eyes quyte from their bokes, not only draws away</l>
                     <l>But eke their minds, as much and more, then any kinde of play</l>

                     <l>To make the Children to their bookes, to haue a more delight.</l>

                     <l>That many prety Boyes wil mar, that are of minds well bent.</l>
                     <l>That sure I know not what to say, but trust me in my minde,</l>
                     <l>A good Tutor, whereto a chyld is bent, can quickly fynde.</l>
                     <l>And as he fyndes the nature of the chyld, euen so he may,</l>
                     <l>By gentle meanes, euen as he list, soone leade him euery way.</l>

                     <l>He iustly vse with gentlenesse, as a good Tutor can.</l>
                     <l>Well, at the last this Gentleman, when he had heard at large,</l>
                     <l>Their true opynyons euery one, at last he gaue in charge.</l>
                     <l>His two sonnes, to two sundry men, wherof the one was milde</l>

                     <l>The other was of nature fierce, and therefore rather sought,</l>
                     <l>With store of stripes for to bring vp, such children as he tought.</l>
                     <l>The Children both of nature like, in tyme did differ much,</l>
                     <l>The difference of gouernment, of Tutors theirs were such.</l>
                     <l>The one did prooue a proper Youth, and learned for his tyme,</l>
                     <l>And by his learning afterward, to honour high did clyme.</l>
                     <l>This was by him brought vp, that was of nature mylde,</l>
                     <l>And euer sought by gentle meanes, for to bring vp a Chylde.</l>
                     <l>The other proued but a blocke, a <hi>Dunsicus,</hi> an asse,</l>
                     <l>Because with too much cruelty, he often dulled was.</l>
                     <l>This was brought vp by him, that was so fierce of minde,</l>
