            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here the Treasure is, there's the Heart,</hi> the thoughts, the affections also.<note place="margin">Matth. 6.21.</note> A judicious mind is vertuously am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, only being inamored with that, whose true worth invites most its Contemplation, glaneing over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour things with a superficial and general surview.</p>
                  <p>The Soul of Man is never un-imployed, though often mis-imployed, resembling in the perpetuity, though not in the quality of its motion, the ever and all-moving Creator; who as he ever was, so was he never idle, as being a most pure act.</p>
                  <p>Is this true? Is the mind of Man never vacant? Art
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59395:6"/>
thou never idle O my Soul? Strive then not to be idely employed; that both in acting, and in acting well, thou maist be more like thy Maker. And let the riches on which thou placest thy love, be Heaven and heavenly things: <hi>Where neither Moth nor rust corrupt, nor Thieves break through and steal</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth. 6.20.</note> so shall such Treasure be, not the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but the Paradise of thy heart.</p>
                  <p>Amongst all those precious Graces heapt up in the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Store-house of Gods mercy, though each particular is to be admired, yet are there degrees of preheminence. For like as the beautiful Stones set in <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Vestments; the Planets amongst the lesser Stars: So these three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Graces, Faith, Hope, and Charity, out-shine the rest, attracting the eye of my Soul, and as much invite my Contemplation, as they necessitate my fruition.</p>
                  <p>These, these are the Fundamental Graces, Superiour to all other, both in respect of the Excellency of their Object, Christ Jesus, and of their Subject wherein they reside, a true Christian. The other, <hi>viz.</hi> Temperance, Fortitude, &amp;c. being often-times bestowed by God on many natural Men, in whom they shine with a dim Light, never with a Sun-like splendor. They (like the <hi>Indians</hi>) possessing those Treasures, which Christians know best the right use of: Such Diamonds being then only truly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, when set within a foile of Humility.</p>
                  <p>Thus my Soul, through the free Grace of thy Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, hast thou exhibited to thy view, and enjoying a Mine of Treasure, a Heaven of Happiness, Riches which exclude not, but command thee to covet. O follow thy Saviours Counsel, be a joyful Man, and industrious Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant.<note place="margin">Matth. 13.44.</note> 
                     <hi>Part with all</hi> thy sinful Lusts, <hi>Sell</hi> all thy worldly Vanities; <hi>purchase this</hi> Field, and Trade for these <hi>Pearls.</hi> Thy affections are the price; which that thou mightest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burse without delay, look more seriously into their worth, so shalt thou at once affect, and possess them.</p>
                  <p>As the optick faculty is both weak, and useless to us, in the Discovery of things that are either too neer, or too far distant, and so out of the command of its Power: so also if we suffer it at once distractedly to wander over se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral species (though within the strength of its specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59395:6"/>
it cannot give a true judgment, or description of any particular. The same Rules bound our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the perspective of our Souls. For look we on God, that Infinite being, further then our limits in his gracious revelation, our sight is cataracted and dimned with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. View we him too neer in the attribute of his mercy, we grow presumptuously blind. Or place we ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene vanities in our affections as worthy to be equally ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on with him, our reason will prove both purblinde, and false-sighted; rendring an untrue and unprofitable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to our Souls. The last of these Rules let me first apply; then follow here the objects proposed to my present Meditation, which are the Principal and Evangelical Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Shall I then at once superficially glance over them? No, rather view thou my Soul each grace apart, that so thou mayest better discern the dignity of each particular.

Frail Mortals that we are, extraordinary need have we of such exact Descriptions; since like weak-sighted Men, we multiply our object, grasping frequently the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in stead of the substance. Thus being often times deceived in our judgments, by the many counterfeits of Faith, Let us upon some Professors thereof (that even falshood may not want a witness) cursorily gaze, as Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers use to do, on executed Traytors; learning wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from others harms, rather pitying their folly, than following their example.</p>

The truth of which, since it cannot aptly, or charitably be demonstrated, or discovered by any extant piece I know, lest I should seem to be my own Judge, or judge my Brother, I will with reverence look into our

Ark, the sacred Scriptures; wherein, as there is the two Tables of the Law for our instruction, so there is a Pot of Manna to encourage and strengthen our obedience. An <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod to tell us what we have been, are, and should not be. There I doubt not but to finde some Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the infant Age before the Law, or the middle Age under the Law, and some in the old Age of the World, that last measure of time under the Gospel.

A gourd indeed, and so it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For the eave of his last day ruined that frontis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59395:10"/>
of Vertue, which his whole lifes best Actions had raised towards Heaven. For, had he been with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and joyn'd with them in Prophesie? His ignorance and wants now send him to enquire of the Devil. Did he Sacrifice before to God? Now behold, the reward of Divination and Witchcraft are in his hand. He whose custom was to ask counsel of God, now seeks after a Witch; and he whose seeming Zeal condemns his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Son, for tasting of an Honey-comb, although ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of any restraint; now, contrary to his Oath and Covenant made with God, without humiliation and judging of himself, or confession of his fault, willingly and wilfully swallows down the very gall of Sin. His Humility did not more grace him, when he lay buried in the peoples Stuff, than his Pride did debase him, when he presumed to be one of Gods Council. That patience, fortitude, and mercy which abounded, yea, was extended towards others, is now deficient to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: For, he falls all along upon the Earth, becomes sore afraid; no strength is left in him, and yet he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to Eat. For, having no conscience towards God, no wonder if his Body wants the charity of Nature: When the Creature abuses the Mercy of the Creator, he must expect to taste of his Justice: And when he ceases to know Himself, he shall be made to know his Punishment. <hi>Saul</hi> hath forgotten both his God and himself, and therefore justly is he now forgotten, and hears his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral censure pronunced by him who never spoke nor wished better to man, <hi>To morrow shalt thou be with me.</hi>

                  <p>Forewarning fore-armes not Sinners; he that doubted of his Choise, though from the mouth of Gods Prophet, credits his refusal and death from the Devils Oracle. Extraordinary Blessings are the free and voluntary gift of God, and not believed of Sinners before enjoyed. But his punishments are the due Burden of sins desert, and therefore are expected before divulged. The Soul being often-times aforehand sensible of that which the Body afterwards endures. None but a false, or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Faith hath a final cessation; but such is this of <hi>Saul,</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59395:10"/>
he now beleeves onely that he might dispair. The first degree of a true Faith, being usually, the false ones last step. God lifting up the one from the sense of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the faith and sight of Mercy. Sin dragging the other from the belief of punishment into the gulf of Despairation.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Saul</hi> hath his last day marked out, even the <hi>morrow</hi>; yet neither the love towards his Sons (whose Lives bore the same date with his) nor care for himself, begets the least endeavour, by delay, or otherwise, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live the fore-going Prophesie (inevitable are the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God); nay rather, he hastens it, shortning his flight, that he might shorten his life. And, that sin (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its nature) might have a companion, he moves his Armour-bearer to be a traitour to his own Soul by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, whom his precept could not force to be a traitour to his Prince. For, he falls upon his Sword, which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Defence, becomes a weapon of Offence. So often-times God deals with the Wicked; who, as in life, themselves are their worst Enemies, so in death they prove their own Executioners. Thus the Sacred Annals, before and since <hi>Moses,</hi> hath by the Deads example, given most lively arguments to prove this falshood, of the deadness of this seeming life of faith. O admire here the infinite extent of the Mercy of God! who out of the carcase of this <hi>Lyon</hi> (Sin) this <hi>Eater</hi> (Death) brings forth both meat and sweetness for his <hi>Sampsons,</hi> his <hi>Nazarites</hi>; making the Downfal of the Fathers, the Rises of the Children; their Ignorance our Knowledge; their faults and blindness, apt spectacles to help the weakness of our sight! It now remains, that the holy Records of the faithful and powerful Gospel, as the Eccho of the Old Testament, consort in the like precedents; that by so consonant an Harmony, the dissonant, and unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed judgement of the most hypocritical and temporary Believer, may be convinced, if not converted.</p>
                  <p>The purest Gold hath its Dross; the best Wheat its Tares: Yea, the Moon is then most full of Spots, when least empty of Light. The Church of God in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, in its Infant Age, had many, who although

they were deemed Members of Christ, had not yet put off the <hi>Old man,</hi> The <hi>Old Adam.</hi> Many, whose Image and outward Superscription seemed to be our <hi>Cesars,</hi> yet proved to be false, and unvaluable Coyn, when they came to their test, or exchange. Witness <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 5.1.</note> (a pair doubly united, by Sin and Wedlock) who, before their trial, were esteemed as Members of the True Church, as Beleevers of the Apostles Doctrine, and no doubt baptised in that Faith; the effects of which seemed to lead them on to forsake the world; for, they sold their possessions to works of Charity and Piety, And laid it at the Apostles feet. Who would not here have parallel'd these with sincere <hi>Joses,</hi> since both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties did the same duty, though not with the same heart; the one acting truly that Christians part, which the other only play'd.</p>

                  <p>The indulgent Parent fears that the life story of that child, will prove but a compendium, whose Infant years are an Abridgment of Mans stature. The like observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be proved true (if doubted) in many preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously forward Christians, who are like to Childrens Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which, while they last, are but Topographies to the Beholders: Or, like Lightning; which, though it invelop Heaven, hath nought remaining; yea, scarcely time and place to bear witness of its glory. So these hypocritical and temporary Professors, seem a perfect Map of Christianity, the splendor of Religion. Yet at the appointed time they vanish, becoming so much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, by how much nearer they seemed to Heaven. View the experiment of this truth in the Scribes and Pharisees, (from the opinion of whose Righteousness, the Jews drews this Maxim, That if any two on Earth should be glorified in Heaven, the one must be a Scribe, the other a Pharisee.) That their Purity was but a Blaze, this vulgar conceit a Falsehood. Hear and believe the Word, yea, the Word of Truth,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.13.</note> concluding these Wise men, Fools; these Guides, Misleaders; these Patrons of the Common-wealth, unnatural Vipers; sealing them up with a seven fold Woe, for manifest an hypocrisie, to eternal Damnation.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour was many times guarded with troops and multitudes of Disciples, whose momentary affections proffered Him an Earthly Crown. Yet he, which knew all Hearts, knew the unconstancy of theirs, and therefore <hi>committed not himself to them.</hi> For, had they been as Powerful as Willing, had their affections been as sincere and durable, as they were fervent, yet could not any earthly Monarchy allure him to Reign, who lest his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Throne to Suffer; exchanging a crown of Glory for a Crown of Thornes, that his Humiliation might be be mans Exaltation. O here behold the Unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Gods Love, the Vanity and Unsteadfastness of Mans best Resolution. Those Disciples, which even now would have Crowned him, those which traced him

through Sea and Land, and having found him, said, What should we do that we might work the Works of God; yea those, who, as it were filled with a passionate desire of possession,<note place="margin">John 6.30.</note> prayed, <hi>Lord, evermore give us this Bread</hi>; these now, instead of honouring him with a Diadem, deny his Regal descent, saying, <hi>Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph.</hi> These whose appetites desired evermore to enjoy this Bread of Life,<note place="margin">John 6.42.</note> think there is now no living with this Food; as being too hard for their digestion, their tongues testifying their distate, saying, <hi>This is an hard saying, who can hear it?</hi> To conclude, they that so fast followed him, now as fast depart from him; Witness our Saviours question to his Chosen ones, <hi>Will ye also go away?</hi>

                  <p>My Meditations have spent much time in the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of this out-side of Faith. I should now proceed, did not the hateful example of Apostating <hi>Demas</hi> stand bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Holy-Writ, for my observation and conclusion of this Point. Knowledge is the foundation of Faith, but God only is the Master builder of it. Christians are Priests, imputatively and derivatively from our Saviour, as offering up the Evangelical sacrifices of Prayer, and Praise; but the Ministers of the Gospel, in a more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner. <hi>Demas</hi> was a <hi>Priest,</hi> because a Christian; <hi>Learned,</hi> as being without doubt, a <hi>Teacher; Pauls</hi> schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and companion, one whose <hi>eyes</hi> were daily witnesses of <hi>Signes and Miracles</hi>; whose ears were frequent audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of <hi>Gods Word:</hi> yet this man wanted the witness of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in his <hi>Conscience.</hi> Therefore no marvail if his actions were destitute of its power. <hi>The Wisdom of this world is Foolishness with God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.20.</note> and proves at length so to Man. <hi>Demas</hi>'s worldliness discovers his Folly; and his second choice shews the Hypocrisie of the first. That affection which towards Christ hath an end, had never a beginning. The Love of God is Lasting. And though our weak understanding, through the interposition of some great Afflictions, may conceive it to be extinct; yet,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59395:12"/>
that eclipse past, this overture of falling out, proves the renewing of Love. He that perseveres to the end, shall endlesly be Beloved. But he that grants God the <hi>Major,</hi> his youth and strength; and of his full age the <hi>Minor,</hi> the lesser part of that time, and yet at last doth in fact deny the conclusion, is as little a Christian as a Logician.</p>
                  <p>The Word of God, as it is the great luminary of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity; so likewise the Sun of our Souls, which discovers unto us those glittering counterfeits, which the false and weak lights of our depraved understandings, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent as blameless. This is that Star which guides all <hi>Wise</hi> men to Christ. A Pole Star, directing only all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Observers; being either unknown, or else not useful to worldly Stargazers. This Word, as it makes us know our selves, which is the principal of wisdom, so it makes us discern (in some sort) others, which is the Divinity of Knowledge. Which of the Devout Jewes would have thought the Scribes and Pharisees hypocrites, had not the Word of that All-creating Word, Christ Jesus, ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomised their shameful Corruption? Who amongst us would have judged a Miraculous Faith, less than a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; had not the same Verity assured us, <hi>That many which have Prophesied, cast out Devils,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 7.22.</note>

These indeed have cropt the Leaves of Faith, leaving the Fruit and Root be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: seeking therewith, like <hi>Adam,</hi> presumptuously to hide their Nakedness, and want both of Application and Justification. Thus these, whilst they think to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others, the Devil deceives them.</p>
                  <p>Charity, the most fruitful, lasting, and most eminent
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59395:13"/>
Grace, begins first at home. The affection which we bear to our selves, being the best pattern for direction of our loves towards others. Witness the approbation of our Saviour Christ, whose abridgement of the whole Law being Charity; the Rule of it was, <hi>To love our Neighbours as our Selves.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 22.39.</note> From this Expression, or short Paraphrase, who concludes not a primary and most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Duty, necessarily to be implyed and commanded, [<hi>a self-loving</hi>] though not a <hi>self-love</hi> as being the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, quantity, and just weight of all our external acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Of this want, are those guilty, reproved by our Saviour; who (too publickly officious) offer to pull out their neighbours Mote, not being sensible of the Beam in their own Eyes. Also the unhappy Miracle-worker must here plead Guilty, of whom that Jewish saying, falsly applyed to our Lord, may be truly verified, <hi>He saved others, himself he cannot save.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gods Power is the chiefest agent in effecting Miracles; an Attribute most necessary to beget Fear, Admiration, and Humiliation. But alas, the Knowledge of Gods Omnipotency, shall rather affright, than comfort us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the apprehension and self-application of His love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, in Him, for whose Name sake he wrought such Signes. Yea, our Fear will prove slavish, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile; our Admiration frightful and terrible; our Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation distracted and desperate, without the sense and feeling, promise, and assurance of his merciful Love. For <hi>God is Love,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 4.16.</note> and works by Love. His Love being the only cause of ours to Him, and to others. The truth of this, made <hi>Paul</hi> account <hi>all Faith, though able to remove Mountains,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.2.</note> 
                     <hi>nothing without Charity</hi>; further intimating, that how glorious soever such outsides might seem, they would prove empty shells, void of the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, the substance, and true essence of Faith. Charity being the left hand of Faith, as Faith the right eye of Charity.</p>
                  <p>There needs no other witness of this Faiths insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency than <hi>Judas Iscariot.</hi> Who was elected to be one of the Select Disciples, and dignified with the Highest of Callings, even to be the Apostle of Jesus Christ. One
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59395:13"/>
who, both under the Law and Gospel, had participated of those initiating Sacraments, Circumcision and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, as also of that which was for Confirmation, the Passeover. Further, he was a Preacher of the Covenant of Grace, by Word as well as by Name, by Deed as well as by Word; as appears by our Saviours large Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. He gave them <hi>Power,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 10.1.</note> viz. <hi>his Twelve Disciples against Vnclean Spirits, to cast them out, and to Heal all manner of Sickness,</hi> and all manner of Diseases. The Execution of this, the joynt Confession of the Twelve, and of the Seventy Disciples, doth manifest, saying, <hi>Lord, even the Devils are subject unto us through thy Name:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 10.17.</note> Loe, here <hi>Judas</hi> miraculously casting out Devils. Will it not be a wonder, yea, and seem an untruth, that this Saint is become a Devil? No.<note place="margin">John 7.6.</note> Such a Faith to have such an End, is but natural; a stinted Faith wants enlargement to continue. Through Faith in His <hi>Name</hi> we may do Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; but through Faith in His <hi>Blood,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 4.30.</note> we and <hi>Judas</hi> only can be Saved.</p>
                  <p>The light and fruit of Faith, and all other good Works must shine, not to me, nor to others alone, but to both: Men may be instruments of Heat to others, and yet Cold themselves. Many are made Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Gods Power, which never enjoy his Grace. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadonezzar</hi> was his <hi>Rod, Cirus</hi> his <hi>Servant:</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Son.</hi> Yea, Miracles and proofs are not wanting in our dayes; there being those (I fear) whose words have powerfully cast Sathan out of others, their own Souls being not delivered from his Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>Stories, the monuments of Art, preserve in black and white, what once was done in Colours, by a Grecian Painter; whose Skill was so much an Ape to Nature, that his lively Draughts deceived the double sences of Birds; causing them to prefer the shaddows of Fruits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fruitful Substance. The Devil in his subject is not less void of Art, although they both differ in their ends; the one Deceiving, but to shew his Skill; the other being Skilful to deceive Birds who have not reason to correct their Sence, nor to discover the Shaddow of Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; one is only a Laughfing-stock of that Artists inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

Craft; But Man, whose incorporeal parts parallel the others Essence, yea, now transcend it, (by how much a positive is better than a depravation) is the stage which Sathans derision tramples on. The least of Scornes, is not the least of Injuries; the height of it, the greatest of Cruelties. Such is his, for it wounds the wounded, seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deprive those of Heaven, whom he hath already defrauded of an earthly Paradise.</p>
                  <p>O my Soul, thou art one of this worlds Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, to whom this busie Impostor, variously disguised, offers his service. Each mind at first, whiles unhabituated, is in that respect an empty Tablet, on which some por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture must be drawn. A good and a bad Artist, strive for the Employment. Divers excellent beginnings are there Blurd by the one. Divers bad ones amended by the other. The good Models having only this advantage, that once dry, and fixt, they may suffer a Blot, never an utter Defacing. Death lastly brings to light, the work, which challenges the Master, and the Master it. Wouldst thou then know what is Drawn, and whom thou hast Imployed? Let thy following Meditations search out, and observe the Original; which (the shaddowes withdrawn) most opportunely, and in order, meets thy next Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The pleasingness of Objects, begets a Delight; the delight, an affection; the affection courts an enjoying. <hi>Eve,</hi> the Mother of Sin, and of Man-kind, before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As the Body, so the Soul hath its several Objects; according to which diversity, it may be capable of a threefold sight; in all which, the cause, medium and instrument of seeing, with its object, is most considerable. In the first, the sight
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59395:14"/>
of sence, there is the Light proceeding from the Sun, occasioning the operation: 2. The fleshly nerves which contein the optick faculties, imployed about all objects, and visible substances. In the second, the sight of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, there is the light of Nature: 2. The luminary o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. The Eye of Faith, whose object is the only begotten, infinitely Glorious, and mercifull Son of God, Christ Jesus, with all his faithful Promises, numberless Merits, saving and incomprehensible Graces.</p>
                  <p>This then, O my Soul, is that Sight and Light; in comparison of which, all other is but Darkness, or as Torch-lights to the Sun. By this alone, a true Christian shall as much transcend the rational, as the rational the sensual Creature. Doth the momentary splendour of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene things entice us to affect and prefer them? And shall the everlasting, and perfectly glorious Vision of Heavenly things; even of Him, who gave Beauty, Form, and Beeing to thee, and all things, prove less deserving, less effectual? Was the carnal eyes of my First Parents so over-pleased with the transitory Beauty of an earthly Fruit, that they forgot their Creator, whose Image they bare, and entered the death, threatning the breach of his Commandement, though open to the fury of a double Curse; exchanging the eternity of Happiness, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary taste? And shall not the Pearless splendour of Heavenly things, animate me to prepare a hand, a heart, to receive, and taste, the Manna of Souls, the Fruit of a Tree of Life, not guarded with a Cherubs Fiery sword, but obvious to all; not rooted in Earth, but sprang from Heaven; being grafted into Humanity, that his Living Fruit might become the saving and eternal nourishment of Man?

                  <p>O <hi>Adam,</hi> I cannot blame thee for the loss of this Grace; since thou deprivest thy Posterity of those Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures only, which thou was possest of. But in thy Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy this thou hadst not, yet wert thou not therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; for thy created purity needed not any imputative righteousness; being of it self sufficient, because accepted. The beauty of thy first Purity was so far from Leprosie, that not the least Stain was then apparent to deface its Candor. Thy Innocency, void of Sin; and therefore required not a Saviour. Thy Soul was the Resemblance of thy Creator; and therefore a pleasing, and most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object for his All-glorious sight. There was without Wrath; Attonement; without Enmity, Mediation; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Debt, satisfaction; without Jesus, Application is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary.</p>
                  <p>Infidelity was the first means of Death, Faith is the only instrument of Life. By the one, came our Descent to Hell; through the other, our Ascent to Heaven.

the brightness and benefit of his light, so the clouding of our Saviour by death, teacheth us his Disciples at once, the felicity of his presence, the uncomfortableness of his absence, and the perfection of his Person. The descents of Mans misery are the degrees to Christs victory. As we in this World inherited sin, so he upon Earth merited righteousness.

If the Devils fear, forced his Prince to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate, when our Saviour sojourn'd on Earth, what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible terrors did then possess them, when the Worlds Great Monarch reigned over Hell?

For who hath the Key of the bottomless Pit of Heaven, and Hell, but he to whom all power is given both in Heaven and Earth? He who openeth, and no Man shutteth. Or when should these Principalities be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, if not at this general and most glorious Conquest? Can any imagine this great Victory to be maymed, or imperfect, since he then led Captivity captive, trampling over all those, that resisted either his Power, or our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? So conclude this; what time since his coming doth so evidently demonstrate this truth to be by our Head in part fulfilled, as the after events. I mean the tranquility and delight of the Church amongst themselves, those hundred years immediately succeeding his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. What though the ten Persecutions did exceedingly rage against the Saints, according to the 4th. verse of that 20. of the <hi>Revelations?</hi> The blood of the Martyrs

is the Seed of the Church. Yea, they did even then reign most gloriously with Christ. As the Kingdome of our Saviour, and the brightness of the Church, shined most perspicuously, when the purity thereof brake forth in their profession and constancy; so the miseries of Christians, and the liberty of Sathan is never more apparent, then when the damnableness, and obscurity of capital Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies Eclipse the visible face of the Church. For in the first, we may truly be said to live, and tryumph even in death: in the last, their supposed freedome is the greatest sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and their seeming life, but a cursed, and eternal deprivation.</p>

Had he dyed, and presently revived, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Man would have tearmed such a Death but a Transe. Yea, the scandalous Rulers would have blasted the wonderfull Miracle of his Resurrection, with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of self-contradicting, and not performance of his former protestation; <hi>Destroy this Temple, and within three Days I will build it up again.</hi> Wherefore O my Soul, that thy faith might be confirmed in the sure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of his dying; The <hi>Jews</hi> convicted, by the truth of his performance; and his own Power, magnified by the Divinity of the act; he is content to lodge, (as it were) in a second Womb, <hi>viz.</hi> of Clay; that all things being perfected; the third Day, he might lead his the way, to a birth of Glory.</p>
                  <p>The victorious Soul of my Saviour, after the reliction of his Body, having trampled upon Death, tryumphed over Hell, and took a full possession of Heaven; that his actions, as they were the means, so they might be (as it were) the story, and prophecy of our succeeding.

To this may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that of the Psalmist. <hi>Mourning may continue for a Night, but joy comes in the Morning. Noah's</hi> Ark, the true Figure of a Christians faith, must be drenched in the Waves, and driven by the Wind, a long time, before it shall rest dry, and safe upon the Mountains of <hi>Ararat.</hi> The humiliation of my Saviour, was his night, wherein the humanity did most manifest it self: So his exaltation, in which his Resurrection hath a part, is his Day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the brightness and power of his God-head did shew it self most apparently. <hi>Adam</hi> (the destroyer of Man) first enjoyed a blessing, a Paradise, before he merited a Curse, a Hell. But the <hi>Messias</hi> (the restorer of Man) must first be made an execration, before he can purchase for us a re-possession. Not long since, I besought all true believers to weep with Christ, who wept not for himself, but for them. But now my Soul breaths forth a more pleasing request, which I prefer not to all, but to those only which are mourners in Sion. That as they have grieved with Him, and for themselves in him, so now they would be filled with his solace, and tryumph in his Victory. That as they have sowed in tears, they may now reap in joy.</p>
                  <p>Every Man was a debtor unto the Almighty, untill Christ our surety paid the mortgage, and redeemed our Souls. He satisfied the debt on the Cross, least we should doubt of the sufficiency of his satisfaction. For, behold here our acquittance, and the Bonds rent, even the Bonds of Death, torne asunder in, and by his Resurrection. Have we not then cause to rejoyce for so great a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance? The mirth of <hi>Moses, Myriam,</hi> and the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> was expressed in a Song of thanksgiving, when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were entombed in the Sea: The <hi>joy of Barak and Debora</hi> was proclaimed in an Anthem of praise,<note place="margin">Judg. 5.1.</note> when <hi>Sisera</hi> and his Chariots were discomfited: The

                  <p>Let us now walk forth with those of <hi>Emmaus,</hi> to meet our Saviour, after the Resurrection of his Body; Praying earnestly, that through the Power of his Spirit, he would open the eyes of our faith, that we may believe, confess, and rejoyce in his Resurrection. The infinite affection of this Saviour of ours, is apparent in every action. His love made him depart from glory, when he descended from the bosome of his Father; his love made him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his glory, when he maskt it with humanity; and the same love makes him as it were dis-esteem his glory, that he might confirm his Disciples.

                  <p>Christ Jesus is the Christians Sanctuary; and these his offices, the three precious, and unexhaustible Fountains, from whence <hi>Ezechiel's healing Waters</hi> plentifully flow.

Is here a Physician? Is here a mundifying River? Is here a most approved Balme?

And ought,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.31.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my method, there to be handled. But the agreeableness of the Meditation to this place, and the profit which by Gods grace will flow to me in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to others in the perusal, makes me insert here this Anatomy of a dead Man, which cannot be too large, since none can enough know himself. In the profundity of a Well, even at mid-day a Man may view the Stars. And in the Sun-shine of prosperity, (if our Souls fathome this our depth of misery) we shall, free from all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, more perfectly apprehend our Lucifer, Christ Jesus.</p>
                  <p>God, the universal Creator, being perfection it self, it must needs follow, that the beauty and happiness of the Creature consists in being like to him. It being always remembred, that what in them hath its measure, degree and proportion, in Him is boundless, unexpressable and infinite. If the impression of Gods Image, in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the Kings Image upon their Coine only makes it Royal, and gives it preheminence, and excellence; it must needs be granted, that whatsoever piece of his workmanship hath this glorious stamp, or pourtraiture erazed, or defaced, must needs remain useless, naked, and without honour.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59395:31"/>
is as it were the superficies of Man, the Pallace, the Shell, the Garment of the Soul. That so having observed their union in sin, aswell as in nature, from the joynt, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary acquired curse of imperfection, I may be the more inlarged to magnifie Gods free gift of perfection.</p>
                  <p>As the Lord in the Creation made Man after his own Image, as concerning the Soul, that he might be capable of Divine Visions, and enjoy a communion with him: So also he made Man like himself, as considering the Body, in respect of Dominion, and Majesty; no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being like God, but himself. That according to the present Commandement, one Man might love another as himself: such a similitude of parts, inducing a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of hearts, love being the fulfilling of the Law, since the fall. Because there needed not Law when love was perfect; before the fall, the defect of the one necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the constitution of the other. Every member of the Body in the state of innocency, being made willing, and ready to perform all good actions, respecting either God or Man, by the quickning and agitating Power of this predominant affection in the Soul. But what have I now to do with the state of Innocency, that am now discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Rebellion? Our self-love in <hi>Adam</hi> hath depraved us of that true love, which (seated in the Soul) moves the Body to act any goodness. Of which miserable loss of ours, that we may be more sensible, it is necessary that as the Souls, so the Bodies defects be particularly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated on.</p>
                  <p>The curse and judgment of the Body is, that it should be a ready instrument to execute the sinfull commands of the Soul; these two parts constituting, Man, being as it were Master and Servant, Husband and Wife. Yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, as in the happiest unions amongst us, we shall finde, that though the Nobler Sex hath the Superiority and Power of Rule, yet so prevalent is the nature of conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal love, that it sweetly allures the superintendents will to joyn issue in many actions by that which is subjected. So in Man, though the Soul be the Head, the Monarch, yet (by reason of the neer conjunction) the Body often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inclines the Soul to be active, according to its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59395:31"/>
making good that Phylosophical maxime. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res animi sequuntur temperamentum corporis.</hi> By this it appears, that the Body is not only instrumentally, but also in a kind potentially evil, since the Fall; being then chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in an instant of time, from its beauty to deformity, from its perfect composition (which was equal <hi>ad pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>) to an unequal mixture of the Elements and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.

Hence the necessity of daily nourishment, and the peccancy and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding of humours (descryed in the four Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) and those excess, aided by the constant bent of nature to do ill, do cause that aptness, and proclivity of several Men to particular Vices; as the cholerick to malice, blood, and anger; the melancholy to despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and discontent; the sanguine to lust; the flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick to sloath and idleness.

To conclude all, is my whole Body con-natural with sin; an abettor and open friend to all iniquity; a Load-stone, cleaving rather to the base mettal of sin, than to the pure and tried gold of grace? Clay it is indeed, both in substance, and quality; as being hardned, and not mollified by the rayes of thy mercies, pressing always to its own Element of Earth, though never so often elevated by the motions of thy good Spirit towards Heaven? <hi>Lord, what is Man that thou art mindfull of him,</hi>

But this Jubile continued not a Year, a Moneth, a Week, I think scarcely a Day. God's first Sabbath of rest (I suppose) was the utmost date of Mans freedome from sin. For no sooner had temptation voluntary leave to enter through the sences, into this holy Temple, but the ambush of sin rushed out of Sathans imposture, as the <hi>Grecians</hi> from their Horse, and overthrew and polluted the Priest, the Sacrifice, and the Altar.

                  <p>All Priests, since the fall, within the Church of God were the Types of our high Priest, Christ Jesus. For no sooner was there a breach made betwixt God and Man; the Creator and the Creature, but mercy pleaded for a reconciliation; and that reconciliation in Justice requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Mediator, which is the Lord Jesus. A principal part of whose Mediatorship is this his office of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.

Go forth now my Soul, and bid defiance to all thy Enemies. For the Shield of thy faith shall receive all their darts, without any danger to thee; retorting them back, even into the adversaries faces.

Since that the Lord, the great Architector, suffered this specious (yet brittle building) of unstable Man to fall down flat, that upon its foundation he might raise up, to the glory of his grace, a more beautifull edifice, in which admirable structure he uses the same matter, and that it might be stable for ever, he Himself becomes the <hi>Head of the Corner.</hi> Further, the Builders of this spiritual Temple are Gods Spirit, and Ministers; the cement,<note place="margin">Mat. 21.42.</note> faith and all other graces; the Buttresses or Pillars, his Election;

                  <p>Again, had Man been only placed in a renued estate, there would have been a possibility of falling, and of plunging Himself into a double curse, whereupon Sathan and evil Men would have taken an occasion to derogate both from the mercy, and power of God, according to those Objections of the Heathen, rehearsed by <hi>Moses; That because the Lord would not,</hi>

                     <hi>or could not save them, he suffered them to be destroyed</hi>; But some will say, he might have confirmed them, as he did the Elect Angels; I answer, that if it should have pleased God thus to have bestowed his mercy towards us his Children, yet the Devil and wicked Men (if in these days of our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, much more in those of our perfection) would have derogated from Gods grace, that they might have attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted all, or the best part to Mans merit. Lastly, in this our Justification by Christ, mercy counterpoises justice; yea, in these there are, to the eternal praise of our all wise God, an admirable and due proportion.

                  <p>I have here Dialogue-wise (for the more profitable and particular handling of things) briefly and plainly shewed, how many rare and precious gems are treasured up in this Ark of the Covenant, the Prophetical office of our Saviour, as also how graciously, and comfortably, they are offered to, and received by the hand of faith, to the benefit, and Jubile, of every true Believer.</p>
                  <p>It remains now, that according to my former method, my Meditations pass on unto the last object and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of faith, the <hi>Kingly office</hi> of our Saviour; which is as it were the tegment, and compleatment, of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

                  <p>Surely, as there is good cause to commend the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens choice and application of this Metaphor: So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>above all, to admire the infinite wisdome of the Spirit of God, as the Original; who under this similitude com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends and discovers the whole duty of a religious Prince, and Governor; as that like a Shepheard, he is to feed his People, to lead them, to fold, and keep them from straying, and to protect them from those Wolves, and wicked Enemies that seek to destroy them. See all this exprest in that woe pronounc'd, by the Spirit of God against the Shepward of <hi>Israel,</hi> that do feed only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Should not the Shepwards feed the Flock?<note place="margin">Ezek. 34.2, 4.</note> The diseased have yee not strengthned, neither have you heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that that was sick, neither have yee bound up that that was broken, neither have yee brought again, that that was driven away, neither have yee sought that that was lost. But with fierceness and with cruelty have yee ruled them. Seeing then that the Lord himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends unto us this humble vocation, offering it as a Glass unto Princes, his Vice-roys upon Earth, therein to see their duties; It will neither be unfit, nor unprofitable, to meditate and consider the office and actions of the Lord of Lords, even our Lord Jesus Christ under the same Metaphor. And the rather,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.25.</note> because St. <hi>Peter</hi> gives us a Precedent; who stiles him the <hi>chief Shepward, and Bishop of our Souls</hi>; and more especially for these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: First, because God the Father so calls him often in Scripture; witness that Prophesie of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> saying,<note place="margin">Ezek. 34.23.</note> I will <hi>set up one Shepward over them,</hi> he shall feed them. Secondly, he so names himself, and with abundance of affection, and delight, and prosecutes and applies the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, saying, I am the <hi>good Shepward, and know my
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59395:54"/>
Sheep, and am known of mine.</hi> And lastly, whatsoever he in that Chapter,<note place="margin">John 10.14.</note> or elsewhere applies to himself, in the office of a Shepward, doth most aptly agree with his Kingly administration. But to make this more cleer, Is it the duty of a King to govern, and direct his People by good Laws? Which though written, yet are as it were his lively, fixt, and continued voice. And is not this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of our King, the Shepward of <hi>Israel?</hi> Who saith, that <hi>to Him the Porter openeth, and the Sheep hear his voice</hi>;<note place="margin">John 10.3.</note> that he calleth his own Sheep by name, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them out. Is it the duty of a King to protect his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to reward them, as well as to restrain, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Enemies? And is not this true of our good Shepward, <hi>Who giveth his life for his Sheep?</hi> being not like the hireling,<note place="margin">John. 10.12.</note> who <hi>seeing the Wolf coming, flieth, and leaveth the Sheep.</hi> Yea, all blessings temporal, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, abound to them that are admitted into his <hi>Fold. For he promises, that if any enter therein, he shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>

                     <hi>and shall go in and out, and finde pasture.</hi> Lastly, is it the office of a King to see and judge of the actions of inferiours; to give dignity and honour to the well-meriting, and obedient; and to inflict punishment, and death, upon rebellious offenders? See this also made good by Gods promise unto us, under the rule of our only Shepward, Christ Jesus; Saying, <hi>Behold, even I will judge betwixt the fat Cattle,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 34.20, 25, 26.</note> 
                     <hi>and the lean; and I will cause the evil Beasts to cease out of the Land. And I will make with them a Covenant of Peace. And I will make them, and the places round about them, a blessing. And I will cause the showers to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessings.</hi> And as concerning the last, and General Judgment, our Saviour speaking of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Persons before his Trybunal; and the parting of his true Subjects, from Rebels, the good from the bad, still alludes to the office of a Shepward; and saith, that <hi>he will separate them one from another, as the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward divideth the Sheep from the Goats.</hi>

of this his glorious function, as it manifests it self in the excellency of his Person; and in the uprightness, and perfection of his Laws; as also in all those gratious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which flow from so divine a dispensation.

how great is the sorrow and anxiety of my minde, that oppresses those Souls, which lie under the burden of such a tyranny? surely it is ineffable. From hence, by the rule of contraries, I conclude the exceeding mirth, and happiness of that People, whose Laws are Maximes, and Patterns to all others; whose God and King is the Lord, whose judgments are true, and righteous altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that if happiness can be separated from joy, then may joy be devorc'd from such a Government. Wherefore as the Prophet extolls the divine quality, the Statutes of the Lord are right, so he omits not to point out unto us the no less gratious effect,<note place="margin">Psal. 95.1, 3.</note> they rejoyce the heart. O come therefore, and <hi>let us sing unto the Lord, let us make a joyfull noise unto the Rock of our Salvation, for thou Lord art a great God, and a great King above all Gods; thy Throne is for ever,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus O my Soul, passing by, thou hast taken a view of the beauty of those divine Laws, by which Christians are governed. If the Heathen <hi>Ptolomy</hi> accounted them the Jewel of his Library, and at their translation into the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, was even ravisht in the observation of their supernatural wisdome, and Majesty: How ought we Christians to be affected, who by more than an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical faith, (as I have proved) look upon them as the Statutes enacted, pronounced, and engraven in last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tables, by God himself, and also confess them. As for antiquity, to be the ancientest, and most venerable; so for their matter, the perfectest, purest, and most righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous of all others. It remains now, that thou glance o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver some of their effects, and so proceed.

                     <hi>therefore I hate every false way?</hi> Lastly, as these powerfull Statutes of God are thus effectual in the illumination of the understanding, and the inflaming of the affection; So also in the subjecting, and changing the <hi>will,</hi> making it of a nilling, a willing will. But here forget not (as also in all the rest) that the Law works only these effects in us, as being the Scepter of Christs Government (and linked with the Gospel.) Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, we may confidently aver, that the Prophesie is fulfilled; That the <hi>Lord shall rule</hi> (by his Law) <hi>in the midst of his Enemies,</hi>

                  <p>O my Soul, I confess I have undertaken a hard task,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59395:72"/>
to perswade against Natures prescription, and sence. For, what more universal, more common, more necessary, and therefore more natural, than the marriage of Soul and Body? What amity more ancient, or more diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, than this, betwixt these two friends? Yea, what expresses the glory, and regal Power of the one; what gives an active beeing, and lively existence to the other, but this mutual communion, and effectual union. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wants there negative arguments, to dishearten, and weigh thee down, my Soul, in this thy Eagle-like flight, as being the unwelcome concomitants, fearfull conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, and direfull defects, of this unwilling separation. Such the darkning of the Sun, Moon, Light and Stars (I mean the Eyes;<note place="margin">Eccles. 12.</note>) the obscuring of <hi>those that look out of the Windows,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 3.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> the receding of the Soul, by reason of the debility of the optick Nerves, as the holy Ghost elegantly expresses; such the palsyness of our hands, the <hi>keepers of our house</hi> of Clay; the weakness and binding of the Legges, the <hi>strong guard thereof</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the want of motion in the Teeth,<note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> the mills and <hi>grinders</hi> of our food; such the bringing low of the <hi>Daughters of Musick,</hi> by deafness in the Eares, and hollowness of voice;<note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> such thy many and present fears, equal (if thou beest ancient) unto thy gray haires, white like the <hi>blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soming Almond-Tree</hi>; The <hi>losing of the silver Cord (viz.)</hi> the evaporating of the natural,<note place="margin">Verse 6.</note> and vital Spirits, the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the marrow, and the relaxing of the Nerves, and sinews, the ligaments of the Bones; such the <hi>breaking of the golden Bowle, Pitcher, or Wheele, at the Fountain, or Cistern, viz.</hi> the rending in two of the heart-string, those last pangs, disabling it to force the blood (extracted from the Liver, as being the Fountain) into the Veins; and to perform its circular motion. But all these are but the associates, and symptomes of Death; the followers, they are far more terrible, and distractive; such are the privation of life: the Pallace of the Soul, being now a dungeon of corruption, the pale hue of the Face, and Body, the breathless Carcass, now, as it were, mourning for her Spouses departure. Such the strange deadness of the late sparkling Eyes, yellowed now like unto a fallen
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59395:72"/>
Star. To conclude the whole Microcosme of the Body, deprived of her created light, and of that Spirit, that moved in her, and informed her, the Soul, becomes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than a motionless lump, an obscure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Chaos.</p>
                  <p>These considerations, O my Soul! at the first sight, I confess, render Death a terrible Goliah; before whom, most of the Armies of <hi>Israel</hi> turn their backs. Yet do not thou fear; for a stone, or two, chosen, and taken out of those running, and pure streams, of Gods Word, from that Rock hewen out without hands, shall from the Sling of every faithfull <hi>David,</hi> not only pierce his forehead, but also swallow up, terminate, and intombe Death in death. Is thy sick-Bed, through the fury of this adversary, as full of torture, as the hot glowing Gridiron of holy <hi>Lawrence?</hi> yet such a Metamorphosis will thy high-soaring Contemplations, and the power of faith work in thee, that the full sence, and influx of Heavenly joyes, and raptures, shall make thee senseless of thy pains, and sufferings. Thy feavourish fits being but <hi>Eliah</hi>'s Chariot, thy cold sweats, but thy passage through <hi>Jordan,</hi> into the Heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> Hast thou not seen a fierce flame in thy Chimny suddenly to damp and recoyle, when the Sun shines full upon it?

Surely if there be any Spiritual weight that depresseth the Soul, it is Judgment. If there be any Heavenly Magnes that attracts, and quickens it, 'tis Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. For, toucht with this, though encircled with corruption, thou shalt continue moving with the Needle, until fixed upon the lines of life, thou constantly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing to the true Flower-de-luce, Christ Jesus. Amongst <hi>Moses</hi> unfeigned Metamorphoses, we finde the Rod chang'd to a Serpent, a devourer of the Magitian delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. So this hope, a branch of the Tree of Life, spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Root of <hi>Jesse,</hi> swallows up Death in victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in Eternity.

my Soul! is included, and assured unto thee, the subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest of Heavenly fruitions, (called by the School-men) the beatifical Vision. Which, so far as I am able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it, is the Souls full repletion, and apprehension of the excellencies of the Divine Essence; not by the back-parts only, and mediately, as <hi>Moses,</hi> but primarily, and immediately, in himself. Yea, also the Body, being in the very moment of its resurrection <hi>spiritualiz'd,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.44. 1 John 3.2.</note> (as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth the Apostle) shall there, with open face see, and look upon, the word of life, receiving fulness of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and satisfaction, by those sences which now are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and uncapable of such glorious manifestations. Here, since this last act of our faith, and last Article of our Creed, is so full of comfort, and unspeakable ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, after the hearty, and humble acknowledgment, of my ignorance, and fervent supplicating the assistance of the only illuminating Spirit, I will more largely and particularly eye this Crown, this unvaluable price, even so far as my faith hath visual beames from Scripture, or consequent demonstration.</p>
                  <p>If the Soul of Man in this state of her nakedness, and deformity, hath been by some Christians (though therein Heretical) deifyed, and by most of the Heathen Magi magnifyed, even to the heighth of created excellencies; surely in her renovation, and perfect reassumption, of that her first Image, and those first created Ornaments, she must needs be more splendid, and more to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But is this beauty of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> in his innocency, the heighth of a Christians hope? No. As our second <hi>Adam,</hi> in his divine descent, and generation, infinitely transcends our first Parent in Nature; so he hath prepared a far more excellent weight of glory, for his Children, by Adoption, his Members by Spiritual, mystical, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural union. Witness his own Oracle, and declarative, rather than necessary Petition;<note place="margin">John 17.22.</note> 
                     <hi>The glory which thou gavest me, I have given them.</hi> Blessed Lord, what a word is this? What a communication? my minde is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunced, and my weak Meditations swell, even to an Impossibility of expression. Can I not now know my Soul in her humiliation, in the weakness of a Creature?
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59395:79"/>
How can I then describe and conceive of her in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, in the glory of her Creator? Let this be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for me to believe hence, that that glory with which she shall be filled, according to her Spiritual Nature, is for quality infinitely excellent, because Gods, yet allayed, and fitted to be received for quantity, finite, and limited as in her. Not as divided from the Divine Fountain, but by vertue of Inhabitation, in a gracious, real, and insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable union, communicated to, and made hers, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Saviours Prayer, <hi>That we all may be one, as the Father is in the Son,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 17.21.</note> 
                     <hi>and the Son in the Father; that we may be one in them</hi>;<note place="margin">John 17.26.</note> as also, <hi>that the love wherewith the Father hath loved the Son, may be in us, and he in us.</hi> Thus then the Souls of the Saints before the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and both Souls and Bodies after the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to their several measures of grace here, shall then have their divine plenitudes of Glory; every Vessel being filled, that is, thrown into that Ocean of Life and Glory. Further, as a Wedge of Iron cast into the Forge, is, as it were converted into Fire, and the body, and substance of the Sun, is, as it were hid, and changed into the light, that possesses it: so shall the Soul and Body, as being in God, and God in it, be absorpt, and as it were transmuted into his Glory. Thus much concerning the Souls <hi>external</hi> glory. The <hi>internal,</hi> if it be possible, is yet a Sphere in altitude above this, as bringing the Soul neerer, to the assimilation, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and fruition of God. The understanding, will, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and affections, in the Soul, being as it were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses (to speak improperly, and according to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Men) of the like infinite essentials in God.</p>

Which shall not then be acquired, and gathered, as now, by a Retrogradation, from the effect to the cause; but then primarily, by immediate Vision, and mutual possession of God, the cause of causes.

This being no thraldome, but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfection of the will, to will nothing, but what is good. The understanding, which is the Leader, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliner, as a Spring in a Watch, the internal mover of the will, being not left to it self, and created sufficiency, as in <hi>Adam,</hi> but by an irrevocable, mercifull, natural, and

therefore necessary consequence, and decree, in Christ, is doubly confirmed; First <hi>positively,</hi> as being for ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and filled with a height of wisdome, truth, and goodness, flowing from the perpetual mystical union,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and co-habitation of Christs Spirit: Secondly, <hi>privatively,</hi> as being in such a state of perfection, glory, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as admits not of any temptation, or inclination, to mislead the one, and thereby to defile the other. From this ground also springs the Eternal station in goodness, and consequently in blessedness, of all other the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Soul. Which like so many Stones in an Arch, are unmoveable, because every Stone is unmoveable; Jesus Christ being the Head-Stone, upon whom the whole Building depending, becomes immutable.</p>

comprehend it, but to be comprehended of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing finite can be adequal, or proportionable, to thy extension.

In this life, by reason of seeming absence, clowdings, and intermissions, our loves are violent, yet pleasing pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. But in the other (that day of our Nuptials) they shall be swallowed up in excelling fruitions. Then shall we affect, and enjoy in one, the all of goodness, and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.

So that the then glorified sences, the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and ports of the affections, (though inconceivably enlarged) shall then continually receive in, even, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing, spiritual, and ravishing object of love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.

And as our Saviour is said to increase more, and more, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; yet from his conception full, according to his organical reception; so the glorified Saints, like the Angels, on <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ladder, according to their several degrees, shall mount, and continually encrease and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend

So then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of more, shall never torture us, because ever full; nor satiety cloy us, because our joyes shall be ever new, and encreasing. The grounds of this Coelestial and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal growth of happiness, excellency, and glory, arises both from Gods Word, and Nature.

This being a blessedness both to Angels, and Men, that the Wings of Cherubins and Seraphins, though, they are without labour, and wearisomness, and with delight, ascending; yet, they can never out-soar the infinite heights of the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and incomprehensible fulness.</p>

both now, and then, shall exclude all servile, and slavish fear, but not our filial Espousal, and Reverential fear; which if found in our sinless Mediator, who <hi>was heard, in that he feared</hi>;<note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.

Psal. 72.5.</note> who if commanded to <hi>fear God for ever, and as long as the Sun and Moon endureth,</hi> shall doubtless thus fear him everlastingly, and in Heaven, as well as here upon Earth. For as love without this fear would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous; so fear without love, would be painfull, and discouraging. But both together, are to the sanctified Soul, as Ballast to a Ship, to keep it steady, and doth grandize, elevate, and enlarge each affection, from the awfull apprehensions, and adoration, of so super-excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling an object, of infinite glory, as is the Trinity in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> God blessed for ever.</p>
                  <p>Further, if this saving grace, and sanctified affection of holy fear,<note place="margin">Prov. 9.10.</note> is by <hi>Solomon</hi> commended to us as the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi>

                     </note> when it arises, there is day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when it sets, an uncomfortable night. Man in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, enjoyed a polar day, a continued presence thereof; but having lost God its cause, and object, the effect cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; not that the Soul is disrob'd of the affection, but of the true use of it: hence the distinction of a spiritual, and carnal joy. The first is the true, only found, and beginning afresh to bud, in the renewed Saints and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites of God, (for a stranger shall not intermeddle with their joy) but the other is momentary, and illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate; as being begotten in the Soul, by false objects; and is as it were the Moon-light of the wicked. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject then of true joy is God, and that in this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he is inclusively and exclusively the compleat happiness of the Creature. Whereby it comes to pass that the godly, and reprobate, may both rejoyce in the same things, as Wifes, Children, Honours, Estates, &amp;c. And yet the joy of the one, be holy, and spiritual; of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, carnal and wicked. Leaving then the sensual mirth, which is deceivable, sinfull, and temporary, my thoughts pitch upon the Solace of the Elect, which the Scripture stiles the joy of the Holy Ghost, <hi>unspeakable,</hi> and <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> the first-fruits,<note place="margin">Ezek. 9.3. 1 Pet. 1.8.</note> and earnest of their future happiness.

of that full light you shall there enjoy. Which if unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able here, shall surely be there unconceivable. Alas, what can I then think, and meditate of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chiefly negatively thus, that there shall be no cloudings, nor intermissions there, no measure of our joy; for we shall continually behold God, and in him see all the grounds of rejoycing. If here excesses have proved mortal, their exceedings shall make us more immortal; this being an increasing, and reviving, not a surfeiting fulness. The capacity of the affection being gradually and continually augmented according to the plentifull infusion; our joyes multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, even to Eternity. The growth of our graces here, although God be seen of us, through the cleft of the Rock, as to <hi>Moses,</hi> teaching, discovering, and evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; a continued and far greater augmentation in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereafter. O blessed and happy estate, which is not diminished by Eternity: but is as unlimitable, as lasting. O happy place wherein all joyes meet their objects in one Centre. There shall we possess, and enjoy, not <hi>gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatim,</hi> but according to the fulness of each Vessel, God our gracious Father, Christ our mercifull Saviour, the Holy Spirit our everlasting Comforter, the glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Arch-Angels, our fellow-Servants, the Holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs and Prophets, our Tryumphant Leaders, the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Apostles and valiant Martyrs our victorious Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; together with the many millions successively of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Professors. There shall we meet and rejoyce in the like felicity of all our vertuous Parents, Brothers, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Wifes, Children, Kindred and Friends. There shall we inherit unvaluable and incorruptible riches; Be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall'd in Thrones of unchangeable and incorruptible ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; and be filled with all unspeakable and Soul-ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delights. To conclude, whatsoever things either in conception, or possibility, can affect, or rejoice the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Soul, are there; not interchangeably, but contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarily, and continuedly obvious, and present. And on the contrary, all things whatsoever that may lessen, or offend in the least degree this divine extasie, have an impossibility of subsistence in this Eternal Paradise. And that not only in regard of the presence, but of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree

of God himself. Therefore needs must this joy be ineffably compleat,<note place="margin">Rev. 21.4.</note> to which all things concur for its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. O Divine condition, which shall thus sweetly impe, and restore these mouldring and broken Wings of my Soul.

O how melodious will the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of these Strings be, when mounted to the highest Key, not to Ela, but to Eli!

It being a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and consequent Truth, that the great God will more declare his excellency in his living members, then in his inanimate works, in his adopted Sons, than in his inferiour Creatures, and Mansions. If an humble heart,<note place="margin">Esay 66.2.</note> contrite for Sin, be now Gods dwelling, shall not a sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied heart purified from Sin, become then his Throne of Majesty. Our Bodies which now Imprison and Eclipse the Soul's lustre, shall then not only be coagile, but like a Chrystaline Lanthorn transparent, and coruscant, not hiding, but by a radiant concomitancy, augmenting the others splendour. For as in the Sun there is the contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the contained, the sphear and the light, yet both conspire, and meet in a heighth of brightness; or as in sounds, strings apart musical, being struck together, produce a harmony; so though the Body, and Soul are two distinct excellencies, yet being united they shall mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually conveigh and reflect their beauty, conducing to and effecting a joynt perfection of Glory.

the admirable secrets and excellent curiosities of the humanity: Then not only our understanding but our Eyes, and other bodily sences shall coadjute to make each Saint a most exact Anatomist, a most divine Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher. O let not then that better covetousness of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular knowledge, make us bankrupts in spirituals; Let not imprudent pursuits after the shadow, make us over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run the substance. Being confident of this, that a true Christians life, shall not prove then as it is now by the World accounted of, a devourer of time, folly, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but a Tree of Life in the midst of Eternity. Yea, a Tree of Knowledge, whose fruits shall be fully ripe in Heaven. Perplex not thy self then, vain Sophister, in those scholasticals, and endless labyrinths; I mean those difficult, and so much controverted Questions, whether the Soul be <hi>ex traduce,</hi> or immediately from God? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be confined to a Throne, or <hi>Tota in toto, &amp; tota in qualibet parte?</hi> Whether there be three distinct Souls in Man, or only the rational?

Rather, O wandering Disputant, let thy chief study, be to resolve these questions thus, that in our Saviours sense, thou art born of God; that thou art wholly holy in every part, both of Soul and Body; that he the incomprehensible, three in one, is Soul of thy Soul, and sees, hears, tasts, smells and touches, in thy chast looks, devout attentions, spiritual relishes, faithfull imbracements, and in the sweet savour of a pious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. That thy holy love, the blood of action, and the life of practise, is circular, and endless, having God to be its Centre, that from him it may receive daily, new Spirits, and new fervour. That thy Prayers, which the learned, call Gods perfume, his incense, do not only revive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the powerfull attraction of saving grace feed thee to Eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Such thoughts as these O Man, if practical, shall make thee transcend the natural, and become a divine Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher:

These exercises, which are the study of Angels, and the liberal Arts of Heavens Academy, end in the perfection of knowledge. But to proceed, O my Soul, thou now groanest under a Body of Lead, made up of corrupted flesh, and stuft full with noisome humours, either so fat, as it sweats under its own burthen; or so lean, and weak, that it needs wooden supports. In its motion, is so Worm-like, that its contemptible, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the pace of most four-footed Creatures.

These Locomotive Mussels, if at all useful shall then only serve for the graver measures of Glory: for our Bodies shall, as the Apostle speaks, be made like unto Christs glorious body, not only in its splendour, but in its voluntary motion, and other glorified qualities. Now as he ascended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so (said the Angels) shall he des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend; not step, by step, but as it is most like, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable celerity; else could not the first Century, have confessed him to be at the right hand of his Father, in the highest Heavens a hundred of years, not being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient according to Astronomical discoveries, to have ascended so many millions of miles. Nor could the Saints, after the Judgment past, under the expence of many years, attain those Heavenly Mansions. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Soul being now to re-enter, reassume, and to be reunited to its own body, chearfully takes possession, and findes it raised, filled and prepared by the Almighty Power of the Creator, for its habitation. Not as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, a Prison, hindring and streightning its faculties, and their enlarged operations, by reason of Organical deficiencies; but made in every part, member, and sence, capacious and proportionate to its utmost activity.

                     <hi>Hosea</hi> the thirteenth, Vers. the fourteenth, <hi>Death is swallowed up in Victory.</hi> From the preceding Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is evidently proved, that the glorification of our bodies shall principally consist; First, in being raised <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> and heavenly bodies; Secondly, in being made <hi>shining</hi> and glorious; Thirdly, in their being <hi>incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,</hi> and immortal; of all which more particularly, and first of their spirituality, and heavenliness.</p>
                  <p>Our present bodies, although they are compounded of the four Elements, yet are made up in an unequal mixture, the proportion being much less of Water, than of Earth, and much less of Ayre, than of Water, and of Fire, than of Ayre. Therefore our Bodies have the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from Earth, and not from any of the rest, and are called in the foregoing Text,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.34.</note> 
                     <hi>Earthly Bodies.</hi> And much different in their mixture from the Bodies of Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Fowles, Meateors. This also our natural motion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares. For being placed in any one of the three other Elements, and left at liberty, by reason of our Earthly ponderousness, we violently move towards the Centre of the Earth, of which we were form'd, and upon which is our habitation.<note place="margin">1 Thes. 4.17.</note> But our state, place, and condition being to be changed, at the resurrection of the just, our bodies (that shall be a live at the Lords second coming) shall be changed.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.51. Job 19.26, 27.</note> And though the same bodies for matter,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59395:89"/>
and substance, (as saith holy <hi>Job</hi>) shall be raised, yet much differing from what they were before, as to their mixture, and qualities. And therefore are said to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Spiritual, and Heavenly Bodies.</hi> A further proof whereof the Holy Spirit gives us in that Text, wherein he saith the Lord Jesus Christ shall change our vile Body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious Body,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.21.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the working, whereby he is able even to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things unto himself. The same witnesses the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Apostle, in that his blessed gradation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, of our present,<note place="margin">1 John 3.2.</note> and future more glorious condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Beloved, now we are the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; But we know, that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</hi> Whence note, this Apostle, or the rest, did not, yea could not, with their then bodily eyes, behold him, as he was then risen from the dead, he vailing his glory in condescention to their present state.</p>
                  <p>A second Heavenly, and Spiritual quality of the Saints glorified Bodies, is a swift and speedy local motion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied of (as many interpret that place) in the Prophet <hi>Isay, They that wait upon the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isaiah 40.31.</note> 
                     <hi>shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with Wings as Eagles, they shall run, and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint.</hi> Which I cannot better manifest to our weak ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, than by comparing it to a flash of lightning; which in an instant, passeth from the East, to West, and from one Port of the vast Canopy of Heaven, to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This quality, also, was manifested to be in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours glorified Body upon Earth, (like to which we shall be raised) by his swift passage from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.5, 6, 7, 8.</note> (being many score miles) to a Mountain in <hi>Galilee,</hi> when he was seen of five hundred Brethren at once. And from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to the Sea of <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 21.1.</note> when he did eat with <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest, after the great draught of Fishes. And from thence to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> again,<note place="margin">Acts 1.9, 12.</note> at his Ascention from Mount <hi>Olivet</hi>; And which is also most demonstrable, by his discent from Heaven to the Aire, when he spoke to,<note place="margin">Acts 9.5.</note> and was seen of <hi>Paul</hi> in the way to <hi>Damascus</hi>; which, without doubt, was a personal, not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59395:90"/>
a visional appearance; since the Apostle adds, that to his other personal appearances,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.8.</note> saying, last of all, he was seen of me; which had not it been real, had been but a slender proof of our Saviours Resurrection. To which end,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.30.</note> he there vouches it. As our Souls are now like the Angels, yea, Angels in the Flesh, so then, our Bodies, as to this Spiritual quality, shall be raised, like our Souls. That so their future union may be lasting, and compleat, and this Marriage may continue, and be indissolveable. In which respect the Apostle saith, they shall be raised not only spiritual,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.50.</note> but heavenly bodies, as fitted to dwell in that place;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.2.</note> which for the matter Philosophers call a Quint-essence, far more refined, than any, or all the four Elements;<note place="margin">Psal. 68.33.</note> and which the Scripture calls the Heaven of Heavens,<note place="margin">Col. 1.12.</note> and the Inheritance of the Saints in light.</p>
                  <p>O my Soul, shall thy Body at that great change, and resurrection of the just,<note place="margin">

Have a high value, and esteem of it, and make not this Vessel of honour, by sinning, a Vessel of dishonour, the Members of Christ, the Members of a Harlot; the Image of God and Christ, the Image of Sathan; the Temple of the Holy Ghost, a Stie, yea, a Hell of unclean lusts. But labour as much to be like Christ in holiness, and righteousness, as thou hopest, and desirest, to be like him, in glory. Let thy Members be spiritualized, and heavenized, and made Members of holiness unto righteousness.<note place="margin">Col. 3.3, 4.</note> And let thy conversation be in Heaven, where thy habitation shall be.

In summe, the whole Body is a Cage of unclean lusts, and the wicked Instruments of all ungodliness, and unrighteousness. O mercifull Creator, this is our sinfull condition by nature. But thou hast promised to change these vile bodies, and to make them glorious bodies, like the body of our Lord.

This is illustrated, and proved from Scripture, which witnesses,<note place="margin">Revel. 20.13.</note> that at the Resurrection, <hi>The Sea gave up her Dead</hi>; that is, that part of the substance of the Bodies that were in it; <hi>and Death and Hell</hi> (that is, the Earth, or Grave) <hi>delivered up the Dead that were in them.</hi> Further, this must be granted, as an undeniable maxime, that as none but God, our Almighty Creator, can make something of nothing; so none but he can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate any Creature, or any Atom of a Creature, so as to make that something nothing. If this be a certain truth, (as assuredly it is;) and that the Lord hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in his Word, that the same Bodies in which the Soul lived here upon Earth, shall again appear, and be raised at the Resurrection, (as inspired <hi>Job</hi> attests) <hi>say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I know that my Redeemer lives, and that I shall stand at the latter Day upon Earth,</hi>

Whence shall proceed that admirable change, as to their qualities, (although not of their substance) deserving the name, in the Scripture promise, of a <hi>new Heaven,</hi> and of a <hi>new Earth</hi>; As it is most excellently set forth by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in these words;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.19,</note> 
                     <hi>For the earnest expectation of the Creature, wait for the manifestation of the Sons of God. For the Creature was made subject to vanity,</hi>

                     <hi>not willingly, but by reason of him, who hath subjected the same in hope; Because the Creature it self also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption,</hi>

                     <hi>into the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty of the Children of God. For we know that the whole Creation groaneth,</hi>

                     <hi>and travelleth in pain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, untill now.</hi> The Elements then, are made like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Heavenly supream Orbes; pure, lucid, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible. Hence I infer, that these four Elements being thus wonderfully changed in their qualities, and made incorruptible; in which, respectively, the several parts, and ingredients of our Bodies are laid up, and reserved, as being naturally a part of them; There must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow, the same and the like change, and alteration, in the matter and substance of our Bodies also. Whence it will follow, that although the first change, in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is supernatural, and wonderfull; that, in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies will naturally follow, as an effect from that cause. Our great God, as in the first Creation, caused the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of all things, out of their first matter, as so many streams from that Fountain; so in this new, and second birth of things, he as a rational, and natural Agent, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth this excellent change in the fore-mentioned qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of our new-raised Bodies, to be a necessary, and certain effect, flowing from the change of the principles, out of which they are compounded. It being more than probable, that the Resurrection of our Bodies, shall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly succeed, the making of the new Heaven, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59395:94"/>
the new Earth, the Saints habitation; as it was in the first Creation; when the Lord made the Earth, and all the Creatures, first, before he made Man, the Lord, and Possessor of it,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note> and them.</p>
                  <p>The premisses being granted; I thence conclude, that as Mortality, is a necessary effect, and consequent, of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, so the immortality of the Body (to use the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles phrase) is as necessary an effect, and consequent, of incorruption. For that substance that can never more be corrupted, may truly be said to be everlasting, and according to the Apostles expression, immortal: Death signifying, either in sensible, or vegitable Creatures, a putred and evil change, or alteration; as also a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basing, diminishing, and deforming separation; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the curse, and fruit of Sin, and abhorrent to nature.</p>
                  <p>Having hitherto discoursed of this marvellous change of our Bodies at the Resurrection, and given some natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reasons thereof, as a Philosopher; I must now as a Christian, ascend higher, and prove this eminent change, to proceed also from a far higher and nobler cause, than meer nature; even from the spiritual, real, and mystical union, of our Persons, through faith, and the Eternal Spirit, as Members to our Head the Lord Jesus, who is God-Man, blessed for ever.</p>
                  <p>As since sin, God hath enacted this to be one of the Statutes of Nature, <hi>It is appointed to Men once to dye</hi>; And by another Law of Nature, after Death, hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved this Microcosme of Soul from Body; Every part of the body (as hath been shewed) returns to its proper Element:<note place="margin">John 1.14.</note> so by the Law of Christ, God-Man, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word, that was made Flesh, it is decreed and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,<note place="margin">John 6.47.</note> as an indubitable truth, <hi>That he that believeth in him hath everlasting life.</hi> And <hi>though he were dead, yet shall he live.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 11.25.</note> 
                     <hi>Whosoever liveth and believeth in him, shall never dye.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 11.26.</note> From hence it is most cleer, that in a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual sence, the death of the Saints, is no death; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so united by faith, that although the Soul be divided from the Body, and each Elementary part of the body, be divided from the other; yet neither Soul nor Body, or any grain,<note place="margin">John 14.6.</note> or part thereof, can be separated from our
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59395:94"/>
head the Lord Jesus, in whom (who is eternal life) is our life. Though we are dead in a natural sence,<note place="margin">Colos. 3.3.</note> yet we live spiritually in and by his Spirit. In which sence also the whole mystical body of Christ, the universal Church, and every Member thereof, is said to be <hi>joyned to the Lord, and is one Spirit</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.17.</note> as being by the Holy Ghost (the ever-living God, that fills all things, the Spirit of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Son) as by an unmeasurable,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13.</note> and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ligament, tyed, and united to the Lord Jesus, our head. So that, like as it is said of the Soul, That it is <hi>tota, in toto, &amp; tota in qualibet parte:</hi> So it may be said, that the for ever blessed Spirit of God the Father and the Son, in and by this ineffable union, and in dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is wholly and spiritually, both before and after death, in our Souls, and in our Bodies, and in every part of them, although never so far (by reason of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural death) separated one from another. Here note, that although the Scripture declares, that in God all things live, move, and have their being, as he is their Creator, and Preserver, and in whom,<note place="margin">Acts 17.28.</note> and by whom they act, and have their subsistance, yet the difference is very great, betwixt that life of the Creatures on Earth, and this life of the Saints, both as to the nature, and durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. That flowing from his Almighty power, and goodness, as a Creator; this from his Eternal love, as our Father in Christ; that life, being temporary; this life Eternal; as flowing from the highest Principle, our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and real union unto God in Christ. For the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clearing, and proof of which immortality, as well of our Bodies, as of our Souls, consider the words of our blessed Saviour, <hi>As the Father hath life in himself,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 5.26.</note>

                     <hi>By one Spirit we are Baptized into one Body, whether we be Jew, or Gentile, whether we be bond, or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. He that is joyned unto the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.17.</note> 
                     <hi>is one Spirit.</hi> By these bright Scripture-lights is evidently discovered, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested to us; that as the head in the natural body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the animal spirit, and conveyeth, and gives anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the Members of the Body; so the Lord Christ God-Man in one Person, is the head of his Spiritual, and mystical Body, the Universal Church; and that from him alone, not only that spiritual life consisting in holiness, and righteousness; but also that eternal, and immortal life, in which, both in Soul, and Body, we shall live in him, and with him at the Resurrection for ever, and for ever, is given and communicated into every Member of his body, the Church united to him, in this life, by a true faith, and by the animation and in-dwelling of the Holy Ghost; who is the life and spirit of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of God the Son. Therefore in these, and other Scriptures, God the Father is sometimes called our life; other-times, Christ and the Holy Ghost is said to be our life; thereby evidencing, that this eternal life of the Saints, hath its <hi>immediate</hi> rise, and Original from the Trinity in Unity, God blessed for ever. Not by partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Essence of the God-head, but by the real, and spiritual union, of their Persons, as Members of Christs mystical Body, unto the Person of Christ; through faith, and the inhabitation and vivification of the Holy Ghost. The first of which (<hi>viz.</hi> Faith) shall cease, and be swallowed up (after death) in fruition. But the other shall continue to Eternity.</p>
                  <p>From what I have here offered, although in great weakness, (for who is sufficient for these things?) I hope it is abundantly cleared, that the eternal life of the Saints, and the glorious incorruptability, and immortality of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59395:95"/>
their Bodies, flowes from a far higher Principle, or cause, than from only meer nature, made new, refined, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptable. And that though the Elements through their incorruptability, are become Eviternal, like the Superior Orbes; and are in a natural possibility (if God please) so to continue, without change, or alteration, Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; yet in all this, they fall far short of the Eternal duration, of the glorified Souls and bodies of the Saints; which have not only a perpetuity, arising from the refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and incorruptible nature, but an Eternity, flowing from the spiritual, real, and inseparable union of their Persons through faith, and the Holy Ghost, to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Lord Jesus Christ God-man, as Members uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Head. In which respect, besides the declared positive, and unchangeable decree, and promises of God, (who cannot lye) as these Scriptures witness amongst many others formerly mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, should not perish, but have eternal life. Who so eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood, hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, and I will raise him up at the last Day.</hi> The Saints I say are placed and fixed in such a blessed and certain state and condition, as living spiritually in God,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.54.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 14.19, 20.</note> and God in them, as hath been proved, that it is as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for God, who is Eternal Life, to perish and dye,<note place="margin">Joh. 17.22, 23.</note> as for any of his Saints to dye or perish,<note place="margin">John 6.56.</note> that live by and in his life; according to that unanswerable Argument of our Lord and Saviour.<note place="margin">John 6.57.</note> 
                     <hi>As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me; Because I live, yee shall live also.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 14.19.</note> To conclude, I humbly conceive that this Eternal Life of the Saints, as to the reason and nature thereof, far transcends the Eternal Life of the glorious Angels, in that as far as is revealed in Scripture, their life was given them by an act of Gods goodness, will and power in their first Creation, and is preserved, continued and confirmed, to the Elect Angels, by an act of his grace. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, those of them that kept not their first state,<note place="margin">Jude 6.</note> are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever separated from God, (who is life) and swallowed up into Eternal Death; whereas the life, even to the Saints,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59395:96"/>
proceeding from Gods spiritual inhabitation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, with them, is undeterminable, unchangeable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable; and is therefore Eternal.</p>
                  <p>O my Soul, shall this thy impure, mortal body, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the making of a new Heaven,<note place="margin">

                     </note> and a new Earth; the refining of the four Elements, of which it was formed, and out of which it shall again be raised, and reassumed, appear at the Resurrection of the just, as having its substance purified, and made incorruptible? Therefore according to the Scripture-phrase, immortal, and everlasting, like as are the bright and superior Orbs? Yea, which is much more wonderfull; shall this incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptability, everlastingness, and immortality of thy soul, and body, be unchangeable, and eternal, because thy Person is spiritually, and really united, by the indwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghost, unto the Person of Christ thy Head, and unto God in Christ, who is Eternal Life? yea lastly, doth this life excell and transcend, as in respect of the cause, and nature of it, the life and being of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, even of the ever blessed Angels, as being built, not only as theirs is, upon the Basis of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power, and goodness, which gives a beeing to all things, but is establisht upon his declared promise, and eternal truth; and hath its unalterable duration from our dwelling,<note place="margin">1 John 1.3.</note> and living in God, and he in us, and from that inseparable fellowship, we have with the Father, and the Son, in the communion of the Holy Ghost?</p>
                  <p>O my Soul, are these things true? Have they been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnst to thee out of the Scripture of truth? O how oughtest thou in all humility, and enlarged thankfulness, to prostrate thy self at the foot-stool of thy infinite, good, gracious, and mercifull God, and Father, in the Lord Jesus Christ, admiring, and adoring him; First, for the Revelation, and manifestation by his Word, and holy Spirit, of so high, ravishing, and stupendious a mystery, the wonder, and praise of glorified Saints, and Angels, and the miracle of divine love.<note place="margin">Psal. 42.7.</note> Next, let, (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaks) one deep, call unto another, and from the sight of the bottomless Pit of Hell, Death, and Sin (out of which eternal love in Christ, free grace, and infinite

From which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, I have reason to think, should Man have had a thought, or design, of, or by himself, to be possest of so glorious a life, prerogative, state, and condition, as our gracious God hath freely given us in Christ; It had been so high, and unwarrantable a sin, and ambition, as would have justly deserved as great a curse and punishment. O from this experience of infinite love,<note place="margin">1 John 4.16.</note> (for God is love) pray incessantly in return thereof, not only to be enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and raised to the highest, and greatest love, and thankfulness, that a Creature can be made capable of; But that thou mayest hence-forth have no will, but his, (which shall be thy great wisdome) in all things, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all thou hast, and thy whole Man, solely to his most gracious, and All-wise dispose: whose free gifts, bounty, and unconceivable liberality, are not such, as Creatures bestow on their favourites; but such as becomes the Majesty and immensness of a God, who gives to his Saints, benefits and blessings temporal, spiritual and eternal; not only above their prayers, hopes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but as the Apostle expresses,<note place="margin">Ephes. 3.20.</note> above what we can either <hi>ask or think.</hi>

                        <hi>Of the sences glorified.</hi>
                     </note>Having exercised my faith, and contemplation, upon this ravishing, and pleasing subject, the glorification of the Bodies, and Members of the Saints, in general, and in the Gross; I shall now lastly proceed, beseeching the assistance of his most Holy Spirit,<note place="margin">John 1.4.9.</note> who is my light, the light of Men, and he who alone enlighteneth every one that cometh into the World, to speak particularly, though with much brevity, of the glorification of the Five Sences. I shall go so far, as I shall receive light from the Scriptures, and right reason; taking that sober, and lawfull liberty, (that is granted to all those that have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated upon the like subjects; where some things are more obscure than others, and not so clearly, and fully held forth in Gods Word) humbly to offer, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59395:99"/>
and rationally (although not positively) may be the truth, as not repugnant to Scripture, right reason, or the Analogie of Faith. As an Introduction and substraction to what followes, I shall premise; First,<note place="margin">Job. 19.25, 26, 27.</note> according to Scripture, as hath been shewed, <hi>Job<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> chap. 19.25. That the <hi>same Bodies shall be raised, that the Saints lived in here upon Earth; as to their substance.</hi> If so, then the same parts, members, and senses, shall then be raised, and have a being also, of which the Body consists, and without which the Body is imperfect, and incompleat, and cannot be truly said to be the same Body. Secondly, that if necessarily, and certainly, they shall then have an existence in the Body, then without doubt, they must be for some most noble use, and end. For this is both a Scriptural and Natural Maxime; That <hi>God, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, made nothing in vain.</hi> Yea, the Scripture is cleer, and express, as to the glorious employment of some of them, in this Heavenly life; as of our <hi>Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Eares,</hi> as shall be shewed hereafter. What reason then is there that we should exclude the exercise of the other? Thirdly, it is cleer and manifest, that the glorified Soul, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain united to the glorified Body, shall not then act sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by it self, but organically, as now it doth, in, and with the Body, as having its seat and operation, as to the understanding, will, and memorative faculties, in the head, and brain; and as to the concupiscential appetite, and affections in the heart; and as to its external Instrument of expression, and manifesting it self, and mind, to God, Men, and Angels, in praises, or otherwise, it shall be with the Tongue, as is proved by the discourse betwixt our Saviour, and <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>;<note place="margin">Math. 17.3:</note> and from many places in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and other Scriptures. So also the Soul, shall make use of the Feet to walk with,<note place="margin">Acts 1.3.</note> although the whole Body, as hath been shewed,<note place="margin">Acts 9.4.</note> like the Wheels in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Vision, shall swiftly descend, or ascend,<note place="margin">Revel. 4.10.5.11. Ezek. 1.20.</note> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will, and motion of the Spirit, or Soul within them. I say then, its now most truly, as properly said, that not the Body, but our Souls in our Bodies, see, hear, tast, feel, and smell. Can it be rationally believed, that the body that shall be raised in perfection, shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59395:100"/>
of either the being, or use of any one of its sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses? that the Soul should, in respect of the want of them, be less perfect in glory, than it was in its state of misery? yea, be deprived of those actings or senses by its re-union, to the body, which it made use of in glory, before its re-entry into the body? Angels, and therefore Souls, after their manner, have their seeing, hearing, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, smelling, and tasting, when they took bodies, and eat with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 18.8.</note> Which senses they make use of at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times also, (for ought we know, or are taught in Gods Word to the contrary; The Scripture-allusion, when it calls the <hi>Israelites</hi> Manna,<note place="margin">Psal. 78.25.</note> 
                     <hi>Angels food,</hi> making more for it, than against it; as also when it saith, that some things, (as wise Observers know) yea many things on Earth,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.23.</note> are figures and patterns of things above in the Heavens) from all which, I conclude, that should not the Soul, re-united to the body, have organically the use of all the senses, it would be in that respect, not so perfect in the glorified body, as when it was in the corruptible body; and streightned and deprived of so much of its freedome, excellency, and activity, as it had, and doth without doubt exercise, as to most of the senses in the state of Glory, before its re-union. Fourthly, if at the Resurrection of the just, the glorified Saints shall then enter into the joy of their Lord,<note place="margin">Math. 25.21.</note> and into their first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Glory, and shall Raign as Kings and Priests, with our Lord Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Rev. 5.10.</note> personally, upon the renewed Earth,<note place="margin">Rev. 20.4. 2 Pet. 3.13.</note> which he will then create, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: And if it be more than probable, that the old fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture being all consumed, the face, and superficies of the Earth, and Rivers (for there shall be no Sea) shall be beautified,<note place="margin">Rev. 21.1.</note> and adorned anew, with such several kinds, of vegetative, and sensitive Creatures, as shall be for the delight, and benefit of the glorified Saints; All which Creatures shall be new made, and produced, as they were in the first Creation, out of the several refined, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Elements; that so they may have a possibility, if God please,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.20, 21, 22.</note> like them, to be everlasting; and <hi>be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the curse, vanity, and bondage of Corruption</hi> (that the first <hi>Adams</hi> sin had, though unwillingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59395:100"/>
them to) <hi>into the glorious liberty of the Children of God,</hi> by the second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord Jesus Christ, the restorer of all things, lost by the first, unto their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, though far better condition: And if so; shall the great glory, goodness, wisdome, and other excellencies of Christ declared, and held forth, in the sweet-smelling Aire, and in the odoriferous, and most rare perfumes, breathed forth (as being an Elixa compared with what they were) from Spice, and fruit-bearing Trees, Plants, and Flowers, be clouded, and as it were lost, for want of the sense of smelling, to conveigh them to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that so it, and the whole Man, may therefore, and in these his wondrous works, praise, adore, admire, and worship God? especially, since at this time, this so greatly heightned, and meliorated Book of Nature shall be a glorious, if not (the Scriptures being now fulfilled) the only Book of God. Again,<note place="margin">Mark 14.25.</note> shall the <hi>new Wine</hi> spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by our blessed Saviour, in the Kingdome of God, and the promise of <hi>eating and drinking with him at his Table in his Kingdome</hi>; The <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> the sweet Springs, Chrystal Rivers, and <hi>Waters of Life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 22.30. Rev. 22.1, 2.</note> or <hi>living Waters,</hi> (for so Springs are called) spoken of and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, in the 22. of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and in many other Scriptures (wherein I exclude not high and mysterious Allegories also to be held forth;) I say, shall these be in vain, and signify nothing? Shall also all those most mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifluous Roots, Fruits, and Plants, that in this blessed, and new-birth of things, shall be delivered from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore shall not as now they do, defile the body, and turn into putrifaction, nor leave, after all the Concoctions of Nature, a remainder of stinking dregs, which since Sin, Nature, by an instinct of self-preservation is forced to expulse and exonerate it self off; shall they I say want this pleasing and distinguishing sense of tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to glorify all the attributes and wonderfull name of God, in the use, benefit and enjoyment of them? If the delight and use of this, and all other of the senses now, is not only lawfull, but commanded; and the Saints may, and do greatly glorify God in the fruition of them; And these deligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> are only in a Scripture-sence become
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59395:101"/>
sinfull, and sensual, to the wicked, whose sin, and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of corruption, adulterates, defiles, and turns the use and exercise of the senses, upon their several objects, or subjects into sin; shall they not be much more usefull, and necessary to the Saints glorified, in their sinless con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; when the whole Soul, Body, Members, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, shall all co-operate in their several functions and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, to Gods great glory, and their own? Further, it is not improbable, that although the Root, Fountain, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and Eternity of the Saints life, flowes prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, from their spiritual union and communion with God in Christ; yet as a medium, or a secondary, and natural means (for our God is <hi>Natura Naturans</hi>) this way as it was,<note place="margin">Genes. 1.29.</note> and should have been made use of in Paradise, may be still continued to nourish, delight, and be subservient (as the Rain is to the Plants, although the Earth is their great Mother) to Eternal Life in the Saints. And such no doubt, was the Tree of Life (not excluding it to be of a Sacramental nature also) to our first Parents, before their Fall. All which is evident, from the reason God gives, of their speedy exclusion, from their continuance, or return into Paradise to eat thereof,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.22, 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Lest they should eat thereof, and live for ever.</hi> Now that Paradise was a Figure, and Pattern, none I conceive will deny this of the Saints, unto which the Lord Jesus was sent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store us. Although this is much better and higher, as to the degrees of our happiness, and condition; by how much the second <hi>Adam,</hi> and publick head of the Saints, is much higher, and more excellent than the first <hi>Adam,</hi> or common Head, and Root of Man-kind. Fifthly, if no use of the sense of gust, or tasting; or that in this our glorified state, in the new Heaven, and the new Earth; there shall be no eating, or drinking; For I presume not to give here any judgment, as to the exercise of these two senses of tasting, and smelling, in the highest degree of the Saints Glory, in the Heaven of Heavens, when the Mediatory Kingdome of Christ, shall have an end, and shall be delivered up to God the Father,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.24, 28.</note> that God may be All in All, I having much less light from Scripture, or reason, probably to know, or guess what shall be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59395:101"/>
and object of these senses in those super-excelling, and glorious Regions, than in this new Earth, which is to be renewed and restored to us, by our Lord Jesus the second <hi>Adam:</hi> I say, if the Saints glorified shall not eat, nor drink in that new Heaven and Earth, what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of, or what use shall be made of most of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Members, or parts of the Body? Of which, as to their most excellent frame, great number, and use, skilfull Anatomists, have written large Volumes, to the glory of the wisdome, power, and work of God, in them. Shall the glorified Bodies be like an empty Trunck, void of a stomack, liver, guts, bowels, bladder, and the rest? If so, as it is contrary to the Scripture, which saith, <hi>The same Bodies shall be raised</hi>; which includes all the internal, as well as the external parts of the Body; so what use shall be made of these, of the Teeth, and the rest; if there be no eating, or drinking, nor employment of them, as a natural and secondary means, still ordained of God, for the nourishment and continuation of a healthfull and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual temperament, called by Philosophers <hi>Temperamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ad pondus aequale,</hi> and as for the everlasting Well-being of the Body? Sixthly, It is a Maxime in nature, and made good by experience, that all animate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Creatures on Earth, are nourished and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their being, by feeding upon such things as are compounded of the like Elements, of the which they partake. And is it not more than probable, that the Saints glorified bodies, the time they continue on the renewed Earth, shall as by a natural and middle way, be delighted, nourisht, preserved and continued, as to their Bodies, by drinking the simple and refined Water, and juices of the Vine, and other the then incorruptible fruits (as before in Paradise?) And by eating the super-excelling fruits, Plants,<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>verse</hi> 29. <hi>compared with</hi> Gen. 9. &amp; 3.</note> and Roots (the subject of our Fathers nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood) being a mixture and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, even of the same repurged matter and Elements of which our new-raised and glorified bodies consist, may therefore both in reason and nature, (God according to his former Method, so ordaining it) be most proper and subservient to the end afore-mentioned? Which end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59395:102"/>
finisht, these compounded substances being in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as in a limbeck separated, may by insensible trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, or otherways, revert each part of them again, to its proper Element, and by a circulation (as now) without annihilation, continue and preserve the being of the whole new Heaven, and new Earth, without the least diminution. But it may be objected, that our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour declares, in his answer to the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> that the glorified Saints, shall at the Resurrection, be as, and equal to the Angels;<note place="margin">Math. 22.30.</note> but the Angels neither eat nor drink. To which objection,<note place="margin">Luke 20.36.</note> I give this double answer, that first, he saith not we shall be like, but as, and equal to the Angel: And besides, it is unknown to us, (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) how their life and being is continued and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. We know they live, and believe they shall live ever, and that they are spiritual substances; but what their formes are, whether they can be circumscrib'd, as our Bodies are, or only defined to be in such or such a place, this is discoursed of, but not ascertained. The curious learned, yea, some possibly too curious, have in their writings affirmed, that they have conversed, seen, and spoken with Angels. That they have bodies, although so spiritual, and like the light, that they cannot be seen, but when they please themselves; and that they have a nourishment, conducing to their being, of an etherial na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, connatural and agreeable to their spiritual substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. From all which, I infer, that unless our Saviours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, that we shall be like the Angels; or any other Scripture, had excluded the Angels from eating, or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or receiving any nourishment, by which in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner their substances are refreshed and continued, (for nothing but God subsists of it self, and from its self) the Angels may be nourished as aforesaid. And as for seeing, hearing, and touching, the Scripture testifie the Angels exercise them all; although in a more excellent manner than we do. That expression of our Saviour [<hi>yee shall be like the Angels</hi>] excludes not, nor proves any thing against the eating, or drinking of the glorified Saints, during their abode in the new Heaven, and the new Earth. My second answer is, that this speech
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59395:102"/>
of our blessed Lord, is a proper, full, and positive answer, to the question of the <hi>Sadduces, whose Wife should the Woman be that had seven Husbands, at the Resurrection?</hi> That since the Saints then shall neither marry, nor be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in marriage, but shall in that respect be like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that their invincible Argument (as they conceived it) was void, and proved nothing, against the Doctrine of the Resurrection. Therefore it is to be limited, and restrained, and not to be extended, as to exclude the eating, and drinking of the glorified Saints: which was not at all in the question. For if so, it may be brought as well to prove, that they shall in all things else be like the Angels: which I humbly conceive, no Man will, or hath asserted; since, in many things (were it proper to be treated of upon this subject) I could shew a manifold difference betwixt the Angels, and the glorified Saints. This being sufficient, and a clear and full answer to that objection, I shall now proceed to speak more particularly, although very succinctly, as having in the six foregoing reasons, or preliminaries, spoken more than I intended, and given sufficient satisfaction to my self, and I hope to others, both from Scripture, and reason, as to this Subject.</p>
                  <p>First, as to the sight, or sense of Seeing; the Eye,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Of the sence of seeing glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</hi>
                     </note> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by Oculists, Naturalists, and Anatomists, it is now placed in the first rank of the bodies parts, or members, as a subject wherein the most excellent, and wonderfull wisdome of God is greatly manifested, and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in respect of its curious fabrick, but admirable way, and manner of conveighing, and representing objects, to the Soul, whether <hi>Extra,</hi> or <hi>intra mittendo,</hi> or by both, is not my work now to dispute, or determine; yet then it shall, as to its optick use, and faculty, be much more wonderfully bettered, heighthned, and enlarged; and that, first, as to its objects. Now, the best Eye, cannot immediately behold the Sun shining in its brightness, any time, with fixedness, without twinckling, trouble, and danger of blindness;<note place="margin">Ezek. 1.28. Dan. 8.17, 18.</note> and as though it was asham'd of its weakness, is presently vailed with a tear. Now a <hi>Daniel,</hi> an <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> cannot look upon, or behold an Angel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59395:103"/>
astonishment,<note place="margin">Dan. 8.9.</note> and falling to the ground upon their faces, as being not able to behold their created glory. But after the Resurrection, we shall with these Eyes (as <hi>Job</hi> speaks) not only behold the glorified Saints, that shine as the Sun, and are as so many millions of Suns; but the glorious Angels, and our Redeemer the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,<note place="margin">Malach. 4.2. Revel. 22.4.</note> the brightest <hi>Sun of righteousness</hi>; and shall see God, as he is; yea, we shall see him face to face, and live. This is that everlasting and glorious beatifical Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the for ever blessed Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity, so much spoken of by the ancient Fathers; in which, as in a most bright cleer mirror, the Saints shall behold (their Eyes being herein assistants to their Souls) all things God is pleased to reveal, and so far as a created nature is capable of past, and present, and to come. As also the natures, virtues, and qualities of all the Creatures; not as now, by their effects, but in their cause, Idea, and truth: yea, the high,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.10.</note> and deep things of God.</p>
                  <p>The second excellency of this glorified sense of sight, as to its strength, in respect of objects, that are far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, is, That whereas now our Eyes, without the help of Perspective-Glasses, cannot discern, or clearly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, and inform us of the things upon Earth, some few miles off, and are much inferiour to Eagles, and Vultures; of whom Naturalists report, That when by high flying, they are so lessened, as not to be discerned by our Eyes, yet they can behold a little quarry upon the ground, and their prey, although many miles distant from them: and that now, through the imbecility, and weakness of our sight, in a clear day, we judge the skie to be of an azure colour; whereas truly, it hath no colour, but is only so represented; being only by a vaster distance, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Aire, enlightened by the Sun; and that distance, beyond the extent of our weak Eyes, upon the level of the Earth, seems to be dark or black: But hereafter at the Resurrection, the Eye being the Instrument and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, through, and by which, the Soul beholds all things, shall be so strengthened, that it shall thereby behold, things very far distant. Else it should lose by union
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59395:103"/>
with the body, that excellency of sight, it had as a Spirit before it re-entred into the Body; It being clear, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that the Angels and Spirits excell all other living Creatures, as to the activity and extent of seeing; That evil spirit the Devil, being able to behold,<note place="margin">Math. 4.8.</note> and represent to our blessed Saviour, from the top of a high Mountain, all the Kingdomes of the World (that is of that Hemis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere,<note place="margin">Genes. 21.17.</note> and semi-circle of the Earth) and the glory of them (a most vast view and prospect;) so also the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of God called unto <hi>Hagar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Genes. 22.11.</note> and afterwards to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> out of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>A third admirable excellency of the Eye glorified, is the wonderfull life and beauty of it. Now, it is the chief Ornament, and grace of the Face, in Men, or Women; but then it shall super-excell, what it is now, as much as the Eye of a living Man transcends the Eye of one that is dead. Which life, splendor, and beauty, doth not only proceed from the glorification of the Eye, as apart, and member of the glorified body, but from those spirit-full and sparkling rayes, sent forth from the within glorious Souls: which like the Sun-beams shining through, and upon the purest Chrystal; shall cause the Eye to shine with a most delightfull, and unexpressible radiancy and splendor; much like to that wonderfull and visional appearance of our Head, and sample, the Lord Jesus, to Saint <hi>John,</hi> of whom it is written,<note place="margin">Revel. 1.14.</note> That his <hi>Eyes were as a Flame of Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O my Soul, shall thy sence of seeing,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Soliloquium.</hi>
                     </note> attain to such a height of perfection, as to be able not only to behold glorified Saints, and Angels, but the much more resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent face of thy glorious Saviour, yea, of God himself; shall it be so greatly fortified, as to surveigh like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, things remotely distant; shall thy eyes be so beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and radiant, as to shine and sparkle like the Stars of the first magnitude; O resolve and endeavour by the assistance of Gods free grace, not to vassalage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base them, by beholding Earthly vanities; much less to make use, and imploy them, as the Pandors of Sathan, and the Dung-ports of sinfull lusts, and lasciviousness; like the Men of this World, <hi>Whose Eyes are full of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:59395:104"/>
and uncleanness. But let them, according to the end, for which they were created, be wholly employed, in beholding and admiring the glory of God, in his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull works, held forth in the bright-shining Stars, and Planets, and in the splendor of the Moon, and Sun. Let them be also helpfull Instruments, to conveigh unto thee continual matter of praise, and admiration, as to the wisdome of thy Creator, in the consideration and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, not only as to the excellent, and universal frame of Heaven and Earth, but as to the great variety and beauty of each particular Creature; so shall this their Heavenly and holy exercise prepare thee and them for a greater measure of perfect Glory.</p>

                     </note> so the Eares are the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligencers of the Soul; by which it receives a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of all things, and are very usefull in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable life, wherein sin, ignorance, and all manner of troubles abound; for its reproof, instruction, and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. But this is not only their use, together with that grace, and Ornament, they add to the Head, they being in the rank of the principal Members of the Body; For they are not only the common receipt of all vocal sounds, and so of great profit, and emolument to the Soul; But they are the curious ports, inlets, and artifice of nature, to conveigh unto the Soul, all other sounds; whether they be such as are pleasant, and musical, for the delight thereof; or of such noises as are of use<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to premonish, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59395:105"/>
give warning; or of such sounds also, which are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, terrible, harsh, and unpleasant, and ought to raise a holy fear, reverence, and admiration in the Soul; to wit of God, the cause and Creator of them: Such as are the out cries, and skreeking of Creatures, rational, or unrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal; the hideous bellowings, and terrible roarings of wilde Beasts; the hissing of Serpents, the Cataracts of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the raging of Seas; the blustering of Winds, and Tempests; and the Worlds astonishing and affrighting noise, of all kinds of Artillery, Earth-quakes, and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; besides many other sounds of like nature. Having observed and declared the principal uses and exercise of the sense of Hearing in this life, I shall with the greater clearness hold forth, and distinguish of the much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing use, and far more excellent exercise thereof, after the Resurrection in the glorified body, upon the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Earth. Now our sight is far more quick, and extensive, than our hearing, as is demonstrable, in our beholding the flame of the Powder, and the flash of lightning, some time before we can hear the report of the Cannon, or the clap of Thunder, although the light in both is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with the sound. Now, we cannot hear the Voices and Hymns of Angels, by reason of their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualness, and the groseness, and earthliness of our sense; unless they in condescention to our weakness, as they did to the Shepwards,<note place="margin">Luke 2.13.</note> at the birth of our Saviour, imitate a humane voice; But then I humbly conceive, that sense shall be so strengthened, heightned, and spiritualiz'd, that it shall be as perfect, and quick, as the sight; and by it we shall both hear, and understand the Angels hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Language; that we may joyn in one consort with them, in the praising of God; And in holy Alleluja's, as the Apostle <hi>John</hi> seems to imply,<note place="margin">Revel. 19.6.</note> in his Visions; <hi>I heard</hi> (saith he) <hi>as it were the voice of a great Multitude, and as the voice of many Waters, and as the voice of many Thunders, saying Alleluja, for the Lord God Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent raigneth;</hi>

                  <p>From what hath been said, of the sense of Tasting,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59395:111"/>
and of this of Smelling, in order to our nourishment, and as a Medium ordained of God, as it was in Paradise, for the more delightfull, and necessary continuance of life; I infer, that it is probable, that this sense of Smelling, shall not only continue, but have the same use, and exercise, although in a far more excellent way, and manner, after the Resurrection of our Bodies, in Glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I argue the probability thereof, from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny most excellent objects, and subjects of this sense in the new Heaven, and new Earth; the blessed habitation of all the new-raised Saints; such as the four refined, and then made incorruptible Elements, of Fire, Aire, Water, and Earth; together with the most odoriferous Plants, Herbs, Flowers, Fruits, and sweet-smelling, and Spice-bearing Trees; the beautifull furniture, constant, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural perfume of this new Creation, whose most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent end, Gods wisdome, and glory, and use, the Saints delight, health, and nourishment, would be lost, and to little purpose, should this sense of Smelling not then have a beeing, and be exercised by us.</p>
                  <p>The Levitical and Ceremonial Oyntments, Perfumes, and Incense, commanded by God, to be made, used, and offered,<note place="margin">Exod. 37.29. Psal. 141.2. Cant. 4.12, 13, 14.</note> under the Law, as principal Sacrifices, and as Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of saving Grace, and Prayer, and Types of our blessed Saviours most pleasing and acceptable Merits, and Mediation, shew, of what high esteem, odours, spice, and perfumes, had then, even in Religious Services; If so, it is most likely, they shall have the honour, to have a beeing, and to be a special Ornament of this new Earth, and of civil use, for the delight and benefit of the Saints. If such Creatures, as the curse for sin, hath made noxious, and destructive to Mankinde, shall after their Purification by Heavenly Fire, have still a beeing, or a re-existence, such as the Elements, yea, ravenous, and devouring Beasts, as the Prophet seems to insinuate in those expressions, (wherein I exclude not a spiritual sense also) that the Wolfe shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lye down with the Kid, and the Calfe and the young Lion, and the fatling together; And the Cow and the Bear shall feed, and their young
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59395:111"/>
ones shall lye down together: The Lyon shall eat straw like the Oxe: how much more shall the harmless Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, aforementioned, which under our innocency, were innocent, comforts, and allayes in our misery, have then a beeing, and by the goodness of God, be made conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants, and sweet increasers of our happiness. From all which, I infer, that more than probably, these Creatures shall have a beeing in this new Creation; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the necessary existence, and exercise of the sense of Smelling, in this our glorified condition.</p>
                  <p>O my Soul, shall the sense of Smelling,<note place="margin">

Shall it be then as now, though in a far more inexpressible manner, not only refreshing, and delightfull, but probably an additional, accidental, and invisible delighter, preserver, and nourisher of the life of the Compositum; thy glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Soul and Body? O let it not now be vitiated, and corrupted by sin, and made the usherer in of lust, curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, and pride; let not thy treasures be exhausted, nor thy charity be impoverisht, sinfully to please this sense, by any too costly excess, in the perfuming of thy body, house, meats, or garments; after the vain and profuse fashion, use, and custome of the prodigious, and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal great ones of this World; That by the Devilish witchcraft, and accursed sorcery of Sin, (a true Circes) are transformed into Beasts and Swine; and who with the venemous Spider, suck and gather a sinfull poison out of the choicest Flowers, and sweetest Creatures, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing them to wantonness, uncleanness, and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. But let this so pleasing and usefull sense, even now, in the enjoyment of all the excelling sweets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not only delight, refresh, and cherish thy outward Man; thy natural and animal Spirits; but let it be a curious, and heavenly Limbeck, to draw forth, raise up, and extract, out of the fragrant Redolencies of the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous kinds of sweets, such a Coelestial Spirit, as may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume thy whole Man, with the Divine ravishing contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the infinite Power, and Wisdome of thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, manifested in the multiplicity, variety, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible

                     </note> that the Sense of Feeling shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and have existence in the Saints glorified state, since to deny it, is <hi>tanto-mount,</hi> as to affirm that their Bodies shall not have a beeing; or which is equally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, that they shall in this new life, be sick of a dead Palsie: This Sense being now, and so without doubt, shall be then one of the clearest signes, and demonstrations of the life of the Body; and hath in one respect, a singular preheminency, and difference, above the rest of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. For, whereas every other Sense hath its proper Seat, and Organ; This may be truly said, to be like the Soul, and to Organize, and reside in every part and member of a living and perfect Body. Neither is this Sense less necessary to motion, than to life; insomuch, as that when a Body is totally deprived thereof, it is insensible, and moves not, and is accompted no better than a dead Trunk, and inanimate Corps. I shall add further, that this Sense, as it is now, (so certainly it shall be then) the Souls chief Instrument, and Inquisitor to discern by, and give Judgment, with much pleasure and delight, of those four principal Elementary qualities, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively inherent to, and in all created things, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that consist of matter, and are made up, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the four Elements; as to heat, or coldness; driness, or moisture; or of those remoter qualities, and adjuncts; soft or hard, smooth or rough, arising from them: So that, as the Soul united to the new-raised Body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Eyes, and the Sense of Sigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, may truly be said to be imperfect, and blind, as to all visible objects; so, should the Body want this Sense of Feeling, the Soul may as truly be said, to be incompleat, and ignorantly dark, as to its knowledge, and understanding, as to all Tangible subjects.</p>
                  <p>From what hath been said, I assert, that the Saints at
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59395:113"/>
the Resurrection, shall in their glorified Bodies, have both the continuance, and exercise of this Sense of Feeling, and that in an incomparable perfection, as to what it is now. I will not positively affirm, that spiritual substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as Angels, may be subjects of this glorified Sense, that shall be spiritualiz'd with our Bodies; which though now a Natural Body,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.44.</note> shall then according to the Word of Truth, be raised a spiritual Body: If so, is it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that as now, to our natural Bodies, natural things are touchable,<note place="margin">Luke 24.39.</note> so to our spiritual bodies, spiritual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as Angels, may be Tangible: Our Saviours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression to his Apostles, not at all contraducing, or exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this inquiry, or inference, he affirming only, that a spirit hath not flesh, and bones, as he had: not denying that a spiritual glorified body, may touch and feel a spiritual Beeing, and Essence: But should this not be, I am assured, we shall both touch, and imbrace him, and be imbrac'd by him (I speak this according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-phrase, with all due and humble reverence) who is far above all Creatures, and Angels, our Head, our Spouse, our Saviour, the most glorious Lord Jesus Christ, God-man, in one Person; as also <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>; the Holy Patriarchs, Kings, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, and glorified Saints; as also our formerly neer and dear Relations; which then shall be known of us, in that perfection of knowledge, and in this our exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that so their salvation may add such an accidental joy to the augmentation of our blessedness, as the Holy Angels are said, by our Saviour, to have now super-added to their happiness, at the conversion of a sinner.</p>
                  <p>To these, I shall annex and subjoyn other more inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our subjects of this glorified Sense; the then refined and well-tempered Aire and Elements; the delightfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of Fowles, Birds, and Beasts, now willingly subject and obedient to Man; the super-excelling, and numerous Trees, Fruits, and Plants; the Arbors of soft and sweet-smelling Roses, the banks of Lillies, the beds of Violets, the Carpets of all manner of rarest Herbs and Flowers; with which this new Heaven, and new Earth, this renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Paradise, shall be (even to perpetuity) plentifully

garnisht, and adorned with, to the great glory of God, the Creator, of Christ the Restorer, and of the Holy Ghost the Efficient, and to the unexpressible pleasure, and delightfull use, and benefit of the Elect and glorified Saints. As the blessed <hi>Canticles,</hi> that Song of Songs, hath been, and is reproacht, and abused by wanton A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morists; and a learned Man was declared an Heretick, for holding there was an Antipodes, or a new World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its discovery; so may possibly these my weak noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and contemplations, (although of a Divine subject) because not heretofore searcht into by others, that I know of; and therefore if the Lord in his providence shall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them to come to a publick view, I only recommend them to the devout perusal, and judgment of holy, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, regenerate, and practical Christians; who although in the Body, do by divine Meditation, as it were live out of the Body, and have been so far changed into the Image of Christ, and taught, and renewed by his holy Spirit, that they have brought their Bodies, and Senses unto such a spiritual frame, and exercise, as is declared, and exhorted to, in the foregoing discourse; These will rightly judge of this personal Raign of Christ, with his Saints upon Earth; and how uncharitably, and unjustly, and I may add ignorantly, many (in other respects, learned, religious, and to be honoured) have ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and falsely branded this Doctrine, as though it was New, Epicureal, and Sensual; whereas the truth is, it is <note n="*" place="margin">

That he, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> should come to renew, and restore all things, in this lower Creation, (freed from the curse of sin) to as good, yea, a far better condition, than they had before the Fall; <hi>When God saw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good.</hi> Now,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.31.</note> did not God make this so excellent a work, for his Glory? and

But did any of Man-kinde, but only two, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> enjoy the Earth, and the Creatures thereof, in their Primitive, and created excellencies, and that but for a Day, or two?

I might here add many more Arguments, for the defence of this truth, but I shall at this time, no further digress, but return to my former Method of Meditation, upon this glorified Sense of Feeling: Referring the Reader to those most excellent Treatises of Dr. <hi>Homes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Archer,</hi> and many others upon this Subject.</p>

it with thy Body be spiritualiz'd, and as to its sensability, incomparably exceed, what it is now: O be carefull not to effeminate, or pollute it; disdaining to vassalage it to pride, covetousness, lust, or vanity: But, as it more than all the other Senses, declares and manifests thy living in the body; So let it, by an innocent, sober, chast, and holy acting, testify Christs living in thee. The Lord Jesus hath taken off all legal impositions,<note place="margin">Colos. 2.21.</note> such as <hi>Touch not, taste not</hi>; but not his Gospel, and Spiritual restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                     </note>Having through Gods gracious assistance, (although in much weakness) meditated and discoursed of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Five Senses; I shall conclude, with the blessed, and excellent use, and exercise of the Tongue; (under which I comprehend the voice, and articulate speech) at our Resurrection in Glory; which although not numbered amongst the Senses, yet is not inferiour, but transcends them all; as being the Souls Orator, and Interpreter, to the glory of God, of what is seen, heard, tasted, smelt, or touched by us; And therefore it is sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>David, His Glory</hi>;<note place="margin">Psal. 30.12.

                  <p>I come now, to the use and exercise, of this glorious, and glorified Member, the Tongue, speech, and voice; which I humbly conceive shall be then, Musical, and Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory, and also precatory, as, and with respect to God, and Christ. Secondly discursive, declarative, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative, as in respect of Angels, and their fellow-Saints; as also gubernative, and mandatory, as, and in respect of all inferiour Creatures.</p>
                  <p>As to the first, that the chiefest duty, and highest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Saints, in this new life, shall be the Loqual, Musical, and melodious singing, praising and worshipping of God, and Christ, is in many Figurative Visions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and held forth, in the <hi>Revelation</hi>; as Chapter the <hi>Fourth,</hi> from Verse the 8<hi>th.</hi> unto the end of the 11<hi>th.</hi> Verse; and Chapter the 5<hi>th.</hi> from Verse the 8<hi>th.</hi> until the end of the 14<hi>th.</hi> Verse; and Chapter the 7<hi>th.</hi> from Verse 9<hi>th.</hi> unto the end of the 12<hi>th.</hi> Verse; and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 11<hi>th.</hi> from Verse 15<hi>th.</hi> unto the end of the 18<hi>th.</hi> Verse; and Chapter 14<hi>th.</hi> from Verse the 2<hi>d.</hi> unto the end of the 3<hi>d.</hi> Verse; and Chapter the 15<hi>th.</hi> from Vers. the 2<hi>d.</hi> unto the end of the 4<hi>th.</hi> Verse; and Chapter 19<hi>th.</hi> Verse the 1. unto the end of the 8<hi>th.</hi> Verse; I am not ignorant, that the places above cited, do most of them respect the providential actings of God, and Christ, in the Church Militant, before the Resurrection of the just; and the Churches returns of praises, and worship for them; yet as I think, none will deny the truth I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, so none but will confess, these to be Types, and Patterns of what is done now in Heaven, by the Church tryumphant, and shall be done, by the Saints after the Resurrection, to Eternity; which I prove from <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Chapter 21. Verse the 22. which speaks directly of the time I write of, even of the glorified state of the Saints, upon the new Earth, under the type of the holy City, or new <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; And I saw no Temple therein, for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb, are the Temple of it; and Chapter the 22. Verse the 3<hi>d.</hi> And
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59395:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there shall be no more curse, but the Throne of God, and the Lamb shall be in it; and his Servants shall serve him. To these, I will only add the expressions of the Psalmist; <hi>In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy Name for ever;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 44.8. Psal. 115.18.</note> 
                     <hi>we will bless the Lord from this time forth, and for ever more.</hi> And that of the Apostle, <hi>By Him</hi> (meaning the Lord Jesus Christ) <hi>let us offer the Sacrifice of praise to God continually; that is,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 13.15.</note> 
                     <hi>the fruit of our Lips, giving thanks to his Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the second particular, that the Saints after the Resurrection, shall converse, and have communion with the blessed Angels, and with the rest of their fellow-members, that Scripture before-cited out of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Chapter 12. Verse 22, &amp; 23. doth sufficiently evidence; for if we have communion with them, in this our mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant condition, (as is there asserted by the Apostle) how much more shall we have our Conversation with them, in this state of Glory. If the glorious Angels are now our Guardians, and were often visible, present, and discoursed, with <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Lot, Joshua, Gideon,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">1 Thes. 4.17.</note> And that then we shall be ever with the Lord: as also throughout the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi>: especially in the two last Chapters, where this time, and state, is prophetically, and evincingly set forth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; That the Angels, and Saints exercise, is, and shall be then laudatory, and precatory; a melodious sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and continual praising, adoring, admiring and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of God; I think none doubts; and I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready sufficiently proved. And as to the blessed matter, and subject of their discourse, and communication, one with another; I humbly conceive, it will chiefly respect, and inspect, as to time, (in imitation of our God) things that are past, present, and things that are to come, so far as are promised, and shall be revealed to them. And as to the most excellent matter of their discourse, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive it will be, to keep in remembrance, declare and communicate to, and with one another, in lesser, or greater Assemblies, the glorious, fearfull, and wonderful Name of the Lord our God; that is, his infinite, and incomprehensible Attributes, by which he is made known to his Creatures; for every Attribute is God in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract, as his Omnipotency, wisdome, holiness, justice, love, mercy, truth, goodness, life, glory, eternity, and the rest; As they have been, are, and shall be declared, in his works of Creation, then fully understood, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us; as to the causes, and effects, nature, vertues, influences, and uses of all things, that God hath made, and that have a Beeing in Heaven, or in Earth: to the glory of our God their Creator. Which is to me a strong reason, and a great help to interpret many Scriptures; as setting forth the great wisdome, and justice of God, in appointing a certain time for his Saints, for whom he made the Earth, and wherein they have so greatly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and been persecuted for his sake, and to whom, he hath redeemed, and restored it; shall with their Head the Lord Jesus, in this new Heaven, and new Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59395:118"/>
their second, and ultimate Glory, in the highest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, possess, and enjoy, know, and understand this his lower Creation, in its Primitive excellency; That so they may sing to his praise, and speak thereof one to another, to the exalting God's Name, and Glory, as being the Chief end, for which he Created it and them.</p>
                  <p>The second Chief Head of the Saints exercise of speech, one with another, will be concerning the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull providences of God, especially in respect of his Church, from the beginning of the World; a History never to be blotted out, obliterated, or forgotten, by his Saints; but to be frequently remembred, and mentioned to the glory of his power, wisdome, love, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and of the rest of his Attributes.</p>
                  <p>A third and principal subject, will be that which now, and ever shall be, the wonder of Heaven, and Earth, the admiration of Saints, and Angels, that Miracle of Divine love, the Redemption of Man-kinde, by the Lord Jesus, God-Man in one Person: In which, above all other his works, the Lord hath been pleased to draw neer, and to manifest himself in all his glorious Attributes, both to Saints and Angels. This is that mystery of mysteries, of which the Apostle witnesses, That <hi>without controversie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>great is the mystery of Godliness; God manifested in the Flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of Angels, Preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the World,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 3.18.</note> 
                     <hi>received up into Glory:</hi> This is that bredth and length, that depth and height, the knowledge of the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, even the fulness of God, and the riches of his Glory. But I must return where I left off,<note place="margin">19.</note> lest I be swallowed up in this Ocean of Divine love,<note place="margin">Ephes. 3.16.</note> which both now and then shall far transcend, not only the expressions, but the Conceptions of Saints and Angels.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Subject, about which the Saints Tongues shall be exercised, respects their several employments, and activities, under their glorious Head, and King, in this transcendent Kingdom and Universal Empire, which by way of allusion, I may terme their Callings or degrees of Office under him, and in Relation to one another;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59395:119"/>
For, if the Holy Scriptures hold forth, that in the highest Heavens, there is the most excellent Order, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment evidenced, by the gradual denominations, and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, given unto those Aetherial subjects: as <hi>Arch-Angels, and Angels,</hi>

                     <hi>Principalities, and Powers, Thrones, and Dominions, Cherubins, and Seraphins</hi>; All which have their several Offices, Imployments, and Governments, according to the appointment, and establishment of our great and all-wise God, in those vast Regions, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable starrified Orbes; yea, if in Paradise, (had our first Parents not fallen) as they, so also their Progeny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should have dressed the Garden,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.15. 1 Cor. 15.41.</note> and not have been idle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so also, it is more than probable, that as the Saints, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, should have (like the Stars) different degrees of Glory, so shall they have different actings, Offices, and Imployments; for the performance of which, the Tongue, and speech, above other parts, and Members of the Body; as being the Souls Image, and Interpreter, will have the greatest share, and honour. As for their Offices, he who is truly the Fountain of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, our Lord, and Emperor, the Lord Jesus, saith, that <hi>the Saints shall be all Kings</hi>;<note place="margin">Revel. 5.10. Luke 12.32. Luke 22.29. Luke 19.19.</note> yet with a difference, as to the extent of their Governments; For <hi>some shall rule over five, others over ten Cities, in this Empire of Glory.</hi> Now their several and respective Functions, and atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their Governments, none will suppose, can be performed, without the use of the Tongue, and speech. If all things in the Church Militant, must be done with decency, and in order, much more admirable shall be the unparallel'd order of this Church Tryumphant; The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, directory, and carrying on of which, I conceive shall not be as now, by the use and help of any kind of Books, or Canons; but by verbal Orders, and Acts flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually from their Souls, now as full of Light, as Life; That gracious promise, and prophesie, being then to be compleated, and fulfilled; <hi>They shall be all taught of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isay. 54.13.</note> Let none mistake me, as though I here hold forth, that Saints shall have any Dominion, or Rule over their Brethren; No, I mean, and intend no such thing; For all here are Kings, and free, and shall be
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59395:119"/>
subject to none, but God, and Christ, their Head. But this I conceive, that this Church Tryumphant, being that glorious, and mystical Body, whereof only Christ is the Head,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12. to vers. 27.</note> it is (as the Apostle elegantly) concerning the Church Militant, like the natural Body, compounded, and made up of many Members; every one of which hath a different degree of honour, grace, and glory, and are design'd for several uses, and actions; which without any servitude, or disrespect, from each other of their Members, they do, and chearfully execute, in order to the good, benefit, and happiness of the whole; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they are continually influenced, and directed,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.15. Revel. 19.16.</note> by their Head, the Lord Jesus, who is the only Potentate, <hi>The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to the third, and last particular, the gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernative, and mandatory acting of the Tongue, and voice, of glorified Saints upon the new Earth, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of all animate, and inferiour Creatures; as Fowles of the Aire, Beasts of the Earth, and creeping things: some of all which kindes, as being intelligible, although not rationable; are now subjected to, and obedient to the voice of Man, even to the command of wicked Men: As first, for instance, are not Faulcons, Lanners, Goss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawkes, and all kinde of ravenous Fowles, brought, and taught to obey the Rulers call, and voice of the Faulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? And as for other Fowles, how wonderfull is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and observance of the Cormorants, and the coy Ducks, as to the Instructions, and designes of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. And as for harmless, lesser, and singing Birds; how speedy and trusty Conveighers of Letters are the Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, called Carriors in the Eastern Countreys, to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants? How do Parrots, and other Birds speak and sing, as they are taught, and when they are commanded so to do by their Teachers?</p>
                  <p>Next, how are all sorts of wild and devouring Beasts made Tame, and obedient to their Keepers; as the Lyon, Bear, Tyger, Wolf; especially the Elephants, and Rhino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceroses, so much used, and imployed in Warres, and for service by the Eastern Nations?

                  <p>If then there remains, and appears such manifest signs, and testimonies of Mans dominion, and of the inferiour Creatures obedience, and subjection to him, even after the Fall, Gods curse, the Creatures rebellion, and the vacating of Mans commission: How perfectly intire, and absolute, shall this Dominion be, and the Creatures sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience, when the glorified Saints in the right of Christ, the Lord, and <hi>Heir of all things,</hi> their Head,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.2.

If it be a truth, that they shall not raign over one another, it is as clear a truth, they

                  <p>But it may be objected, how shall the Creature, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that assertion of the Apostle, <hi>Be delivered from Bondage,</hi> they now are under,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.21.</note> and enjoy the liberty of the Sons of God, if they be under this subjection?</p>
                  <p>I answer; as it is no diminution of our liberty, that we shall then be in subjection to God, in Christ, because his Service is our perfect freedome; so it shall be no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, or contradiction, to the liberty in that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture intended, to be restored to the Creatures; For no other liberty, it is clear, is there meant to be given then, but what they had before; their unwilling subjection to bondage, by reason of Gods curse, for Mans sin, and it, being one of the principal ends of their Creation, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, serve, and obey Man, Gods Vice-gerent upon Earth, their service therein, according to the Primitive Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, (as may be observed also, in the unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried motions of the Sun, and Planets) shall be their joy, honour, and freedome, not their bondage: This govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment having no need, or occasion, to make any such harsh, laborious, oppressive, or slautering use of any Creature, as now: all the Saints vocal commands, being then, by the wonderfull wisdome, and providence of God, so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and made agreeable to the nature, and will of the Creatures, and that by a certain kinde of instinct, as that their subjection, and obedience, shall be as natural, pleasing, and acceptable to them, as it is to the Fire and Air, to ascend; they being as ambitious and ready to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, as the Saints to rule, govern, and command them; since all their Orders, and verbal Injunctions, shall tend to the great glory of God, ours and their Creator, and of Christ our Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>As to the particular actings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and subject matter of the Saints verbal Statutes, and Injunctions in this their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Government of the Creatures, I shall not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inlarge, (as conducing nothing to the subject I am now upon) although the Holy Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in mysterious Figures, and expressions, hold forth some light and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery thereof.

exhorted to, and instructed in, what things you are to believe, and to practise; what you are to imbrace; and what to eschew, as to grace and vertue, and as to vice and error: which I earnestly desire you, yea charge you, as a Husband, and a Father, to read often over, or at least once a Quarter. Which were it not all Scripture, and through the grace and mercy of God skimmed, and digested for your edification; I should not by this recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation have presumed to put so high a value upon it. Since which time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having by God's gracious assistance, finished this Treatise of Faith, (being destitute of Worldly gifts to bestow up on you) That in discharge of my duty to God, and to you, I may still continue and express my conjugal, and paternal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, respectively to the Souls of you all. I have directed and dedicated it to you, and yours; desiring, and requiring your fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and serious perusal of it, as being for the subject matter, the most sublime, and holding forth the glorious knowledge of the only Infinite, and most high God; and the wonderful and high Mysteries of Man's Salvation, as they are manifested in the face of the Lord Jesus Christ; who is here lively represented, both to the eye, and to the exercise of your faith, begining with the promise to <hi>Adam,</hi> and Man's fall and misery, and proceeding to his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Life, Death, and Passion, Resurrection, and Assension, and the exercise of his Three-fold Office, as Priest, and the Prophet, and King, with all benefits from them, with his Kingdom, considered in its several degrees, and administrations, first as it was legal, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, under the Law; Secondly, purely spiritual under the Gospel; Thirdly, as it shall be victorious over Sathan, and Worldly enemies, in this latter Age of the World; Fourthly, peaceable, holy and righteous during the Sabbatisms, the Saints Reign a thousand years upon Earth; Fifthly, glorious, after the Resurrection of the Elect, and their Reign with Christ personally, a Thousand Years upon the renewed Earth; Sixthly, Judicial, begining at Christ's second coming, under which the Saints are rewarded, and all the wicked raised, judged, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and cast into the Local Hell, together with the evil Angels, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, Eternally glorious, when Christ's Mediatory Kingdom being expired, &amp; delivered up to the Father, that God may be all in all, the Saints shall be translated into the highest Heavens; that they may there Reign, &amp; live with God and Christ, the Head of the Saints, and Angels, for ever, and for ever. As the subject matter hath a prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, as being a discourse of things most excellent above others, the knowledge, beliefe, and saving application thereof to your souls is of all exercises the most excellent, profitable, and delightful, since without faith, and the true knowledge of God in Christ, there is no light, joy, peace, rest, happiness to your souls here, nor in the life to

                  <p>MY dearest heart, and intirely affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Children, the good and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whose Souls I pray for, and labour for, as for my own; I have I trust (by the direction of the holy Spirit) chosen in this manner to write unto you, as hoping that what is delivered to you in the Person, and words of our Lord and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Saviour. For such is every word in the Epistle (except some words not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial necessary for connexion, explanation and application requisit in a subject of such various matter) You will with the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and affection, delight and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, attend to, and receive; For although all the words therein, were not uttered by his own mouth upon Earth, yet were they all indited by his holy Spirit, who spake by the Prophets and Apostles, and is the Lord God of the holy Prophets.<note place="marg2">Heb. 1.1.</note> So that if ye will not hear and obey him herein,<note place="marg2">Rev. 22.6.</note> speaking to you, by himself, and by them; Neither will you be perswaded,<note place="marg2">Luk. 16.31.</note> though one arose and spake to you from Hell, and from the dead; Ye know after what manner I have been with you,<note place="marg2">Act. 20.18.</note> at all seasons; And how I have kept nothing back that was profitable unto you,<note place="marg2">20.</note> but have shewed you, and have taught you both in private,<note place="marg2">21.</note> and more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely; Testifying unto you, and exhorting you to repentance towards God,<note place="marg2">24.</note> and faith to our Lord Jesus Christ.<note place="marg2">22.</note> And now behold
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59395:170"/>
I am as one bound a Prisoner, and a banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, separated from you; not knowing what things shall further befall me: But none of these things move or grieve me; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther count I my life dear unto my self, so that I might finish my course with joy. For I am perswaded and assured that neither Tribulation,<note place="marg2">Rom. 8.35.</note> or Distress, Persecution, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, nakedness or peril, or Sword, Death, or Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers,<note place="marg2">38,</note> nor things present, nor things to come;<note place="marg2">39.</note> nor height, nor depth, nor any other Creature shall be able to separate me from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus my Lord,<note place="marg2">1 Jo. 4.19.</note> or cause to cease my love to him; As therefore loving him, because he hath loved me first.<note place="marg2">2 Tim. 4.8.</note> Yea, I am further assured, that when I have finished my course, a Crown of righteousness is laid up for me, which my Lord the righteous Judge shall give me at that Day, and not to me only, but unto all those that love his appearing. And now my dearly beloved ones, I know not, God he only knows, whether we shall see the Face of one another any more: Wherefore, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or dead, I may discharge my duty as a Husband, and as a Father, I take you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord this Day, that I am pure from the blood of you all; For I have not shunned to declare unto you the counsel of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Take heed therefore to your Souls, which God hath purchased with his own blood, for I know that after my departure, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Wolves and Enemies, such as the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Powers of Darkness, the numerous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting, and malicious men of the World, and that out of your own selves, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the most dangerous of adversaries, will arise strong, innumerable and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lusts, all endeavouring to draw you from the Faith, and to destroy your most precious Souls; Therefore watch, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that by the space of these many years, I have not ceased to warn every one

                     <hi>I</hi> Commend unto your serious and often Reading and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this following Epistle, a Work which cost me much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, study, and time in the Collection, yet performed with much delight and chearfulness, as moved to write it to all my Relations, by the good Spirit of the Lord, as the best means I could use to counsel stir up, and advise them, with <hi>Mary,</hi> to choose the better part, which shall never be taken from them.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore loving Daughter, let me lay this Paternal Charge upon you, as I shall do upon the rest of your Brothers and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, for whom I am preparing Transcripts out of the Original, written by my own hand: That you read it over at least once a Quarter, as long as you live, as being not mine, but the Epistle of our most dear Lord and Saviour presented to you only by my hands, his most unworthy Instrument. The subject matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being his most sacred Word, who is the Lord God of all the holy Prophets, the Pen-men hereof, And the great Prophet of his Church; whose Word, whosoever will not hear and obey, are threatned to be destroyed. My design herein, I hope, through the grace and mighty power of the most holy Spirit of Christ, will be prosperous, and effectual, as being not only a Letter of advice and counsel from an earthly Father, whom I am confident you love, and will obey in the Lord; But the Epistle, and most pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Exhortations of your heavenly Father, yea, the love-letter of your Head and Spouse the Lord Jesus Christ, who hath mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried you unto himself in holiness and everlasting righteousness.</p>
                  <p>Dear Daughter, the holy Scriptures being the Foundation of all saving knowledge, and true Religion, I have by the direction and assistance of the Lord, skim'd off for you the Cream thereof,

and given you a few proofs of many, holding forth, as from his own mouth; First, The excellency of his Person: Secondly, The Fundamental Articles of the Christian faith, and belief in the words of the holy Scripture only: Thirdly, what things are to be practised by you, held forth in God's holy Law: Fourthly, what evil things are to be eschewed, either respecting Doctrine, or manners, wherein you have the Lord Jesus Christ's encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and exhortation, to the attaining of all saving graces, and virtues, and his Dehortation from all errors in Doctrine, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those that are sowen, and profest in these worst of times) and from all sins and vices in practice: Fifthly, You have herein many of his Holy Counsels, directing how to walk holily, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, circumspectly, and unblameably in your life and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together with the holy means and Ordinances ordained by him, for the obtaining and strengthning his graces in you, which is concluded with his Prayer and mine to our Heavenly Father for a blessing. O let not then, much beloved Child, This Letter (should you neglect the counsel given you therein) after my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease, bear witness against you: But let it be a Record and lasting Legacy read and practised by you, and your Childrens Children; which is the fervent Prayer of your</p>

                  <head>An Humble ANSWER to a PAPER or <hi>QVERY,</hi> Given to the <hi>Author,</hi> by King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the First, at <hi>Hombey</hi>; concerning the Observations of <hi>Easter</hi>-Day <hi>A. D.</hi> 1647.</head>
                  <byline>By the <hi>KING.</hi>
                  </byline>
                  <p>I desire to be resolved of this Question, Why the new Reformers discharge the keeping of Easter?</p>
                  <p>The Reason for this Query is,</p>
                  <p>I Conceive the Celebration of this <hi>Feast</hi> was Instituted by the same Authority which changed the <hi>Jewish</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both into the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Day, or <hi>Sunday:</hi> for it will not be found in Scripture where <hi>Saturday</hi> is discharged to be kept or turned into the <hi>Sunday,</hi> wherefore it must be the Churches Authority that changed the one, and instituted the other. Therefore my Opinion is, that those who will not keep this <hi>Feast,</hi> may as well return to the Observation of <hi>Saturday,</hi> and refuse the Weekly <hi>Sunday.</hi> When any Body can shew me, that herein I am in an error, I shall not be ashamed to confess and mend it: till when you know my mind.</p>

                  <p>I Cannot but from the blessed example of our Saviour, (who was in his Age a new Reformer of old Errors, <hi>Viz.</hi> the false glosses of the Scribes and Pharisees, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.20.) but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all such Reformers in our times, blessed also; But for the keeping of <hi>Easter,</hi> although I know not any Ordinance of <hi>Parliament</hi> discharging it, yet with submission to better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I in all dutifulness conceive, That your <hi>Majesties</hi> reason upon which your <hi>Query</hi> is built, hath a great mistake even in the foundation of it, you being pleased to lay this for a ground, That the change of the <hi>Sabboth</hi>; and the Institution of <hi>Easter</hi> are by one and the same equal Authority and Ecclesiastical Decree, which with your <hi>Majesties</hi> favour, I cannot yield to, for I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive that the change of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Sabboth (the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the Work of the Creation) unto the Lords day, the remembrance of that great Work, (the Work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion finished upon this Day of the Lord's Resurrection) was by no less than by Divine Authority, because the keeping of one Day in Seven as a Sabboth to God, was not only sanctified and set apart, by God's own example in the Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. Ver. 2 and accordingly observed by the <hi>Israelites</hi> many Weeks before the Law was given, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.23. But is One of the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments delivered by God's own mouth in Mount <hi>Sinay,</hi> written by his own Finger in Tables of Stone, commanded by himself to be put into the Ark of the Covenant; which Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue or Ten Commandments are also by our blessed Saviour in his Sermon upon the Mount declared to be the rule of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples moral obedience, unto the end of the World, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.17. and in the following part of that Sermon, wherein he vindicates the Law from the corrupt Glosses of the Scribes and Pharisees; he instances only in moral duties, and moral Laws. From all which Divines generally infer that the Decalogue is to continue in force unto the Worlds end; and therefore it seems most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that no Authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is inferiour to that which appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Seventh Day from the Creation to be the Sabboth, could abrogate that Day, and appoint an other Day to be used instead of it, because neither the Law of Nature, nor the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:59395:177"/>
doth any where give the least intimation, that any humane Power may change any of the Commandments of God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed so many absurdities would follow upon such an assertion, as I am confident your <hi>Majesty</hi> will not own it. It remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the change of the Day must be the work of Christ himself, or of his Apostles, who were divinely inspired, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 21. And to prove that it was so, <hi>Viz.</hi> That the Lords Day by Divine Institution now succeeds in the room of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, I shall use no other Arguments than these which I finde in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And that according to <hi>Austin</hi>'s judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Lord's Day is declared to be the Christian Sabboth, by the Resurrection of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> which the said Bishop not only saith, but proveth by these Arguments.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. The Apostles kept their holy Meetings on that Day to Preach, and Pray, and Celebrate the Lord's Supper, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Day is called the Lord's Day, not only in the Apostles times, but by the Apostle <hi>John</hi> himself, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. And he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adds, that this Epithite <hi>(Dominicum)</hi> in the Scripture is only applyed to these two, The Lord's Day, and the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, To shew that they are both to be taken alike in Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He saith we have not only example, but express precept for it, 1 Cor. 16.2. That upon the first Day of the Week which was the Day of their Assembly, then Collections or Oblations would be made.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And lastly, He affirms that in all Ages of the Church this Day was observed. To this <hi>I</hi> may add our Saviour's rest upon that Day from his Works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.10. His often visiting the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles during the Forty Days, after his Resurrection, upon that Day speaking of the things appertaining to the Kingdom of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. Now what more material thing was there to be declared to them than this, The change of the Sabboth, and the appointing a set time for his Worship; he accordingly appearing thrice on the first Day of the Week, (besides his being seen of the Women) to teach and instruct his Disciples. First to the
<pb facs="tcp:59395:178"/>
two Disciples that went to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> Luke 24.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Apostles when <hi>Thomas</hi> was absent, <hi>John</hi> 20.19. And the third time when <hi>Thomas</hi> was present, <hi>John 20.26. As also observe,</hi> that those wonderful and extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost were poured out according to his promise upon the Apostles and Church (then) met together, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1. The Day of Penticost being the Morrow after the Seventh Sabboth, to be accounted from the Day of the Sheaf-Offering, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.15. By all which, he seems to have honoured and set apart that Day above others, for his service. Lastly, this being a principal Institution, might probably be one of those Decrees ordained by the Apostles (as well as that concerning the Sacrament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34.) delivered by <hi>Paul</hi> to the Churches in all the Cities, through which he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.4. But for the Observation of <hi>Easter</hi> to be an Annual Festival to Christians, I find not any thing in the Holy Scriptures: And your <hi>Majesty</hi> is pleased to place it only upon the Churches Authority. And although I will not contend about the Churches Power in the Institution of such things as are sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply indifferent, yet I suppose I may boldly assert, that such things as are only Instituted by Ecclesiastical Authority, having no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>step in the Scripture, may by Ecclesiastical Authority be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.</p>

Mercy implor'd, hath its first motion or inducement from the suppliant; but thy mercy first beheld us, when we had no power to view thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blinded by Sathan; thy goodness raised us, when we were dead and buried in sin, and thy free love only procured thee to move in compassion towards us, who were moved through trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, contrary to thee: unvaluable and extraordinary gifts are assured (although silent expressions) of a fixed and ardent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: But who O Lord is able to value thy gift, to declare, much less apprehend thy love? Friendship is reciprocal, for a friend can no sooner exhibit any reality of benevolence, but, as it were, by reflection, he is presently apprehensive of the like from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though not in quantity, as being perhaps less able, yet in quality, as being not less loving. But O merciful Creator, thy love met with hatred, the very object of thy favour was thy Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, whom thou didst not reconcile with a gift, as fearing his power or ability to resist thee, since he was thy Creature, thy Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, thy just sentence of Condemnation waiting but the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word of thy will to execute him! O unexhausted Fountain of wisdome, there was no weakness or deficiency in thee, which (Man destroyed) might any whit disable or diminish thy work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship in a second Creation, since all thy works keep time with thy Word! What caused thee then, O powerful Maker, to give Life, where Death was due; Heaven, where Hell was deserved; Pleasure and Joy, where Pain and Torment was incurred! Why didst thou give mercy and forgiveness to Man, and denyedst it to Angels; honouring the Humanity with a Personal Union, which in <hi>Adam</hi> was a Traytor by Rebellion? Lastly, Why gavest thou thy only begotten Son to Death, that we might be thy Adopted Sons in Life.<note place="margin">Eph. 2.4.</note> Lord, my Soul shall answer with St. <hi>Paul; God, who is rich in Mercy, for his great Love wherewith he loved Vs, even when we were dead in Sin, hath quickened Vs together in

All Princes are but Vice-Royes, God only is <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords:</hi> Yet who amongst them is not welcomed into his Kingdome, with joyful Acclamations, and royal Solemnities? But loe here, not only the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> but the great Emperor of Heaven and Earth, born in <hi>Bethelem,</hi> the least of the Cities of <hi>Judah</hi>; a City, and yet affords no place, but a Stable, to lodge and entertain the Worlds Monarch; Heaven must point him out by a Star, Angels must preach him, before any of his own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him; and then Shepheards are his Heralds to Proclaim him. The sequel, and after-story of his Life, is no less reproachfully miserable, than this Prologue of his birth. Poverty clothes Him with obscurity and affliction 30. Years; in which space, his very Infancy is not free from Persecution by <hi>Herod</hi>: witness those Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents of <hi>Bethelem,</hi> who suffered for him, who came to dye for them; he flying into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> from the wrath of Man, that he might undergo the anger of God, preserving himself not from pain, but for pain. O Lord, had thy Loves Foundation been laid in Earth, the hatred and ungratefulness of Man, might have ruined thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and induc'd thee to have retrograded from thy purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed design; but behold the Root of thy Mercy was in thy Self, which brought forth the fruits of thy sufferings, thy love being natural, therefore immutable; none of thy grievous pressures were obscured from thy view, for thy praescience beheld, as present, all fore-past actions, and future events; so that thou wert not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, or contrary to thy will, overtaken by them; no necessity did enforce thee to undergo so difficult a Task, since constraint is

only prevalent in a finite nature; but thou art infinite, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all things, circumscribed by nothing. Lord Jesus, let me admire, since I cannot express this thy love, and make me to love thee again in some measure, that thus hast loved me without measure. Here whilest my Soul, full of wonder, desires to stay and meditate, thy goodness leads me still forwards, and as it were reproves my lingring thus.

Yea, in your own Nation, in this our Age of wonders? All which, in honour, and gratitude to God, and the edification, and encouragement of his Church, calls for from you, in Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Saints in former times, (as hath been afore decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) many Triumphant Arches, Pillars, and Monuments of praise; both in Prose, and Verse; never to be worn out by time, or thrown down by the Malice, and slanders of traducing Persons.</p>

To such, that like <hi>Naman,</hi> to the Prophet <hi>Elisha,</hi> say, God be merciful to me in this; I cannot say, go in peace; but this I will say, that Ingratitude includes all other sins against God, and Man; (<hi>Si ingratum, dixeris Omnia dixeris;</hi>) Wherefore that all such may convince, and Judge themselves, notwithstanding all these Excuses, and <hi>subter fuges</hi>; Let me ask them this question; Have you from your birth, until now, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no mercies, nor blessings from God to your Souls, to your Bodies, or to your Relations? No recovery from spiritual or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Diseases, nor deliverances from spiritual and corporal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and dangers? no blessings, temporal, spiritual, and eternal; no gracious, and extraordinary providences to you, or yours? If then you cannot deny, but must acknowledge to have received from the Lord, many favours of this Nature, O may I not say of the most of the <hi>English</hi> Nobility and Gentry, as once our Saviour of the Ten Leapers, Were there not Ten cleansed, where are the Nine? Only One returning to give thanks. Wherefore lest your unthankfulness, mud and stop up the stream of God's mercy to you, and the Nation for the future; and since it is God's commands, the practise of God's Saints, and your duty, as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Christians, to be Praisefull; Yea, lest your Talents be taken from you, and given to others, and you receive that most terrible Sentence, declared by our Lord at his return, to the unprofitable Servant, that hid his Talent in a Napkin; Bind him

                  <p>Right honourable, and renowned Gentlemen; as I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd to present and direct this weak Piece to your view, so what I have above written in Zeal to God's glory, and unfeigned love to your Souls, shall be my Apology to the following subject: As that my end therein is primarily the glory of God, whose praises is my duty, as well as his command, to exalt in my own Soul, and others, as hath been declared, and to perpetuate, as much as in me lies, to my Posterity, and to all future Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, what great, and free love, mercy, and goodness, he hath shewed to me, and mine; herein endeavouring to imitate the Holy example of that Royal Psalmist King <hi>David,</hi> who hath thus in Verse exprest both his resolution and practise; Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me all ye that fear God,<note place="margin">Psal. 66.17.</note> and I will tell you, what he hath done for my Soul: (I say for my Soul) as may appear in some degree, in the alluzions, and applications in several temporal mercies, and personal deliverances, commemorated in this Book; I acknowledging to Angels, and Men, that God's Fatherly love in Christ, and care of my poor Soul, in supporting, preserving, and delivering it from Sin, Sathan, and the World; my mighty Adversaries, and from innumerable spiritual evils, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Do as far transcend (to the glory of his free grace be it spoken) my temporal and corporal deliverances, and mercies, as the Heaven is above the Earth, and my unvaluable Soul, is more precious, than this poor Hut of Earth, I sojourn in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59395:193"/>Here possibly, some great Men, or rare Wits, who (Eagle-like) soar far above my mean parts and gifts, may uncharitably sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and object, (to say no more) What doth this poor Man's Personal, or spiritual mercies, and deliverances, concern us? To such, I answer; Are you Christians, and fellow-members of Christ's Body, and will you not weep with those that weep, and rejoice with those that rejoice? As God commands you?<note place="margin">Rom. 12.15.</note> Can you be living Members,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.

O take heed, lest such pride, and insensibleness, declare you to be no living Member of one Church; However, I am assured, all those that fear God, now, and in Ages to come, shall read with delight, rejoice, and praise God with me, for his gracious providences and merciful deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, recorded in this following Treatise; Which I although cloathed in a plain and low stile, in the Opinion, it may be of some carping Momusses, and over-curious Criticks, whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will please, but what's their own, or what is like (<hi>Sphynkes</hi> Ridles) to be understood by a few; Or that is not imbroidered with humane strains of Wit, and Eloquence, or bumbasted, and imbossed with affected praises, and needless Epithites. For my part, I have not endeavoured to humour such; nor to drown matter in words, but without affectation, vaunting, or racking in Prose, or in Verse, I have desired to keep to my own Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and natural Dialect; And to be understood, rather than to be so obscure, as to need a Comment; What you finde is good herein, it flowes (although through my Leaden Pipe) from the Spirit of the Lord, the unexhaustible Fountain of Grace, and goodness; what is incongruous or evil, it is the sinful slime, and filth, which naturally cleaves to every humane Aquaeduct, (except the Holy Scripture) <hi>(Nam Humanum est Errare)</hi> which being in voluntary is pardoned by the Lord, I doubt not of yours; unless, I should be so uncharitable, as to think you disdain to imitate so Divine a Pattern.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, my Lords, and Gentlemen, I confess I was hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieved for my own, and your great ingratitude, (when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a diligent inquiry, I could finde few, or none, (Monuments, or Returns) of this Nature; although I am assured, all of you are vastly indebted to our great and gracious God, for number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, spiritual, and temporal blessings, mercies, and deliverances; and which is worse, many of you have great Incomes given you by him, and to this end, of wit, parts, and gifts, with which you might, and ought, to make to him a just, and thankful repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; especially, since our liberal Heavenly Father, expects from

                  <p>This serious and sad consideration of my own, and your sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Omissions, stirred me up speedily (lest I should dye ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) to Pen, and publish this Work, not only in discharge of my duty to the only great and glorious God, my loving, and merciful Father; But as an humble Essay, and Copy, for you to write by; which, if but any one of you follow, I shall rejoyce much, because such an one, hath received great good thereby, and the Lord by him, much glory; But if none, I shall weep in secret, for your Ingratitude: And have much joy, and peace, in that herein, I have done my duty to God, and to you; But I hope better things of you: In which charitable expectation, I subscribe my self, my Lords and Gentlemen,</p>

                        <p>O How early, even in the Spring of my Youth, did sin and vanity bud, flower, and bring forth clusters of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and Apples of <hi>Gomorah</hi>! no sooner was I mounted for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> (about the year 1625.) but a Troop of Lusts were on Horse-back also, ready to attend me thither; <hi>Viz.</hi> Pride, in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise and Garment of neatness; Lust, in a light riding suit of love, and amorousness; Lying, in a divers coloured Coat of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement and good language; and Idleness, in a wide-made Suit, slasht, and open-sleeved of recreation; upon which, was a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Cloak of friendly Visits: seventy miles as to my labour, seem'd but a short stage; but as to my longing desires, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; until I got a fight of the Southern constellation of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Geminy, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>'s Churches, and the united Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster</hi>; where I was no sooner setled, but I found my self unsetled through the multitude of temptations, and incitations to sin and vanity. Being almost suffocated with ill scent of pride and vanity, I rode out for Recreation, to a Park neer it, to find out sweeter Air, but there me thought the Proverb was verified, <hi>The World runs upon Wheels</hi>; which raised up Clouds of dust, as though the Earth against Nature would take place of the Element of Air: There I saw many Inchanters of both Sexes, raise their familiars, and command and charm them within multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied circles of Coaches: wherefore I returned from thence, to walk as I conceived, in a more private and reserved Paradice, called therefore the Springs Garden; but that I was so crowded and shouldred, with the Gallants of both Sexes, which, as so
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59395:205"/>
many moving Groves, fill'd up, and replanted the Walks, that the whole Garden, was (me thought) changed into a wild Wood, and Wilderness; wherefore to avoid this throng, through some solitary Meddowes and winding Paths, I sought in the Centre of the Wood, for some place of privacy; and found some little Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitages, where I hoped to have discoursed with some sober or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Persons; but found them to be Chapels of ease, dedicated to <hi>Bacchus, Ceres,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi>; which made me think of the truth and reason of that Sentence, (<hi>Sine Cerere &amp; Bacho, friget Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>) The Lord's Day being come, I thought to spend that Day better, than the Days of the Weeks past, and therefore Visited the Church of <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Westminster:</hi> which, to say no more in its commendation, (according to Relations) I found to be in some things, like St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church in <hi>Rome.</hi> This (being I was a Protestant, and in a Protestant City) did raise my admiration, but not my devotion. After this, having heard extolled the wit and language of our <hi>English</hi> Poets, and that their Playes, (a fit name for such Airy Poems) were much Visited, and by the Youth of our Nation, preferred above the best of Sermons; As also that they were acted to the life, in the publick Theatres; I we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Being told of the Noble Buildings of both <hi>Exchanges,</hi> and of the great concourse to them of Coaches, and Persons of the best Quality; I expected better things there, but found in that place an <hi>Exchange</hi>; but as for the Company, the like, or the same.

                        <p>After some time, I adventured, at the instance of some of my acquaintance, not therein my friends, to go into a Tavern; I stopt, and thought the fair structure, rich Sign-bush and Bason, had some resemblance to the <hi>Roman</hi> Tryumphant Arches; But my admiration was soon chang'd into a detestation; for the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and singing, bawling and swearing of their Tenants at will, the knocking of Pots, the scraping of Fidlers, the gaping of Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters at the Bar (not of truth and Justice, but too often of the contrary) made me think it to be a <hi>Bedlam,</hi> a place full of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or the House of <hi>Circes,</hi> where by mixt intoxicating, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterated Liquors, rational Men are changed into Swine, Dogs, Goats, and Lyons; yea, into all kind of Beasts, and bruitishness.

This is a great mystery; but I speak of Christ, and his Church; Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular, so love his Wife, even as himself; and let the Wife see that she reverence her Husband.

                        <p>From whose words, especially his conclusion, (This is a great mystery) I infer, that Marriage (although not in a strict and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish sence) yet, as to a larger meaning, and construction of the Word, may be called a Sacrament, as holding forth by outward and visible signes, and things, spiritual mysteries, and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Of this nature in Scripture, and many instances, as the Ark, Rain-bow, Red Sea, Rock, Manna, and other such like.</p>
                        <p>Is it so, O my Soul? And hath the Lord so extraordinarily, and abundantly blessed this Ordinance, and condition unto thee; as thou hast declared in thy foregoing Memorial, and thankful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment? Let, upon this occasion, thy Meditation be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stirred up, and inlarged; and from this great temporal blessing and mystery, behold, declare, and point out, the far greater and excelling blessings, which are, and shall be enjoyed by thee, and the Church, the Spouse of Christ, by our spiritual Marriage, and Union unto Him.</p>

is the Holy Ordinance of God, and the blessed effect of his gracious Providence, and Eternal Decree: All Marriages (according to the Proverb) being made in Heaven, so is that great Architype thereof, the Marriage of the Church, and in it,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.22.</note> of every true believer unto Christ.

                        <p>To conclude, this our spiritual Union and Marriage, is by the Apostle called a great Mystery,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.32.</note> as being the blessed effect of the free grace of God, who is assentially love; and therefore it is as to the heighth and depth, length and breadth thereof, Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible, and passing all understanding.<note place="margin">Eph. 3.18, 19.

                        <p>O Lord, as sin is the substance, so affection and judgment, is the dark shaddow that alwayes attends and accom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panies it, as the effect doth the cause. This truth was verified to this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> in the Years 1637, 1638, &amp; 1639. When according to thy Word, a fruitful Land, was turned into barrenness,<note place="margin">Psal. 107.34.</note> for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>
                        <p>As the first Rebellion of <hi>Adam</hi> brought a curse upon the whole lower Creation,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.27.</note> so this wicked off-spring, by sin, often invert the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:59395:212"/>
order, and harmony of the Elements, and makes malignant the influence of the higher Orbes, causing those Coelestial Planets, which were Created for blessings to Man-kinde, to be Executors of thy righteous Judgments.</p>
                        <p>Of this, these Three Years Prodigies, are clear and sufficient witnesses, when as that only Magazin of light, and heat, to the Universe, (thy glorious Sun) which chears and delights Man and Beast, and gives in our Northern Regions, in the Spring, as it were new life to Vegatives; was made by thee, for <hi>England</hi>'s iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, a terrible Curse, as occasioning deadly Diseases, Feavers, and Murrains upon Men and Beasts, through its constant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive heat; and like a Globe, and Furnace of Fire, withered, and burnt up all Grass and Vegitives; especially our Grain, the staff of life, destroying by this Heavenly Fire, our Earthly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.</p>
                        <p>As thy Sun, so thy watering Pots, the Clouds, which like swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Pappes, used to distil streams of fruitful Rains, according to thy Ordinance; were now vanisht, or rather banisht to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes; or if any appeared, they were but dry breasts, and true symptomes of the barren Womb of <hi>England</hi>; yea, thou madest the Heavens contrary to their Nature, to become as Brass,<note place="margin">Deut. 28.23.</note> and the Earth as Iron; that the one might be as the Hammer, the other the Anvil, whereon to forge thy many Darts, and sharp Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of insuing Plagues.</p>
                        <p>As thy Rod of Justice, O Lord, hath three Cords, or Lashes, which thou callest thy three sore or greatest Judgments;<note place="margin">Ezek. 14.21.</note> 
                           <hi>Viz.</hi> War, Pestilence, and Famine; whereof this last is the greatest, as being usually the dregs, and the effect of the two former; So thy mercy also hath a three-fold time, or Plea, (as in the Gospel;) Lord let the Fig-Tree alone this third Year also,<note place="margin">Luk. 13.7, 8, 9.</note> to try it, whether or no it will bring forth Fruit, before thou cuttest it down.</p>
                        <p>Lord, as <hi>England</hi>'s sin called for, and deserved this greatest Judgment, (Famine) so thy mercy did, during these three Years, successively threatning this grievous Plague, give her three years warning, and space of Repentance; Yea, did offer thy Peoples Prayers unto thee, by the hand of our Mediator, for a reprieve, and obtained it; and which is much more wonderful, a pardon, and dismission of so justly deserved, and so long impending a Judgment; for which great condiscention, I will bless thee as long as I have a beeing. And that the Generations to come may praise thee also, I have in all humility and thankfulness, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and recorded in this, and the following Meeters, thy never to be forgotten Goodness, and Mercy.</p>

                        <p>THe tremendious curse, for Man's sin, and rebellion against God his Creator,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note> is Death, temporal and Eternal. The Quarter-Master and Harbinger of Death, is sickness, who prepares as soon as we were born, (for even then we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to die) matter, or food, (corrupt humors, and innumerable
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:59395:216"/>
diseases) for this all devouring Monster; together, with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable quarters, until according to the Proverb, He hath eaten us out of House and home; So that this our dying Life, is but a living Death. Lord, as all have sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> so all in him are dead; witness that thy just Statute, and Sentence,<note place="margin">Rom 5.12, 17.</note> It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto all Men once to dye:<note place="margin">Heb. 9.27.</note> To which Law (as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging my self a sinful Son of <hi>Adam</hi>) I humbly submit, and have these five times entertained Deaths fore-runners, or Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard. The first of his Messengers, was a short, yet dangerous Surfeit, in the time of my Childhood; out of which, by thy blessing upon the means, used by a friendly Physitian, I was spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily recovered. The second, was a continued defluxion of Rheum, which caused a constant Cough, and inclined me for many years (in the entrance of my Manhood) unto a Consumption. By this correction, Heavenly Father, thou didst most wisely bridle, order, and allay the strong and indomitable Lusts of my Youth; that beholding daily, Death, thy Sergeant, at the Door, I might fear to act wickedness, and submit to thy Discipline: This friend of Death (which thy mercy and wisdome made in a sence, a friend, unto me) by thy special providence, and ordering me to use fit means, was, after many years space, and at a time, and in a place, where that Disease was always before dangerously afflictive, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged also, and I wonderfully, and perfectly recovered. The third assailant, was a deadly Plurisie, the consequent and usual effect of a long and violent Cough, which by a terrible pain, and stitch, made my breathing (the necessary Servant and Bellowes of Life) painful; which after divers Moneths suffering, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less use of many remedies, Thou, O Lord,<note place="margin">Psal. 65 2.</note> that hearest and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerest Prayer, heard mine; and by thy blessing upon a Plaister laid to my Stomack, and a Purge, didst in one Night and a Day free me from all pains, Coughs and Distempers, to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my self, and Relations. The fourth Allie, and Spie of Death, was a violent Ague, whose eight Hours hot fits might well deserve the Name of a Feaver; This ceaz'd upon me at <hi>Homby,</hi> where thy providence, O Lord, by this thy Attachment, freed me from a worse, because illegal detainure; These fiery Fits, (the very shaddows of Hell) at a certain Hour every other Day, for some Weeks, like a well-ordered Regiment, made their assaults; and as so many <hi>Roman</hi> Rams, or whole Cannon, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered all my Rampires of Earth, the out-works of Nature, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, and making a breach for their General (Death) to enter at. But even then also, O most gracious God, and Father,<note place="margin">Jer. 8.22.</note> the only expert Physitian, that curest both Body and Soul, Thou freely, without any Fee, (for alas, I had nothing of merit to give
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:59395:217"/>
thee) Visited me, and didst attend to my cry, and pittied my many sighs, and groans; walking with me in this Fiery Furnace; so that although I was often burning,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.25. Exod. 31.2.</note> like <hi>Moses</hi> Bush, yet I was not consumed: Yea, thou mad'st these Brats of sin, and death, instead of Destroyers, my Refiners: Diseases and afflictions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not punishments to thine, and beginnings of Hell, as to the wicked; But like the Purges, Vomits, and Blood-lettings of a skilful, and loving Father, and Physician, for prevention; and for the cure, not for the destruction of thy Children, and Patients; according to thy Word, this shall be the fruit, to take away their Sin.</p>
                        <p>Praised be thy Name, O Lord, that in much loving kindness and faithfulness,<note place="margin">Isay 27.9. Psal. 119.75.</note> hath alwayes afflicted me; and didst then also, after a few Weeks, give me a perfect recovery, by thy blessing, upon the Medicine of a poor Widdow, even after that the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most endeavours of a skilful Doctor proved uneffectual.</p>
                        <p>The fifth, and last dangerous encounter, was with another Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivant of Death, a second painful and perilsome Ague. From this Ague, also, after three very accute fits, thou gavest me a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and healthful recovery. Lord, what shall I render unto thee for these five most gracious recoveries, and as it were new lives; And for thy deliverance from many other lesser Distempers? Yea, what have I to return unto thee, since all I am is thine, and all my most spiritual Sacrifices are lame, weak, and sickly? Lord, although such were forbidden under the Law,<note place="margin">Deut. 15.21.</note> yet under thy Gospel we have a great High Priest, which takes away the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,<note place="margin">Exod. 28.38.</note> and infirmity of our holy things; in whom thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared (even from Heaven) that thou art well pleased with us; And who is that compassionate Physician,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.17.

                        <p>Amongst whom, (to the praise and glory of his free grace, be it spoken) I have had a large share, witness the foregoing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and this deliverance, when in the conclusion of some Hours spent alone in Fasting and Prayers, and I ready to arise from my Knees, and to change my Cushion for my Bed at Ten a Clock at Night, I heard a great crack, as of a Pistol, issuing from behind the Hangings, and corner of the Chamber, within two Yards of me; at which suddain noise, I arose up, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led back the Hangings, saw a Barrel full of small-Cole, all of a flame, occasioned by the innocent carelesness, and thrift of my Fire-maker, who had cast back some live small Coales, into the Tub; the breaking of whose burnt Hoops, gave me this timely Alarm: which had it been delayed but a few Minutes, I, and my Servant had been a Bed, and asleep, and lockt up in my Bed-Chamber, within that Dining-Room; And the Hangings that hung over the Barrel, certainly Fired; together with that Room, and that whole stately Structure.</p>
                        <p>O Lord, whilst we are faithfully imployed in thy service, and worship; we are assuredly under thy Almighty Protection; who hast promised to those that make thee their Refuge;<note place="margin">Psal. 91.10, 11, 12.</note> That there shall no evil befall them, nor any Plague come neer their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; That thy Angels shall take charge of them, to keep them in all their ways, that they shall bear them up in their hands, lest they dash their Foot against a Stone. O how sweet, how comfortable, how incouraging to thy People, is the most firm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the constant presence,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.14.</note> watchful, and powerful assistance
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:59395:225"/>
of thy glorious Angels, whom thou hast made Ministring Spirits for the good of thy Elect; As thy Servant at this time found by experience! Such gracious Providences as this, being most probably timed, acted, and discovered by an Angel, as the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Train, and kindling of the Fire, and inflaming of the Barrel, might possibly be, the malicious contrivance of a wicked Spirit; Who, as the Scriptures witness, are as constantly Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of evil, to Man-kinde (although the wicked World are ignorant thereof) as the others are of all good, to thy Children.</p>
                        <p>Lord, probably it was the Devils will and design, that the Barrel should not have flamed forth so soon, by a quarter of an Hour, and then without any noise; that so, the Chamber being empty, and we a Bed, and asleep; and the Hangings on Fire, we might have been first certainly smothered, and afterwards burnt. (A <hi>Roman</hi>-like Obsequie.) But thy All-wise providence suffered him (as thou didst his <hi>Guy Faulkes</hi>) to bring his Plot to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment, and then ordered thy Angel thus strangely and opportunely, to discover to thy greater glory, his disappointment, and thy Servants wonderful Salvation, and serious Observation of this thy most Fatherly love, care, and watchfulness over me, thy poor Child and Creature. Blessed God, and Father, how hast thou, through our Adoption in Christ, meliorated our condition, so that our greatest Enemies, in all their malicious actings against us, are now made but Carriers, to convey thy love-tokens unto us; yea, all our troubles and dangers, are so many choice and faith-strengthning experiences of thy Power, Goodness, and mercy; so that now, instead of fearing of them, we can rejoyce and triumph in, and over them; And give to our selves, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, a satisfying reason why thou sufferest Devils, and Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Men thus to act, rage, and persecute thy Saints; when thou couldest in a moment cast them all into Hell. Why thou leadest us into various Temptations, afflicts us with Diseases, sufferest us to be Daily incompast about with troubles, and dangers; when in an instant thou couldest renew, and make again this Earth our Paradice; Is it not, O Lord, (as well as to exercise and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our Graces, and to purge out our sins) that in and by these Trials thou mightest also have a frequent, and fit occasion to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest thy self unto us, (in the face of our Lord Jesus Christ) in all thy glorious Attributes, of Power, and Wisdome, Justice, and Faithfulness, Love, Mercy and Goodness? Thus O Lord, this great danger of Burning, was to me the Mother of a far greater mercy, thy wonderful preservation; and shall now, and for ever be the subject of my praise, and thanks-giving: which I humbly present to thy most gracious Majesty, in this Memorial, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poem. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <p>This truth was both verified and manifested, when I and my Servant, in my Lodgings in <hi>Somerset</hi> House, were suddainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened out of our sweet, and quiet Nights sleep, about break of Day, on a Summers Morning, by a great noise upon my Stairs head, seconded by the most forcible breaking open of my Dining Room Door, though defended by two great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore in self-defence, I presented my Pistol, and struck Fire against the Brest of the Leading-man without effect, which failure in all likelihood might have encouraged, and provoked him and his associates, to have rusht in upon us naked Men, and to have hew'd us in pieces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but certainly there was more with us, than was against us; else had not a valiant tryed Officer, with some Files of Souldiers; for such I understood them to be afterwards, at the sight only of two Men in their Shirts been struck with such a pannick fear, that they suddainly and with great speed ran back through the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Room, not stopping in their flight, nor recollecting their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> until they came to the bottom of my Stairs. To which Stairs

These Persons, he told me, he and his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers pursued through the same Hole, into my Cellar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, supposing all to be but one, and the same House; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, I telling him my Name, and rectifying the mistake, The Officer came up to the Stair-head, and craved pardon for his rash and dangerous Error; I returning to my Bed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he with his Prisoners, the same way that he came; (my Door into the House, Court, or Quadrangle, being all this time fast lockt, and bolted) as we left it, at our going to bed.</p>

                        <p>O how doth our righteous God humble, affright and punish the proud, wanton, and beautiful Persons of our times, by this Tyrant: Who, as the Lord's Bayliff, having seiz'd their whole Bodies upon Execution, for the Debt of Sin; and baffled, and fool'd their expected Rescuers, their deified Physicians, binds his Prisoners Hand and Foot unto their Beds; Regards not their groans, sighs, and teares that falls from their late amorous, and lascivious Eyes; which he seales up with a scab, singing off, (as Peasants do their Swine) even unto baldness, their curiously cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, powdered, and abused Hair; swells up, and greatens their Heads, and Faces, beyond all proportion, even unto monstrous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; Cloaths their Idoliz'd, and beautiful Faces, and Bodies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Silk, and Tissues; of curious paints, promates, and cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly washes; at first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with <hi>Job</hi>-like Boiles, and Ulcerated Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; afterwards, with a loathsome, ugly, and stinking tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Leprosie; and when that shakes off, he brands, and stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizes them, with most dis-figuring Marks; that so all may know, that looks on them, under whose Tyranny they have been? As for their smiling and inticing Lips, their false Tongues, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pycurian Throats, the Instruments of Voice; by all which, they used to quaver, and warble forth wanton Aires, and deluding words; He commands to silence, and binds them by the strict,

and sore Bonds of outward and inward Tumors, and Imposthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; to be dumb, and quiet, scarcely permitting them so much liberty, as to send relief, and nourishment, to their almost-starved, and languishing Mother-Nature.</p>
                        <p>O Lord! hast thou no less than four times delivered my self, and six times my second-self, my dear Wife, from this painful, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, loathsome, unsatiable, and dis-figuring Malady, even when it seized upon others of our Family?

                        <p>At the discovery of this Enemy, we were both afrighted, and the more, (which may seem extraordinary, and strange,) because it was dead, whereas usually living, not dead Adversaries are hurtful.</p>

                        <p>NO Person, time, place, or Company upon Earth, is free from danger; not <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> who was stab'd, and slain, in the Senate-House of <hi>Rome</hi>; although a Person as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, as great; in a time of Peace, and in a Place, that was the richest, and strongest Piece of the Worlds head; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the Capitol; and in the mid'st of an Assembly of the justest, gravest, wisest, greatest, richest, and valiantest Men of the whole Earth.</p>
                        <p>But it may be Objected, that although civil Persons, times, places, and Senates, may be unsecure; yet Ecclesiastical are not so, and therefore they, their times of Worship, and Assemblies, are at the least, by the papal Cannon-Laws, stiled and made spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and priviledged; their Synods and Counsels, sacred; and their Churches, and Monasteries, Sanctuaries; not only for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but for the most flagitious Persons, such as Traitors, and Murderers.</p>

Pope, in their Room; which Election is the present Foundation of all the succeeding Popes, and their actings; which if the Papists, and their Champions the Jesuits, deny to be legal, where will they finde a Pope, Papacy, and Succession ever since <hi>Peter,</hi> or since <hi>John</hi> the XXIV. yea, all actings by, and since Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the V. are illegal, and therefore Null? If they affirm it legal, then they confess their Church had three Heads, or Popes at once; that the Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> hath a right to call together, when he pleases, a General Council: that such a General Counsel hath a right to Depose Pope, or Popes.

Nay,<note place="margin">Psal. 12.3.</note> what can the righteous do? Wherefore my humble suit unto our Master-buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, is, to keep the Foundation unmoveable, not permitting a Resurrection to ancient Hereticks before the time, that so what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Men build thereon, whether it be Gold or Stubble,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.12.</note> may be brought to the Test in this Fiery Tryal.</p>
                  <p>Stand fast therefore Brethren in that liberty wherein Christ hath made us free,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.1.13.</note> not making your liberty a Cloak for malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, not for an occasion to the Flesh, but by love serve one another; judging thus of one another, that he that loves his brother, abides in the light; but he that hates his brother, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he may boast of new discoveries, walks in darkness,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.9.1.</note> and knows not whether he goes. Because that darkness hath blinded his eyes, and that whatsoever seems to be religious, and yet bridles not his Tongue, he deceives his own heart,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.16.</note> and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is vain.</p>
                  <p>But that I may not only perswade, but offer my Mite, I shall in all humility propose a medium; which if found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Word of God, may through the blessing of the Almighty make up the breach, and reconcile your greatest difference.</p>
                  <p>I conceive you both agree in these particulars, That all shall be Members,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.34.</note> and have right to vote in your Churches (from which Votes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.11.</note> Women are excepted) shall not only be free from just scandal, that is prophaness, and the impenitent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of any known Sin,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.11.</note> but be indowed with a sufficiency of knowledge;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.14, 17</note> to which end (since your accord in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion) I hope there will be speedily set forth and establisht, one short Catechisme for Information and Examination. Next, in condescention to the impediments, I hear it is mutually resolved, that the Government of their respective Members, reconciling of inferiour differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ordering their Conversations, even as far as Or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dination,
<pb facs="tcp:59395:245"/>
and the Censure of Excommunication, respect being had in Appeals to the Advice and Results of the Classes and Provincial Synods, and saving to the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi> their right be ordered by their particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 2.21.</note>Thus far we are knit together in one spiritual building and Temple of God. The great difference, if I understand it, is, the Tegument and Covering, which is indeed the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, coupling and strength of the whole Aedifice: as where shall rest (as to us) under the same Scepter, the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and concluding Power, the end of Appeals, the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that unlimited Plea, and over-much extended liberty of Conscience,<note place="margin">Joh: 17.21.</note> that so we may be one, as Christ and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are one; this, some of you fix in a general Assembly, others limit to a particular Congregation; The first pleads not only Scripture analogically, but prudence for preserving union, and preventing of Tumults; as also antiquity, from the parallel in general Counsels and Parliaments, affirming that the other way, hath no Grounds in Scripture, since Churches were necessarily independant, no State being then Christian, that this way (by reason that our corrupt Nature hath no check) is destructive to the Unity of Religion: Since, according to the number of the Congregations will their Opinions, as also pernicious to Common-wealths; there being no Fewds so bloody and irreconcileable, as those that break out about points of Faith; instance in the Warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Turke</hi> and <hi>Persian,</hi> Papists and Protestants in the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Contestations and <hi>Arian</hi> Persecutions.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, They conclude an inconsistency in this way with Relations and Callings, disaffection and departure from Bed, Board, Families, and Imployments, being experimental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of Religious differences.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, the contracting party affirm, that a general Assembly differs but in Name from a Conclave of Cardinals, or Prelatical Synod, that every Member of the Church is free, and ought not in matters of Faith, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude himself by Proxy, that no Church hath power over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or brethren (since the Apostles,) have dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Consciences of their brethren, that their platform of Church Government ought to be, and is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:59395:245"/>
the Evangelical Scripture sets forth theirs, and no other.</p>
                  <p>Now dear Brethren, give me your pardon and leave with <hi>Moses,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 2.13.</note> to step in betwixt your Combatings with his <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s words, Why do ye contend, being ye are Brethren?<note place="margin">Gen. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> it may be God giving a blessing, and each of you in his hand, I shall in my Preposition be a Medium to unite you, (only despise not my endeavours) since the Lord hides many things from the wise and prudent,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.25.</note> and reveales them to Babes.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, I observe neither of you arrogate to your selves an infallibility, but piously seek an Orthodox and prudential way of Government, for the attaining and preserving GOD's truth; blessed are your endeavours; yea they shall be blessed. Wherefore I ask the <hi>Presbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> Why do ye extol and lift up a general Assembly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the rest of the Flock of Christ? To the <hi>Independents,</hi> I say, Why do ye prefer the Judgment of one particular Congregation, before the joynt Votes of all refined Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches of the Kingdome? surely the first will yield to me, that where most of God's People are, in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is the greatest measure of his Spirit; and to such Assemblies principally, and to their Votes, are made all those gracious promises (I need not quote the places) concerning Christ's Spirit and Presence; I mean to such a Multitude, not of Men only, but of purged and visible Believers.</p>
                  <p>The other, I presume, both from Grounds of Scripture, and Reason, will grant, that could the Votes of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and received Members of Christ, of their several Churches, be joyntly taken, and in one place, they must be accepted, and are but as the Vote of one great Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; which though it hath an increase of Ministers and Elders, yet according to a true definition, for Essence, is a Church, and that more eminently, though not more truly, than the particular Congregations, of whom it consists, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as an Assembly made up of many Families,<note place="margin">Col. 4.15.</note> called by the Apostles, Churches of God;<note place="margin">Rom. 16.5.</note> is more excellent than its subdivisions.</p>
                  <p>But that I may make good by Scripture, this incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:59395:246"/>
of Churches conjuncture and union of Votes, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you of these Three Chief Proofs, and Lights of Church Government, both for Doctrine and manners. The first shewes the Primitive and Apostolique way of ending Controversies in Doctrine, by the summoning that great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the Members of the Churches of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Judea</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which Churches read <hi>Acts</hi> 11.1. and <hi>Gallat.</hi> 1.22. Therefore called a Multitude, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.12. In which the Apostles (although indued with an infallible Spirit) and the Elders of the Churches did not only Vote, and Decree matters (though that in many cases wherein the People consents, such Votes may be, and are necessary, expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and lawful) but the whole Church, Verse 22. which compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Verse 41. wherein Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand are said to be converted; and with <hi>Acts</hi> 4. Verse 4. wherein Five Thousand were by One Sermon converted, clearly demonstrates, that this Assembly was composed of many Congregations, as further appeares from the Apostles Teaching and Preaching in every House, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.42. How else could Eight Thousand Men, besides Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, be taught and edified.</p>
                  <p>The like is proved from the Election and choice of the Seven Deacons, by the Vote of the Multitude, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.5. where the Apostles, and Elders also were present, yea those whom the Holy Ghost <hi>Acts</hi> 2.47. calls a Church in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall respect,<note place="margin">Compare Rom. 16.16. with the Postscript of that Epistle.</note> he calls Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.31. in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational consideration. And lastly, in <hi>Corinth</hi> there more than probably appeares to be many Congregations, else whence or where were these discentions and divisions? some saying, I am of <hi>Paul</hi>; others, I am of <hi>Apollo,</hi> of <hi>Cephas,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. All the Members of which were commanded to meet in one Assembly for the Excommunication of the incestuous Persons, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. Where note, they were to meet, to whom the Epistle was directed, and who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished to mourn: But the Epistle and Exhortation was directed to the whole Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and not to the Elders only; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the whole Congregation, when they shall desire it, have a right to a Vote and censure.</p>
                  <p>Having thus fully proved by Scripture, that in Cities and Provinces, and consequently in Kingdomes, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of particular Congregations may, and were by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb facs="tcp:59395:246"/>
to meet for the deciding of any great difference, yea, the Apostles, though of an infallible Spirit, did not contradict, but gave both approbation and institution to that liberty.<note place="margin">Act. 1.15.23.</note> I shall with humblest submission offer this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing preposition,<note place="margin">Act. 21.22.</note> as a right and fit Medium of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. That in all great Schismes and Heresies, over-spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whole Churches, if the breach cannot be made up by advice, argument, and subordinate Discipline, either Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational or <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> an Appeal be made to a general Assembly, who after the stating, disputing, and voting such Points in difference, together with the merit of the offence (the Recusant Church or Churches, notwithstanding conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing unsatisfied) that then the Assembly adjourn that Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions for Three Moneths; in which time, the Assembly, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of each Congregation to be ordered after Fasting and Prayer, to state the Question, and declare their Arguments, and Judgment of the General Assembly to their particular Churches, and so accordingly at that Meeting receive and bring up each Churches Vote and Sentence, with the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (because of the disproportion of Parishes) summ'd up of those that affirm, and those that discent, that so at the next Session the Question may be decided and concluded by the major Vote, both of Churches and Members; which Scripture-way will not only by a Religious Policy from time to time discover the temper, pulse, and inclination of the whole Kingdome, and consequently administer a great help and direction to Government, but will give full satisfaction to all, (unless to obstinate Hereticks) as being the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Vote (even by the Pole) of all the visible and undividual Christians of the Kingdome politically united, as in one Congregation; yea the disobedient will be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuse, and justly lyable to their Sentence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</p>
                  <p>But put the Question, a considerable number of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the Kingdome give in their Vote, with a new opinion hazarding a rent and division in the Nation?</p>
                  <p>I Answer, that upon so sad an occasion, our Church (in imitation of the ancient calling of General Counsels, upon the over-flowing of Heresie) ought to desire the Judgment and assistance, and that by additional Votes (if it may be) of all the reformed Churches in the World,
<pb facs="tcp:59395:247"/>
which comes neerest to the Judgment of the holy Catholick Church, the Body of Christ, to which he hath promised his presence and spirit of truth to the end; and therefore must,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> as to each particular State or Church, though not infallibly, yet prudentially, end and conclude by obedience, either active or passive, the discenting Churches, whom the civil Magistrate, after the Churches Excommunication, is to order by Banishment or lesser punishment, according as their Doctrines shall be more or less prejudicial to the State wherein they live:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 15. v. 12, 13, 14.</note> Which, since they suffer as evil doers, is (as to that Common-wealth) a civil and necessary act of preservative Justice, not an inforcing of Conscience or Persecution.<note place="margin">Mat. 18.17.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus fervently beseeching the blessing of the All-wise God, upon my poor endeavours, trusting that in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of love and charity, I have in sincerity and plainness declared unto you the mind of Christ in all humility, I conclude,</p>
