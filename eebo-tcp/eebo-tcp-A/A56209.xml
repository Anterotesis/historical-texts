            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether their placing armed Gards that Evening at the House, and all approaches to it and the next Morning too, and giving <hi>Colonel Okey,</hi> and <hi>Colonel Alured</hi> (the Commanders of their Gards) their <hi>Serjeant</hi> and <hi>Door-keepers, strict special Commands and Orders, not to suffer any of the old secluded Members</hi> so much as to come into the <hi>outward Lobby</hi> before <hi>the House,</hi> (whether Footboys, Apprentices, and other Persons of all sorts had free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,) much lesse to enter into the <hi>House</hi>; and their forcible secluding of Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerard,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony Irby,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Evelin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Serjeant Maynard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> and 15. other Members more on Tuesday morning, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 27. out of the very Lobby, in pursuance of their Orders, till they crowded into the <hi>Lobby</hi> by degrees against the <hi>Door-keepers,</hi> and <hi>Gards</hi> wills, who at first oft shut the Doors against them, though they admitted Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, and others to pass in and out: And their seclusion of them out of the <hi>House</hi> when in the <hi>Lobby,</hi> by keeping the House door fast locked against them, and ordering the <hi>Door-keeper and Serjeant not to open it,</hi> notwithstanding many demands to open it, and Messages to them for that purpose, which they slighted; not vouchsafing to take any notice of, after two full hours attendance by the Members on them in the <hi>Lobby</hi>; nor so much as sending any <hi>Member,</hi> nor their Serjeant out to them; as they usually do to every ordinary Petitioner, or person attending them upon publick or private occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Be not a just ground and provocation for these and all other secluded Members, (being about 4. times more in number and interest to those then sitting, and the real <hi>House of Commons,</hi>) with all the respective Counties, Cities, Boroughs, Ports for which they serve, with as high co<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="3">3. Whether this their disdainfull, uncivil, unbrotherly Treating of their fellow-Members (desiring nothing else but a brotherly association with them, to compose the manifold Distractions, and make up the wide Breaches of our Sinking, Dying Nations, by their United Councils and Endeavours, and to Regulate all Exorbitances, occasioned by their heady Councils and Miscariages) in not allowing them the Privileges of Porters and Footboyes to enter into their outward Lobby, in taking no notice of them, and putting this fresh affront upon them, after so many former Indignities, in the midst of their and our Domestick Confusions and fears from forein parts, be not an evident Demonstration; that they intend neither the publike Peace, Unity, nor settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Government, Laws, Liberties, or Nations, but their unjust support of their own private Interests, Rapines, ambitious Tyrannical Usurpations and Exercises of Supreme Parliamentary Civil and Military Authority over our three Nations to imbroyl them in new Wars and Confusions, to prey upon the small remainder of their Real and Personal Estates, by the power of the Sword, now gotten into their hands, out of the Army-Officers; who abused it likewise to the oppressing and enslaving of the people, and created them a Parliament without the secluded Members, and House of Peers?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether their disdainfull, Injurious forcible seclusion of the Members, by their own special Orders and Commands to their Gards and Officers now, be not a shrewd Evidence, that their former seclusions, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 6. and 7. 1648. and <hi>May</hi> 7. and 9. 1659. (acted by, and fathered on the Army-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and seemingly disowned by themselves) were secretly procured &amp; countenanced by them, thus openly owning their last seclusion, by their precedent Orders and subsequent approbation of it; and that at their very first re-assembling, after their own late forcible seclusion, by <hi>Lamberts</hi> and <hi>Hewsons Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> now Entertained and Imployed in their service, to seclude, and keep out their old honest fellow Members, of Untainted Integrity and merit? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not a greater breach of Privilege, Trust, Duty, Tyranny, Perjury, and Treason in them, against all former Declarations, the Protestation, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant, taken and Subscribed by them, with hands lifted up to the most High God, thus to seclude their fellow Members: than it was in <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Harrison, April</hi> 20. 1653. or for <hi>Lambert October</hi> 13. last to seclude and turn themselves out of doors, after their declaring and voting it <hi>Treason, Perjury</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> in them? Whether this their secluding of the Members by Col. <hi>Okey</hi> himself, and others who appeared most active against their Exclusion by <hi>Lambert,</hi> will not draw a self-condemnation on them, as acting by their commands, against their Consciences; and justify both <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi> and <hi>Lamberts</hi> seclusion of themselves? And justly encourage all their newly reduced Soldiers and others, to shut and turn themselves out of the House again upon any emergent occasion or discontent, with greater boldness and impunity than before, since they justified their last seclusion, by their former <hi>underhand encouragements of them to seclude the Majority of the Members, who over-voted them in</hi> Decemb. 1648. and give them Orders to seclude them now again upon the same account in the same month of <hi>December, for fear they should over-vote them if re-admitted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether their printed <hi>Vote,</hi> Decem. 27. <hi>To take the business of their absent Members into debate on the</hi> 5. <hi>of Ianuary next</hi>; instead of giving admittance, or any answer to the 22. secluded Members waiting for an answer in the Lobby above 2. hours, be not a meer dilatory <hi>Cheat</hi> put upon the <hi>secluded Members,</hi> the City of <hi>London,</hi> and whole <hi>Nation</hi>; to delay their admission till they have put new Gards on, and drawn up all their forces to <hi>London,</hi> to over-awe the City, and hinder their long-delayed <hi>Militia</hi> for their own security; and setled the Militia of every County under their own commands, to enslave the whole City and Nation to their Tyranny and usurped <hi>Parliamentary</hi> Power; and then they will not only forcibly keep out all the Members, but absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eject them, unlesse they will take their new Oath and Ingagement: As is evident by their <hi>Speakers</hi> prohibiting the Lord Maior and Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil on Saturday last to set up their Chains and <hi>settle their Militia</hi>; and their Order and Vote on <hi>Munday</hi> night against all forces raised without their Order, to hinder the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>litia</hi> in the City, when they commanded the Militia in the <hi>Suburbs</hi> and <hi>Westminster</hi> to meet and Act that day: And by some of their discourses to two seeluded Members; <hi>That there was no hopes of their admission, unlesse they were for a Commonwealth, would take the Ingagement, and confirm what they had done</hi>: and thereby become as guilty, treacherous, perfidious, disloyal, and hurtfull to the publike as themselves) which those Members assured them, <hi>they would never submit to,</hi> being against the Privilege of Parliament, their Judgements, Consciences, Protestation, Covenant, former Oathes upon their first <hi>admission as Members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Whether the City, or English Nation, can expect the least justice ease or redresse of their insupportable Burdens, Taxes, and Impositions from these new Tax-masters, who (though they are not yet the Tenth part of a full <hi>Commons House</hi>) presumed to pass and print a New <hi>Act of Parliament, to continue their</hi> expired <hi>Customs and Excises</hi> on them, till <hi>March next?</hi> Whether their unpresidented presumption, in arrogating to themselves the Title, power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Parliament; when all Laws, and Lawbooks resolve, their own Consciences and the whole Nation infallibly know them to be no Parliament, nor Commons house, hath not brought them within the compasse and penalty of this Clause in their own last Act, before their Dissolution by <hi>Lambert, October</hi> 11. intituled, <hi>An Act against raising of Money upon the people without their Consent in Parliament: And be it further enacted, That no person or persons shall after the</hi> 11. <hi>of October,</hi> 1659. <hi>Assess, levy, collect, gather or receive, any Customs, Imposts, Excise, Assessment, Contribution. Tax, Tallage, or any sum or sums of money, or other Impositions whatsoever, upon the People of this Commonwealth, without their consent in Parliament, or as by Law might have béen done before the Third of November,</hi> 1640. <hi>And be it further enacted and declared, That every person offending against this Act,</hi> (therefore every of themselves who passed this new Act, Decemb. 27 and those who shall put it in execution) <hi>shall be and are hereby adjudged to be guilty of High Treason, and shall forfeit and suffer as in case of High Treason.</hi> Whether the people of this Commonwealth (the thousand part whereof knew not of their new sitting) did ever consent to this sudden extemporary new Act, made the first morning of their sitting in lesse than two hours space, when there were but 42. Members in the House; 22. secluded Members at the door, and near 250. more Members yet living, (besides the whole House of Lords, who must stand for <hi>Cyphers</hi>) absent, and not privy to their Session, or this Act? If not, (as is unquestionable) whether by this their own Law and Act, <hi>they be not adjudged to be guilty of High Treason, and to forfeit and suffer as in case of High Treason,</hi> for this their imposing and continuing of Customs and Excises on the people; as well as for their <hi>seclusion</hi> of their Members; which they voted to be <hi>Treason in Lambert?</hi> And whether the Offices and Common Soldiers can upon this account expect any pay from the <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Country,</hi> or <hi>Indemnity</hi> for secluding those Now sitting, if they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend again in <hi>secluding the greatest part of the Members,</hi> which are in truth the only House, which can only really pay and indemaifie them?</p>
