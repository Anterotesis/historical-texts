         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Saladyne</hi> hauing thus set vp the Scedule, and hangd about
his Fathers hearse many passionate Poems, that France might
suppose him to be passing sorrowful, hee clad himselfe and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
all in black, and in such sable sutes discoursed his griefe: but
as the <hi>Hiena</hi> when she mourns is then most guileful, so <hi>Saladine</hi>
vnder this shewe of griefe, shaddowed a heart ful of contented
thoughts. The Tyger though he hide his claws, wil at last disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
his rapine: the Lions looks are not the maps of his meaning,
nor a mans phisnomie is not the display of his secrets. Fire cannot
be hid in the straw, nor the nature of man so concealed, but at last
it wil haue his course: nurture &amp; art may do much, but that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura

               <p>So fares it with <hi>Saladine,</hi> for after a months mourning was
past, he fel to consideration of his Fathers testament, how hee had
bequeathed more to his yoonger brothers than himselfe, that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader</hi>
was his Fathers darling, but now vnder his tuition, that as
yet they were not come to yeares, &amp; he being their gardain, might
(if not defraud them of their due) yet make such hauocke of theyr

                  <hi>SAladyne,</hi> how art thou disquieted in thy thoughts, &amp; perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
with a world of restlesse passions, hauing thy minde troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the tenour of thy Fathers testament, &amp; thy heart fiered
with the hope of present preferment? By the one thou art coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saild
to content thee with thy fortunes: by the other, perswaded
<pb facs="tcp:20331:7"/>
to aspire to higher wealth. Riches (<hi>Saladyne</hi>) is a great royaltie,
and there is no sweeter phisick than store. <hi>Auicen</hi> like a foole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
in his Aphorismes to say, that gold was the most pretious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storatiue,
and that treasure was the most excellent medecine of
the minde. Oh <hi>Saladyne,</hi> what were thy Fathers precepts brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
into the winde? hast thou so soone forgotten his principles?
did he not warne thee from coueting without honor, and climing
without vertue? did he not forbid thee to ayme at any action that
should not bee honourable? and what wil bee more preiudiciall to
thy credite, than the carelesse ruine of thy brothers prosperitie;
and wilt thou become the subuersion of their fortunes? is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sweeter thing than concord, or a more precious Iewel then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie?
are you not sonnes of one father, siens of one tree, birds of
one neast? and wilt thou become so vnnaturall as to robbe them,
whom thou shouldest relieue? No <hi>Salydine,</hi> intreat them with
fauours, and entertaine them with loue, so shalt thou haue thy
conscience cleare and thy renowne excellent. Tush, what wordes
are these base foole, farre vnfit (if thou be wise) for thy humour.
What though thy father at his death talked of many friuilous
matters, as one that doted for age, &amp; raued in his sicknes, shal his
words be axioms, and his talke be so authenticall, that thou wilt
(to obserue them) preindice thy selfe? No no <hi>Saladyne,</hi> sicke
mens willes that are parole, and haue neither hand nor seale, are
like the lawes of a Cittie written in dust, which are broken with
the blast of euery winde. What man thy father is dead, and hee
can neither helpe thy fortunes, nor measure thy actions: therfore
bury his words with his carkasse, and be wise for thy selfe. What,
tis not so olde as true:

               <p>In this humour was <hi>Saladyne</hi> making his brother <hi>Rosader</hi>
his foote boy, for the space of two or three yeares, keeping him in
such seruile subiection, as if he had been the sonne of any country
vassal. The yoong Gentleman bare all with patience, til on a day
walkyng in the Garden by himselfe, he began to consider how he
was the sonne of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> a knight ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wmed for
many victories, &amp; a gentleman famozed for his vertues, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the testament of his father, hee was not only kept from
his land, and intreated as a seruant, but smothered in such secret
slauerie, as hee might not attaine to any honourable actions. As
quoth hee to himselfe (nature woorking these effectuall passions)
why should I that am a Gentleman borne, passe my time in such
vnnatural drudgery? were it not better either in <hi>Paris</hi> to become
a scholler, or in the court a courtier, or in the field a souldier, then
to liue a foote boy to my own brother: nature hath lent me wit to
conceiue, but my brother denied mee art to contemplate: I haue
strength to performe any honorable exployt, but no libertie to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
my vertuous indeuours: those good partes that God
hath bestowed vpon mee, the enuy of my brother doth smother in
obscuritie: the harder is my fortune, &amp; the more his frowardnes.
With that casting vp his hand he felt haire on his face, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
his beard to bud, for choler hee began to blush, and swore
to himselfe he would be no more subiect to such slauerie. As thus
hee was ruminating of his melancholie passions, in came <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne</hi>
with his men, and seeing his brother in a browne study, and
to forget his wonted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>euerence, thought to shake him out of his
dumps thus. Sirha (quoth he) what is your heart on your halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peny,
or are you saying a Dirge for your fathers soule? what is
my dinner readie? At this question <hi>Rosader</hi> turning his head
ascance, and bending his browes as if anger there had ploughed
the furrowes of her wrath, with his eyes full of fire, hee made
this replie. Doest thou aske mee (<hi>Saladyne</hi>) for thy Cates? aske
some of thy Churles who are fit for suche an office: I am thine
<pb facs="tcp:20331:8"/>
equal by nature, though not by birth, and though thou hast more
Cardes in the bunch. I haue as many trumpes in my handes as
thy selfe. Let me question with thee, why thou hast few my woods,
spoyled my Manner houses, and made hauocke of suche vten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salles
as my father bequeathed vnto mee? I tell thee <hi>Saladyne,</hi>
either answere mee as a brother, or I wil trouble thee as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie.</p>
               <p>At this replie of <hi>Rosaders, Saladyne</hi> smiled as laughing at
his presumption, and frowned as checking his folly: he therfore
tooke him vp thus shortly. What sirha, wel I see early pricks the
tree that wil prooue a thorne: hath my familiar conuersing with
you made you coy, or my good lookes drawne you to be thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous?
I can quickly remedie such a fault, and I wil bend
the tree while it is a wand: In faith (sir boy) I haue a snaffle for
such a headstrong colt. You sirs lay holde on him and binde him,
and then I wil giue him a cooling carde for his choller. This
made <hi>Rosader</hi> halfe mad, that stepping to a great rake that stood
in the Garden, hee laide such loade vppon his brothers men that
hee hurt some of them, and made the rest of them run away. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladyne</hi>
seeing <hi>Rosader</hi> so resolute, and with his resolution so
valiant, thought his heeles his best safetie, &amp; tooke him to a loaft
adioyning to the Garden, whether <hi>Rosader</hi> pursued him hotlie.
<hi>Saladyne</hi> afraide of his brothers furie, cried out to him thus. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader</hi>
be not so rash, I am thy brother &amp; thine elder, and if I haue
done thee wrong ile make thee amendes: reuenge not anger in
blood, for so shalt thou staine the vertue of old sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauz:</hi>
say wherein thou art discontent and thou shalt bee satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
Brothers frownes ought not to be periodes of wrath: what
man looke not so sowerly, I know we shalbe friendes, and better
friends then we haue been. For, <hi>Amantium ira amoris redinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratio
est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These wordes appeased the choller of <hi>Rosader,</hi> (for he was
of a milde and curteous nature) so that hee layde downe his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and vpon the faith of a Gentleman, assured his brother hee
would offer him no preiudice: wherupon <hi>Saladyne</hi> came down,
and after a little pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they went into the house arme in arme togither, to the great
content of all the old seruants of sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> Thus
continued the pad hidden in the strawe, til it chaunced that <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismond</hi>
King of <hi>France</hi> had appointed for his pleasure a day of
Wrastling and of Tournament to busie his Commons heades,
least being idle, their thoughts should runne vppon more serious
matters, &amp; call to remembrance their old banished King, a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
there was to stand against all commers a <hi>Norman,</hi> a man
of tall stature and of great strength: so valiant, that in many such
conflicts he alwaies bare away the victorie, not onely ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them which hee incountred, but often with the weight of his
bodie killing them outright. <hi>Saladyne</hi> hearing of this, thinking
now not to let the ball fal to the ground, but to take apportunitie
by the forehead: first by secret meanes conuented with the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and procured him with rich rewards to sweare, that if <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader</hi>
came within his clawes hee should neuer more returne to

of pelfe, as (<hi>Quis nisi mentis inops oblatum respuit aurum.</hi>)
taking great gifts for litle Gods, tooke the crownes of <hi>Saladyne</hi>
to performe the Stratagem. Hauing thus the Champion tied to
his vilanous determination by oath, hee prosecuted the intent of
his purpose thus. Hee went to yoong <hi>Rosader,</hi> (who in all his
thoughts reacht at honour, and gazed no lower then vertue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him) and began to tel him of this Tournament &amp; Wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

brother (quoth hee) for the honor of sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> our
renowmed father, to famous that house that neuer hath him found
without men approoued in Chiualrie, shewe thy resolution to be
peremptorie. For my selfe thou knowest though I am eldest by
birth, yet neuer hauing attempted any deedes of Armes, I am
yongest to performe any Martial exploytes, knowing better how
to suruey my lands, then to charge my Launce: my brother <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandyne</hi>
hee is at <hi>Paris</hi> poring on a fewe papers, hauing more
insight into Sophistrie and principles of Philosophie, then anie warlyke indeueurs: but thou <hi>Rosader</hi> the yoongest in yeares,
<pb facs="tcp:20331:9"/>
but the eldest in valour, art a man of strength and darest doo what
honour allowes thee: take thou my fathers Launce, his Sword,
and his Horse, and hye thee to the Tournament, and either there
valiantly cracke a speare, or trie with the <hi>Norman</hi> for the palme
of actiuitie. The words of <hi>Saladyne</hi> were but spurres to a free
horse, for hee had scarce vttered them, ere <hi>Rosader</hi> tooke him in
his armes, taking his proffer so kindly, that hee promised in what
hee might to requite his curtesie. The next morrow was the day
of the Tournament, and <hi>Rosader</hi> was so desirous to shew his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roycal
thoughts, that he past the night with litle sleep: but assoone
as <hi>Phoebus</hi> had vailed the Curteine of the night, &amp; made <hi>Aurora</hi>
blush with giuing her the <hi>bezoles labres</hi> in her siluer Couch, he
gat him vp, and taking his leaue of his brother, mounted himselfe
towardes the place appoynted, thinking euery mile ten leagues
til he came there. But leauing him so desirous of the iourney: to
<hi>Torismond</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> who hauing by force banished
<hi>Gerismond</hi> their lawful King that liued as an outlaw in the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of <hi>Arden,</hi> sought now by all meanes to keep the <hi>French</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
with all sports that might breed their content. Amongst the
rest he had appointed this solemne Turnament, wherunto hee in
most solemne maner resorted, accompanied with the twelue peers
of <hi>France,</hi> who rather for fearthen loue graced him with the shew
of their dutiful fauours: to feede their eyes, and to make the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
pleased with the sight of most rare and glistring obiects,
he had appoynted his owne daughter <hi>Alinda</hi> to be there, and the
faire <hi>Rosalynd</hi> daughter vnto <hi>Gerismond,</hi> with al the the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
Dammoselles that were famous for their features in all
<hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus in that place did loue and war triumph in a simpathy: for
such as were martial, might vse their Launce to be renowmed for
the excellency of their Cheualrie, and suche as were amorous,
might glut themselues with gazing on the beauties of most hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
creatures. As euery mans eye had his seueral suruey, and
fancie was partial in their lookes, yet all in general applauded
the admirable riches that Nature bestowed on the face of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salynde:</hi>
for vppon her cheekes there seemed a battaile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Graces, who should bestow most fauours to make
<pb facs="tcp:20331:10"/>
her excellent. The blush that gloried <hi>Luna</hi> when shee kist the
Shepheard or the hilles of <hi>Latmos,</hi> was not tainted with such
a pleasant dye, as the Uermilion flourishe on the siluer hue of
<hi>Rosalyndes</hi> countenance: her eyes were lyke those Lampes
that make the wealthie couert of the Heauens more gorgious,
sparkling fauour and disdaine: courteous and yet toye, as if in
them <hi>Venus</hi> had placed all her amorets, and <hi>Diana</hi> all her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie.
The tramelles of her hayre, foulded in a call of Golde,
so farre surpast the burnishe glister of the mettal, as the Sunne
doth the meanest Starre in brightnesse: the tresses that foldes in
the browes of <hi>Apollo</hi> were not halfe so rich to the sight, for in her
hayres it seemed loue had laide her selfe in ambush, to intrappe
the proudest eye that durst gaze vppon their excellence: what
should I neede to decipher her particular beauties, when by the
censure of all, shee was the Paragon of all earthly perfection.
This <hi>Rosalynd</hi> sat I say with <hi>Alinda</hi> as a beholder of these
sportes, and made the <hi>Caualiers</hi> cracke their Lances with more

at last when the Tournament ceased, the wrastling beganne, and
the <hi>Norman</hi> presented himselfe as a chalenger against all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,

amazed all that durst attempt to incounter with him in any deed
of actiuitie: til at last a lustie <hi>Francklin</hi> of the Country came
with two tall men that were his sonnes of good lyniaments and
comely personage: the eldest of these dooing his obeysance to the
King entered the Lyst, and presented himselfe to the <hi>Norman,</hi>
who straight coapt with him, and as a man that would triumph
in the glorie of his strength, roused himselfe with such furie, that
not onely hee gaue him the fall, but killed him with the weight of
of his corpulent personage: which the yoonger brother seeing,
lepte presently into the place, and thirstie after the reuenge,
assayled the <hi>Norman</hi> with such valour, that at the first incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hee brought him to his knees: which repulst so the <hi>Norman,</hi>
that recouering himselfe, feare of disgrace doubling his strength,
hee stept so stearnely to the yoong <hi>Francklin,</hi> that taking him
<pb facs="tcp:20331:10"/>
vp in his armes hee threw him against the grounde so violently,
that hee broake his necke, and so ended his dayes with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
At this vnlookt for massacre, the people murmured, and
were all in a deepe passion of pittie, but the <hi>Francklin,</hi> father
vnto these, neuer chaunged his countenance, but as a man of a
couragious resolution, tooke vp the bodies of his sonnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
shewe of outward discontent.</p>
               <p>All this while stood <hi>Rosader</hi> and sawe this Tragedie: who
noting the vndoubted vertue of the <hi>Francklins</hi> minde, alighted of
from his Horse, and presently sat downe on the grasse, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his boy to pul off his bootes, making him ready to try the
strength of this Champion, being furnished as he would, he clapt
the <hi>Francklin</hi> on the shoulder and said thus. Bold yeoman whose
sonnes haue ended the tearme of their yeares with honour, for
that I see thou scornest fortune with patience, and twhar test the

stand a while and either see me make a third in their Tragedie, or
else reuenge their fal with an honourable triumph, the <hi>Francklin</hi>
seeing so goodly a gentleman to giue him such curteous comfort,
gaue him hartie thankes, with promise to pray for his happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.
With that <hi>Rosader</hi> vailed bonnet to the King, and lightly
leapt within the lists, where noting more the companie then the
combatant, hee cast his eye vpon the troupe of Ladies that gliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
there lyke the starres of heauen, but at last Loue willing to
make him as amourous as hee was valiaunt, presented him
with the sight of <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> whose admirable beautie so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueagled

               <p>The <hi>Normane</hi> seeing this young Gentleman fettered
in the lookes of the Ladyes, draue him out of his <hi>memen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
with a shake by the shoulder: <hi>Rosader</hi> looking backe with
an angrie frowne, as if hee had been wakened from some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt
dreame, discouered to all by the furye of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
that hee was a man of some high thoughts: but when they
<pb facs="tcp:20331:11"/>
all noted his youth, and the sweetnesse of his visage, with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
applause of fauours, they grieued that so goodly a yoong man
should venture in so base an action: but seeing it were to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
to hinder him from his enterprise, they wisht him to bee
graced with the palme of victorie. After <hi>Rosader</hi> was thus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out of his <hi>memento</hi> by the <hi>Norman,</hi> hee roughly clapt to him
with so fierce an incounter, that they both fel to the ground, and
with the violence of the fal were forced to breathe: in which space
the <hi>Norman</hi> called to minde by all tokens, that this was hee
whome <hi>Saladyne</hi> had appoynted him to kil: which coniecture
made him stretch euery limbe, and try euerie sinew, that working
his death hee might recouer the golde, which so bountifuly was
promised him. On the contrary part, <hi>Rosader</hi> while he breathed
was not idle, but stil cast his eye vpon <hi>Rosalynde,</hi> who to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
him with a fauour, lent him such an amorous looke, as might
haue made the most coward desperate: which glance of <hi>Rosalynd</hi>

with a winke: and therefore feared not to daily in the flame, and
to make <hi>Rosader</hi> know she affected him: tooke from her necke

this conquest, accompanyed with a troupe of yoong gentlemen,
that were desirous to be his familiars, went home to his brother
<hi>Saladynes,</hi> who was walking before the gates, to heare what
successe his brother <hi>Rosader</hi> should haue, assuring himself of his
death, and deuising how with dissimuled sorrowe, to celebrate his
funerals: as he was in his thought, he cast vp his eye, and sawe
<pb facs="tcp:20331:12"/>
where <hi>Rosader</hi> returned with the garland on his head, as hauing
won the prize, accompanied with a crue of boon companions:
greeued at this, he stepped in and shut the gate. <hi>Rosader</hi> seeing
this, and not looking for such vnkind entertainment, blusht at the
disgrace, and yet smothering his griefe with a smile, he turned to
the Gentlemen, and desired them to hold his brother excused, for
he did not this vpon any militious intent or nigardize, but being
brought vp in the country, he absented himselfe, as not finding his
nature fit for such youthful company. Thus he sought to shadow
abuses proffered him by his brother, but in vaine, for hee could by
no meanes be suffered to enter: wherupon he ran his foot against
the doore, and brake it open: drawing his sword, and entring bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the Hall, where hee found none (for all were fled) but one
<hi>Adam Spencer</hi> an English man, who had beene an old and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
seruant to Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux:</hi> he for the loue hee bare
to his deceased Maister, fauored the part of <hi>Rosader,</hi> &amp; gaue him
&amp; his such entertainment as he could, <hi>Rosader</hi> gaue him thanks,
and looking about, seeing the Hall empty, saide: Gentlemen, you
are welcome, frolike and be merry, you shall be sure to haue wine
enough, whatsoeuer your fare be, I tel you <hi>Caualiers,</hi> my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the Tables, and set downe whatsoeuer he could find in the
house, but what they wanted in meat, was supplyed with drinke,
yet had they royall cheare, and withal such hartie welcome, as
would haue made the coursest meats, seeme delicates. After they
had feasted and frolicktit twise or thrise with an vpsey freeze, they
all tooke their leaue of <hi>Rosader</hi> and departed. Assoone as they
were gone, <hi>Rosader</hi> growing impatient of the abuse, drewe his

yet by the meanes of <hi>Adam Spencer,</hi> who sought to continue
friendshippe and amity betwixt the brethren, and through the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
submission of <hi>Saladyne,</hi> they were once againe reconciled,
and put vp all forepassed iniuries with a peaceable agreement, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
together for a good space in such brotherly loue, as did not

neighbors glad of such friendly concord. <hi>Saladine</hi> hiding fire
in the straw, and concealing a poysoned hate in a peaceable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,

               <p>INfortunate <hi>Rosalynde,</hi> whose misfortunes are more than thy
yeares, and whose passions are greater then thy patience. The
blossoms of thy youth are mixt wich the frosts of enuy, &amp; the hope
of thy ensuing fruits perish in the bud. Thy father is by <hi>Toris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
banisht from the crown, &amp; thou the vnhappy daughter of a
King detained captiue, liuing as disquieted in thy thoughts, as
thy father disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented in his exile. Ah <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> what cares wait
vpon a crown? what griefs are incident to dignity? what sorrows
haunt royal pallaces? The greatest seas haue the sorest stormes,
the highest birth subiect to the most bale, &amp; of al trees the Cedars
soonest shake with the wind: smal Currents are euer calme, lowe
valleys not scortcht in any lightnings, nor base men tyed to anie
baleful preiudice. Fortune flies, &amp; if she touch pouerty, it is with
hir heele, rather disdaining their want with a frown, then enuying
their welth with disparagement. Oh <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> hadst thou beene
born low, thou hadst not falne so high, &amp; yet beeing great of blood,
<pb facs="tcp:20331:13"/>
thine honour is more, if thou brookest misfortune with patience.
Suppose I contrary fortune with content, yet Fates vnwilling
to haue me any waies happy, haue forced loue to set my thoughts
on fire with fancie. Loue <hi>Rosalynd?</hi> becommeth it women in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
to thinke on loue? Tush, desire hath no respect of persons,
<hi>Cupid</hi> is blind and shooteth at random, assoone hitting a ragge,
as a robe, and piercing assoone the bosome of a Captiue, as the
brest of a Libertine. Thou speakest it poore <hi>Rosalynd</hi> by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
for being euery way distrest, surcharged with cares, and ouer
growne with sorrowes, yet amidst the heape of all these mishaps,
Loue hath lodged in thy heart the perfection of yong <hi>Rosader,</hi> a
man euery way absolute as wel for his inward life, as for his out
ward lyniaments, able to content the eye with beauty, &amp; the eare
with the report of his vertue. But consider <hi>Rosalynde</hi> his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and thy present estate, thou art poore and without patry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and yet the daughter of a Prince, he a yonger brother, and
voyd of such possessions as eyther might maintaine thy dignities
or reuenge thy fathers iniuries. And hast thou not learned this of
other Ladies, that louers cannot liue by looks: that womens ears
are sooner content with a pound of <hi>giue me,</hi> then a dram of <hi>heare
me:</hi> that gold is sweeter than eloquence: that loue is a fire, and
wealth is the fewel: that <hi>Venus</hi> coffers should be euer ful. Then
<hi>Rosalynd,</hi> seeing <hi>Rosader</hi> is poore, thinke him lesse beautiful,
because hee is in want, and account his vertues but qualities of
course, for that he is not indued with wealth. Doth not <hi>Horace</hi>
tell thee what methode is to be vsed in loue:
<q>Querenda pecunia primum, post nummos virtus.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Tush <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> be not ouer rash: leape not before thou looke:
either loue such a one as may with his landes purchase thy liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
or els loue not all. Chuse not a faire face with an empty purse,
but say as most women vse to say,
<q>Si nihil attuleris, ibis Homere foras.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Why <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> can such base thoughts harbour in such high
beauties? Can the degree of a princesse, the daughter of <hi>Geris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
harbour such seruile conceites, as to prize gold more than
honor, or to measure a Gentleman by his wealth, not by his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
No <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> blush at thy base resolution, and say if thou
<pb facs="tcp:20331:13"/>
louest, eyther <hi>Rosader</hi> or none: and why? because <hi>Rosader</hi> is
both beautiful and vertuous. Smiling to her selfe to thinke of
her new intertained passions, taking vp her Lute that lay by her,
she warbled out this dittie.</p>

of France, who were enamoured of her beauty: which <hi>Toris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
perceiuing, fearing least her perfection might be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his Preiudice, and the hope of his fruit ende in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of her blossomes, he thought to banish her from the court:
for quoth he to himselfe, her face is so ful of fauour, that it pleads

that she wil proue to me as <hi>Helen</hi> did to <hi>Priam:</hi> some one

I wist in all these actions, shee tarryes not about the Court, but
shall (as an exile) eyther wander to her father, or else seeke other

he breathed out this censure vnto her before the Peers, that char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
her that that night shee were not seene about the Court: for

               <p>IF (mighty <hi>Torismond</hi>) I offend in pleading for my friend,
let the law of amitie craue pardon for my boldnesse: for where
there is depth of affection, there friendship alloweth a priuiledge.
<hi>Rosalynd</hi> and I haue beene fostered vp from our infancies, and
noursed vnder the harbour of our conuersing togeather with such
priuate familiarities, that custome had wrought an vnyon of our
nature, &amp; the sympathie of our affections such a a secret loue, that
we haue two bodies, and one soule. Then maruell not (great <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismond</hi>)
if seeing my friend distrest, I finde my selfe perplexed
with a thousand sorrowes: for her vertuous and honourable
thoughts (which are the glories that maketh women excellent)
they he such, as may challenge loue, and race out suspition; her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to your Maiestie, I referre to the censure of your owne
eye, that since her fathers exile hath smothered al griefs with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and in the absence of nature, hath honored you with all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as her owne father by nouriture, not in word vttering any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
nor in thought (as far as coniecture may reach) hamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
on reuenge: only in all her actions seeking to please you, &amp;
to win my fauor. Her wisedome, silence, chastitie, and other such
rich qualities, I need not decypher: onely it rests for me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
in one word, that she is innocent. If then, Fortune who try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
in varietie of miseries, hath presented some enuious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(as minister of her intended stratageme) to taint <hi>Rosalynde</hi>
with any surmise of treason, let him be brought to her face, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
his accusation by witnesses: which proued, let her die, and
<hi>Alinda</hi> wil execute the massacre. If none can auouch any confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
relation of her intent, vse Iustice my Lord, it is the glory of
a King, and let her liue in your wonted fauour: for if you bannish
her, my selfe as copartner of her harde fortunes, will participate
in exile some part of her extremities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Torismond</hi> (at this speech of <hi>Alinda</hi>) couered his face with
such a frown, as tyranny seemed to sit triumphant in his forhead,
and checkt her vp with such taunts, as made the Lords (that only
<pb facs="tcp:20331:15"/>
were hearers) to tremble. Proud girle (quoth he) hath my looks
made thee so light of toong, or my fauours incouraged thee to bee
so forward, that thou darest presume to preach after thy Father:
Hath not my yeares more experience than thy youth, &amp; the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of mine age deeper insight into ciuil policie, than the prime of
thy florishing dayes? The olde Lion auoides the toyles, where
the yoong one leapes into the nette: the care of age is prouident
and foresees much: suspition is a vertue, where a man holdes his
enemie in his bosome. Thou fond girle, measurest all by present
affection, and as thy heart loues, thy thoughts censure: but if thou
knowest that in liking <hi>Rosalynd</hi> thou hat chest vp a bird to pecke
out thine owne eyes, thou wouldst intreat as much for hir absence
as now thou delightest in her presence. But why doe I alleadge
policie to thee? sit you downe huswife and fall to your needle: if
idlenes make you so wanton, or libertie so malipert, I can quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tye you to a sharper taske: and you (mayd) this night be pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
eyther into <hi>Arden</hi> to your father, or whither best it shal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
your humour, but in the Court you shall not abide. This ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
replie of <hi>Torismond</hi> nothing amazed <hi>Alinda,</hi> for stil she
prosecuted her plea in the defence of <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> wishing her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(if his censure might not be reuerst) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would appoynt her
partner of her exile: which if he refused, eyther she would by some
secret meanes steale out and followe her, or else ende her dayes
with some desperate kind of death. When <hi>Torismond</hi> heard his
daughter so resolute, his heart was so hardened against her, that
he set down a definitiue and peremptory sentence, that they should
both be banished: which presently was done. The Tyrant rather
choosing to hazard the losse of his onely child, than any wayes to
put in question the state of his kingdome: so suspitious and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
is the conscience of an vsurper. Wel although his Lords per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him to retaine his owne Daughter, yet his resolution
might not be reuerst, but both of them must away from the Court
without eyther more company or delay. In hee went with great
melancholy, and left these two Ladyes alone. <hi>Rosalynd</hi> waxed
very sad, and sate downe and wept. <hi>Alinda</hi> she smiled, and sitting

mindes were discouered in fortunes contempt, and heroycal seene
in the depth of extremities? Thou wert wont to tel others that
complained of distresse, that the sweetest salue for misery was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and the onely medicine for want, that pretious implaister
of content: being such a good Phisition to others, wilt thou not
minister receipts to thy selfe? But perchance thou wilt say:
<q>Consulenti nunquam caput doluit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Why then, if the Patients that are sicke of this disease ran
finde in themselues neither reason to perswade, nor art to cure,
yet (<hi>Rosalynd</hi>) admit of the counsaile of a friend, and applie the
salues that may appease thy passions. If thou grieuest that being
the daughter of a prince, and enuy thwarteth thee with such hard
exigents, thinke that royaltie is a faire marke, that Crowns haue
crosses when mirth is in Cottages: that the fairer the Rose is,
the sooner it is bitteh with Caterpillers: the more orient y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pearle
is, the more apt to take a blemish: and the greatest birth, as it hath
most honour, so it hath much enuy. If then fortune aymeth at the fairest, be patient <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> for first by thine exile thou goest to
thy father, nature is higher prised then wealth, and the loue of ones
parents ought to bee more pretious then all dignities: why then
doth my <hi>Rosalynd</hi> grieue at the frowne of <hi>Torismond,</hi> who by
offering her a preiudice, proffers her a greater pleasure? and more
(mad lasse) to be melancholy, when thou hast with thee <hi>Alinda</hi> a
friend, who wil be a fathful copartner of al thy misfortunes, who
hath left her father to follow thee, and chooseth rather to brooke
al extremities then to forsake thy presence. What <hi>Rosalynd:</hi>
                  <q>Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Cheerly woman, as wee haue been bed fellowes in royaltie,
we wil be felow mates in pouertie: I wil euer be thy <hi>Alinda,</hi> and
thou shalt euer rest to me <hi>Rosalynd:</hi> so shall the world canonize
our friendship, and speake of <hi>Rosalynd</hi> and <hi>Alinda,</hi> as they did
<pb facs="tcp:20331:16"/>
of <hi>Pilades</hi> and <hi>Orestes.</hi> And if euer fortune smile and we return
to our former honour, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>At this <hi>Rosalynd</hi> began to comfort her, and after shee had
wept a fewe kinde teares in the bosome of her <hi>Alinda,</hi> shee gaue
her heartie thankes, and then they sat them downe to consult how

preiudice in that two wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went wandring without either guide

not a sodeine shift to preuent a misfortune? I (thou seest) am of a
tall stature, and would very wel become the person and apparrel
of a Page, thou shalt bee my mistresse, and I wil play the man so
properly, that (trust me) in what company so euer I come I wil
not be discouered: I wil buy me a suite, and haue my Rapier ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
handsomly at my side, &amp; if any knaue offer wrong, your Page
wil shew him the poynt of his weapon. At this <hi>Alinda</hi> smiled, and
vpon this they agreed, and presently gathered vp al their Iewels,
which they trussed vp in a Casket, and <hi>Rosalynd</hi> in all hast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
her of robes, and <hi>Alinda</hi> being called <hi>Aliena,</hi> and <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynd
Ganimede:</hi> they traueiled along the Uineyardes, and by
many by-waies: at last got to the Forrest side, where they trauei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the space of two or three dayes without seeing anye crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
being often in danger of wilde beasts, and payned with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
passionate sorrowes. Now the blacke Oxe began to tread on
their feet, and <hi>Alinda</hi> thought of her wonted royaltie: but when
she cast her eyes on her <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> shee thought euery daunger a
step to honour. Passing thus on along, about midday they came
to a Fountaine, compast with a groaue of Cipresse trees, so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
and curiously planted, as if some Goddesse had intreated
Nature in that place to make her an Arbour. By this Fountaine
sat <hi>Aliena</hi> and her <hi>Ganimede,</hi> and forth they
pulled such victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
as they had, and fedde as merely as if they had been in <hi>Paris</hi>
with all the Kings delicates: <hi>Aliena</hi> onely grieuing that they
could not so much as meete with a shepheard to discourse them
<pb facs="tcp:20331:16"/>
the way to some place where they might make their abode. At last
<hi>Ganimede</hi> casting vp his eye espied where on a tree was ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
certaine verses: which assoone as he espied, he cryed out, be
of good cheare Mistrisse, I spie the figures of men: for heere in
these trees bee ingrauen certaine verses of shepheards, or some
other swaines that inhabite here about. With that <hi>Aliena</hi> start
vp ioyful to heare these newes, and looked, where they found car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the barke of a Pine tree this passion.</p>

               <p>No doubt (quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) this poesie is the passion of some
perplexed shepheard, that beeing enamoured of some faire and
beautifull Shepheardesse, suffered some sharpe repulse, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
complained of the crueltie of his Mistresse. You may see
<pb facs="tcp:20331:17"/>
(quoth <hi>Ginimede</hi>) what mad cattel you women be, whose harts
sometimes are made of Adamant that wil touch with no impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and sometime of wax that is fit for euery forme: they delight
to be courted, and then they glory to seeme coy, and when they are
most desired then they freese with disdaine: and this fault is so
common to the sex, that you see it painted out in the shepheardes
passions, who found his Mistres as froward as he was enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And I pray you (quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) if your robes were off, what
mettal are you made of that you are so satyrical against women?
Is it not a foule bird defiles the own nest? Beware (<hi>Ganimede</hi>)
that <hi>Rosader</hi> heare you not, if hee doo, perchance you will make
him leape so farre from loue, that he wil anger euery vaine in your

as I am <hi>Alienas</hi> Page, not as I am <hi>Gerismonds</hi> daughter: for
put mee but into a peticoat, and I wil stand in defiance to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost,
that women are curteous, constant, vertuous, and what
not. Stay there (quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) and no more words, for yonder be

               <p>No doubt (quoth <hi>Ganimede</hi>) this protestation grew from
one full of passions. I am of that minde too (quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) but
see I pray, when poore women seeke to keepe themselues chaste,
how men woo them with many fained promises, alluring with
sweet words as the <hi>Syrens,</hi> and after proouing as trothlesse as
<hi>Acneas.</hi> Thus promised <hi>Demophoon</hi> to his <hi>Phillis,</hi> but who
at last grew more false? The reason was (quoth <hi>Ganimede</hi>)
that they were womens sonnes, and tooke that fault of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for if man had growne from man, as <hi>Adam</hi> did from the
earth, men had neuer been troubled with inconstancie. Leaue off
(quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) to taunt thus bitterly, or els ile pull off your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
apparrell and whip you (as <hi>Venus</hi> doth her wantons) with
nettles. So you will (quoth <hi>Ganimede</hi>) perswade mee to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and that needs not: but come (seeing we haue found here by
his Fount the tract of Shepheardes by their Madrigalles and
Roundelaies) let vs forwarde: for either wee shall finde some
foldes, sheepcoates, or els some cottages wherin for a day or two
<pb facs="tcp:20331:18"/>
to rest. Content (quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) and with that they rose vp, and
marched forward till towards the euen: and then comming into
a faire valley (compassed with mountaines, whereon grew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pleasaunt shrubbes) they might descrie where two flockes of
sheepe did feed. Then looking about, they might perceiue where
an old shepheard sate (and with him a yoong swaine) vnder a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
most pleasantly scituated. The ground where they sate was
diapred with <hi>Floras</hi> riches, as if she ment to wrap <hi>Tellus</hi> in the
glorie of her vestments: round about in the forme of an Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theater
were most curiously planted Pine trees, interseamed
with Lymons and Cytrons, which with the thicknesse of their
boughes so shadowed the place, that <hi>Phoebus</hi> could not prie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the secret of that Arbour, so vnited were the tops with so thick
a closure, that <hi>Venus</hi> might there in her iollitie haue dallied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene
with her deerest paramour. Fast by (to make the place more
gorgious) was there a Fount so Christalline &amp; cleere, that it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Diana</hi> with her <hi>Driades</hi> &amp; <hi>Hemadriades</hi> had that spring,
as the secret of all their bathings. In this glorious Arbour satte
these two shepheardes (seeing their sheepe feede) playing on their
Pipes many pleasant tunes, and from musicke and melodie fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into much amorous chat: drawing more nigh we might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scry
the countenance of the one to be full of sorrow, his face to bee
the very pourtraiture of discontent, and his eyes full of woes, that
liuing hee seemed to dye: we (to heare what these were) stole pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily

sight the shepheards arose, and <hi>Aliena</hi> saluted them thus: Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
all haile (for such wee deeme you by your flockes) and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
good lucke, (for such you seeme by your passions) our eyes
being witnesse of the one, and our eares of the other. Although not
by Loue, yet by Fortune, I am a distressed Gentlewoman, as sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
as you are passionate, and as full of woes as you of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
thoughts: wandring this way in a forrest vnknown, onely
I &amp; my Page, wearied with trauel would faine haue some place
of rest. May you appoint vs any place of quiet harbour (bee it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so meane) I shall bee thankfull to you, contented in my selfe,
and gratefull to whosoeuer shall be mine Host. <hi>Coridon</hi> hearing
the Gentlewoman speake so courteously returned her mildly and
reuerently this answere.</p>
               <p>Faire Mistresse, wee returne you as hearty a welcome as you
gaue vs a courteous salute. A shepheard I am, and this a louer, as
watchful to please his wench, as to feed his sheep: ful of fancies,
and therefore say I, full of follyes. Exhort him I may, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him I cannot: for Loue admits neither of counsaile, nor
<pb facs="tcp:20331:21"/>
reason. But leauing him to his passions, if you be distrest, I am
sorrowfull such a faire creature is crost with calamitie: pray for
you I may, but releeue you I cannot: marry if you want lodging
if you vouch to shrowd your selues in a shepheards cottage, my
house for this night shall be your harbour, <hi>Alinea</hi> thankt <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
greatly, and presently sate her downe and <hi>Ganimede</hi> by hir.
<hi>Coridon</hi> looking earnestly vpon her, and with a curious suruey
viewing all her perfectious, applauded (in his thought) her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence,
and pitying her distresse, was desirous to heare the cause
of her misfortunes, began to question with her thus.</p>
               <p>If I should not (faire Damosell) occasionate offence, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
your griefs by rubbing the scar, I would faine craue so much
fauour, as to know the cause of your misfortunes: and why, and
whither you wander with your page in so dangerous forrest. <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena</hi>
(that was as courteous as she was sayre) made this replie:
Shepheard, a friendly demaund ought neuer to be offensiue, and
question of curtesie carry priuiledged pardons in their forheads.
Know therefore, to discouer my fortunes were to renue my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
and I should by discoursing my mishaps, but rake fire out
of the cynders. Therefore let this suffice gentle shepheard, my
distresse is as great as my trauaile is daungerous, and I wander
in this forrest to light on some cotage where I and my page may
dwell: for I meane to buy some Farme, and a flocke of sheepe, &amp;
so become a shepheardesse, meaning to liue low, and content mee
with a country life: for I haue heard the swaines saye, that they
drunke without suspition, and slept without care. Marry mistres
quoth <hi>Coridon,</hi> if you meane so you came in good time, for my
Landflord intends to sell both the Farme I tyll, and the flocke I
keepe, and cheape you may haue them for ready money: and for a
shepheards life (oh Mistres) did you but liue a while in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
you would say the Court were rather a place of sorrow then
of solace. Here mistresse shal not fortune thwart you, but in mean
misfortunes, as the losse of a few sheepe, which, as it breedes no
beggery, so it can bee no extreame preiudice: the next yeare may
mend all with a fresh increase. Enuy stirres not vs, we cauet not
to climbe, our desires mount not aboue our degrees, nor our
thoughts aboue our fortunes. Care cannot harbour in our cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb facs="tcp:20331:21"/>
nor doe our homely couches know broken slumbers: as wee
exceed not ill dyet, so we haue inough to satisfie: and Mistresse, I
haue so much Latin, <hi>Satis est quod sufficit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By my trueth shepheard (quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) thou makest mee in
loue with your countrey life, and therfore send for thy Landslord,
and I will buy thy Farme and thy slocks, and thou shalt still vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me bee ouerseer of them both: onely for pleasure sake, I and
my Page will serue you, lead the flocks to the field, &amp; folde them:
Thus will I liue quiet, vnknowne, &amp; contented. This newes so
gladded the hart of <hi>Coridon,</hi> that he should not be put out of his
farme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> putting off his shepheards bonnet, he did hir all the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that he might. But all this while sate <hi>Montanus</hi> in a muse
thinking of the crueltie of his <hi>Phoebe,</hi> whom he wooed long, but
was in no hope to win. <hi>Ganimede</hi> who stil had the remembrance
of <hi>Rosader</hi> in his thoughtes, tonke delight to see the poore shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
passionate, laughing at loue, that in all his actions was so
imperious. At last when she had noted his teares that stole down
his cheeks, and his sighes that broke from the center of his heart,
pittying his lament, she dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of <hi>Coridon</hi> why the yong shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
looked so sorrowfull? Oh sir (quoth he) the boy is in loue.
Why (quoth <hi>Ganimede</hi>) can shepheards loue? I (quoth <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>)
&amp; ouer-loue, els shouldst not shou see me so pensiue. Loue I
tell thee, is as pretious in a shepheards eye, as in the lookes of a
King, &amp; we cuntry swains intertaine fancie with as great delight
as the proudest Courtier doth affection. Opportunity (that is the
sweetest friend to <hi>Venus</hi>) harboureth in our cottages, and loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
(the chiefest fealty that <hi>Cupid</hi> requireth) is found more among
shepheardes than higher degrees. Then aske not if suche silly
swains can loue? what is the cause then, quoth <hi>Ganimede,</hi> that
Loue being so sweet to thee, thou lookest so sorrowfull? Because
quoth <hi>Montanus,</hi> the party beloued is froward: and hauing cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
in her lookes, holdeth disdaine in her tongues ende? What
hath she then, quoth <hi>Aliena,</hi> in heart? Desire (I hope Madame)
quoth he: or else my hope lost, despaire in Loue were death. As
thus they chatted, the Sunne beeing ready to set, and they not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
folded their sheepe, <hi>Coridon</hi> requested she would sit there
with her Page, till <hi>Montanus</hi> and hee lodged theyr sheepe for
<pb facs="tcp:20331:22"/>
that night. You shall goe quoth <hi>Aliena,</hi> but first I will intreate
<hi>Montanus</hi> to sing some amorous Sonnet that hee made when

                  <hi>Montanus</hi> had no sooner ended his sonnet, but <hi>Coridon</hi> with
alowe curtesie rose vp, &amp; went with his fellow, and shut their
sheepe in the folds: and after returning to <hi>Aliena</hi> &amp; <hi>Ganimede,</hi>
conducted them home weary to his poore cottage. By the waye
there was much good chat with <hi>Montanus</hi> about his loues: hee
resoluing <hi>Aliena</hi> that <hi>Phoebe</hi> was the fairest Shepherdice in al
France, &amp; that in his eye her beautie was equal with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Nimphs.
But quoth he, as of all stones the Diamond is most cleerest, &amp; yet
most hard for the Lapidorie to cut, as of all flowres, the Rose is
the fairest, and yet guarded with the sharpest prickles: so of al our
country lasses <hi>Phoebe</hi> is the brightest, but the most coy of all to
stoope vnto desire. But let her take heed quoth he, I haue heard of
<hi>Narcissus,</hi> who for his high disdain against Loue, perished in the
folly of his owne loue. With this they were at <hi>Coridons</hi> Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
where <hi>Montanus</hi> parted from them, and they went in to
rest. <hi>Alinda</hi> and <hi>Ganimede</hi> glad of so contented a shelter, made
merry with the poore swaine: and though they had but countrey

                  </gap>ging, yet their welcome was so greate, and
their cares so little, that they counted their diet delicate, and slept
as soundly as if they had beene in the court of <hi>Torismond.</hi> The
next morne they lay long in bed, as wearyed with the toyle of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accustomed
trauaile; but assoone as they got vp, <hi>Aliena</hi> resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
there to set vp her rest, and by the helpe of <hi>Coridon</hi> swapt a
bargaine with his Landslord, and so became mistres of the farme
and the flocke: her selfe putting on the attyre of the shepherdesse,
and <hi>Ganimide</hi> of a yong swaine: euerye day leading foorth her
flockes, with such delight, that she held her exile happy, &amp; thoght
no content to the blisse of a Countrey cottage. Leauing her thus
<pb facs="tcp:20331:23"/>
famous amongst the shepheards of <hi>Arden,</hi> againe to <hi>Saladyne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Saladyne</hi> had a long while concealed a secrete resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of reuenge, &amp; could no longer hide fire in the flax, nor oyle in
the flame: (for enuy is like lightning, that will appeare in the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
fog.) It chaunced on a morning very early he cald vp certain
of his seruants, and went with them to the chamber of <hi>Rosader,</hi>
which being open, hee entred with his crue, and surprized his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when he was a sleepe, and bound him in fetters, &amp; in the midst
of his hall chained him to a post. <hi>Rosader</hi> amazed at this strange
chaunce, began to reason with his brother about the cause of this
sodaine extremity, wherein he had wrongd, and what fault he had
committed worthy so sharpe a penance. <hi>Saladyne</hi> answered him
onely with a look of disdain, and went his way, leauing poore <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader</hi>
in a deepe perplexity. Who thus abused, fell into sundry
passions, but no means of releefe could be had: wherupon for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
he grew into a discontented melancholy. In which humour
he continued two or three daies without meat: insomuch, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his brother would giue him no food, he fel into despaire of his
life. Which <hi>Adam Spencer</hi> the old seruant of sir <hi>Iohn of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>
seeing, touched with the dutie &amp; loue hee ought to his olde
maister, felt a remorse in his conscience of his sonnes mishap: and
therefore, although <hi>Saladine</hi> had giuen a generall charge to his
seruants, that none of them vpon pain of death should giue either
meat or drinke to <hi>Rosader,</hi> yet <hi>Adam Spencer</hi> in the night rose
secretly, &amp; brought him such victuals as he could prouide, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockt
him, and set him at liberty. After <hi>Rosader</hi> had well feasted
himselfe, and felt he was loose, straight his thoughts aymed at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
and now (all being a sleepe) hee would haue quit <hi>Saladyne</hi>
with the methode of his own mischiefe. But <hi>Adam Spencer</hi> did
perswade him to the contrary with these reasons: Sir quoth hee,
he content, for this night go againe into your olde fetters, so shall
you trie the faith of friends, and saue the life of an old seruant. To<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow
hath your brother inuited al your kinred &amp; allyes to a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempne
breake fast, onely to see you, telling them all that you are
mad, &amp; faine to be tied to a poast. Assoone as they come, complain
to them of the abuse proffered you by <hi>Saladyne.</hi> If they redresse
you, why so: but if they passe ouer your playntes, <hi>sicco pede,</hi>

                  </gap>ld with the violence of your brother before your innocence,
then thus: I will leaue you vnlocke that you may breake out at
your pleasure, and at the ende of the hall shall you see stand a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of good pollaxes, one for you, and another for mee. When I
giue you a wincke, shake off your chaines, and let vs plaie the
men, and make hauocke amongst them, driue them out of the
house and maintaine possession by force of armes, till the King
hath made a redresse of your abuses. These wordes of <hi>Adam
Spencer</hi> so perswaded <hi>Rosader,</hi> that he went to the place of his
punishment, and stood there while the next morning. About the
time appointed, came all the guestes bidden by <hi>Saladyne,</hi> whom
hee intreated with curteous and curious entertainment, as they
all perceiued their welcome to be great. The tables in the hall
where <hi>Rosader</hi> was tyed, were couered, and <hi>Saladyne</hi> bringing
in his guests togither, shewed them where his brother was bound,
and was inchainde as a man lunaticke. <hi>Rosader</hi> made reply, and
with some inuectiues made complaintes of the wrongs proffered
him by <hi>Saladyne,</hi> desiring they would in pitie seeke some meanes
for his reliefe. But in vaine, they had stopt their eares with <hi>Vlis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
that were his words neuer so forceable, he breathed onely his
passions into the winde. They carelesse, sat downe with <hi>Saladyne</hi>
to dinner, beeing very frolicke and pleasant, washing their heades
well with wine. At last, when the fume of the grape had entered
peale meale into their braines, they began in satyricall speeches to
raile against <hi>Rosader:</hi> which <hi>Adam Spencer</hi> no longer broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
gaue the signe, and <hi>Rosader</hi> shaking off his chaines got a
pollaxe in his hande, and flew amongst them with such violence
and fury, that he hurt many, slew, some, and draue his brother and
all the rest quite out of the house. Seeing the coast cleare, he shut
the doores, and being sore an hungred, and seeing such good vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals,
he sat him downe with <hi>Adam Spencer,</hi> and such good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
as he knew were honest men, and there feasted themselues
with such prouision as <hi>Saladyne</hi> had prepared for his friendes.
After they had taken their repast, <hi>Rosader</hi> rampierd vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> house,
least vpon a sodeine his brother should raise some crew of his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
and surprise them vnawares. But <hi>Saladyne</hi> tooke a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
course, and went to the Sheriffe of the shire &amp; made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb facs="tcp:20331:24"/>
of <hi>Rosader,</hi> who giuing credite to <hi>Saladyne,</hi> in a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
resolution to reuenge the Gentlemans wrongs, tooke with
him fiue and twentie tall men, and made a vow, either to breake
into the house and take <hi>Rosader,</hi> or else to coope him in till hee
made him yeeld by famine. In this determination, gathering a
crue togither, hee went forward to set <hi>Saladyne</hi> in his former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.
Newes of this was brought vnto <hi>Rosader,</hi> who smiling at
the cowardize of his brother, brookt al the iniuries of fortune with
patience, expecting the comming of the Sheriffe. As he walke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the battlements of the house, he descryed where <hi>Saladyne</hi> and
he drew neare, with a troupe of lustie gallants. At this he smilde,
and calde vp <hi>Adam Spencer,</hi> and shewed him the enuious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie
of his brother, and the folly of the Sheriffe to bee so credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous:
now <hi>Adam,</hi> quoth he, what shall I do? It resls for me, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to yeeld vp the house to my brother and seek a reconcilement,
or els issue out, and breake through the company with courage,
for coopt in like a coward I will not bee. If I submit (ah <hi>Adam</hi>)
I dishonor my selfe, and that is worse then death, for by such open
disgraces, the fame of men growes odious: if I issue out amongst
them, fortune may fauour mee, and I may escape with life, but
suppose the worst: if I be slaine, then my death shall be honorable
to me, &amp; so inequall a reuenge in famous to <hi>Saladyne.</hi> Why then
Maister forward and seare not, out amongst them, they bee but
faint hearted lozels, and for <hi>Adam Spencer,</hi> if hee die not at your
foote, say hee is a dastard. These words cheered vp so the heart of
yong <hi>Rosader,</hi> that he thought himselfe sufficient for them al, and
therefore prepared weapons for him and <hi>Adam Spencer,</hi> and
were readie to entertaine the Sheriffe: for no sooner came <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne</hi>
and he to the gates, but <hi>Rosader</hi> vnloookt for leapt out and
assailed them, wounded many of them, and caused the rest to giue
backe, so that <hi>Adam</hi> and he broke through the prease in despite of
them all, and tooke their way towards the forrest of <hi>Arden.</hi> This
repulse so set the Sheriffs hart on fire to reuenge, that he straight
raised all the country, and made Hue and Crie after them. But
<hi>Rosader</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> knowing full well the secret waies that led
through the vineyards, stole away priorily through the prouince of
<hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and escaped safe to the forrest of <hi>Arden.</hi> Beeing
<pb facs="tcp:20331:24"/>
come thether, they were glad they had so good a harbor: but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
(who is like the Camelion) variable with euery obiect, and
constant in nothing but inconstancie, thought to make them myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of her mutabilitie, and therefore still croft them thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily. Thinking still to passe on by the bywaies to get to <hi>Lions,</hi>
they chanced on a path that led into the thicke of the forrest, where
they wandred fiue or sixe dayes without meate, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
famished, finding neither shepheard nor cottage to relieue
them: and hunger growing on so extreame, <hi>Adam Spencer</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing olde)
began to faint, and sitting him downe on a hill, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
about him, espied where <hi>Rosader</hi> laye as feeble and as ill
perplexed: which sight made him shedde teares, and to fall into
these bitter tearmes.</p>

               <head>Adam Spencers speech.</head>
               <p>OH how the life of man may well bee compared to the state of
the Ocean seas, that for euery calme hath a thousand storms,
resembling the Rose tree, that for a fewe flowers, hath a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of sharpe prickles: all our pleasures ende in paine, and our
highest delightes, are crossed with deepest discontents. The ioyes
of man, as they are few, so are they momentarie, scarce ripe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are rotten: and withering in the blossome, either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with the heate of enuy, or fortune. Fortune, oh inconstant
friend, that in all thy deedes art froward and sickle, delighti g in
the pouertie of the lowest, and the ouer throw of the highest, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypher
thy inconstancy. Thou standest vpon a globe, &amp; thy wings
are plumed with times feathers, that thou maist euer be restlesse;
thou art double faced like <hi>Ianus,</hi> carrying frownes in the one to
threaten, and smiles in the other to betray; thou profferest an Eele,
&amp; performest a Scorpion, &amp; wher thy greatest fauours be, there is
the feare of the extreamest misfortunes, so variable are all thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But why <hi>Adam</hi> doest thou exclaime against Fortune?
she laughes at the plaintes of the distressed: and there is nothing
more pleasing vnto her, then to heare fooles boast in her fading
allurements, or sorrowfull men to discouer the sower of their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
Elut her not <hi>Adam</hi> then with content, but thwart her with
<pb facs="tcp:20331:25"/>
brooking all mishappes with patience. For there is no greater
check to the pride of fortune, then with a resolute courage to passe
ouer her crosses without care. Thou art old <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; thy haires
waxe white, the Palme tree is alreadie full of bloomes, and in the
furrowes of thy face appeares the Kalenders of death? Wert
thou blessed by fortune thy yeares could not bee many, nor the
date of thy life long: then sith Nature must haue her due, what is
it for thee to resigne her debt a little before the day. Ah, it is not
this which grieueth mee, nor do I care what mishaps fortune can
wage against mee: but the sight of <hi>Rosader,</hi> that galleth vnto
the quicke. When I remember the worships of his house, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his fathers, and the vertues of himselfe: then doo I say,
that fortune and the fates are most iniurious, to censure so hard
extreames, against a youth of so great hope. Oh <hi>Rosader,</hi> thou
art in the flower of thine age, and in the pride of thy yeares, bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and full of May. Nature hath prodigally inricht thee with
her fauours, and vertue made thee the myrror of her excellence:
and now through the decree of the vniust starres, to haue all these
good partes nipped in the blade, and blemisht by the inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of fortune. Ah <hi>Rosader,</hi> could I helpe thee, my griefe were
the lesse, and happie should my death be, if it might bee the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of thy reliefe: but seeing we perish both in one extreame, it
is a double sorrow. What shall I doo? preuent the sight of his
further misfortune, with a present dispatch of mine owne life. Ah,
despaire is a mercilesse sinne.</p>
               <p>As he was readie to go forward in his passion, he looked ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
on <hi>Rosader,</hi> and seeing him chaunge colour, hee rose vp and
went to him, and holding his temples, said, What cheere maister?
though all faile, let not the heart faint: the courage of a man is
shewed in the resolution of his death. At these wordes <hi>Rosader</hi>
Iifted vp his eye, and looking on <hi>Adam Spencer</hi> began to weep.
Ah <hi>Adam</hi> quoth he, I sorrow not to dye, but I grieue at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of my death. Might I with my Launce encounter the enemy,
and so die in the field, it were honour, and content: might I (<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>)
combate with some wilde beast, and perish as his praie, I
were satisfied: but to die with hunger, O <hi>Adam,</hi> it is the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
of all extreames. Maister (quoth hee) you see me are both in
<pb facs="tcp:20331:25"/>
one predicament, and long I cannot liue without meate, seeing
therefore we can finde no foode, let the death of the one, preserue
the life of the other. I am old, and ouerworne with age, you are
yoong, and are the hope of many honours: let me then dye, I will
presently cut my veynes, and maister with the warme blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
your fainting spirites: sucke on that till I ende, and you be
comforted. With that <hi>Adam Spencer</hi> was ready to pull out his
knife, when <hi>Rosader</hi> full of courage (though verie faint) rose vp,
and wisht <hi>A. Spencer</hi> to sit there til his returne: for my mind
giues me quoth he, I shall bring thee meate. With that, like a
mad man he rose vp, and raunged vp and downe the woods, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to encounter some wilde beast with his Rapier, that either he
might carry his friend <hi>Adam</hi> food, or els pledge his life in pawn
of his loyaltie. It chaunced that day, that <hi>Gerismond</hi> the lawfull
King of <hi>France,</hi> banished by <hi>Torismond,</hi> who with a lustie crue
of Outlawes liued in that Forrest, that day in honour of his birth
made a feast to all his bolde yeomen, and frolicke it with store of
wine and venison, sitting all at a long table vnder the shadow of
Lymon trees. To that place by chance Fortune conducted <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader,</hi>
who seeing such a crue of braue men hauing store of that,
for want of which hee and <hi>Adam</hi> perished, hee stept boldly to the
boords end, and saluted the company thus.</p>
               <p>Whatsoeuer thou be that art maister of these lustie squiers,
I salute thee as graciously, as a man in extreame distresse may:
know that I and a fellow friend of mine, are here famished in the
Forrest for want of food: perish wee must vnlesse relieued by thy
fauours. Therefore if thou be a Gentleman, giue meate to men,
and to suche as are euerie way woorthie of life: let the proudest
squire that sits at thy table, rise and incounter with mee in any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
point of actiuitie whatsoeuer, and if hee and thou prooue
me not a man, send me away comfortlesse. If thou refuse this, as
a niggard of thy cates, I will haue amongst you with my sword:
for rather wil I dye valiantly, then perish with so cowardly an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame.
<hi>Gerismond</hi> looking him earnestly in the face, and seeing
so proper a Gentleman in so bitter a passion, was mooued with
so great pitie, that rising from the table, he tooke him by the hand
and badde him welcome, willing him to sit dowae in his place,
<pb facs="tcp:20331:26"/>
and in his roome not onely to eat his fill, but the Lord of the feast.
Gramerry sir (quoth <hi>Rosader</hi>) but I haue a feeble friend that
lyes hereby famished almost for food, aged and therefore lesse able
to abide the extremitie of hunger then my selfe, and dishonour it
were for me to taste one crumme, before I made him partner of
my fortunes: therefore I will runne and fetch him, and then I wil
gratefully accept of your proffer. Away hies <hi>Rosader</hi> to <hi>Adam
Spencer,</hi> and tels him the newes, who was glad of so happie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
but so feeble he was that he could not go: whereupon <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader</hi>
got him vp on his backe, &amp; brought him to the place. Which
when <hi>Gerismond</hi> &amp; his men saw, they greatly applauded their
league of friendship: and <hi>Rosader</hi> hauing <hi>Gerismonds</hi> place
assigned him, would not sit there himselfe, but set downe <hi>Adam
Spencer.</hi> Well to be short, those hungry squires fell to their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals,
and feasted themselues with good delicates, &amp; great store
of wine. Assoone as they had taken their repast, <hi>Gerismond</hi>
(desirous to heare what hard fortune draue them into those bitter
extreames) requested <hi>Rosader</hi> to discourse, (as it were not any
way preiudicall vnto him) the cause of his trauell. <hi>Rosader</hi> (ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
any way to satisfie the curtesie of his fauourable host, (first
beginning his <hi>exordium</hi> with a volley of sighes, and a fewe luke
warme teares) prosecuted his discourse, &amp; told him from point to
point all his fortunes, how hee was the yongest sonne of sir <hi>Iohn</hi>
of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> his name <hi>Rosader,</hi> how his brother sundry times
had wronged him, and lastly, how for beating the Sheriffe, and
hurting his men, hee fled: and this old man (quoth he) whom I so
much loue and honour, is surnamed <hi>Adam Spencer,</hi> an old ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of my fathers, and one (that for his loue) neuer fayled me in
all my misfortunes. When <hi>Gerismond</hi> heard this, he fell on the
neck of <hi>Rosader,</hi> and next discoursing vnto him, how he was <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismond</hi>
their lawfull King exiled by <hi>Torismond,</hi> what fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie
had euer been betwixt his father sir <hi>Iohn of Bourdeaux</hi>
and him, how faithfull a subiect hee liued, and how honourably he
dyed: promising (for his sake) to giue both him &amp; his friend such
curteous entertainment, as his present estate, could minister: and
vpon this made him one of his forresters. <hi>Rosadar</hi> seeing it was
the King, craude pardon for his boldnesse, in that hee did not doo
<pb facs="tcp:20331:26"/>
him due reuerence, and humbly gaue him thankes for his fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
curtesie. <hi>Gerismond</hi> not satisfied yet with newes, beganne
to enquire if he had been lately in the Court of <hi>Torismond,</hi> and
whether he had seene his daughter <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> or no? At this, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader</hi>
fetcht a deep sigh, and shedding many teares, could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere:
yet at last, gathering his spirits togither, he reuealed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Kyng, how <hi>Rosalynde</hi> was banished, and how there was
such a simpathie of affections betwixt <hi>Alinda</hi> and her, that shee
chose rather to bee partaker of her exile, then to part fellowship:
whereupon the vnnaturall King banished them both: and now
they are wandred none knowes whither, neither could any learne
since their departure, the place of their abode. This newes driue
the king into a great melancholy, that presently hee arose from all
the company, and went into his priuie chamber, so secrete as the
harbour of the woods would allow him. The company was all
dasht at these tydings, and <hi>Rosader</hi> and <hi>Adam Spencer</hi> hauing
such opportunitie, went to take their rest. Where we leaue them,
and returne againe to <hi>Torismond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fight of <hi>Rosader</hi> came to the eares of <hi>Torismond,</hi> who
hearing that <hi>Saladyne</hi> was sole heire of the landes of sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of
<hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> desirous to possesse such faire reuenewes, found iust
occasion to quarrell with <hi>Saladyne,</hi> about the wrongs he proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to his brother: and therefore dispatching a Herehault, he sent
for <hi>Saladyne</hi> in all poast haste. Who marueiling what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
should be, began to examine his owne conscience, wherein hee
had offended his highnesse: but imboldened with his innocence,
he boldly went with the Herehault vnto the Court. Where as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone
as hee came, hee was not admitted into the presence of the
king, but presently sent to prison. This greatly amazed <hi>Saladine,</hi>
chiefly in that the Iayler had a straight charge ouer him, to see
that he should be close prisoner. Many passionate thoughts came
in his head, till at last he began to fall into consideration of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
follies, and to medicate with himselfe. Leaning his head on
his hand, and his elbow on his knee, full of sorrow, grief and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
passions, he resolued into these tearmes.</p>

               <p>VNhappie <hi>Saladyne,</hi> whame folly hath led to these misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and wanton desires wrapt within the laborinth of these
calamities. Are not the heauens doomers of mens deedes? And
heldes not God a ballance in his fist, to reward with fauour, and
reuenge with iustice? Oh <hi>Saladyne,</hi> the faults of thy youth, as
they were fond, so were they foule: and not onely discouering lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
nourture, but blemishing the excellence of nature. Whelpes
of one litter are euer most louing, and brothers that are sonnes of
one father, should liue in friendship without iarre. Oh <hi>Saladyne,</hi>
so it should bee: but thou hast with the deere fedde against the
winde, with the crabbe stroue against the streame, and sought to
peruert nature by vnkindnesse. <hi>Rosaders</hi> wrongs, the wrongs of
<hi>Rosader</hi> (<hi>Saladyne</hi>) cryes for reuenge, his youth pleads to God
to inflict some penaunce vpon thee, his vertues are pleas that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
writtes of displeasure to crosse thee: thou hast highly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thy kynde and naturall brother, and the heauens cannot spare
to quite thee with punishment. There is no sting to the worme of
conscience, no hell to a minde coucht with guilt. Euery wrong I
offred him (called now to remembrance) wringeth a drop of blood
from my heart, euery bad looke, euery frowne pincheth me at the
quicke, and saies <hi>Saladyne</hi> thou hast sinned against <hi>Rosader.</hi> Be
penitent, and assigne thy selfe some pennance to discouer thy sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and pacifie his wrath.</p>
               <p>In the depth of his passion, hee was sent for to the King: who
with a looke that threatened death entertained him, and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of him where his brother was? <hi>Saladyne</hi> made answer, that
vpon some ryot made against the Sheriffe of the shire, he was fled
from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> but hee knew not whither. Nay villaine (quoth
he) I haue heard of the wronges thou hast proffered thy brother
since the death of thy father, and by thy means haue I lost a most
braue and resolute Cheualier. Therfore, in iustice to punish thee,
I spare thy life for thy fathers sake, but banish thee for euer from
the court and countrey of <hi>France,</hi> and see thy departure be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
tenne dayes, els trust me thou shalt loose thy head, &amp; with that
<pb facs="tcp:20331:27"/>
the King flew away in a rage, &amp; left poore <hi>Saladyne</hi> greatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed.
Who grieuing at his exile, yet determined to beer it with
patience, and in penaunce of his former folies to trauaile abroade
in euery Coast, till he had found out his brother <hi>Rosader.</hi> With
whom now I beginnne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rosader</hi> beeing thus preferred to the place of a Forrester by
<hi>Gerismond,</hi> rooted out the remembrance of his brothers vnkind<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
by continuall exercise, trauersing the groues and wilde For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests:
partly to heare the melody of the sweete birds which recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and partly to shew his diligent indeauour in his masters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. Yet whatsoeuer he did, or howsoeuer he walked, the liuely
image of <hi>Rosalynde</hi> remained in memorie: on her sweete per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
he fed his thoughts, prouing himself like the eagle a true
borne bird, since that the one is knowne by beholding the Sunne
so was he by regarding excellent beautie. One day amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the rest
finding a fit opportunity and place conuenient, desirous to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

At this <hi>Rosader</hi> fetcht a deepe sigh, and sayde, It is the O gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

at whose shrine I doe bend all my deuotions: the most fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of all faires, the Phenix of all that sexe, and the puritie of all
earthly perfection And why (gentle Forrester) if shee be so beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
and thou so amorous, is there such a disagreement in thy
thoughts? Happily she resembleth the Rose, that is sweete, but
full of prickles? or the Serpent <hi>Regius</hi> that hath scales as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

               <p>O shepheard (quoth <hi>Rosader</hi>) knewest thou her personage
graced with the excellence of all perfection, beeing a harbour
wherein the Graces shrowd their vertues: thou wouldest not
breath out such blasphemy against the beauteous <hi>Rosalind.</hi> She
is a Diamond, bright, but not hard, yet of most chast operation:
a pearle so orient, that it can be stained with no blemish: a Rose
without prickles, and a Princesse absolute, as well in beauty as in
vertue, But I, vnhappy I, haue let mine eye soare with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eagle

but farre more chast than <hi>Daphne:</hi> I haue with <hi>Ixion</hi> laide my
loue on <hi>Iuno,</hi> and shall (I feare) embrace nought but a clowde.
Ah shepheard, I haue reacht at a starre, my desires haue moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

a peasant, haue ventured to gaze on a Princesse, whose ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
are too high to vouchsafe such base loues.</p>
               <p>Why Forrester, quoth <hi>Ganimede,</hi> comfort thy selfe: be blyth
and frolike man. Loue sowseth as low as she soareth high: <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi>

               <p>Beleeue me (quoth <hi>Ganimede</hi>) eyther the Forrester is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Painter, or <hi>Rosalynde</hi> farre aboue wonder: so it makes
me blush, to heare how women should be so excellent, and pages
so vnperfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20331:30"/>
                  <hi>Rosader</hi> beholding her earnestly, answered thus. Truly gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
page, thou hast cause to complaine thee, wert thou the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
but resembling the shadow, content thy selfe: for it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
inough to be like the excellence of nature. He hath aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
you <hi>Ganimede,</hi> quoth <hi>Aliena,</hi> it is enough for pages to
wait on beautiful Ladies, and not to be beautiful themselues. Oh
Mistres quoth <hi>Ganimede,</hi> hold you your peace, for you are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall:
Who knowes not, but that all women haue desire to tye so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraintie to
their petticotes, and ascribe beauty to themselues,
wher if boies might put on their garments, perhaps they would
proue as comely, if not as comely, as courteous. But tel me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rester,
(and with that she turnd to <hi>Rosader</hi>) vnder whom main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainest
thou thy walke? Gentle swaine, vnder the King of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawes,
said he, the vnfortunate <hi>Gerismond,</hi> who hauing lost his
kingdome, crowneth his thoughtes with content, accounting it
better to gouerne among poore men in peace, than great men in
danger. But hast thou not said she, (hauing so melancholy oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
as this Forrest affoordeth thee) written more Sonets in
commendations of thy Mistris? I haue gentle swaine quoth he,
but they be not about me: to morow by dawn of day, if your flocks
feed in these pastures, I will bring them you: wherein you shall
read my passions, whiles I feele them, iudge my patience when
you read it: til when I bid farewel. So giuing both <hi>Ganimede</hi>
and <hi>Aliena</hi> a gentle good night, he resorted to his lodge, leauing
them to their prittle prattle. So <hi>Ganimede</hi> (said <hi>Aliena,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rester
being gone) you are mightily beloued, men make ditties in
your praise, spend sighs for your sake, make an idoll of your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
beleeue me it greeues mee not a little to see the poore man so
pensiue, and you so pittilesse.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Aliena</hi> (quoth she) be not peremptory in your iudgments,
I heare <hi>Rosalynde</hi> praisd as I am <hi>Ganimede,</hi> but were I <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salynde,</hi>
I could answere the Forrester: if he mourne for loue,
there are medicines for loue: <hi>Rosalynde</hi> connot be faire and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
And so Madame you see it is time to fold our flocks, or else
<hi>Coridon</hi> will frown, and say you will neuer proue good huswife.
With that they put their sheepe into the coates, and went home
to her friend <hi>Coridons</hi> Cottage, <hi>Aliena</hi> as merry as might bee,
<pb facs="tcp:20331:30"/>
that she was thus in the company of her <hi>Rosalynde:</hi> but shee
poore soule, that had Loue her loadstarre, and her thoughtes set on
fire with the flame of fancie, could take no rest, but being alone
began to consider what passionate pennance poore <hi>Rosader</hi> was
enioyned to by Loue and Fortune: that at last shee fell into this
humour with her selfe.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Rosalynde passionate alone.</head>
               <p>AH <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> how the Fates haue set down in theyr Sindde
to make thee vnhappy: for when Fortune hath done hir worst,
then Loue comes in to begin a new tragedie: she seeks to lodge
her sonne in thyne eyes, and to kindle her fires in thy bosome.
Beware fond girle, he is an vnruly guest to harbour: for entring
in by intreats, he will not be thrust out by force, and her fires are
fed with such fuell, as no water is able to quench. Seest thou
not how <hi>Venus</hi> seekes to wrap thee in her Lahorynth, wherein
is pleasure at the entrance, but within, sorrowes, cares, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content:
she is a <hi>Syren,</hi> stop thine eares at her melodie: she is a
a Basiliscke, shutte thine eyes, and gaze not at her seast thou pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.
Thou art now placed in the Countrey content, where are
heauenly thoughtes, and meane desires: in those Lawnes where
thy flocks feed <hi>Diana</hi> haunts: be as her Nymphes chast, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
to Loue, for there is no greater honour to a mayd, than to
account of fancie, as a mortal foe to their sexe. <hi>Daphne</hi> that bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wench, was not turned into a Bay tree, as the Poets fain, but
for her chastitie her fame was immortall, resembling the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
that is euer greene. Follow thou her steps <hi>Rosalinde,</hi> and
the rather, for that thou art an exile, and banished from the court:
whose distresse, as it is appeased with patience, so it would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
with amorous passions. Haue minde on thy forepassed
fortunes, feare the worst, and intangle not thy selfe with present
fancies, least louing in hast, thou repent thee at leisure. Ah but yet
<hi>Rosalynd,</hi> it is <hi>Rosader</hi> that courts thee: one, who as he is beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
so hee is vertuous, and harboureth in his minde as manie
good qualities, as his face is shadowed with gratious fauours:
and therefore <hi>Rosalynde</hi> stoope to Loue, least beeing eyther
<pb facs="tcp:20331:31"/>
too coy, or too cruell, <hi>Venus</hi> waxe wroth, and plague thee with
the reward of disdaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rosalynde</hi> thus passionate, was wakened from her dumpes
by <hi>Aliena,</hi> who sayde it was time to goe to bed. <hi>Coridon</hi> swore
that was true, for <hi>Charls</hi> Waine was risen in the North. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon
each taking leaue of other, went to their rest, all but the
poore <hi>Rosalynde:</hi> who was so full of passions, that she could not
possesse any content. Well, leauing her to her broken slumbers,
expect what was performed by them the next morning.</p>
               <p>The Sunne was no sooner stept from the bed of <hi>Aurora,</hi> but
<hi>Aliena</hi> was wakened by <hi>Ganimede:</hi> who restlesse all night had
tossed in her passions: saying it was then time to go to the field to
vnfold their sheepe. <hi>Aliena</hi> (that spied where the hare was by the
hounds, and could see day at a litle hole) thought to be pleasaunt
with her <hi>Ganimede,</hi> &amp; therfore replied thus: What wanton? the
Sun is but new vp, &amp; as yet Iris riches lies folded in the bosome
of <hi>Flora, Phoebus</hi> hath not dried vp the pearled dew, and so long
<hi>Coridon</hi> hath taught me it is not fitte to lead the sheepe abroad:
least the deaw being vnwholesome, they get the rot: but now see
I the old prouerbe true, he is in hast whom the deuill driues, and
where loue prickes forward, there is no worse death then delay,
Ah my good page, is there fancie in thine eye, and passions in thy
heart? What, hast thou wrapt loue in thy looks? and sette all thy
thoughts on fire by affection? I tell thee, it is a flame as harde to
be quencht as that of <hi>Aetna.</hi> But nature must haue her course,
womens eies haue faculty attractiue like the feat, &amp; retentiue like
the diamond: they dally in the delight of faire obiects, til gazing
on the Panthers beautiful skin, repenting experience tel them he
hath a deuouring paunch. Come on (q. <hi>Ganimede</hi>) this sermon
of yours is but a subtiltie to lie stil a bed, because either you think
the morning cold, or els I being gone, you would steale a nappe:
this shift carries no paulme, and therefore vp and away. And for
Loue, let me alone, ile whip him away with nettles, &amp; set disdaine
as a charme to withstand his forces: and therefore loake you to
your selfe, be not too bold, for <hi>Venus</hi> can make you bend: nor to
coy, for <hi>Cupid</hi> hath a piercing dare, that wil make you crie <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caui,</hi> And that is it (quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) that hath raised you so earlie
<pb facs="tcp:20331:31"/>
this morning. And with that she slipt on her peticoat, and start vp:
and assoone as shee had made her ready, and taken her breakfast,
away goe these two with their bagge and bottles to the field, in
more pleasant content of mynd, then euer they were in the Court
of <hi>Torismond.</hi> They came no sooner nigh the foldes, but they
might see where their disconted Forrester was walking in his
melancholy. Assoone as <hi>Aliena</hi> saw him, she smiled, and sayd to
<hi>Ganymede,</hi> wipe your eyes sweeting: for yonder is your sweet
heart this morning in deep prayers no doubt to <hi>Venus,</hi> that she
may make you as pitifull as hee is passionate. Come on <hi>Gani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede,</hi>
I pray thee lets haue a litle sport with him. Content (quoth
<hi>Ganimede</hi>) and with that to waken him out of his deep <hi>memen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
he began thus.</p>
               <p>Forrester, good fortune to thy thoughts, and ease to thy pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
what makes you so early abroad this morne, in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
no doubt of your <hi>Rosalynd.</hi> Take heede Forrester, step not
too farre, the Foord may be deep, and you slip ouer the shooes: I
tell thee, flyes haue their spleen, the antes choster, the least haires
shadows, and the smallest loues great desires. Tis good (Forre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster)
to loue, but not to ouer loue: least in louing her that likes not
thee, thou fold thy selfe in an endlesse Laborinth. <hi>Rosader</hi> seeing
the faire shepheardesse and her prettie Swayne, in whose compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
he felt the greatest ease of his care, hee returned them a salute
on this maner.</p>
               <p>Gentle shepheards, all haile, and as healthfull be your flocks,
as you happie in content. Loue is restlesse, and my bedde is but
the cell of my bane, in that there I finde busie thoughtes and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
slumbers: heere (although euery where passionate) yet I
brooke loue with more patience, in that euerie obiect feedes mine
eye with varietie of fancies: when I looke on <hi>Floraes</hi> beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
tapestrie, checkered with the pride of all her treasure, I call
to minde the faire face of <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> whose heauenly hue exceeds
the Rose and the Lilly in their highest excellence: the brightnesse
of <hi>Phoebus</hi> shine, puts mee in minde to thinke of the sparkeling
flames that flew from her eyes, and set my heart first on fire, the
sweet harmony of the birds, puts me in remembrance of the rare
melody of her voyce, which lyke the <hi>Syren</hi> enchaunteth the eares
<pb facs="tcp:20331:32"/>
of the hearer. Thus in contemplation I salue my sorrowes, with
applying the perfection of euery obiect to the excellencie of her
qualities.</p>
               <p>She is much beholding vnto you (quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) and so much,
that I haue oft wisht with my selfe, that if I should euer proue as

as watching at her, you roue beyond the Moone, and cast your
lookes vpon my mistresse, who no doubt is as faire though not so
royall, one bird in the hand is worth two in the wood: better pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
the loue of <hi>Aliena,</hi> then catch frinously at the shadowe of
<hi>Rosalynd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ale tel thee boy (quoth <hi>Ganimede</hi>) so is my fancy fixed on my
<hi>Rosalynde,</hi> that were thy mistresse as faire as <hi>Laeda</hi> or <hi>Danae,</hi>
whom <hi>Ioue</hi> courted in transformed shapes, mine eyes would not
vouch to entertaine their beauties: and so hath Loue lockt me in
her perfections, that I had rather onely contemplate in her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
then absolutely possesse the excellence of any other. <hi>Venus</hi> is
too blame (Forrester) if hauing so true a seruant of you, shee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
you not with <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> if <hi>Rosalynd</hi> were more fairer then
her selfe.</p>
               <p>But leauing this prattle, now ile put you in mynd of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
about those Sonnets which you sayd were at home in your
lodge. I haue them about mee (quoth <hi>Rosader</hi>) let vs sit downe,
and then you shall heare what a Poeticall fury Loue will in fuse
into a man: with that they sate downe vpon a greene banke, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with sigge trees, and <hi>Rosader,</hi> fetching a deep sigh, read
them this Sonnet.</p>

experience (quoth <hi>Ganimede</hi>) and therfore we hold al thy words
for Axiomes: but is Loue such a lingring maladie? It is (quoth
he) either extreame or meane, according to the minde of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
that entertaines it: for as the weedes grow longer vntoucht
then the prettie floures, and the flint lyes safe in the quarry, when
the Emerauld is suffering the Lapidaries toole: so meane men
are freed from <hi>Venus</hi> iniuries, when kings are enuironed with a
laborinth of her cares. The whiter the Lawne is, the deeper is
the moale, the more purer the Chrysolite the sooner stained: and
such as haue their hearts ful of honour, haue their loues ful of the
greatest sorowes. But in whomsoeuer (quoth <hi>Rosader</hi>) hee fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his dart, hee neuer leaueth to assault him, till either hee hath
wonne him to folly or fancy: for as the Moone neuer goes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the starre <hi>Lunisequa,</hi> so a Louer neuer goeth without the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest

quoth <hi>Rosader,</hi> but my hard fortunes, whose destenies haue
crost me with her absence: for did shee feele my loues, she would
not let me linger in these sorrowes. Women, as they are faire, so
they respect faith, and estimate more (if they be honourable) the
wit than the wealth, hauing loyaltie the obiect wherat they ayme
their fancies. But leauing off these interparleyes, you shall heare

all this no release of my passions: so that I resemble him, that in
<pb facs="tcp:20331:34"/>
the deapth of his distresse hath none but the Eccho to answere
him. <hi>Ganimede</hi> pitttying her <hi>Rosader,</hi> thinking to driue him
out of his amorous melancholy, said, that now the Sunne was in
his Meridionall heat, and that it was high noone, therefore wee
shepheards say, tis time to go to dinner: for the Sunne and our
stomackes, are Shepheards dials. Therefore Forrester, if thou
wilt take such fare as comes out of our homely scrips, welcome
shall answere whatsoeuer thou wantst in delicates. <hi>Aliena</hi> tooke
the entertainment by the ende, and tolde <hi>Rosader</hi> hee should bee
her guest. He thankt them heartily, and sat with them downe to
dinner: where they had such cates as Countrey state did allow
them, sawst with such content, and such sweete prattle, as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
farre more sweet, than all their Courtly iunckets.</p>
               <p>Assoone as they had taken their repast, <hi>Rosader</hi> giuing them
thankes for his good cheare, would haue been gone: but <hi>Gani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede,</hi>
that was loath to let him passe out of her presence, began
thus: Nay Forrester quoth he, if thy busines be not the greater,
seeing thou saift thou art so deeply in loue, let mee see how thou
canst wooe: I will represent <hi>Rosalynde,</hi> and thou shalt bee as
thou art <hi>Rosader,</hi> see in some amorous Eglogue, how if <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynd</hi>

drew forth a recorder, and began to winde it. Then the louyng

               <p>When thus they had finished their courting Eglogue in such
a familiar clause, <hi>Ganimede</hi> as Augure of some good fortunes
to light vpon their affections, began to be thus pleasant: How
now Forrester, haue I not fitted your turne? haue I not playde
the woman handsomely, and shewed my selfe as coy in graunts,
as courteous in desires, and beene as full of suspicion, as men of
flattery? And yet to salue all, iumpe I not all vp with the sweet
vnion of loue? Did not <hi>Rosalinde</hi> content her <hi>Rosader?</hi> The
Forrester at this smiling, shooke his head, and folding his armes
made this merrie reply.</p>
               <p>Truth gentle Swaine, <hi>Rosader</hi> hath his <hi>Rosalynde,</hi> but as
<hi>Ixion</hi> had <hi>Iuno,</hi> who thinking to possesse a goddesse, only imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a clowd: in these imaginary fruitions of fancie, I resemble
the birds that fed themselues with <hi>Zeuxis</hi> painted grapes: but
they grew so leane with pecking at shadows, that they were glad
with <hi>Aesops</hi> Cocke to scrape for a barley cornell: so fareth it
with me, who to feed my self with the hope of my Mistris fauors,
<pb facs="tcp:20331:36"/>
sooth my selfe in thy sutes, and onely in conceipt reape a wished
for content: but if my foode bee no better than such amorous
dreams, <hi>Venus</hi> at the yeares end, shal find me but a leane louer.
Yet do I take these follyes for high fortunes, and hope these fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
affections do deuine some vnfained ende of ensuing fancies.
And thereupon (quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) Ile play the priest, from this daye
forth <hi>Ganimede</hi> shall call thee husband, and thou shalt cal <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimede</hi>
wife, and so weele haue a marriage. Content quoth <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader,</hi>
and laught. Content quoth <hi>Ganimede,</hi> and chaunged as
red as a rose: and so with a smile and a blush, they made vp this
iesting match, that after proued to a marriage in earnest; <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
full little thinking hee had wooed and woonne his <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all was well, hope is a sweet string to harpe on, &amp; therfore
let the Forrester a while shape himselfe to his shadow, and tarrie
fortunes leysure, till she may make a Metamorphosis fit for his
purpose. I digresse, and therefore to <hi>Aliena:</hi> who saide, the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
was not worth a pinne, vnlesse there were some cheare, nor
that bargaine well made that was not striken vp with a cuppe of
wine: and therefore she wild <hi>Ganimede</hi> to set out such cates as
they had, and to draw out her bottle, charging the Forrester as
he had imagined his loues, so to conceipt these cates to be a most
sumptuous banquet, and to take a Mazer of wine, and to drinke
to his <hi>Rosalynde,</hi> which <hi>Rosader</hi> did, and so they passed awaye
the day in many pleasant deuices. Till at last <hi>Aliena</hi> perceyued
time would tarry no man, and that the Sun waxed very low, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to set: which made her shorten their amorous prattle, and end
the banquet with a fresh Carrowse: which done, they all three a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose,
and <hi>Aliena</hi> brake off thus.</p>
               <p>Now Forrester, <hi>Phoebus</hi> that all this while hath beene parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of our sports, seeing euery woodman more fortunate in his
loues, than he in his fancies: seeing thou hast woon <hi>Rosalynde,</hi>
when he could not woo <hi>Daphne,</hi> hides his head for shame, &amp; bids
vs adiew in a clowd, our sheepe they poore wantons wander to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their foldes, as caught by Nature their due times of rest,
which tels vs forester, we must depart. Marry though there were

you her as good a mayd as I find her. Content quoth <hi>Rosader,</hi>
tis enough for me in the night to dreame on loue, that in the day
am so fond to doate an loue: and so till to morrowe you to your
Folds, and I will to my Lodge: and thus the Forrester and they
parted. He was no sooner gone, but <hi>Aliena</hi> &amp; <hi>Ganimede</hi> went
and folded their flocks, and taking vp their hookes, their bags, &amp;
their bottles, hyed homeward. By the way (<hi>Aliena</hi> to make the
time seeme short) began to prattle with <hi>Ganimede</hi> thus: I haue
heard them say, that what the Fates forepoint, that Fortune pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
downe with a Period, that the Starres are sticklers in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
Court, and Desire hangs at the heele of Destenie: if it be so,
then by all probable coniecures, this match will be a marriage:
for if Augurisme be authenticall, or the Deuines doomes princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
it cannot bee but such a shadow portends the issue of a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
for to that ende did the Gods force the conceit of this Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
that they might discouer the ensuing consent of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections:
so that ere it bee long, I hope (in earnest) to daunce at
your wedding.</p>
               <p>Tush (quoth <hi>Ganimede</hi>) all is not malte that is cast on the
kill, there goes more words to a bargaine than one, loue feeles no
footing in the aire, and fancie holdes it slippery harbour to nestle
in the tongue: the match is not yet so surely made, but hee may
misse of his market: but if fortune be his friend, I will not be his
foe: and so I pray you (gentle Mistresse <hi>Aliena</hi>) take it. I take
all things well (quoth she) that is your content, and am glad <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader</hi>
is yours: for now I hope your thoughts will bee at quiet:
your eye that euer looked at Loue, will now lende a glaunce on
your Lambes, and then they will proue more buxsome, and you
more blyth, for the eyes of the Maister feedes the Cattle. As thus
they were in chat, they spyed olde <hi>Coridon</hi> where he came plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to meet them: who told them supper was ready, which news
made them speed them home. Where we will leaue them to the
next morrow, and returne to <hi>Saladyne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this while did poore <hi>Saladyne</hi> (banished from <hi>Bourdeux</hi>
and the Court of France by <hi>Torismond</hi>) wander vp and downe
in the Forrest of <hi>Arden,</hi> thinking to get to <hi>Lyons,</hi> and so tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
<pb facs="tcp:20331:37"/>
through <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>Italie:</hi> but the Forrest beeing full
of by pathes, and he vnskilfull of the country coast, slipt out of the
way, and chaunced vp into the Desart, not farre from the place
where <hi>Gerismond</hi> was, &amp; his brother <hi>Rosader. Saladyne</hi> wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
with wandring vp and downe, and hungry with long fasting,
finding a little caue by the side of a thicker, eating such fruite as
the Forrest did affoord, and contenting himselfe with such drinke
as Nature had prouided, and thirst made delicate, after his repast
he fell in a dead sleepe. As thus he lay, a hungry Lyon came hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
downe the edge of the groue for pray, and espying <hi>Saladyne</hi>
began to ceaze vpon him: but seeing he lay still without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he left to touch him, for that Lyons hate to pray on dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasses:
and yet desirous to haue some foode, the Lion lay downe
and watcht to see if he would stirre. While thus <hi>Saladyne</hi> slept
secure, fortune that was careful of her champion, began to smile,
and brought it so to passe, that <hi>Rosader</hi> (hauing striken a Deere
that but lightly hurt fled through the thicket) came pacing down
by the groue with a Boare speare in his hande in great haste, he
spyed where a man lay a sleepe, and a Lyon fast by him: amazed
at this sight, as he stoode gazing, his nose on the sodaine bledde,
which made him coniecture it was some friend of his. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
drawing more nigh, he might easily discerne his visage, and
perceiued by his phisnomie that it was his brother <hi>Saladyne:</hi>
which draue <hi>Rosader</hi> into a deepe passion, as a man perplexed at
the sight of so vnexpected a chance, maruelling what should driue
his Brother to trauerse those secrete Desarts without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
in such distresse and forlorne sorte. But the present time
craued no such doubting ambages: for he must eyther resolue to
hazard his life for his reliefe, or else steale away, and leaue him to
the crueltie of the Lyon. In which doubt hee thus briefly debated
with himselfe.</p>

               <head>Rosaders meditation.</head>
               <p>NOw <hi>Rosader,</hi> Fortune that long hath whipt thee with net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
meanes to salue thee with roses, and hauing crost thee
with many frownes, now she presents thee with the brightnesse
<pb facs="tcp:20331:38"/>
of her fauors. Thou that didst count thy selfe the most distressed
of all men, maiest account thy selfe the most fortunate amongst
men: if fortune can make men happy, or sweet reuenge be wrapt
in a pleasing content. Thou seest <hi>Saladyne</hi> thine enemie, the
worker of thy misfortunes, and the efficient cause of thine exile,
subiect to the crueltie of a mercilesse Lyon: brought into this
miserie by the Gods, that they might seeme iust in reuenging
his rigour, and thy iniuries. Seest thou not how the Starres are
in a fauorable aspect, the planets in some pleasing coniunction,
the fates agreeable to thy thoughts, and the destinies performers
of thy desires, in that <hi>Saladyne</hi> shall die, and thou bee free of his
bloud: he receiue meed for his amisse, and thou erect his Tombe
with innocent handes. Now <hi>Rosader</hi> shalt thou retourne vnto
<hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and enioy thy possessions by birth, and his reuenews
by inheritaunce: now mayest thou triumph in Loue, and hang
fortunes Altars with garlands. For when <hi>Rosalynde</hi> heares
of thy wealth, it will make her loue thee the more willingly: for
womens eyes are made of Chrisecoll, that is euer vnperfect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
tempred with gold: and <hi>Iupiter</hi> soonest enioyed <hi>Danae,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee came to her in so rich a shower. Thus shall this Lyon
(<hi>Rosader</hi>) ende the life of a miserable man, and from distresse
raise thee to be most fortunate. And with that casting his Boare
speare on his necke away he began to trudge. But hee had not
stept backe two or three paces, but a new motion stroke him to
the very hart, that resting his Boare speare against his brest, hee
fell into this passionate humour.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Rosader,</hi> wert thou the sonne of Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bourdeux,</hi>
whose vertues exceeded his valour, and the most hardiest Knight
in all <hi>Europe?</hi> Should the honour of the Father shine in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Sonne? and wilt thou dishonour thy parentage, in
forgetting the nature of a Gentleman? Did not thy father at his
last gaspe breath out this golden principle: Brothers amitie is
like the drops of <hi>Balsamum,</hi> that salueth the most daungerous
sores? Did he make a large exhort vnto concord, and wilt thou
shew thy selfe carelesse? Oh <hi>Rosader,</hi> what though <hi>Saladyne</hi>
hath wronged thee, and made the liue an exile in the Forrest?
shall thy Nature bee so cruell, or thy Nurture so crooked, or thy
<pb facs="tcp:20331:38"/>
thoughtes so sauage, as to suffer so dismall a reuenge? what, to
let him be deuoured by wilde beastes? <hi>Non sapit, qui non sibi
sapit</hi> is fondly spoken in such bitter extreames. Loose not his life
<hi>Rosader,</hi> to win a world of treasure: for in hauing him thou hast
a broth<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r, and by hazarding for his life, thou gettest a friend, and
reconcilest an enemie: and more honour shalt thou purchase by
pleasuring a foe, than reuenging a thousand iniuries.</p>
               <p>With that his Brother began to stirre, and the Lion to rowse
himselfe: whereupon <hi>Rosader</hi> sodainly charged him with the
Boare speare, and wounded the Lion very sore at the first stroke.
The beast feeling himselfe to haue a mortall hurt, leapt at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader,</hi>
and with his pawes gaue him a sore piuch on the brest, that
he had almost faln: yet as a man most valiant, in whom the sparks
of Sir <hi>Iohn of Burdeaux</hi> remained, he recouered himselfe, and
in short combat slew the Lion: who at his death roared so lowd,
that <hi>Saladyne</hi> awaked, and starting vp was amazed at the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
sight of so monstrous a beast lying slaine by him, and so sweet
a Gentleman wounded. He presently (as hee was of a ripe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt)
began to coniecture, that the Gentleman had slaine him in
his defence. Whereupon (as a man in a traunce) he stood staring
on them both a good while, not knowing his Brother beeing in
that disguise: at last he burst into these tearmes.</p>
               <p>Sir, whatsoeuer thou be (as full of honour thou must needes
be, by the view of thy present valour) I perceiue thou hast redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
my fortunes by thy courage, and saued my life with thine own
losse: which tyes me to be thine in all humble seruice. Thankes
thou shalt haue as thy due, and more thou canst not haue: for my
abilitie denies me to performe a deeper debt. But if any wayes
it please thee to commaund me, vse mee as farre as the power of
a poore Gentleman may stretch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rosader</hi> seeing hee was vnknowne to his Brother, woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to heare such courteous words come from his crabbed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but glad of such reformed nurture, he made this answere. I
am sir (whatsoeuer thou art) a Forrester and Ranger of these
walkes: who following my Deere to the fall, was conducted hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by some assenting Fate, the I might saue thee, and dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
my selfe. For comming into this place, I saw thee a sleepe,
<pb facs="tcp:20331:39"/>
and the Lyon watching thy awake, that at thy rising hee might
pray vppon thy carkasse. At the first sight I coniectured thee a
Gentleman (for all mens thoughts ought to bee fouorable in i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination)
and I counted it the part of a resolute man to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
a strangers reliefe, though with the losse of his owne blood:
which I haue performed (thou seest) to mine owne preiudice.
If therefore thou be a man of such worth as I value thee by thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
liniaments, make discourse vnto me what is the cause of
thy present misfortunes. For by the furrowes in thy face thou see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
to be crost with her frownes: but whatsoeuer or howsoeuer,
lette mee craue that fauour, to heare the tragicke cause of thy
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. <hi>Saladyne</hi> sitting downe, and fetching a deepe sigh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
thus.</p>

               <head>Saladynes discourse to Rosader
vnknowne.</head>
               <p>ALthough the discourse of my fortunes, be the renewing of my
sorrowes, and the rubbing of the scarre, will open a fresh
wound: yet that I may not prooue ingratefull to so courteous a
Gentleman, I wil rather sitte downe and sigh out my estate, then
giue any offence by smothering my griefe with silence. Knowe
therefore (sir) that I am of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and the sonne and heyre
of Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> a man for his vertues and valour so
famous, that I cannot thinke, but the fame of his honours hath
reacht further than the knowledge of his personage. The infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
sonne of so fortunate a Knight am I, my name <hi>Saladine:</hi>
who succeeding my Father in possessions, but not in qualities,
hauing two Brethren committed by my Father at his death to
my charge, with such golden principles of brotherly concorde, as
might haue pierst like the <hi>Syrens</hi> melodie into any humane eare.
But I (with <hi>Vlisses</hi> became deafe against his Philosophicall
harmony, and made more value of profit than of vertue, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
gold sufficient honour, and wealth the fittest title for a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans

to bee a Scholler, counting it enough if he might pore on a booke
while I fed on his reuenewes: and for the yoongest (which was
my Fathers ioye) yoong <hi>Rosader.</hi> And with that, naming of
<pb facs="tcp:20331:39"/>
                  <hi>Rosader, Saladyne</hi> sate him downe and wept,</p>
               <p>Nay forward man (quoth the Forrester) teares are the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fittest
salue that any man can apply for to cure sorrows, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cease from such feminine follies, as should drop out of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
eye to deceiue, not out of a Gentlemans looke to discouer
his thoughts, and forward with thy discourse.</p>
               <p>Oh sir (quoth <hi>Saladyne</hi>) this <hi>Rosader</hi> that wrings tears from
my eyes, and blood from my heart, was like my father in exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
personage &amp; in inward qualities: for in the prime of his yeres
he aymed all his acts at honor, and couered rather to die, than to
brooke any iniury vnworthy a Gentlemans credite. I, whom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
had made blinde, and couetousnesse masked with the vayle of
selfe-loue, seeing the Palme tree grow straight, thought to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
it being a twig: but Nature wil haue her course, the Cedar
wil be tall, the Diamond bright, the Carbuncle glistering, and
vertue wil shine though it be neuer so much obscured. For I kept
<hi>Rosader</hi> as a slaue, and vsed him as one of my seruile hindes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
age grew on, and a secret insight of my abuse entred into his
minde: insomuch, that he could not brooke it, but coueted to haue
what his father left him, and to liue of himselfe. To be short sir,
I repined at his fortunes, and he countercheckt me not with abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
but valour, vntil at last by my friends and ayde of such as fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
gold more than right or vertue, I banisht him from <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi>
and hee poore Gentleman liues no man knowes where in
some distressed discontent. The Gods not able to suffer such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie
vnreuenged, so wrought, that the King pickt a causelesse
quarrel against me, in hope to haue my lands, &amp; so hath exiled me
out of <hi>France</hi> for euer. Thus, thus sir, am I the most miserable of
almen, as hauing a blemish in my thoughts for the wrongs I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<hi>Rosader,</hi> and a touch in my estate to be throwne from my
proper possessions by iniustice. Passionat thus with many griefs,
in penance of my former follies, I go thus pilgrime like to seeke
out my brother, that I may reconcile my self to him in all submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and afterward wend to the holy Land, to ende my yeares in
as many vertues, as I haue spent my youth in wicked vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rosader</hi> hearing the resolution of his brother <hi>Saladyne,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb facs="tcp:20331:40"/>
to compassionate his sorrowes, and not able to smother the
sparkes of Nature with fained secretie, he burst into these louing
speeches. Then know <hi>Saladyne</hi> (quoth hee) that thou hast met
with <hi>Rosader,</hi> who grieues as much to see thy distresse, as thy
selfe to feele the burthen of thy misery. <hi>Saladyne</hi> casting vp his
eye, and noting well the phisnomy of the Forrester, knew that it
was his brother <hi>Rosader:</hi> which made him so bash and blush at
the first meeting, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Rosader</hi> was faine to recomfort him. Which
he did in such sort, that hee shewed how highly he held reuenge in
scorne. Much a doo there was betweene these two brethren. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladyne</hi>
in crauing pardon, and <hi>Rosader</hi> in forgiuing and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all former iniuries: the one submisse, the other curteous; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladyne</hi>
penitent and passionate, <hi>Rosader</hi> kynd and louing; that
at length Nature working an vnion of their thoughts, they ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
embraced, and fell from matters of vnkindnesse, to talke of
the Country life, which <hi>Rosader</hi> so highly commended, that his
brother began to haue a desire to taste of that homely content. In
this humor <hi>Rosader</hi> conducted him to <hi>Gerismonds</hi> Lodge, and
presented his brother to the King, discoursing the whole matter
how all had hapned betwixt them. The King looking vpon <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne,</hi>
found him a man of a most beautifull personage, and sawe
in his face sufficient sparkes of ensuing honors, gaue him great
entertainment, and glad of their friendly reconcilement, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
such fauour as the pouertic of his estate might affoord: which
<hi>Saladyne</hi> gratefully accepted. And so <hi>Gerismond</hi> fell to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Torismonds</hi> life? <hi>Saladyne</hi> briefly discourst vnto him his
iniustice &amp; tyrannies: with such modestie (although hee had wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him) that <hi>Gerismond</hi> greatly praised the sparing speech of
the yoong Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Many questions past, but atlast <hi>Gerismond</hi> began with a
deepe sigh, to inquire if there were any newes of the welfare of
<hi>Alinda</hi> or his daughter <hi>Rosalynd?</hi> None sir quoth <hi>Saladyne,</hi>
for since their departure they were neuer heard of. Iniurious
Fortune (quoth the King) that to double the fathers miserie,
wrongst the daughter with misfortunes. And with that (surchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with sorrows) he went into his Cell, and left <hi>Saladyne</hi> and
<hi>Rosader,</hi> whome <hi>Rosader</hi> straight conducted to the sight of
<pb facs="tcp:20331:40"/>
                  <hi>Adam Spencer.</hi> Who seeing <hi>Saladyne</hi> in that estate, was in a
browne study: but when he heard the whole matter, although hee
grieued for the exile of his maister, yet be ioyed that banishment
had so reformed him, that from a lasciuious youth he was proued
a verteous Gentleman. Looking a longer while, and seeing what
familiaritie past betweene them, and what fauours were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
with brotherly affection, he sayd thus: I marry, thus it
should be, this was the concord that old sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi>
wisht betwyxt you. Now fulfil you those precepts hee breathed
out at his death, and in obseruing them, looke to liue fortunate,
and die honourable. Well sayd <hi>Adam Spencer</hi> quoth <hi>Rosader,</hi>
but hast any victuals in store for vs? A piece of a red Deer (quoth
he) and a bottle of wine. Tis Forresters fare brother, quoth <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader:</hi>
and so they sat downe &amp; sel to their cates. Assoone as they
had taken their repast, and had wel dined, <hi>Rosader</hi> tooke his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Saladyne</hi> by the hand, and shewed him the pleasures of the
Forrest, and what content they enioyed in that mean estate. Thus
for two or three dayes he walked vp and downe with his brother,
to shew him all the commodities that belonged to his walke. In
which time hee was mist of his <hi>Ganymede,</hi> who mused greatly
(with <hi>Aliena</hi>) what shuld become of their forester. Somewhile
they thought he had taken some word vnkindly, and had taken the
pet: then they imagined some new Loue had withdrawne his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
or happely that he was sicke, or detained by some great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of <hi>Gerismonds,</hi> or that hee had made a reconcilement with
his brother, and so returned to <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These coniectures did they cast in their heades, but special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Ganimede:</hi> who hauyng Loue in heart prooued restlesse, and
halfe without patience, that <hi>Rosader</hi> wronged her with so long
absence: for Loue measures euerie minute, and thinkes houres
to bee dayes, and dayes to bee moneths, till they feede theyr
eyes with the sight of theyr desired obiect. Thus perplexed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
poore <hi>Ganymede:</hi> while on a day sitting with <hi>Aliena</hi> in
a great dumpe, she cast vp her eye, and saw where <hi>Rosader</hi> came
pacing towardes them with his Forrest bill on his necke. At that
sight her colour changde, and shee said to <hi>Aliena,</hi> See Mistresse
where our iolly Forrester comes. And you are not a little glad
<pb facs="tcp:20331:41"/>
thereof (quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) your nose bewrayes what porredge you
loue, the winde cannot be tyed within his quarter, the Sun sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with a vayle, Oyle hidden in water, nor Loue kept out of
of a womans lookes: but no more of that, <hi>Lupus est in fabula.</hi>
Assoone as <hi>Rosader</hi> was come within the reach of her tongues
ende, <hi>Aliena</hi> began thus: Why how now gentle Forrester, what
winde hath kept you from hence? that being so newly marryed,
you haue no more care of your <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> but to absent your self
so many dayes? Are these the passions you painted out so in your
Sonnets and roundelaies? I see well hote loue is soone cold, and
that the fancy of men, is like to a loose feather that wandreth in
the ayre with the blast of euery wynd. You are deceiued Mistres
quoth <hi>Rosader,</hi> twas a coppy of vnkindnes that kept me hence,
in that I being married, you caried away the Bride: but if I haue
giuen any occasion of offence by absenting my selfe these three
daies, I humbly sue for pardon: which you must grant of course,
in that the fault is so friendly confest with penance. But to tel you
the truth (faire Mistresse, and my good <hi>Rosalynd</hi>) my eldest bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the iniury of <hi>Torismond</hi> is banished from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi>
and by chance hee and I met in the Forrest. And heere <hi>Rosader</hi>
discourst vnto them what had happened betwixt them: which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement
made them glad, especially <hi>Ganimede.</hi> But <hi>Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
hearing of the tyrannie of her father, grieued inwardly, and yet
smothred all things with such secrecy, that the concealing was
more sorrow then the conceipt: yet that her estate might bee hyd
stil, she made faire weather of it, and so let all passe.</p>
               <p>Fortune, that sawe how these parties valued not her Deitie,
but held her power in scorne, thought to haue about with them,
and brought the matter to passe thus. Certaine Rascals that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by prowling in the Forest, who for feare of the Prouost Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
had Caues in the groaues and thickets, to shrowde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from his traines: hearing of the beautie of this faire shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardesse
<hi>Aliena,</hi> thought to steale her away, and to giue her to
the King for a present, hoping, because the King was a great lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
by such a gift to purchase all their pardons: and therefore
came to take her and her Page away. Thus resolued, while <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liena</hi>
and <hi>Ganimede</hi> were in sad talke, they came rushing in,
<pb facs="tcp:20331:41"/>
and layd violent hands vpon <hi>Aliena</hi> and her Page, which made
them crye out to <hi>Rosader:</hi> who hauing the valour of his father
stamped in his hart, thought rather to die in defence of his friends,
than any way bee toucht with the least blemish of dishonour: and
therfore dealt such blowes amongst them with his weapon, as he
did witnesse well vpon their carkasses, that hee was no coward.
But as <hi>Ne Hercules quidem contra duos,</hi> so <hi>Rosader</hi> could not
resist a multitude, hauing none to backe him: so that hee was not
onely rebatted, but sore wounded, and <hi>Aliena</hi> and <hi>Ganimede</hi>
had been quite carryed away by these Rascalles, had not Fortune
(that ment to turne her frowne into a fauour) brought <hi>Saladyne</hi>
that way by chance, who wandring to find out his brothers walk,
encountred this crue: and seeing not onely a shepheardesse and
her boy forced, but his brother wounded, he heaued vp a Forrest
bill be had on his neck, and the first he stroke had neuer after more
need of the Phisition: redoubling his blowes with such courage,
that the flaues were amazed at his valour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rosader</hi> espying his brother so fortunately arriued, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how valiantly he behaued himselfe, though sore wounded, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
amongst them, and layd on such loade, that some of the crue
were slaine, and the rest fled, leauing <hi>Aliena</hi> and <hi>Ganimede</hi> in
the possession of <hi>Rosader</hi> and <hi>Saladyne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aliena</hi> after shee had breathed a while and was come to her
selfe from this feare, lookt about her, and saw where <hi>Ganimede</hi>
was busie dressyng vp the woundes of the forrester: but shee cast
her eye vpon this curteous Champion that had made so hotte a
rescue, and that with such affection, that shee began to measure
euery part of him with fauour, and in her selfe to commende his
personage and his vertue, holding him for a resolute man, that
durst assaile such a troupe of vnbrydeled villaines. At last gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her spirits together, she returned him these thankes.</p>
               <p>Gentle sir, whatsoeuer you bee that haue aduentured your
flesh to relieue our fortunes, &amp; to haue as many hidden vertues,
as you haue manifest resolutions. Wee poore Shepheards haue
no wealth but our flocks, and therefore can wee not make requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
with any great treasures: but our recompence is thankes,
and our rewards to our friends without faining. For rannsome
<pb facs="tcp:20331:42"/>
therefore of this our rescue, you must content your selfe to take
such a kinde gramercy, as a poore shepheardesse and her Page
may giue: with promise (in what wee may) neuer to prooue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull.
For this Gentleman that is hurt, yoong <hi>Rosader,</hi> hee
is our good neighbour and familiar acquaintance, weele pay him
with smiles, and feed him with loue-lookes: and though he be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the fatter at the yeares ende, yet weele so hamper him that he
shall hold himselfe satisfied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saladyne</hi> hearing this shepheardesse speake so wisely, began
more narrowly to pry into her perfection, and to suruey all her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaments
with a curious insight: so long dallying in the flame of
her beautie, that to his cost he found her to be most excellent: for
Loue that lucked in all these broyles to haue a blow or two, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the parties at the gaze, encountred them both with such a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that the stroke pierst to the heart so deep, as it could neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be raced out. At last after hee had looked so long, till <hi>Aliena</hi>
waxt red, he returned her this answere.</p>
               <p>Faire Shepheardesse, if Fortune graced me with such good
hap, as to doo you any fauour, I hold my selfe as contented, as if
I had gotten a great conquest: for the reliefe of distressed women
is the speciall point, that Gentleman are tyed vnto by honor: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then my hazard to rescue your harmes, was rather duty than
curtesie, thankes is more than belongs to the requitall of such a
fauour. But least I might seeme either too coy or too carelesse of
a Gentlewomans proffer, I will take your kinde gramercie for a
recompence. All this while that he spake, <hi>Ganimede</hi> lookt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
vpon him, and sayd, Truly <hi>Rosader,</hi> this Gentleman fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
you much in the feature of your face. No maruell (quoth
he, gentle Swayne) for tis my eldest brother <hi>Saladyne.</hi> Your
brother quoth <hi>Aliena?</hi> (and with that she blusht) he is the more
welcome, and I hold my self the more his debter: and for that he
hath in my behalf done such a piece of seruice, if it please him to do
me that honor, I wil cal him seruant, and he shal cal me mistresse.
Content sweet mistresse quoth <hi>Saladyne,</hi> and when I forget to
call you so, I wil be vnmindfull of mine owne selfe. Away with
these quirkes and quiddities of loue quoth <hi>Rosader,</hi> and giue me
some drinke, for I am passyng thirstie, and then will I home for
<pb facs="tcp:20331:42"/>
my woundes bleed sore, and I will haue them drest. <hi>Ganimede</hi>
had teares in her eyes, and passions in her heart to see her <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
so payned, and therefore stept hastily to the bottle, and filling
out some wine in a Mazer, shee spiced it with such comfortable
drugges as she had about her, and gaue it him, which did comfort
<hi>Rosader:</hi> that rysing (with the helpe of his brother) hee tooke his
leaue of them, and went to his Lodge. <hi>Ganimede</hi> assoone as they
were out of sight, led his flocks downe to a vale, and there vnder
the shadow of a Beech tree sat downe, and began to mourne the
misfortunes of her sweet heart.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Aliena</hi> (as a woman passyng discontent) seuering her
selfe from her <hi>Ganimede,</hi> sitting vnder a Lymon tree, began to
to sigh out the passions of her new Loue, and to meditate with hir
selfe on this maner.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Alienaes meditation.</head>
               <p>AYe me, now I see, and sorrowing sigh to see that <hi>Dianaes</hi>
Lawrels are harbours for <hi>Venus Doues,</hi> that there trace as
well through the Lawnes, wantons as chast ones, that <hi>Calisto</hi>
be she neuer so charie, wil cast one amorous eye at courting <hi>Ioue:</hi>
that <hi>Diana</hi> her selfe will chaunge her shape, but shee will honour
Loue in a shaddow: that maydens eyes bee they as hard as Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
yet <hi>Cupide</hi> hath drugs to make them more pliable than
waxe. See <hi>Alinda,</hi> how Fortune and Loue haue interleagued
themselues to be thy foes: and to make thee theyr subiect or els
an abiect, haue inueigled thy sight with a most beautifull obiect.
Alate thou didst hold <hi>Venus</hi> for a giglot, not a goddesse, and now
thou shalt bee forst to sue suppliant to her Deitie. <hi>Cupide</hi> was
a boy and blinde, but alas his eye had ayme inough to pierce thee
to the hart. While I liued in the Court, I held Loue in contempt,
and in high seats I had small desires. I knew not affection while
I liued in dignitie, nor could <hi>Venus</hi> counterchecke me, as long
as my fortune was maiestie, and my thoughtes honour: and
shall I now bee high in desires, when I am made lowe by Deste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie?</p>
               <p>I haue heard them say, that Loue lookes not at low cottages,
<pb facs="tcp:20331:43"/>
that <hi>Venus</hi> iettes in Roabes not in ragges, that <hi>Cupide</hi> flyes so
high, that hee scornes to touch pouertie with his heele. Tush <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda,</hi>
these are but olde wiues tales, and neither authenticall
precepts, nor infallible principles: for experience tels thee, that
Peasauntes haue theyr passions, as well as Princes, that
Swaynes as they haue theyr labours, so they haue theyr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moures,
and Loue lurkes assoone about a Sheepcoate, as a Pallaice.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Alinda,</hi> this day in auoyding a preiudice thou art fallen
into a deeper mischiefe, being rescued from the robbers, thou art
become captiue to <hi>Saladyne:</hi> and what then? Women must loue,
or they must cease to liue: and therefore did Nature frame them
faire, that they might be subiect to fancy. But perhaps <hi>Saladines</hi>
eye is leuelde vpon a more seemlier Saint. If it be so, beare thy
passions with patience, say Loue hath wrongd thee, that hath not
wroong him, and if he be proud in contempt, be thou rich in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and rather dye than discouer any desire: for there is nothing
more pretious in a woman, than to conceale Loue, and to die mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest.
He is the sonne and heire of sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> a youth
comely enough: oh <hi>Alinda,</hi> too comely, els hadst not thou been
thus discontent: valiant, and that fettered thine eye: wise, else
hadst thou not been now wonne: but for all these vertues, bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by thy father, and therefore if he know thy parentage, he wil
hate the fruit for the tree, and condemne the yoong sien for the old
stocke. Well, howsoeuer, I must loue: and whomsoeuer, I will:
and whatsoeuer betide, <hi>Aliena</hi> wil thinke wel of <hi>Saladyne:</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he of me as he please. And with that fetching a deep sigh, she
rise vp, and went to <hi>Ganimede:</hi> who all this while sat in a great
dumpe, fearing the imminent danger of her friend <hi>Rosader,</hi> but
now <hi>Aliena</hi> began to comfort her, her selfe being ouer growne
with sorrowes, and to recall her from her melancholy with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pleasaunt perswasions. <hi>Ganimede</hi> tooke all in the best part,
and so they went home togither after they had folded their flocks,
supping with old <hi>Coridon,</hi> who had prouided there cates. Hee
after supper, to passe away the night while bed time, began a long
discourse, how <hi>Montanus</hi> the yoong shepheard that was in loue
with <hi>Phoebe,</hi> could by no meanes obtaine any fauour at her
<pb facs="tcp:20331:43"/>
hands: but still pained in restlesse passions, remained a hopelesse
and perplexed Louer. I would I might (quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) once see
that <hi>Phoebe,</hi> is she so faire, that she thinks no shepheard worthy
of her beauty? or so froward, that no loue nor loyaltie will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
her, or so coy, that she requires a long time to he wooed, or so
foolish that she forgets, that like a fop she must haue a large har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
for a little corne?</p>
               <p>I cannot distinguish (quoth <hi>Coridon</hi>) of these nice qualities:
but one of these dayes Ile bring <hi>Montanus</hi> and her downe, that
you may both see their persons, and note their passions: &amp; then
where the blame is, there let it rest. But this I am sure quoth
<hi>Coridon,</hi> if al maidens were of her mind, the world would grow
to a mad passe: for there would be great store of wooing and litle
wedding, many words and little worship, much folly and no faith.
At this sad sentence of <hi>Coridon</hi> so solempnly brought forth, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liena</hi>
smiled: and because it waxt late, she and her page went to
bed, both of them hauing fleas in their eares to keep them awake,
<hi>Ganimede</hi> for the hurt of her <hi>Rosader,</hi> and <hi>Aliena</hi> for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
she bore to <hi>Saladyne.</hi> In this discontented humour they
past away the time, till falling on sleepe, their sences at rest, loue
left them to their quiet slumbers: which were not long. For as
soone as <hi>Phoebus</hi> rose from his <hi>Aurora,</hi> and began to mount
him in the Skie, summoning Plough-swaines to their handy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<hi>Aliena</hi> arose, and going to the couch where <hi>Ganimede</hi>
lay, awakened her page, and said the morning was farre spent, the
deaw small, and time called them away to their foldes. Ah, ah
quoth <hi>Ganimede,</hi> is the wind in that doore? then in fayth I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiue
that there is no Diamond so hard but will yeeld to the file,
no Cedar so strong but the wind will shake, nor any mind so chast
but Loue will change. Well <hi>Aliena,</hi> must <hi>Saladyne</hi> be the man,
and will it be a match? Trust me he is faire and valiant, the sonne
of a worthy Knight, whome if he imitate in perfection, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
him in proportion, he is worthy of no lesse than <hi>Aliena.</hi>
But he is an exile, what then? I hope my Mistresse respectes the
vertues not the wealth, and measures the qualities not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Those Dames that are like <hi>Danae,</hi> that like <hi>Ioue</hi> in no
shape but in a shower of gold: I wish them husbands with much
<pb facs="tcp:20331:44"/>
wealth and little witte, that the want of the one may blemish the
abundance of the other. It should (my <hi>Aliena</hi>) slayne the honour
of a shepheards life to set the end of passions vpon pelfe. Loues
eyes looks not so low as golde, there is no fees to be payd in <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids</hi>
Courtes: and in elder time (as <hi>Coridon</hi> hath told me) the
Shepheards Loue-gifts were apples and chestnuts, &amp; then their
desires were loyall, and their thoughts constant. But now
<q>Quaerenda pecunia primum, post nummos virtus.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And the time is grown to that which <hi>Horace</hi> in his Satyres
wrote on:
<q>
                     <l>omnis enim res</l>
                     <l>Virtus famae decus diuina humanaque pulchris</l>
                     <l>Diuitiis parent: quas qui constrinxerint ille</l>
                     <l>Clarus erit, fortis, iustus, sapiens, etiam &amp; rex</l>
                     <l>Et quicquid volet-</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Aliena</hi> lette it not be so with thee in thy fancies, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
his faith, and there an ende. <hi>Aliena</hi> hearing <hi>Ganimede</hi>
thus forward to further <hi>Saladyne</hi> in his affections, thought shee
kist the child for the nurses sake, and woed for him that she might
please <hi>Rosader,</hi> made this reply. Why <hi>Ganimede,</hi> whereof
growes this perswasion? Hast thou seene Loue in my lookes? or
are mine eyes growne so amorous, that they discouer some newe
intertayned fancies: If thou measurest my thoughts by my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
thou maiest proue as ill a Phisiognomer as the Lapida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that aymes at the secrete vertues of the Topare, by the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
shadow of the stone. The operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Agate is not known
by the strakes, not the Diamond prized by his brightnesse, but by
his hardnesse. The Carbuncle that shineth most, is not euer the
most pretious: and the Apothecaries choose not flowers for their
colours, but for their vertues. Womens faces are not alwayes
Calenders of fancie, nor do their thought and their lookes euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
for when their eyes are fullest of fauors, then are they oft
most emptie of desire: and when they seeme to frowne at disdain,
then are they most forward to affection. If I bee melancholie,
then <hi>Ganimede,</hi> tis not a consequence that I am intangled with
the perfection of <hi>Saladyne.</hi> But seeing fire cannot be hid in the
<pb facs="tcp:20331:44"/>
straw, nor Loue kept so couert but it will be spyed, what shoulde
friends conceale fancies? Knowe my <hi>Ganimede,</hi> the beautie
and valour, the wit and prowesse of <hi>Saladyne</hi> hath fettered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liena</hi>
so farre, as there is no obiect pleasing to her eyes, but the
sight of <hi>Saladine:</hi> and if Loue haue done me iustice, to wrap his
thoughts in the foldes of my face, and that he be as deeply ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
as I am passionate: I tell thee <hi>Ganimede,</hi> there shall
not be much wooing, for she is already wonne, and what needes
a longer battery. I am glad quoth <hi>Ganimede,</hi> that it shall be
thus proportioned, you to match with <hi>Saladyne,</hi> and I with <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader:</hi>
thus haue the Destenies fauoured vs with some pleasing
aspect, that haue made vs as priuate in our loues, as familiar in
our fortunes.</p>
               <p>With this <hi>Ganimede</hi> start vp, made her ready, and went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fields with <hi>Aliena:</hi> where vnfolding their flockes, they
sate them downe vnder an Oliue tree, both of them amorous, &amp;
yet diuersly affected: <hi>Aliena</hi> ioying in the excellence of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne,</hi>
and <hi>Ganimede</hi> sorowing for the wounds of her <hi>Rosader,</hi>
not quiet in thought till shee might heare of his health. As thus
both of them sate in their dumpes, they might espie where <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>

by a Fountaine, he courting her with his Countrey ditties, and
she as coy as if she held loue in disdaine.</p>
               <p>The newes were so welcome to the two Louers, that vp they
rose, and went with <hi>Coridon.</hi> Assoone as they drew nigh the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
they might espie where <hi>Phoebe</hi> sate, (the fairest shepherdesse
in all <hi>Arden,</hi> and he the frolickst swaine in the whole forrest) she
in a petticote of scarlet, couered with a green mantle, &amp; to shrowd
her from the Sunne, a chaplet of roses: from vnder which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
a face full of Natures excellence, and two such eyes as
might haue amated a greater man than <hi>Montanus.</hi> At gaze vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
this gorgeous Nymph sate the Shepheard, feeding his
<pb facs="tcp:20331:45"/>
eyes with her fauours, wooing with such piteous lookes, &amp; cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with such deepe strained sighs, as would haue made <hi>Diana</hi>
her selfe to haue beene compassionate, at last fixing his lookes on
the riches of her face, his head on his hande, and his elbow on his
knee, he sung this mournefull <hi>Ditttie.</hi>

                  <hi>Montanus</hi> hearing the cruell resolution of <hi>Phoebe,</hi> was so
euergrowne with passions, that from amorous Ditties he fel flat
<pb facs="tcp:20331:46"/>
into these tearmes: Ah <hi>Phoebe</hi> quoth he, wherof art thou made,
that thou regardest not thy maladie? Am I so hatefull an obiect,
that thine eyes condemne mee for an obiect? or so base, that thy
desires cannot stoope so low as to lend me a gratious looke? My
passions are many, my loues more, my thoughts loyaltie, and my
fancie faith: al deuoted in humble deuoire to the seruice of <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be:</hi>
and shall I reape no reward for such fealties. The Swaines
dayly labours is quit with the euenings hire, the Ploughmans
toyle is eased with the hope of corne, what the Oxe sweates out
at the plough, he farneth at the cribbe: but infortunate <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
hath no salue for his sorrowes, nor any hope of recompence
for the hazard of his perplexed passions. If <hi>Phoebe,</hi> time maye
plead the proofe of my truth, twise seauen winters haue I loued
faire <hi>Phoebe:</hi> if constancie be a cause to further my sute, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi>
thoughts haue beene sealed in the sweete of <hi>Phoebes</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence,
as far from change as shee from loue: if outward passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may discouer inward affections, the furrows in my face may
discouer the sorrows of my heart, and the mappe of my looks the
griefs of my mind. Thou seest (<hi>Phoebe</hi>) the teares of despayre
haue made my cheeks full of wrinckles, and my scalding sighes
haue made the ayre Ecchoher pittie conceiued in my plaintes:
<hi>Philomele</hi> hearing my passions, hath left her mournfull tunes
to listen to the discourse of my miseries. I haue pourtrayed in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
tree the beauty of my Mistres, &amp; the despaire of my loues.
What is it in the woods cannot witnes my woes? and who is it
would not pittie my plaints? Only <hi>Phoebe.</hi> And why? Because
I am <hi>Montanus,</hi> &amp; she <hi>Phoebe:</hi> I a worthles Swaine, and she
the most excellent of all faires. Beautifull <hi>Phoebe,</hi> oh might I
say pittifull, then happy were I though I tasted but one minute
of that good hap. Measure <hi>Montanus,</hi> not by his fortunes, but
by his loues, and ballance not his wealth, but his desires, &amp; lende
but one gratious looke to cure a heape of disquieted cares: if not,
ah if <hi>Phoebe</hi> cannot loue, let a storme of frownes end the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of my thoughts, and so let me perish in my desires, because
they are aboue my deserts: onely at my death this fauour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied me, that al shal say <hi>Montanus</hi> died for loue of hard
hearted <hi>Phoebe.</hi> At these words she fild her face full of frowns,
<pb facs="tcp:20331:47"/>
and made him this short and sharpe reply.</p>
               <p>Importunate shepheard, whose loues are lawlesse, because
restlesse: are thy passions so extreame, that thou canst not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
them with patience? Or art thou so folly-sicke, that thou
must needs be fancie-sicke, &amp; in thy affection tyed to such an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
as none serues but <hi>Phoebe?</hi> Wel sir, if your market can be
made no where els, home againe, for your Mart is at the fayrest,
<hi>Phoebe</hi> is no lettice for your lips, and her grapes hangs so high,
that gaze at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you may, but touch them you cannot. Yet <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi>
I speak not this in pride, but in disdaine: not that I scorne
thee, but that I hate loue: for I count it as great honor to triumph
ouer fancie, as ouer fortune. Rest thee content therfore <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
cease from thy loues, and bridle thy lookes, quench the spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles
before they grow to a further flame: for in louing mee thou
shalt but liue by losse, &amp; what thou vtterest in words are all writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the wind. Wert thou (<hi>Montanus</hi>) as faire as <hi>Paris,</hi> as
hardy as <hi>Hector,</hi> as constant as <hi>Troylus,</hi> as louing as <hi>Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Phoebe</hi> could not loue, because she ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not loue at all: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if thou pursue me with <hi>Phoebus,</hi> I must flie with <hi>Daphne.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ganimede</hi> ouer-hearing all these passions of <hi>Montanus,</hi>
could not brooke the cruelty of <hi>Phoebe,</hi> but starting from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the bush said: And if Damzell you fled from mee, I would
transforme you as <hi>Daphne</hi> to a bay, and then in contempt tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
your branches vnder my feet. <hi>Phoebe</hi> at this sodaine replye
was amazed, especially when shee saw so faire a Swaine as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimede,</hi> blushing therfore she would haue bene gone: but that he
held her by the hand, &amp; prosecuted his reply thus. What shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse,
so faire, and so cruell? Disdaine beseemes not cottages, nor
coynesse maids: for either they be condemned to be too proud, or
too froward. Take heed faire Nymph, that in despising loue, you
be not ouer-reacht with loue, and in shaking off all, shape your
selfe to your owne shadow, &amp; so with <hi>Narcissus</hi> proue passi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

and yet vnpitied. Oft haue I heard, and sometime haue I seene,
high disdain turnd to hot desires. Because thou art beautifull, be
not so coy: as there is nothing more fair, so there is nothing more
fading: as momentary as the shaddowes which growes from a
clowdy Sunne. Such (my faire Shepheardesse) as disdaine in
<pb facs="tcp:20331:47"/>
youth desire in age, and then are they hated in the winter, that
might haue been loued in the prime. A wringled mayd is like to a
parched Rose, that is cast vp in Coffers to please the smell, not
worne in the hand to content the eye. There is no folly in Loue to

yoong, least thou be disdained when thou art olde. Beautie nor

as his desires are many, so his deserts are great.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phoebe</hi> all this while gazed on the perfection of <hi>Ganimede,</hi>
as deeply enamored on his perfection, as <hi>Montanus</hi> inueigled
with hers: for her eye made suruey of his excellent feature, which
she found so rare, that she thought the ghost of <hi>Adonis</hi> had been
leapt from <hi>Elizium</hi> in the shape of a Swaine. When shee blusht
at her owne folly to looke so long on a stranger, she mildely made
answere to <hi>Ganimede</hi> thus I cannot deny sir but I haue heard
of Loue, though I neuer felt Loue: and haue read of such a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse
as <hi>Venus,</hi> though I neuer sawe any but her picture: and
perhaps, and with that shee waxedred and bashfull, and with all
silent: which <hi>Ganimede</hi> perceiuing, commended in her selfe the
bashfulnesse of the mayd, and desired her to go forward. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
sir (quoth she) mine eye hath been more prodigal to day than
euer before: and with that she stayd againe, as one greatly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
and perplexed. <hi>Aliena</hi> seeing the hare through the maze,
hade her forward with her prattle: but in vaine, for at this abrupt
period she broke off, and with her eyes full of teares, and her face
couered with a vermillion die, she sat downe and sighed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon,
<hi>Aliena</hi> and <hi>Ganimede</hi> seeing the Shepheardesse in such a
straunge plight, left <hi>Phoebe</hi> with her <hi>Montanus,</hi> wishing hir
friendly that she would be more pliant to Loue, least in penance
<hi>Venus</hi> ioyned her to some sharpe repentance. <hi>Phoebe</hi> made no
reply, but fetcht such a sigh, that Eccho made relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hir plaint:
giuing <hi>Ganimede</hi> such an adieu with a piercing glance, that the
amorous Girle-boy perceiued <hi>Phoebe</hi> was pincht by the heele.</p>
               <p>But leauig <hi>Phoebe</hi> to the follies of her new fancie, and
<hi>Montanus</hi> to attend vppon her: to <hi>Saladyne,</hi> who all this last
night could not rest for the remembrance of <hi>Aliena:</hi> insomuch
that he framed a sweet conceipted Sonnet to content his humor,
<pb facs="tcp:20331:48"/>
which hee put in his bosome: being requested by his brother <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader</hi>
to go to <hi>Aliena</hi> and <hi>Ganymede,</hi> to signifie vnto them that
his woundes were not dangerous. A more happy message could
not happen to <hi>Saladyne,</hi> that taking his Forrest bill on his neck,
hee trudgeth in all haste towardes the plaines, where <hi>Alienaes</hi>
flockes did feede: comming iust to the place when they returned
from <hi>Montanus</hi> and <hi>Phoebe.</hi> Fortune so conducted this iolly
Forrester, that he encountred them and <hi>Coridon,</hi> whom hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently saluted in this maner.</p>
               <p>Faire Shepheardesse, and too faire, vnlesse your beautie bee
tempred with curtesie, and the liniaments of the face graced with
the lowlinesse of mynd: as many good fortunes to you and your
Page, as your selues can desire, or imagine. My brother <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
(in the grief of his green wounds) stil myndful of his friends,
hath sent me to you with a kynd salute, to shew that he brooks his
paines with the more patience, in that he holds the parties preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in whose defence hee receiued the preiudice. The report of
your welfare, will be a great comfort to his distempered body and
distressed thoughts, and therefore he sent me with a strickt charge
to visite you. And you (quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) are the more welcome in
that you are messenger from so kynd a Gentleman, whose paines
we compassionate with as great sorrow, as he brookes them with
griefe: and his wounds breeds in vs as many passions, as in him
extremities: so that what disquiet he feeles in bodie, we partake
in heart. Wishing (if wee might) that your mishap might salue
his malady. But seeing our wils yeelds him litle ease, our orizons
are neuer idle to the Gods for his recouery. I pray youth (quoth
<hi>Ganimede</hi> with teares in his eyes) when the Surgion searcht
him, held hee his woundes dangerous? Dangerous (quoth <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne</hi>)
but not mortall: and the sooner to be cured, in that his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
is not impatient of any paines: whervpon my brother hopes
within these ten dayes to walke abroad and visite you himselfe.
In the meane time (quoth <hi>Ganimede</hi>) say his <hi>Rosalynde</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
her to him, and bids him be of good cheare. I knowe not
(quoth <hi>Saladyne</hi>) who that <hi>Rosalynde</hi> is, but whatsoeuer shee
is, her name is neuer out of his mouth: but amidst the deepest
of his passions hee vseth <hi>Rosalynde</hi> as a charme to appease all
<pb facs="tcp:20331:48"/>
sorrowes with patience. Insomuth that I coniecture my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is in loue, and shee some Paragon that holdes his heart per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed:
whose name he oft records with sighes, sometimes with
teares, straight with ioye, then with smiles: as if in one person
Loue had lodged a Chaos of confused passions. Wherin I haue
noted the variable disposition of fancy, that lyke the <hi>Polype</hi> in
colours, so it changeth into sundry humors, beeing as it should
seeme, a combat myxe with disquiet, and a bitter pleasure wrapt
in a sweet preiudice, lyke to the <hi>Sinople tree,</hi> whose blossomes
delight the smell, and whose fruit infects the taste. By my fayth
(quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) sir, you are deep read in loue, or growes your
insight into affection by experience? Howsoeuer, you are a great
Philosopher in <hi>Venus</hi> principles, els could you not discour our
secret aphorismes. But sir our Countrey amours are not lyke
your Courtly fancies, nor is our wooing lyke your suing: for pore
shepheards neuer plaine them till Loue paine them, where the
Courtiers eyes is full of passions, when his heart is most free
from affection: they court to discouer their eloquence, wee wooe
to ease our sorrowes, euery faire face with them must haue a new
fancy sealed with a fore finger kisse, and a farre fetcht sigh: wee
heere loue one, and liue to that one, so long as life can maintaine
loue, vsing few ceremonies because we know fewe subtilties, and
litle eloquence for that we lightly accompt of flattery: onely faith
and troth thats shepheards wooing, and sir how lyke you of this?
So (quoth <hi>Saladyne</hi>) as I could tie my self to such loue, What,
and looke so low as a Shepheardesse, being the sonne of sir <hi>Iohn</hi>
of <hi>Bourdeaux:</hi> such desires were a disgrace to your honors. And
with that surueying exquisitely euery part of him, as vttering all
these wordes in a deepe passion, she espied the paper in his bosom:
whervpon growing iealous that it was some amorous Sonnet,
she sodeinly snacht it out of his bosome, and asked if it were anye
secret? She was bashfull, and <hi>Saladyne</hi> blusht: which she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
sayd: Nay then sir, if you waxe redde, my life for yours

and your passions. And wich that she lookt on it: which was
written to this effect.</p>

for precious vnlesse it be hard: so men are not men vnlesse they be

therefore taking <hi>Aliena</hi> by the hand sate downe by her: and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymede</hi> to giue them leaue to their Loues, found her selfe busie

               </p>
               <p>Faire Mistresse, if I be blunt in discouering my affections,
and vse little eloquence in leuelling out my loues: I appeale for
pardon to your owne principles, that say, shepheards vse few ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
for that they acquaint themselues with few subtilties:
to frame my selfe therefore to your country fashion with much
faith and litle flattery, know bewtifull Shepheardesse, that why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
I liued in the Court I knew not Loues comber, but I helde
affection as a toy, not as a malady: vsing fancy as the <hi>Hiperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rei</hi>
doo their flowers, which they weare in their bosome all day,
and cast them in the fire for fuell at night. I lyked all because I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
none, and who was most faire, on her I fed mine eye: but as
charily as the Bee, that assoone as shee hath suckt honny from the
Rose, Flies straight to the next Marigold. Liuing thus at mine
owne list, I wondred at such as were in loue, and when I read
their passions, I tooke them onely for poemes that flowed from
the quicknesse of the wyt, not the sorrowes of the heart. But now
(faire Nymph) since I became a Forrester, Loue hath taught me
such a lesson that I must confesse his deitie and dignitie, and saie
as there is nothing so pretious as beuty, so there is nothing more
piercing than fancy. For since first I arriued in this place, and
mine eye tooke a curious suruey of your excellence, I haue been
so fettered with your beautie and vertue, as sweet (<hi>Aliena</hi>) <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne</hi>
without further circumstance loues <hi>Aliena</hi> I could paynt
out my desires with long ambages, but seeing in many words
lyes mistrust, &amp; that truth is euer naked: let this suffice for a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
wooing, <hi>Saladyne</hi> loues <hi>Aliena,</hi> and none but <hi>Aliena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although these wordes were most heauenly harmony in the
<pb facs="tcp:20331:50"/>
eares of the Shepheardesse: yet to seeme coye at the first cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and to disdaine Loue howsoeuer she desired Loue, she made
this reply.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Saladyne,</hi> though I seeme simple, yet I am more subtile
than to swallow the hooke because it hath a painted bayt: as men
are wily so women are wary, especially if they haue that wyt by
others harmes to beware. Do we not know <hi>Saladyne,</hi> that mens
toongs are like <hi>Mercuries</hi> pipe, that can inchant <hi>Argus</hi> with an
hundreth eyes: and their words are preiudiciall as the charmes of
<hi>Circes,</hi> that transforme men into monsters. If such <hi>Syrens</hi> sing,
we poore women had need stoppe our eares, least in hearing wee
proue so foolish hardy as to belieue them, and so perish in crusting
much, and suspecting litle. <hi>Saladine, Piscator ictus sapit,</hi> hee
that hath been once poisoned, and afterwards fears not to bowse
of euery potion, is worthy to suffer double pennance. Eiue mee
leaue then to mistrust, though I doo not condemne. <hi>Saladyne</hi> is
now in loue with <hi>Aliena,</hi> hee a Gentleman of great parentage,
shee a Shepheardesse of meane parents: hee honorable, and shee
poore? Can Loue consist of contrarieties? Wyll the Fawlcon
pearch with the Kistresse, the Lyon harbor with the Woolfe? Wil
<hi>Venus</hi> ioyne roabes and rags togither? Or can there be a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie
betweene a King and a begger. Then <hi>Saladyne</hi> how can
I belieue thee that loue should vnite our thoughts, when Fortune
hath set such a difference betweene our degrees? But suppose
thou likest of <hi>Alienaes</hi> bewtie, men in their fancy resemble the
waspe, which scornes that flower from which she hath fetcht her
waxe: playing lyke the inhabitants of the Iland <hi>Tenerifa,</hi> who
when they haue gathered the sweet spices, vse the trees for fuell:
so men when they haue glutted themselues with the faire of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
faces, holde them for necessary euils: and wearied with that
which they seemed so much to loue, cast away fancy as children
doo their Rattles: and loathing that which so deeply before they
liked, especially such as take loue in a minute, and haue their eyes
attractiue lyke ieate, ape to entertaine any obiect, are as readie to
let it slip againe. <hi>Saladyne</hi> hearing how <hi>Aliena</hi> harpt still vpon

her sharpe inuectiue thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20331:50"/>I grant <hi>Aliena</hi> (quoth hee) many men haue done amisse, in
prouing soone ripe and soone rotten, but particular instances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
no generall conclusions: and therefore I hope what others
haue faulted in, shall not preiudice my fauours. I wil not vse so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry
to confirme my loue, for that is subtiltie: nor long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
least my wordes might be thought more than my fayth:
but if this will suffice, that by the honor of a Gentleman I loue
<hi>Aliena,</hi> and wooe <hi>Aliena,</hi> not to crop the blossomes and reiect
the tree, but to consumate my faithfull desires, in the honorable
ende of marriage.</p>
               <p>At this word marriage: <hi>Aliena</hi> stood in a maze what to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere:
fearing that if shee were too coy to driue him away with
her disdaine, and if she were too curteous to discouer the heate of
her desires. In a dilemma thus what to doo, at last this shee sayd.
<hi>Saladyne</hi> euer since I saw thee, I fauored thee I cannot dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
my desires, because I see thou doest faithfully manifest thy
thoughtes, and in liking thee I loue thee so farre as mine honor
holdes fancy still in suspence: but if I knew thee as verteous as
thy father, or as well qualified as thy brother <hi>Rosader,</hi> the doubt
should bee quickly decided: but for this time to giue thee an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
assure thy selfe this, I will either marry with <hi>Saladyne,</hi>
or still liue a virgine: and with this they strained one anothers
hand. Which <hi>Ganimede</hi> espying, thinking hee had had his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
long inough at shrift, sayd: what, a match or no? A match
(quoth <hi>Aliena</hi>) or els it were an ill market. I am glad (quoth
Ganimede) I wold <hi>Rosader</hi> were wel here to make vp a messe.
Well remembred (quoth <hi>Saladyne</hi>) I forgot I left my brother
<hi>Rosader</hi> alone: and therefore least being solitary hee should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his sorrowes, I wil hast me to him. May it please you then
to command mee any seruice to him, I am readie to bee a dutifull
messenger. Onely at this time commend me to him (quoth <hi>Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>)
and tell him, though we cannot pleasure him we pray for him.
And forget not (quoth <hi>Ganimede</hi>) my commendations: but say
to him that <hi>Rosalynd</hi> sheds as many teares from her heart as he
drops of blood from his wounds, for the sorow of his misfortunes,
feathering all her thoughts with disquiet, till his welfare procure
her content: say thus (good <hi>Saladyne</hi>) and so farwel. He hauing
<pb facs="tcp:20331:51"/>
his message, gaue a courteous adieu to them both, especially to
<hi>Aliena:</hi> and so playing loath to depart, went to his brother.
But <hi>Aliena,</hi> shee perplexed and yet ioyfull, past away the day
pleasantly still praising the perfection of <hi>Saladyne,</hi> not ceasing to
chat of her new Loue, till euening drew on, and then they folding
their sheep, went home to bed. Where we leaue them and return
to <hi>Phoebe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phoebe</hi> fiered with the vncouth flame of loue, returned to
her fathers house, so gauled with restlesse passions, as now shee
began to acknowledge, that as there was no flower so fresh but
might be parched with the Suune, no tree so strong but might be
shaken with a storme, so there was no thought to chast, but Time
armed with Loue could make amorous: for shee that held <hi>Diana</hi>
for the Goddesse of her deuotion, was now fain to flie to the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Venus,</hi> as suppliant now with praiers, as she was froward
afore with disdaine. As shee lay in her bed, shee called to mynd the
seueral bewties of yoong <hi>Ganimede,</hi> first his locks, which being
amber hued, passeth the wreathe that <hi>Phoebus</hi> puts on to make
his front glorious: his browe of yuorie, was like the seate where
Loue and Maiestie sits inthronde to enchaine Fancy: his eyes
as
bright as the burnishing of the heauen, darting forth frowns with
disdaine, and smiles with fauour, lightning such lookes as would
enflame desire, were she wrapt in the Circle of the frozen Zoane:
in his cheekes the vernullion teinture of the Rose florished vpon
naturall Alabaster, the blushe of the Morne and <hi>Lunaes</hi> siluer
showe were so liuely pourtrayed, that the <hi>Troyan</hi> that filles out
wine to <hi>Iupiter</hi> was not halfe so bewtifull: his face was full of
pleasance, and al the rest of his liniaments proportioned with such
excellence, as <hi>Phoebe</hi> was fertred in the sweetnes of his feature.
The <hi>Idea</hi> of these perfections tumbling in her mynde, made the
poore Shepheardesse so perplexed, as feeling a pleasure tempred
with intollerable paines, and yet a disquiet mixed with a content,
shee rather wished to die, than to liue in this amorous anguish.
But wishing is litle worth in such extreames, &amp; therfore was she
forst to pine in her malady, without any salue for her sorrows. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale
it she durst not, as daring in such matters to make none her
secretarie, and to conceale it, why it doubled her griefe: for as
<pb facs="tcp:20331:51"/>
fire supprest growes to the greater flame, and the Curreut stopt
to the more violent streame: so Loue smothered, wrings the hare
with the deeper passions.</p>
               <p>Perplexed thus with sundry agonies, her food began to faile,
and the disquiet of her mind began to worke a distemperature of
her body, that to be short <hi>Phoebe</hi> fell extreme sicke, and so sicke
as there was almost left no recouery of health. Her father seeing
his fair <hi>Phoebe</hi> thus distrest, sent for his friends, who sought by
medecine to cure, and by counsaile to pacifie, but all in vaine: for
although her body was feeble through long fasting, yet did shee
<hi>magis aegrotare animo quàm corpore.</hi> Which her friends percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and sorrowed at, but salue it they could not.</p>
               <p>The newes of her sicknesse was bruted abroad through all the
Forrest: which no sooner came to <hi>Montanus</hi> eare, but hee like a
mad man came to visit <hi>Phoebe.</hi> Where sitting by her bed side,
he began his Exordium with so many teares and sighes, that she
perceiuing the extremitie of his sorrows, began now as a Louer
to pittie them, although <hi>Ganimede</hi> helde her from redressing
them. <hi>Montanus</hi> craued to know the cause of her sicknesse, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pred
with secret plaints: but she answered him (as the rest) with
silence, hauing still the forme of <hi>Ganimede</hi> in her mind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecturing how she might reueale her loues. To vtter it in wordes
she found her selfe too bashfull, to discourse by any friend shee
would not trust any in her amours, to remain thus perplexed still
and conceale all, it was a double death. Whereupon for her last
refuge she resolued to write vnto <hi>Ganimede:</hi> and therfore dest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Montanus</hi> to absent himselfe a while, but not to depart: for
she would see if she could steale a nappe. Hee was no sooner gone
out of the chamber, but reaching to her standish, shee tooke penne
and paper, and wrote a letter to this effect.

nature, and drawne to the other by beauty: which being rare, and
made the more excellent by many vertues, hath so snared the
freedome of <hi>Phoebe,</hi> as shee restes at thy mercie, either to bee
made the most fortunate of all maydens, or the most miserable of
all women. Measure not <hi>Ganimede</hi> my loues by my wealth, nor
my desires by my degrees: but thinke my thoughtes as full of
faith, as thy face of amiable fauors. Then as thou knowst thy self
most beautifull, suppose me most constant. If thou deemest mee
hard harted because I hated <hi>Montanus,</hi> thinke I was forst to it
by fate: if thou saist I am kind hearted, because so lightly I loued
thee at the first looke, thinke I was driuen to it by desteny, whose
influence as it is mighty, so is it not to be resisted. If my fortunes
were any thing but infortunate loue, I would striue with fortune:
but he that wrests against the will of <hi>Venus,</hi> seeks to quench fire
with oyle, &amp; to thrust out one thorn by putting in another. If then
<hi>Ganimede,</hi> loue enters at the eye, harbours in the heart, and wil
neither be driuen out with phisicke nor reason: pittie mee, as one
whose malady hath no salue but from thy sweet self, whose griefe
hath no ease but through thy grant, and think I am a Uirgin, who
is deeply wrongd, when I am forst to woo, and couiecture loue to
be strong, that is more forceable then nature.</p>
                        <p>Thus distressed vnlesse by thee eased, I expect either to lyue
fortunate by thy fauour, or die miserable by thy denyall. Liuing

the letters, which (he said) came from <hi>Phoebe.</hi> At this the
wanton blusht, as being abashe to thinke what news should come
from an vnknowne Shepheardesse, but taking the letters, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ript
the seales, and read ouer the discourse of <hi>Phoebes</hi> fancies.
When she had read and ouer-read them, <hi>Ganimede</hi> beganne to
smile, and looking on <hi>Montanus,</hi> fell into a great laughter: and
with that called <hi>Aliena,</hi> to whome shee shewed the writinges.
<pb facs="tcp:20331:53"/>
Who hauing perused them, conceipted them very pleasantly, and
smiled to see how Loue had yokt her, who before would not stoop
to the lure, <hi>Aliena</hi> whispering <hi>Ganimede</hi> in the eare, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Knew <hi>Phoebe</hi> what want there were in thee to performe
her will, and how vnfit thy kind is to be kind to her, she would be
more wise, and lesse enamoured: But leauing that, I pray thee
let vs sport with this Swaine. At that word <hi>Ganimede</hi> turning
to <hi>Montanus,</hi> began to glaunce at him thus.</p>
               <p>I pray thee tell me Shepheard, by those sweet thoughts and
pleasing sighes that grow from my Mistresse fauours, art thou
in loue with <hi>Phoebe?</hi> Oh
my youth, quoth <hi>Montanus,</hi> were
<hi>Phoebe</hi> so farre in loue with me, my flocks would be more fatte
and their Maister more quiet: for through the sorrows of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
growes the leannesse of my sheepe. Alas poore Swaine
quoth <hi>Ganimede,</hi> are thy passions so extreame, or thy fancie so
resolute, that no reason wil blemish the pride of thy affection, and
race out that which thou striuest for without hope? Nothing can
make me forget <hi>Phoebe,</hi> while <hi>Montanus</hi> forget himselfe: for
those characters which true loue hath stamped, neither the enuie
of time nor fortune can wipe away. Why but <hi>Montanus</hi> quoth
<hi>Ganimede,</hi> enter with a deep insight into the despaire of thy fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and thou shalt see the depth of thine owne follies: for (poore
man) thy progresse in loue is a regresse to losse, swimming again
the streame with the Crab, and flying with <hi>Apis Indica</hi> against
wind and weather. Thou seekest with <hi>Phoebus</hi> to win <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
and shee flies faster than thou canst follow: thy desires soare
with the Hobbie, but her disdain reacheth higher than thou canst
make wing. I tell thee <hi>Montanus,</hi> in courting <hi>Phoebe,</hi> thou
barkest with the Wolues of <hi>Syria</hi> against the Moone, and roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
at such a marke with thy thoughts, as is beyond the pitch of
thy bow, praying to loue, when loue is pittilesse, and thy maladie
remedilesse. For proofe <hi>Montanus,</hi> read these letters, wherein
thou shalt see thy great follyes and little hope.</p>
               <p>With that <hi>Montanus</hi> tooke them and perused them, but with
such sorrow in his lookes, as they bewrayed a sourse of confused
passions in his heart, at euery line his colour changed, and euery
sentence was ended with a period of sighes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20331:53"/>At last noting <hi>Phoebes</hi> extreame desire toward <hi>Ganimede,</hi>
and her disdaine towards him, giuing <hi>Ganimede</hi> the letter, the
Shepheard stood as though he had neyther won nor lost. Which
<hi>Ganimede</hi> perceiuing, wakened him out of his dreame thus:
Now <hi>Montanus,</hi> doest thou see thou vowest great seruice, and
obtainest but litle reward: but in lieu of thy loyaltie, she maketh
thee as <hi>Bellephoron</hi> carry thine owne bane. Then drinke not
willingly of that potion wherein thou knowest is poyson, creepe
not to her that cares not for thee. What <hi>Montanus,</hi> there are
many as faire as <hi>Phoebe,</hi> but most of all more courteous
than <hi>Phoebe.</hi> I tell thee Shepheard, fauour is Loues fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell:
then since thou canst not get that, lette the flame vanish into
smoake, and rather sorrowe for a while, then repent thee for euer.</p>
               <p>I tell thee <hi>Ganimede</hi> (quoth <hi>Montanus</hi>) as they which are
stung with the Scorpion, cannot be recouered but by the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
nor he that was wounded with <hi>Achilles</hi> lance bee cured but
with the same truncheon: so <hi>Apollo</hi> was faine to cry out, that
loue was onely eased with loue, &amp; fancy healed by no medicine but
fauour. <hi>Phoebus</hi> had hearbs to heale all hurts but this passion,
<hi>Cyrces</hi> had charms for all chances but for affection, &amp; <hi>Mercurie</hi>
subtill reasons to refell all griefs but loue. Perswasions are boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
reason lends no remedy, counsell no comfort, to such whome
fancie hath made resolute: &amp; therefore though <hi>Phoebe</hi> loues
<hi>Ganimede,</hi> yet <hi>Montanus</hi> must honor none but <hi>Phoebe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then quoth <hi>Ganimede,</hi> may I rightly tearme thee a despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
louer, that liuest without ioy, and louest without hope: but
what shal I do <hi>Montanus</hi> to pleasure thee? shal I despise <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be</hi>
as she disdaines thee? Oh (quoth <hi>Montanus</hi>) that were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
my griefs, and double my sorrows: for the sight of her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
were the censure of my death. Alas <hi>Ganimede,</hi> though I
perish in my thoughts, let not her die in her desires. Of all passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
loue is most impatient: then lette not so faire a creature as
<hi>Phoebe</hi> sinke vnder the burden of so deepe distresse. Being loue
sicke, she is proued hart sicke, &amp; all for the beautie of <hi>Ganimede.</hi>
Thy proportion hath intangled her affections, and shee is snared
in the beauty of thy excellence. Then sith she loues thee so deare,
mislike not her deadly. Be thou paramour to such a paragon: she
hath beauty to please thine eye, and flockes to enrich thy store.
<pb facs="tcp:20331:54"/>
Thou canst not wish for more than thou shalt win by her: for she
is beautifull, vertuous and wealthy, three deepe perswasions to
make loue frolicke. <hi>A liena</hi> seeing <hi>Montanus</hi> cut it against the
haire, and pleade that <hi>Ganimede</hi> ought to loue <hi>Phoebe,</hi> when
his onely life was the loue of <hi>Phoebe,</hi> answered him thus. Why
<hi>Montanus</hi> dost thou further this motion? seeing if <hi>Ganimede</hi>
marry <hi>Phoebe</hi> thy market is cleane mard. Ah Mistres (q. he) so
hath loue taught me to honour <hi>Phoebe,</hi> that I would preiudice
my life to pleasure her, and die in despaire rather than shee should
perish for want. It shall suffice me to see her contented, and to feed
mine eye on her fauour. If she marry though it bee my martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
yet if she be pleased I wil brooke it with patience, &amp; try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
in mine owne stars to see her desires satisfied. Therefore if
<hi>Ganimede</hi> be as courteous as he is beautifull, let him shew his
vertues in redressing <hi>Phoebes</hi> miseries. And this <hi>Montanus</hi>
pronounst with such an assured countenance, that it amazed both
<hi>Aliena</hi> and <hi>Ganimede</hi> to see the resolution of his loues: so that
they pitied his passions, &amp; commended his patience, deuising how
they might by any subtiltie get <hi>Montanus</hi> the fauor of <hi>Phoebe.</hi>
Straight (as womens heads are full of wiles) <hi>Ganimede</hi> had a
fetch to force <hi>Phoebe</hi> to fancie the shepheard, malgrado the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of her mind he prosecuted his policie thus. <hi>Montanus</hi>
quoth he, seeing <hi>Phoebe</hi> is so forlorne, least I might be counted
vnkind in not saluing so faire a creature, I will goe with thee to
<hi>Phoebe,</hi> and there heare her selfe in word vtter that which shee
hath discourst with her pen, and then as Loue wils mee. I will set
downe my censure. I will home by our house, and send <hi>Coridon</hi>
to accompany <hi>Aliena. Montanus</hi> seemed glad of his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and away they goe towards the house of <hi>Phoebe.</hi> When
they drew nigh to the cottage, <hi>Montanus</hi> ran afore, and went in
and told <hi>Phoebe,</hi> that <hi>Ganimede</hi> was at the doore. This word
<hi>Ganimede</hi> sounding in the eares of <hi>Phoebe,</hi> draue hir into such
an extasie for ioy, that rising vp in her bed, she was halfe reuined,
&amp; her wan colour began to waxe red: and with that came <hi>Gani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
in, who saluted <hi>Phoebe</hi> with such a courteous looke, that
it was half a salue to her sorows: sitting him down by hir bed side,
he questioned about hir disease, and where the paine chiefly helde
hit? <hi>Phoebe</hi> looking as louely as <hi>Venus</hi> in her night gear, tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:20331:54"/>
her face with as ruddy a blush, as <hi>Clitia</hi> did when shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed
her loues to <hi>Phoebus:</hi> taking <hi>Ganimede</hi> by the hande
began thus. Faire shepheard, if loue were not more strong than
nature, or fancie the sharpest extreame, my immodesty were the
more, &amp; my vertues the les: for nature hath framed womens eyes
bashfull, their harts ful of feare, &amp; theyr tongs ful of silence: But
loue, that imperious loue, where his power is predominant, then
he peruerts all, &amp; wrests the wealth of nature to his owne wil: an
instance in my selfe fayre <hi>Ganimede,</hi> for such a fire hath he kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled
in my thoughts, that to finde ease for the flame, I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to passe the bounds of modesty, &amp; seek a salue at thy hands for
my harms: blame me not if I be ouer beld for it is thy beauty, &amp;
if I bee too forward it is fancie, &amp; the deepe insight into thy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
that makes me thus fond. For let me say in a word what may
be contained in a volume, <hi>Phoebe</hi> loue <hi>Ganimede:</hi> at this shee
held downe her head and wept, and <hi>Ganimede</hi> rose as one that
would suffer no fish to hang on his fingers, made this reply. Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not thy plants <hi>Phoebe,</hi> for I dopity thy plaints, nor seek not
to discouer thy loues in teares: for I coniecture thy truth by thy
passions: sorrow is no salue for loues, nor sighs no remedy for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Therfore frolick <hi>Phoebe,</hi> for if <hi>Ganimede</hi> can cure thee,
doubt not of recouery. Yet this let me say without offence, that it
greeues mee to thwart <hi>Montanus</hi> in his fancies, seeing his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
haue been so resolute, &amp; his thoughts so loyall: but thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgest
that thou art forst from him by fate: so I tell thee <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be,</hi>
either some starre, or else some destenie, fittes my mind rather
with <hi>Adonis</hi> to die in chase, than be counted a wanton in <hi>Venus</hi>
knee. Although I pitie thy martyrdome, yet I can grant no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
for though I held thee fair, yet mine eie is not fettred, loue
grows not like the hearb Spattanna to his perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in one night
but creeps with the snaile, &amp; yet at last attaines to the top <hi>Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Lenter</hi> especially in loue: for momentary fancies are often
times the fruits of follies: If <hi>Phoebe</hi> I should like thee as the
<hi>Hiperborei</hi> do theyr dates, which banket with them in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
&amp; throw them away at night, my folly should be great, &amp; thy
repentance more. Therfore I wil haue time to turn my thoghts,
and my Loues shall growe vp as the water <hi>Cresses,</hi> slowly, but
with a deepe roote. Thus <hi>Phoebe</hi> thou maist see I disdaine not
<pb facs="tcp:20331:55"/>
though I desire not, remaining indifferent til time &amp; loue makes
me resolute. Therefore <hi>Phoebe</hi> seek not to suppresse affection,
and with the loue of <hi>Montanus</hi> quench the remembraunce of
<hi>Ganimede,</hi> striue thou to hate mee as I seeke to like of thee, and
euer haue the duties of <hi>Montanus</hi> in thy minde, for I promise
thee thou mayest haue one more wealthy, but not more loyall.
These wordes were corasiues to the perplexed <hi>Phoebe,</hi> that
sobbing out sighes, and straining out teares, shee blubbered out
these words.</p>
               <p>And shall I then haue no salue of <hi>Ganimede</hi> but suspence, no
hope but a doubtfull hazard, no comfort, but bee posted off to the
will of time: iustly haue the Gods ballanst my fortunes, who bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cruel to <hi>Montanus,</hi> found <hi>Ganimede</hi> as vnkind to my selfe:
so in forcing him perish for loue, I shall die my selfe with ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
loue. I am glad quoth <hi>Ganimede,</hi> you look into your own
faults, and see where your shoo wrings you, measuring now the
pains of <hi>Montanus</hi> by your owne passions. Truth q. <hi>Phoebe,</hi>
and so deeply I repent me of my frowardnesse towards the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
that could I cease to loue <hi>Ganimede,</hi> I would resolue to
like <hi>Montanus.</hi> What if I can with reason perswade <hi>Phoebe</hi>
to mislike of <hi>Ganimede,</hi> wil she then fauour <hi>Montanus?</hi> When
reason (quoth she) doth quench that loue that I owe to thee, then
will I fancie him: conditionally, that if my loue can bee supprest
with no reason, as being without reason, <hi>Ganimede</hi> will onely
wed himselfe to <hi>Phoebe.</hi> I graunt it faire Shepherdesse quoth
he: and to feed thee with the sweetnesse of hope, this resolue on:
I wil neuer marry my selfe to woman but vnto thy selfe: &amp; with
that <hi>Ganimede</hi> gaue <hi>Phoebe</hi> a fruitlesse kisse, and such wordes
of comfort, that before <hi>Ganimede</hi> departed shee arose out of her
bed, &amp; made him and <hi>Montanus</hi> such cheare, as could bee founde
in such a country cottage. <hi>Ganimede</hi> in the midst of their banket
rehearsing the promises of either in <hi>Montanus</hi> fauour, which
highly pleased the Shepheard. Thus all three content, and soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
vp in hope, <hi>Ganimede</hi> tooke his leaue of <hi>Phoebe</hi> &amp; depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
leauing her a contented woman, &amp; <hi>Montanus</hi> highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
But poore <hi>Ganimede,</hi> who had her thoughtes on her <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
when she cald to remembrance his wounds, fild her eies full
of teares, and her heart full of sorrowes, plodded to finde <hi>Aliena</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20331:55"/>
at the Folds, thinking with her presence to driue away her passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
As she came on the plaines, shee might espy where <hi>Rosader</hi>
and <hi>Saladyne</hi> sat with <hi>Aliena</hi> vnder the shade: which sight was
a salue to her griefe, and such a cordiall vnto her heart, that shee
tript alongst the Lawnes full of ioy.</p>
               <p>At last <hi>Coridon</hi> who was with them spied <hi>Ganimede,</hi> and
with that the Clown rose, &amp; running to meet him cried, Oh sirha,
a match, a match, our Mistres shalbe maried on sunday. Thus the
poore peasant frolicke it before <hi>Ganimede,</hi> who comming to the
crue saluted them all, and especially <hi>Rosader,</hi> saying that he was
glad to see him so wel recouered of his wounds. I had not gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
so soone quoth <hi>Rosader,</hi> but that I am bidden to a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
which on Sunday next must bee solempnized betweene my
brother and <hi>Aliena.</hi> I see well where Loue leads delay is loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and that small wooing serues, where both the parties are
willing. Truth quoth <hi>Ganimede:</hi> but a happy day should it be, if
<hi>Rosader</hi> that day might be married to <hi>Rosalynd.</hi> Ah good <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimede</hi>
(quoth he) by naming <hi>Rosalynd</hi> renue not my sorrowes:
for the thought of her perfections, is the thrall of my miseries.
Tush, bee of good cheare man quoth <hi>Ganimede,</hi> I haue a friend
that is deeply experienst in Negromancy and Magicke, what art
can do shall be acted for thine aduantage: I wil cause him to bring
in <hi>Rosalynde,</hi> if either <hi>France</hi> or any bordring Nation harbour
her: and vpon that take the faith of a yoong shepheard. <hi>Aliena</hi>
smilde to see how <hi>Rosader</hi> frownd, thinking that <hi>Ganimede</hi> had
iested with him. But breaking off from those matters, the Page
(somewhat pleasant) began to discourse vnto them what had past
between him and <hi>Phoebe:</hi> which as they laught, so they wondred
at, all confessyng, that there is none so chast but Loue wil change.
Thus they past away the day in chat, and when the Sun began to
set, they tooke their leaues and departed: <hi>Aliena</hi> prouiding for
their marriage day such solemne cheare and handsome roabes as
fitted their country estate, &amp; yet somewhat the better, in that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader</hi>
had promised to bring <hi>Gerismond</hi> thither as a guest. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimede</hi>
(who then ment to discouer her self before her father, had
made her a gowne of green, and a kirtle of the finest sendal, in such
sort that she seemed some heauenly Nymph harboured in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
attire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20331:56"/>
                  <hi>Saladine</hi> was not behind in care to set out the nuptials, nor <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader</hi>
vnmindfull to bid guests, who inuited <hi>Gerismond</hi> and all
his folowers to the feast: who willingly granted, so that there was
nothing but the day wanting to his marriage. In the mean while,
<hi>Phoebe</hi> being a bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> guest, made her self as gorgious as might
be to please the eye of <hi>Ganimede:</hi> and <hi>Montanus</hi> suted himself
with the cost of many of his flocks to be gallant against that day:
for then was <hi>Ganimed</hi> to giue <hi>Phoebe</hi> an answer of her loues,
and <hi>Montanus</hi> either to heare the doome of his miserie, or the
censure of his happinesse. But while this geare was a brewing.
<hi>Phoebe</hi> past not one day without visiting her <hi>Ganimede,</hi> so far
was she wrapt in the beauties of this louely swaine. Much prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
they had, and the discourse of many passions, <hi>Phoebe</hi> wishing
for the day (as she thought) of her welfare, &amp; <hi>Ganimede</hi> smiling
to thinke what vnexpected euentes would fall out at the wedding.
In these humors the weeke went away, that at last sunday came.</p>
               <p>No sooner did <hi>Phoebus</hi> Hench-man appeare in the skie, to
giue warning that his maisters horses should be crapt in his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
couch, but <hi>Coridon</hi> in his holiday sute maruellous seemely,
in a russet iatket welted with the same, &amp; faced with red worsted,
hauing a paire of blew chamblet sleeues, bound at the wrests with
foure yeolow laces, closed afore very richly with a dosen of pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
buttons: his hose was of gray karsie, with a large sloppe bard
ouer thwart the pocket holes with three faire gards, stitcht of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side with red threed, his stock was of the owne sewed close to
his breech, and for to bewtifie his hose, he had trust himselfe round
with a dosen of new thredden points of medley colour: his bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
was greene wheron stood a copper brooch with the picture of
Saint <hi>Denis:</hi> and to want nothing that might make him amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in his old dayes, hee had a faire shyrt band of fine lockeram,
whipt ouer with Couentry blew of no small cost. Thus attired,
<hi>Coridon</hi> bestird himselfe as chiefe stickler in these actions, and
had strowed al the house with flowers, that it seemed rather some
of <hi>Floraes</hi> choyce howers, than any country cottage.</p>
               <p>Thether repaired <hi>Phoebe</hi> with all the maides of the Forrest,
to set out the bride in the most seemliest sort that might bee: but
howsoeuer shee helpt to prancke out <hi>Aliena,</hi> yet her eye was still
on <hi>Ganimede,</hi> who was so neat in a sute of gray, that he seemed
<pb facs="tcp:20331:56"/>
                  <hi>Endymion</hi> when he won <hi>Luna</hi> with his lookes, or <hi>Paris</hi> when
he playd the swain to get the bewtie of the Nymph <hi>Oenone. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimede</hi>
like a prettie Page waited on his mistresse <hi>Aliena,</hi> and
ouerlookt that all was in a readines against the bridegroom shuld
come. Who attired in a Forresters sute came accompanied with
<hi>Gerismond</hi> &amp; his brother <hi>Rosader</hi> early in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning, where ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued,
they were solemnly entertained by <hi>Aliena</hi> &amp; the rest of the
country swains, <hi>Gerismond</hi> very highly commending the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
choice of <hi>Saladyne,</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had chosen a shepheardesse, whose
vertues appeared in her outward bewties, being no lesse fair than
seeming modest. <hi>Ganimede</hi> comming in and seeing her father
began to blush. Nature woorking affects by her secred effectes:
fearce could she abstain from teares to see her father in so low for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes:
he that was wont to sit in his royal Pallaice: attended on
by twelue noble Peeres, now to be contented with a simple Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and a troupe of reuelling woodmen for his traine. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of his fall, made <hi>Ganimede</hi> full of sorrowes: yet that
she might triumph ouer Fortune with patience, and not any way
dash that merry day with her dumps, she smothered her melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with a shadow of mirth: and verie reuerently welcommed the
king, not according to his former degree, but to his present estate,
with such diligence, as <hi>Gerismond</hi> began to commend the page
for his exquisit person, and excellent qualities.</p>
               <p>As thus the King with his Forresters frolickt it among the
shepheards, <hi>Coridon</hi> came in with a faire mazer full of Sidar,
and presented it to <hi>Gerismond</hi> with such a clownish salute, that
he began to smile, &amp; tooke it of the old shepheard very kindly, drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to <hi>Aliena</hi> and the rest of her faire maydes, amongst whome
<hi>Phoebe</hi> was the formost. <hi>Aliena</hi> pledged the King, &amp; drunke to
<hi>Rosader:</hi> so the carrowse went rounde from him to <hi>Phoebe,</hi> &amp;c.
As they were thus drinking and ready to goe to Church, came in
<hi>Montanus</hi> apparelled all in tawny, to signifie that he was forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
on his head hee wore a garland of willow, his bottle hanged
by his side whereon was painted dispaire, and on his sheephooke
hung two Sonnets as labels of his loues and fortunes.</p>
               <p>Thus attired came <hi>Montanus</hi> in, with his face as full of griefe, as his heart was of sorowes, shewing in his countenance
the map of extremities. Assoone as the Shepheards sawe him,
<pb facs="tcp:20331:57"/>
they did him all the honor they could, as being the flower of al the
swaines in <hi>Arden:</hi> for a bonnier boy was there not seen since the
wanton wag of <hi>Troy</hi> that kept sheep in <hi>Ida.</hi> He seeing the King,
&amp; gessyng it to be <hi>Gerismond,</hi> did him all the reuerence his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
curtesie could afford. Insomuch that the king wondring at his
attire, began to question what he was. <hi>Montanus</hi> ouerhearing
him made this reply. I am sir quoth he loues swaine, as ful of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
discontents as I seeme fraught with outward follies. Mine
eyes like bees delight in sweet flowers, but sucking their fill on
the faire of beauty, they carry home to the Hiue of my heart farre
more gaul than hony, and for one drop of pure deaw, at tun full of
deadly <hi>Aconiton,</hi> I hunt with the Fly to pursue the Eagle, that
flying too nigh the Sun, I perish with the Sun: my thoughts are
aboue my reach, and my desires more than my fortunes: yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
greater than my loues. But daring with <hi>Phaeto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> I fal with
<hi>Irarus,</hi> and seeking to passe the mean, I die for being so mean, my
night fleeps are waking slombers, as full of sorrowes as they be
far from rest, &amp; my dayes labors are fruitlesse amors, staring at a
star &amp; stombling at a straw, leauing reason to follow after repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
yet euery passion is a pleasure thogh it pinch, because loue
hides his wormeseed in figs, his poysons in sweet potions, &amp; sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
preiudize with the maske of pleasure. The wisest counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
are my deep discontents, and I hate that which should salue
my harm, like the patient which stung with the <hi>Tarantula</hi> loaths
musick, and yet the disease incurable but by melody. Thus (Sir)
restlesse I hold my selfe remediles, as louing without either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or regard, and yet louing, bicause there is none worthy to be
loued, but the mistresse of my thoughts. And that I am as full of
passions as I haue discourst in my plaintes, Sir if you please see
my Sonnets, and by them censure of my sorrowes.</p>
               <p>These wordes of <hi>Montanus</hi> brought the king into a great
wonder, amazed as much at his wit was as his attire: insomuch that
he tooke the papers off his hooke, and read them to this effect.</p>

                  <hi>Gerismond</hi> seeing the pithy vaine of those Sonets, began to

vnto him the loue of <hi>Montanus</hi> to <hi>Phoebe,</hi> his great loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alite
&amp; her deep crueltie: and how in reuenge the Gods had made
the curious Nymph amorous of yoong <hi>Ganimede.</hi> Upon this
discourse, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king was desirous to see <hi>Phoebe:</hi> who being broght
before <hi>Gerismond</hi> by <hi>Rosador,</hi> shadowed the beauty of her face
with such a vermilion teinture, that the Kings eyes began to da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle
at the puritie of her excellence. After <hi>Gerismond</hi> had fed his
lookes a while vpon her faire, he questioned with her, why she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
<hi>Montanus</hi> loue with so little regard, seeing his desertes
were many, and his passions extreame. <hi>Phoebe</hi> to make reply to
the Kings demaund, answered thus: Loue (sir) is charitie in his
lawes, and whatsoeuer hee sets downe for iustire (bee it neuer so
vniust) the sentence cannot be reuerst: womens fancies lende fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
not euer by desert, but as they are inforst by their desires<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
for fancy is tied to the wings of Fate, &amp; what the starres decree,
<pb facs="tcp:20331:58"/>
stands for an infallible doome. I know <hi>Montanus</hi> is wise, &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
ears are greatly delighted with wit, as hardly escaping the
charme of a pleasant toong, as <hi>Vlisses</hi> the melody of the <hi>Syrens.
Montanus</hi> is bewtifull, and womens eyes are snared in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
of obiects, as desirous to feede their lookes with a faire
face, as the Bee to suck on a sweet floure. <hi>Montanus</hi> is welthy,
&amp; an ounce of giue me perswades a woman more than a pound of
heare me. <hi>Danae</hi> was won with a goldon shower, when she could
not be gotten with all the intreaties of <hi>Iupiter:</hi> I tell you sir, the
string of a womans heart reacheth to the pulse of her hand, and let
a man rub that with gold, &amp; tis hard but she wil prooue his hearts
gold. <hi>Montanus</hi> is yoong, a great clause in fancies court: <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi>
is vertuous, the richest argument that Loue yeelds: &amp; yet
knowing all these perfections I praise them, and wonder at them,
louing the qualities, but not affecting the person, because the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenies
haue set downe a contrary censure. Yet <hi>Venus</hi> to ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me wine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same grape, a sip of the same sauce,
&amp; string me with the like passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath crost me with as il a penance:
for I am in loue with a shepheards swaine, as coy to mee as I am
cruel to <hi>Montanus,</hi> as peremptory in disdain as I was peruerse
in desire, &amp; that is (quoth she) <hi>Alienaes</hi> page, yong <hi>Ganimede.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gerismond</hi> desirous to prosecute the ende of these passions,
called in <hi>Ganimede:</hi> who knowing the case, came in graced with
such a blush, as beautified the Christall of his face with a ruddie
brightnesse. The King noting well the phisnomy of <hi>Ganimede,</hi>
began by his fauours to cal to mind the face of his Rosalynd, and
with that fetcht a deepe sigh. <hi>Rosader</hi> that was passing familiar
with <hi>Gerismond,</hi> demanded to him why he sighed so sore? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Rosader</hi> (quoth hee) the fauour of <hi>Ganimede</hi> puts mee in
minde of <hi>Rosalynde.</hi> At this word, <hi>Rosader</hi> sight so deepely as
though his heart would haue burst. And whats the matter (quoth
<hi>Gerismond</hi>) that you quite mee with such a sigh? Pardon mee
sir (quoth Rosader) because I loue none but <hi>Rosalynd.</hi> And vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that condition (quoth <hi>Gerismond</hi>) that <hi>Rosalynd</hi> were here,
I would this day make vp a marriage betwixt her and thee. At
this <hi>Aliena</hi> turnd her head and smilde vpon <hi>Ganimede,</hi> and shee
could scarce keep countenance. Yet shee salued all with secrecie,
an <hi>Gerismond</hi> to driue away such dumpes, questioned with
<pb facs="tcp:20331:59"/>
                  <hi>Ganimede,</hi> what the reason was he regarded not <hi>Phoebes</hi> loue,
seeing she was as faire as the wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that brought <hi>Troy</hi> to ruine.
<hi>Ganimede</hi> mildly answered, If I shuld affect the fair <hi>Phoebe,</hi>
I should offer poore <hi>Montanus</hi> great wrong to winne that from
him in a moment, that hee hath labored for so many monthes. Yet
haue I promised to the bewtiful shepheardesse, to wed my self ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to woman except vnto her: but with this promise, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if I can by
reason suppresse <hi>Phoebes</hi> loue towards me, she shall like of none
but of <hi>Montanus.</hi> To y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> q. <hi>Phoebe</hi> I stand, for my loue is so far
beyond reason, as it wil admit no persuasion of reason. For iustice
q. he, I appeale to <hi>Gerismond:</hi> and to his censure wil I stand q.
<hi>Phoebe.</hi> And in your victory q. <hi>Montanus</hi> stands the hazard of
my fortunes: for if <hi>Ganymede</hi> go away with conquest, <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
is in conceit loues Monarch, if <hi>Phoebe</hi> winne, then am I in
effect most miserable. We wil see this controuersie q. <hi>Gerismo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi>
&amp; then we will to church: therefore <hi>Ganimede</hi> let vs heare your
argument. Nay, pardon my absence a while (quoth shee) and you
shall see one in store. In went <hi>Ganimede</hi> and drest her self in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
attire, hauing on a gowne of greene, with kirtle of rich san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,
so quaint, that she seemed <hi>Diana</hi> triumphing in the Forrest:
vpon her head she wore a chaplet of Roses, which gaue her such a
grace, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she looked like <hi>Flora</hi> pearkt in the pride of all hir floures.
Thus attired came <hi>Rosalind</hi> in, &amp; presented her self at hir fathers
feete, with her eyes full of tears, crauing his blessing, &amp; discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vnto him all her fortunes, how shee was banished by <hi>Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
and how euer since she liued in that country disguised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gerismond</hi> seeing his daughter, rose from his seat &amp; sel vpon
her necke, vttering the passions of his ioy in warry plaints driuen
into such an extasie of content, that hee could not vtter one word.
At this sight, if <hi>Rosader</hi> was both amazed &amp; ioyfull, I refer my
selfe to the iudgement of such as haue experience in loue, seeing
his <hi>Rosalynd</hi> before his face whom so long and deeply he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
At last <hi>Gerismond</hi> recouered hi spirites, and in most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
tearmes entertained his daughter <hi>Rosalynd,</hi> after many
questions demanding of her what had past betweene her and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sader.</hi>
So much sir (quoth she) as there wants nothing but your
Grace to make vp the mariage. Why then (quoth <hi>Gerismond</hi>)
<hi>Rosader</hi> take her, shee is thine, and let this day solemnize
<pb facs="tcp:20331:59"/>
both thy brothers and thy nuptials, <hi>Rosader</hi> beyond measure co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
humbly thauked the king, &amp; imbraced his <hi>Rosalynde,</hi> who
turning to <hi>Phoebe,</hi> demanded if she had shewen sufficient reason
to suppresse the force of her loues. Yea quoth <hi>Phoebe;</hi> &amp; so <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
a perswasiue, that if it please you Madame, and <hi>Aliena</hi> to giue
vs leaue, <hi>Montanus</hi> and I will make this day the thirde couple
in marriage. She had no sooner spake this word, but <hi>Montanus</hi>
threw away his garland of willow, his bottle, where was pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
dispaire, &amp; cast his sonnets in the fire, shewing himselfe as fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
as <hi>Paris</hi> when he hanseled his loue with <hi>Helena.</hi> At this
<hi>Gerismond</hi> and the rest smiled, and concluder that <hi>Montanus</hi>
and <hi>Phoebe</hi> should keepe their wedding with the two brethren.
<hi>Aliena</hi> seeing <hi>Saladyne</hi> stand in a dumpe, to wake him from his
dreame began thus. Why how now my <hi>Saladyne,</hi> all a mort,
what melancholy man at the day of marriage? perchaunce thou
art sorrowfull to thinke on thy brothers high fortunes, and thyne
owne base desires to chuse so meane a shepheardize. Cheare vp
thy hartman, for this day thou shalt bee married to the daughter
of a King: for know <hi>Saladyne,</hi> I am not <hi>Aliena,</hi> but <hi>Alinda</hi> the
daughter of thy mortal enemie <hi>Torismond.</hi> At this all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
was amazed, especially <hi>Gerismond,</hi> who rising vp, tooke
<hi>Alinda</hi> in his armes, and said to <hi>Rosalynd:</hi> is this that faire <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi>
famous for so many vertues, that forsoke her fathers court
to liue with thee exilde in the country? The same q. <hi>Rosalynde.</hi>
Then quoth <hi>Gerismond,</hi> turning to <hi>Saladine,</hi> iolly Forrester be
frolick, for thy fortunes are great, &amp; thy desires excellent, thou hast
got a princesse as famous for her perfection, as exceeding in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
And she hath with her beauty won (quoth <hi>Saladyne</hi>) an
humble seruant, as full of faith, as she of amiable fauour. While
euery one was amazed with these Comicall euentes, <hi>Coridon</hi>
came skipping in, &amp; told them that the Priest was at Church and
tarried for their comming. With that <hi>Gerismond</hi> led the way,
&amp; the rest followed, where to the admiration of all the countrey
swains in <hi>Arden,</hi> their mariages were solemnly solemnized. As
soone as the Priest had finished, home they went with <hi>Alinda,</hi>
where <hi>Coridon</hi> had made all things in readines. Dinner was
prouided, &amp; the tables being spread, and the Brides set downe by
<hi>Gerismond, Rosader, Saladyne,</hi> &amp; <hi>Montanus</hi> that day were
<pb facs="tcp:20331:60"/>
seruitors: homely cheare they had, such as their country could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord:
but to mend their fare they had mickle good chat, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
discourses of their loues and fortunes. About mid dinner, to
make them mery <hi>Coridon</hi> came in with an old crowd, and plaid
them a fit of mirth, to which he sung this pleasant song.</p>

I know not. With that <hi>Saladine</hi> went and met his brother, whom
he welcommed with all curtesie, &amp; <hi>Rosader</hi> gaue him no lesse frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entertainment: brought he was by his two brothers into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
where they all sate at dinner. <hi>Fernandine</hi> as one that knew as
many maners, as he could points of sophistry, &amp; was aswel brought
vp as well lettered, saluted them all. But when he espied <hi>Geris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> kneeling on his knee, he did him what reuerence belonged to
his estate: and with that burst forth into these speaches. Although
(right mighty Prince) this day of my brothers marriage be a daye
of mirth, yet time craues another course: and therfore from daintie
cates rise to sharpe weapons. And you the sonnes of Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of
<hi>Bourdeux,</hi> leaue off your amors, &amp; fal to arms, change your loues
into lances, and now this day shew your selues valiant, as hitherto
you haue been passionate. For know <hi>Gerismond,</hi> that harde by at
the edge of this forrest the twelue peeres of France are vp in arms
to recouer thy right: and <hi>Torismond</hi> troupt with a crue of despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
runnagates is ready to bid them battaile. The armies are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ioyne: therefore shewe thy selfe in the field to incourage thy
subiects: &amp; you <hi>Saladine</hi> and <hi>Rosader</hi> mount you, and shew your
selues as hardy soldiers as you haue been harty louers: so shal you
for the benefit of your Country, discouer the <hi>Idea</hi> of your Fathers
vertues to be stamped in your thoughts, and proue children worthy
of so honorable a parent. At this alarum giuen him by <hi>Fernandine
Gerismond</hi> leapt from the boord, &amp; <hi>Saladyne</hi> and <hi>Rosader</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
themselues to their weapons. Nay (q. <hi>Gerismond</hi>) go with
me, I haue horse and armor for vs all, &amp; then being well mounted
let vs shew that we carry reuenge &amp; honor at our fanchons points.
Thus they leaue the Brides full of sorrow, especially <hi>Alinda,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:20331:61"/>
desired <hi>Gerismond</hi> to be good to her Father: hee not returning
a word because his hast was great hied him home to his lodge, wher
he deliuered <hi>Saladyne</hi> &amp; <hi>Rosador</hi> horse and armour, and himselfe
armed royally led the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Gerismond</hi> seeing the wing wherein the Peeres fought, thrust in
there, and cryed S. <hi>Denis,</hi> laying on such load vpon his enemies,
that he shewed how highly he did estimate of a crowne. When the
Pe<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs perceiued that their lawful king was there, they grew more
eager: and <hi>Saladine</hi> &amp; <hi>Rosader</hi> so behaued themselues, that none
durst stand in their way nor abide the furie of their weapons. To be
short, the Peers were conquerors, <hi>Torismonds</hi> army put to flight
and himself slain in battaile. The Peers then gathered themselues
together, and saluted their king, conducted him royally into <hi>Paris,</hi>
where he has receiued with great ioy of all the citizens. Assoone
as all was quiet &amp; he had receiued againe the crowne, he sent for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi>
&amp; <hi>Rosalynd</hi> to the court, <hi>Alinda</hi> being very passionat for the
death of her father: yet brooking it with the more patience, in that
she was contented with the welfare of her <hi>Saladyne.</hi> Wel, assoone
as they were come to <hi>Paris, Gerismond</hi> made a royal feast for the
Peers and Lords of his Land, which continued thirtie dayes, in
which time summoning a parliament, by the consent of his nobles,
he created <hi>Rosader</hi> heire apparant to the kingdome, hee restored
<hi>Saladyne</hi> to all his fathers Land, and gaue him the Dukedome of
<hi>Namours,</hi> he made <hi>Fernandine</hi> principall secretarie to himselfe:
and that Fortune might euery way seeme frolicke, he made <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi>
Lord ouer all the Forrest of <hi>Arden, Adam Spencer</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of the Kings Gard, and <hi>Coridon,</hi> Maister of <hi>Alindas</hi> flocks.
<hi>HEere Gentlemen may you see in <hi>Euphues golden Legacie,</hi> that
such as neglect their fathers precepts, incur much preiudice, that
diuision in nature as it is a blemish in nurture, so tis a breach of good
fortunes, that vertue is not measured by birth but by action, that yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
brethren though inferiour in yeares, yet may bee superiour to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors:
that concord is the sweetest conclusion, and amity betwixt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more forceable than fortune. If you gather any fruits by this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacie
speake wel of <hi>Euphues</hi> for writing it, and me for fetching it. If
you grace me with that fauor you incorage me to be more froward &amp;
assoon as I haue ouerlookt my labors, expect the <hi>Sailers Kalender.</hi>
