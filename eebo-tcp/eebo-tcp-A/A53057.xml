            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:115281:21"/>Those <hi>Spirits</hi> most commonly move according to the matter they worke on. For in spungy and in Porous <hi>light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> their <hi>motion</hi> is quick; in solid, and weighty, their <hi>motion</hi> is slower.

This is the reason <hi>Mineralls</hi> last longer then <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables</hi> and <hi>Animals,</hi> because that <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is both tougher and harder to worke on, then <hi>Vegetables</hi> and <hi>Animals</hi> are.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Sensitive spirits</hi> we may similize to severall Workmen, being alwayes bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily imployed, removing, lifting, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, driving, drawing, digging, and the like. And although these <hi>Spirits</hi> are of substance thinner then <hi>dull matter,</hi> yet they are stronger by reason of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115281:22"/>
and <hi>motion,</hi> which motion gives them power: for they are of an acute quality, being the <hi>Vitrioll,</hi> as it were, of <hi>Nature,</hi> cut and divide all that opposeth their way.</p>
               <p>Now these <hi>Spirits</hi> although they be <hi>infinite,</hi> yet we cannot thinke them so grosse an infinite, as <hi>combustible matter,</hi> yet those thinner <hi>infinites</hi> may cut, and carve the thicker <hi>infinites</hi> all into severall <hi>Figures:</hi> like as <hi>Aqua-fort is</hi> will eate into the hardest Iron, and divide it into small parts.</p>
               <p>As I have sayd before, the <hi>Spirits of life</hi> worke according as the <hi>Matter</hi> is, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing is shap'd according to the soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the <hi>matter;</hi> like as a <hi>man</hi> which builds a House, makes the beames of the House of such wood, which is tough, and strong, because he knows otherwise it will breake, by reason of the great weight they are to bear; but to make Laths he takes his Wood and cuts it thin, that the Nayls may easier passe through, so joyning and fitting severall forts to proper uses to build his house. Or like a <hi>Cooke</hi> when he's to raise a Pye, must take stiffe Dough; for otherwise it will not

onely fall before it be finished, but it cannot be raised, and to make the Lids to cover his Pye, hee must use a softer Paste, otherwise it will not rowle thinn; thus a stiffe Paste is not fit for a Lid, nor a thinner Paste for to raise a Pye; it may make a Cake, or so. So the <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>life</hi> must make <hi>Figures,</hi> as the <hi>matter</hi> is fit, and proper thereto, for the <hi>figure</hi> of <hi>man</hi> or the like; the <hi>Spirits</hi> of life take the solid and hard <hi>matter</hi> for the<note n="*" place="margin">I do not say that Bones are the solid'st matter in Nature.</note>

               <p>Now the <hi>spirits</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> or <hi>lively spirits</hi> do not onely move dull and in moving <hi>matter,</hi> but makes that <hi>matter</hi> to move, and worke upon others; for some kinde of <hi>Figures</hi> shall make<note n="†" place="margin">As the Figure of Man.</note> another to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble it selfe, though not just be as it selfe is made, but as the shadow like the substance; for it workes as a <hi>Hand</hi> that is guided by another, and not of its

As I have said before, the difference of <hi>Rationall Spirits,</hi> and <hi>sensitive Spirits,</hi> is, that the <hi>sensitive Spirits</hi> make <hi>Figures</hi> out of <hi>dull Matter:</hi> The <hi>Rationall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> put themselves into <hi>Figure,</hi> placing themselves with <hi>Number,</hi> and <hi>Measure;</hi> this is the reason when <hi>Animals</hi> dye, the <hi>Externall Forme</hi> of that <hi>Animall</hi> may be perfect, and the <hi>Internall Motion</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> quite alter'd; yet not absent, nor dispersd, untill the <hi>Annihilating</hi> of the <hi>Externall Figure:</hi> thus it is not the <hi>Matter</hi> that alters, but the <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Forme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some <hi>Figures</hi> are stronger built then others, which makes them last longer: For <hi>some,</hi> their building is so weak, as they fall as soon as finished; like houses that are built with Stone, or Timber, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it might be a Stone-house, or Timber-house, yet it may be built not of such a sort of Stone, or such a sort of Timber.</p>
