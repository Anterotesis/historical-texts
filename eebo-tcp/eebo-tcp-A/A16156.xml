            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE obſcureſable night, leaving behind her the ſhady twilight to make good the reare againſt the hot approach of the fire-breathing Sunne, ſurrendred up the field unto a gloomy morning; when the Marriners diſcovering land, changed the feare of their continuing wrack-threatning fortune, into another farre greater both in eſteeme and effect. The ſhippe through her long working and continuall repercuſſions was all over riven and quite ſpoild, ſo as the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary inſtruments ſufficed not to empty the water, which guſhing in through the chinkes of her ſides above, and leakes ſprung about her keele beneath, ſtill more and more overcharged the Pumpe.</p>
                  <p>The very day before, and the ſelfe ſame night too, they (by ſounding the Seas depth) knew they were not far off the land, though they yet ſaw no poſſible means of reaching to it without imminent perill of ſhipwrack; But now that danger (although indeed ſtill the ſame) ſeemed in their eyes ſomewhat leſſer, conſidering that which the oppoſite ſhore menaced their crazie veſſell. The bluſtering winds inceſſantly whiſtled on all ſides; But to hold more on the one hand than on the other lay not in the power of ſuch as endeavoured it, the ſhip riding right under the Iſland, whoſe capes were ſo farre diſtant that there appeared no hopes to wade thither with any aſſurance of ſafety. Thus then being certaine of naufrage, every one endeavoured to fit himſelfe with ſome ſmall plancke or other, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawfull for any ſuch as had none, to teare one off the ſhippe and make it the meanes of his deliverance. Their confuſed cries (in the meane while) mounting up to the skies equalized the ruſtling noiſe of the loud-roaring Sea, which grew to be ſo boldly domeſticke, that it came and went fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly in and out without asking any leave.</p>
                  <p>The now-deſpairing Pilot, who with the furtherance of three aſſiſtants,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7474:9"/>
and helpe of his ſtrongeſt Cables was not able to command the helme, having now abandoned it, and eaſed him of the burthen of his cloathes, ſought out for ſome thing ſerviceable for the conveying his body from the tyranny of the devouring Ocean; whilſt the night to the Sunnes ſhame (which being totally eclipſed by the interpoſition of the terreſtriall Globe continued its courſe in the oppoſite horizon) recovering the poſſeſſion of her hereditary darkeneſſe imparted to theſe diſtreſſed caitives a glimpſe of dusky light, to the end the ſight of their miſerie might encreaſe its ſenſibility.</p>
                  <p>The Ship (like a Sea-bird among the ſurging waves) held on her courſe, diving under the foaming ſurface of the raging maine, whilſt the boiling billowes grew ſtill more and more ſwelling and violent, by how much the nearer they approached the ſhore, till by buldgeing on an occult rocke, it wanted little of being quite overturned, ſo forcibly was it hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along the diſſembling ſmoothneſſe of the water by the fury of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable wind; feare ſo encreaſing their out-cries, as they ſeemed to bee perſwaded, that they could with their vowes force the heavens to doe what they would have them.</p>
                  <p>Among other paſſengers there aboard was an aged Gentleman, whoſe gray haires and grave countenance ſpake him worthy of a reſpective re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, he alone among all theſe clamours had the power to containe himſelfe all this while within the bounds of ſilence; Till now caſting his eyes on the ſhoare and ſailes, at the very inſtant that with the benefit of a favourable wave they had ſurmounted the rocke (though with their Ship ſhrewdly bruiſed and well neare ſplit) hee loudly pronounced this ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>And is this (my maſters) a time to be ſpent in lamentations, and lazily invoking the heavenly aſſiſtance, without uſing the neceſſary meanes of your deliverance? Peradventure you beleeve it ſhould by ſome ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-miraculous way be preſt upon you, whilſt it being already proffered you, you have neyther the judgement to conceive it, nor the will to make uſe of it: To what end (I pray you) were your hands made, and the reach of reaſon confer'd upon you? you call out for inſtruments as though you wanted them, and knowing that the gods ab horre idleneſſe would yet have them be propitious to your ſloathfull <hi>oraiſons.</hi> The danger is not yet ſuch altogether as you conceive it to be, though indeede it will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe grow to be ſuch, if you uſe not the remedy to prevent it; Seeing we have yet a good way to the land, our Shippe being almoſt all over leaky and battered; the ſhore abounding in ſandy ſhelves, and all our Sailes ſtrucken downe. True it is, that whilſt the night laſted, it was our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt courſe to ſtrike all ſave a ſmall Trinket Saile, the violence of the winds and the darkeneſſe then requiring it; But now (alas) our ſtate is farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, For I tell you, that if you put not in practiſe all the meanes you can imagine to runne us aſhore with all expedition poſſible, it will be unpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us to eſcape drowning.</p>
                  <p>This ſpeech of his was ſo efficacious, as it ſeemed to infuſe new courage into their drooping ſpirits, ſo as hoiſſing up all their Sailes, the Ship re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving (as it were) a new livelineſſe from the forwardneſſe of their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, merrily ranne aground in a Channell not farre remote off the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7474:9"/>
land, whence after a ſhort ſpace, at the ebbing of the Sea, they had the convenienceie of conveying themſelves at their leaſure, to the much deſired ſhore.</p>
                  <p>The old Gentleman (with a ſervant he had with him) having landed, tooke his way towards a wood, where lighting on a ſmall path, hee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it ſo farre, that at laſt it led him to the mouth of a cave. But by then the death-menacing diſquietneſſe hee had endured in the night, the drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of his ſpirits for want of ſleepe, the tedious toilſomneſſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth way hee was come, but above all, the irkeſome heavineſſe of his old age had ſo overtired him, as hee found himſelfe unable to goe on any farther, untill hee had firſt refreſht himſelfe with a little reſt. But here, as hee thought to lay him downe, hee heard an odde kinde of murmure in the cave hard by him, and more attentively liſtning, might diſtinctly heare two faintly-lamenting voices, which with a pittifull accent enterchanged ſome few but weake words, as though in ſighes and ſobbings they had beene two dolefull corrivals. Whereupon, entring into the cave (its mouth being freed of a large ſlate-ſtone wherwith it was uſed to be clos'd up) hee paſſed along through a narrow entrie ſo farre, that hee came to finde out its doore; through which (although it was covered with a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous piece of hangings embroydered with gold, and adorned with a rich coate of Armes under a royall Crowne) hee might yet eſpie a noble ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, who having taken up in her armes a babe borne but that very inſtant, laid him aſide on a bed, to goe &amp; lend her aſſiſtance unto his mother, who lay groveling on a mattreſſe with her face in ſuch a poſture, as it could not from where hee ſtood be ſeene; continuing a pretty while in that plight, with her ſpirits ſo retired from executing their peculiar offices, as they ſeemed to have quite forſaken her. But the matron (aſſiſted by an other Damſell) by wetting and chafing her pulſes with ſoveraigne waters, brought her againe to her ſelfe; when upon their lifting her to lay her in a more eaſie poſture, was diſcovered ſuch a ſhape of a face, as (in deſpite of all paleneſſe) was one of the faireſt and beſt featur'd that ever was painted with celeſtiall penſill, diſtended upon an youthfull tablet of ſome eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares of age; her haire hung downe all diſheveled about her ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhoulders, (the onely fitte dreſſing to raviſh amorous hearts) her appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell too was coſtly, and all things elſe in her promiſed no leſſe eminencie than excellencie; onely the place and her preſent condition wore the badges of a diſtreſſed ſtate. A long while continued ſhee deprived of the ability to make uſe of the Organs of her ſpeech, left alone of her women, who were gone downe to the bottome of the cave to looke to the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne babe; onely her ſighes kept her company by turnes, now and then interrupted by a weeping groane (I might well ſay) loving, if a lugubrous and deſperate love could be capable of ſo ſweet an <hi>epithete.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Matron returned more cheerefully than ſhee went (ſo much pleaſed her a male childe, but much more a manly beauty) and making her a low reverence, ſhee thus beſpake her.</p>
                  <p>Moſt excellent and deareſt Madame, bee of good comfort, (I beſeech your Highneſſe) for behold here the faireſt and beſt proportioned crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ever was borne: Oh what a beautifull and goodly progenie would the world produce if really affectionate love were alwayes ſole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7474:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in <hi>himencall</hi> unions! I have alwayes heard ſay, that ſtolen embraces and furtive births prov'd to be ever the beſt, goodlieſt, and moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; all the ſpirits concurring, and being with an affectionate will ſtrongly united together, and wholly intentive to the performance of that onely office. The heavens be prayſed, for having now at length out of the maſſe of our diaſters extracted us this dragme of comfort.</p>
                  <p>The young Lady raiſing her ſelfe upon her elbow, tooke at one looke a full ſurvey of her childe; but being reduced to ſuch weakeneſſe as ſhee was not longable to reſt on the feeble ſupport of her arme, cauſing him (wrapped in a rich mantle) to be laid by her on the bed, ſhee tenderly kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him thus anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Ah <hi>Paralette:</hi> And good reaſon have you to ſay, hee is a goodly faire childe, for ſo indeed he is (unfortunate infant!) Peradventure hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make the deformity of his deſtiny ſeeme leſſe ugly through the vaile of theſe his goodly beautifulneſſe and comely making; theſe (alas) looke not as if they were for their birth-place beholding to homely caves ſeated among deſolate groves, where the neceſſity of ſhunning the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, preſents their owner for his firſt object with darkeneſſe and horror. But with this return'd to weeping and then againe to kiſſing him, ſhee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, ſaying.</p>
                  <p>And ſeemes it unto you (Mother) that an effect ſo beautifull ought to be a juſt eaſe to my calamities? and that the Gods have, out of my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, extracted that for my good, which is likely to prove to mee a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall occaſion both of griefes and miſeries? No, no, the heavens not fully ſatisfied in having made mee in the higheſt degree miſerable in my owne perſon onely, are pleaſed to manifeſt their infinite power in an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe miſery; for in extending it to another they multiply my agonies with the multiplication of the cauſes of my fortunes; ſhee was notable to utter another word, for being fallen into a ſwound, more through the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her griefe, than the agony of her ſickneſſe, continuing a good while in this deadly trance, whileſt her women carefully employed the beſt of their endeavours for the recovery of her ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>The old Gentleman, full of noble pitty, would willingly have added an helping hand to aſſiſt her, but that he conſidered, that <hi>extreame afflictions admit not of any other reliefe, than little-availing compaſsion.</hi> Beſides, that the quality of her infirmity prohibiting the preſence of men, would have made his curteſie beene conſtrued for an unexcuſable point of incivility. Taking afterwards more obſervant notice of the place, hee diſcovered in its poverty an object of diſcorreſpondent furnitures, the bed and arras hangings being all of ſilke and gold. But whileſt he thus ſtood obſerving what they were a doing, <hi>Carildo</hi> a Squire appeared at the call of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,</hi> which cauſed him to retire from the cave, but not to part away thence, in that he conceived ſhee was ſending him forth, nor was he indeed therein miſtaken; for as this Squire would have put himſelfe on his way out, he came to meet him full butt; at which unexpected ſight the Squire (carried by the violence of a juſt judgement to an unjuſt ſuſpition) was no leſſe diſmaid than afrighted: till the Gentleman courteouſly ſaluting him, enquired the way to ſome neighbouring village, where hee might provide himſelfe of a ſhip, ſeeing that the veſſell that had brought him thither
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7474:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had beene (through the diſcourteſie of the ſea and tempeſt) wracked on that ſhore; To which the Squire (perceiving now by his language that hee had entertained a wrong ſuſpition of him) made anſwer; That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit to finde ſhipping in that Iland would be ſomewhat difficult, yet that he could not lightly miſſe of fitting himſelfe in <hi>Feacia.</hi> But in the meane time, where may I (replied the Gentleman) provide me ſome victuals? In a very good place (anſwered the other) for on the way that I am now going, we ſhall paſſe by the houſe of a reverend <hi>Druide,</hi> who entertaines very kindly all ſtrangers, but more eſpecially Gentlemen of merit as you ſeeme to be; who alſo will out of his ordinary goodneſſe ſee you provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of ſhipping, and ſupplied of all other neceſſaries; Being then by the Gentleman asked the name of that Iland: It is properly called (ſaid hee) <hi>Ericuſa,</hi> but more commonly the Iland of Adventures, for here arrives not any <hi>Cavalier,</hi> that in a ſhort time lights not on divers ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected accidents; Certainely (replied the old Gentleman) I beleeve that to be moſt true, ſince my ſhipwrack may very well be accounted in the number of theſe accidents, but much rather that which I chanced to ſee within your cave: Here obſerving the Squire grow pale at his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of theſe later words hee proceeded.</p>
                  <p>Be not diſmaid (my kinde friend) for it was neither curioſity nor any ill intention that brought me to prie into your ſecrets; onely I would to God it lay within the reach of my power to doe this noble Princeſſe any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, you ſhould then ſoone ſee, that I would willingly effect it even to the effuſion of my blood.</p>
                  <p>[Now the Gentleman knew not as yet, that the Lady delivered of the childe was a Princeſſe, yet did he boldly ſtile her ſo, for that hee gheſſed her to bee ſuch, as well by the title given her by the Matron, as by the Crowne he had diſcovered above her Armes, perſwading himſelfe, that by boldly giving her that eminent title, he might eaſily worke out of the Squire the ſecrets of her being and quality, which indeed fell out accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly] for the Squire hearing him relate the paſſages of the cave, which induced him to conceive that ſhee was already knowne unto him, had not the power to be longer ſilent; and the ſubtle old Gentleman perceiving him come to the point he wiſh'd for, praid him to diſcloſe how her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fortunes had guided her to the ſtate of her preſent being: To the which he willingly condeſcending, ſaid: (Sir) There is not any body here that knowes her otherwiſe, than by meere conjectures, ſo as what you might have beene caſually informed of, cannot chooſe but be farre wide off the truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Corianna</hi> my Lady and Soveraigne Miſtreſſe became enamoured of <hi>Lucano</hi> Duke of <hi>Lucania,</hi> a Gentleman in all excelling qualities, the moſt accompliſht that was, (I will not ſay of all her Fathers Subjects, but) of all the Princes that are this day in the world; For in nobility and eſtate there was not one that equalled him in the whole Kingdome of <hi>Parthenope,</hi> nor elſe-where any that exceeded him in comlineſſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, hardineſſe or knightly valour, yet were theſe (though rare) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments but handmaides to others farre more prize-worthy; at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to thoſe wherewith he captivated mens minds, as his bounty and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and above all, his diſcretion, the moderatreſſe of all other vertues,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7474:11"/>
and of her ſelfe too. So that to love then the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lucania</hi> was ſo farre from being a fault, that hee was not held for a gentle ſpirit that did not both honour and (in a manner) adore him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Corrianna</hi> then (caſting both her eyes and heart, I know not whether more upon the comely and well-featured perſonage or ſweete diſpoſition, and other excelling qualities of <hi>Lucano)</hi> grew to be ſo affectionate both to the one and the other, that her becomming blinde thereat, ſo dimm'd his eyes, that they ſtumbled, or rather tumbled downe both together over the precipice of inconſiderate reſolution, into the bottomleſſe gulfe of deſpairing miſerie.</p>
                  <p>The King her Father had ſolemnly promiſed her to the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> for the Prince his Sonne; and ſhee very readily had aſſented thereunto: for, being (at that time) a free woman, ſhee wholly rendred her ſelfe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the diſpoſition of her parents: But after that love (the infringer of wholſome lawes, and deſtroyer of good orders) had violated her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and corrupted her minde, ſhee then gave liberty to her licentious will, which afterwards occaſioned his fatall end, and her utter ruine.</p>
                  <p>The Princes &amp; Lords of that Kingdome are (for the moſt part) uſed to reſort to the Court but few moneths in the yeare; for, it being their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to make a glorious ſhew, the great expences they make therein doe ſo farre exceede their abilities, that for not being able to maintaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there (any long time) in their accuſtomed pompe, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained (for feare of their utter undoing) to retire themſelves to their owne home and meanes.</p>
                  <p>The Father of <hi>Lucano</hi> by thus over-running his courſes, left at his death his eſtate ſo incumbred, as it was judged a happineſſe that hee died (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for other occaſions hee was well worthy of life) and his Mother being his guardian, aſſigning an honourable allowance towards her houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping, and towards the maintenance and nobly breeding up of her ſonne (who at that time paſſed not nine yeares of age) imployed the reſidue towards the diſcharging of debts; ſo that at his going out of his minority, hee was ſo rich, that without prejudice to his eſtate, he could liberally ſpend conformable to the unbounded greatheſſe of his minde, and eminent degree of his nobility. This was the reaſon that <hi>Lucano</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver frequented the Court but (in his Fathers time) when he was very young, making his abode during the reſidue of his blooming yeares in forraine countries, it being diſcreetly conſidered of his prudent mother, that ones naturall climate and aire (how temperate and pure ſoever) is ſubject to the imperfection of being uncapable of it ſelfe to make any man compleate; ſtudie and inſtruction being of themſelves dead things without Travell and Experience, the onely meanes to polliſh the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and imbelliſh the deformity both of mindes and manners.</p>
                  <p>At the publiſhing of theſe nuptials, the Court was enriched with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Lords, and Knights, and pompouſly adorned with magnificent and glorious ſhewes, in ſo much, as <hi>Parthenope</hi> (though alwayes <hi>gentile)</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now exeedingly to exceed her ſelfe, ſo as ſuch as beheld her, wondred what wit could invent, or purſe miniſter and ſupply the excellencie and abundance of the Artifice, and ſtately curioſities that were there ſeene.</p>

expreſſible varieties of delightſome objects: In the morning the temples refounded with the harmonious noiſe of care-raviſhing Mufick, and odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferouſly ſmelled of ſenſe-recreating and fragrant ſavours: In the after-noone their faire large ſtreetes ſtrowed all over with rich Caroches and proud Courſers, made a moſt glorious ſhew in the diſtinct medley of ſuch a number of Nobility, who towards the ſetting of the ſunne, retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the jetting-out windowes, and faire <hi>balcones</hi> of the Kings Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, enriched with a comely aſpect of moſt beautifull Ladies, a ſight which wrought in the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> an ardent deſire to deſerve the being eyed and gaz'd upon.</p>
                  <p>The Sunne (taken with the delightſomneſſe of theſe heroicall exerciſes) was loath to withdraw himſelfe to his accuſtomed reſt, untill he had ſeene broken by two hundred lances (that there were burſt in ſhivers) two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of his more reſplendent rayes; the vapours of the earth, at that houre, ſerving for ſticklers to devide it equally among the tilters.</p>
                  <p>From the liſts they betooke themſelves to the dancing hall, the firſt place of admittance granted novice-lovers in <hi>Cupids</hi> Academy, and beſt affected ſolace of roſiall and love-adoring yeares.</p>
                  <p>In this happy time came <hi>Lucano</hi> to the Court, entertained by the King with particular favours, his worth ſpeaking him the prime Peere of the Realme, but much more his gracefull aſpect and Princely preſence, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities forwardly recommended by Nature unto other mens favours. And having with all ceremonious reverence performed his duty to the <hi>Queene,</hi> hee with a ſweetly-reſpective-humbleneſſe kiſs'd the hand of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</hi> But while they interchangeably beheld one another, their eyes were at firſt ſight ſo conſtantly fixed on each others countenance, as though their objects had beene long before familiar to them, and ſeene elſe-where; for clearing themſelves of which ambiguity, their rayes as faithfull Heralds by peering while here while there, queſtion either the other about it. What the particular anſwers of either ſide return'd were, is unknowne; onely moſt certaine it is, that the ſcope of it was love, for to love they concluded.</p>
                  <p>Now the daily newes of the future bridegroome began to ſound harſh in <hi>Corrianna's</hi> eare, all his rich preſents were priz'd but as meere droſſe in her eſteeme, nor could ſhee endure to give the Embaſſadours as much as a looke, that might any way promiſe them that ſhee bare the leaſt good liking to their embaſſie, her thoughts, affection, and will were in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment quite altered, and if the fayning of her ſelfe ſick had not depriv'd her of the ſight of <hi>Lucano,</hi> ſhee from fayning had become ſick in good earneſt, her body being already diſpoſed to follow the indiſpoſition of its minde, which was diſcovered by the evident ſignes of the alteration of her countenance, were it for the relation that is between it and the minde, or through her want of ſleepe, or rather becauſe from that time her heart began to make an ominous preſage of her enſuing diſaſters.</p>
                  <p>The ſports and revellings were reduced all into one place, where in dancing were by them laid the ruinous foundation of their utter ruine. It never came within the reach of my knowledge, to diſcerne which of them both was the firſt that made the motion of love, but I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that (their wounds being equall) both at the ſelfe ſame time ſought
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7474:12"/>
for the proper ſalve to cure them with: yet I have heard the Princeſſe her ſelfe often ſay, that ſhee alone was in all the fault, and that the unfortunate <hi>Duke</hi> (foreſeeing the future misfortunes) reſolved to goe on, rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not have her beleeve that he little eſteemed her, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was either inconſiderate, or any way uncapable of performing the office of a prudent and diſcreete Gentleman; Nature having fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripened his boſome, becauſe the Deſtinies had over-forwarded his death. But <hi>where fortune prevailes</hi> (it is moſt certaine) <hi>that little availes there any humane Iudgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their flames then being thus reciprocally revealed, there wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now ſave the meanes and opportunity of attaining to the remedy; but becauſe that place was inconvenient to treate thereof, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference often interrupted, (not without danger alſo of being obſerved) they reſolved to talke further thereof in her chamber; yet dancing almoſt every evening, and holding on ſometimes till the breake of day, it behov'd her to counterfeite her ſelfe ſick whenſoever ſhee deſired to enjoy his company.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paralette</hi> Dutcheſſe of <hi>Magnagrecia,</hi> a principall Lady and neere kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman to <hi>Lucano,</hi> was her governeſſe, her it behoved the Princeſſe to win of her party, being ſhee alwayes lay in her chamber, and almoſt never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of her preſence; yet was it a difficult thing (I will not ſay) to perſwade her to be a furtherer of their deſires (that being a thing impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be accompliſh'd) but to prevaile with her ſo farre, as to procure her ſilence, ſhee often menacing to reveale all to the King: <hi>Corianna</hi> for all that (certain of the contrary for the affectionate reſpect ſhee bore her, and being howſoever reſolved to goe on, although the King himſelfe had beene already acquainted with it) little regarded her threats of diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all; yet, finding her ſo averſe to her deſires, was enforced to diſcloſe the whole tenor of her ſecrecies unto one of her women, of whoſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe ſhee boldly preſumed to be confident.</p>
                  <p>At the houre appointed <hi>Lucano</hi> came, but then the Dutcheſſe ſlipt away, and the Gentlewoman, by caſting a ſmall coard out of the window, drew up a ſcaling lader, and faſtned it to two iron hookes, by which meanes hee clim'd up into her chamber, where, after their complementall ſalutes, ſhee thus beſpake him.</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Lucano,</hi> I know not what opinion you may entertaine of mee, who being already promiſed to a husband, have yet beene the occaſion of your comming into this place; I therefore beſeech you (Sir) if ſuch boldneſſe be otherwiſe unexcuſeable, that you (out of your nobleneſſe) would yet be pleaſed to extenuate it, by giving it ſome other name; and by ſo much the rather, that it proceeds from my over-loving you, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity which conſtraines me to make you a participant of my dangers, as I am conforted with the hope of your being a reciprocall partaker of my love: The truth (in briefe) is, that I deſire to be yours, though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (in that manner as I pretend to be) without a world of dangers, yet if the affection which you beare me be of ſuch a <hi>carract,</hi> as that it weighs them not, I ſhall then thinke on the meanes that ſhall worke our full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and that is, to goe with you whitherſoever your diſcreete reſolutions ſhall be pleaſed to guide us. But if in ſuch a degree I poſſeſſe not a roome
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7474:12"/>
in your noble boſome, then doe, I beſeech you, but diſcloſe it unto mee, that I may then reſolve of ſome meanes of weaning me from the thought of it.</p>
                  <p>Much amazed remained <hi>Lucano</hi> at this ſo unlook'd for a propoſition, for that hee a little before beleeved, he ſhould ſafely arrive at the harbour of his deſires without hazarding the veſſell of his content and fortunes among the dangerous rocks of inconſiderate and deſperate reſolutions; love her hee did very ardently, but yet not in ſuch a way; nor imagined hee, that ſhee (who was already as good as married) had any ſuch thought in her, perſwading himſelfe that one woman might very well be intereſſed in two men, under the diſtinct titles of law and love; and although ſuch a thing in it ſelfe be indeede ill, yet thought he its badneſſe much extenuated by its commonneſſe, accidents of that quality hapning every day unto thouſands. But what could a generous heart, and a heart overflowne with a deluge of love (upon ſuch a ſudden pinch) reſolve of? Having therefore kiſs'd her hand, he return'd her this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Right noble Madame, I beſeech your Highneſſe not to conceive mee to be either ſo diſcourteous in opinion, or ſo free from the engagements of affection, that I can paſſe any other judgement on you, than ſuch as obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged duty and love (my only directors) addreſſe me unto, without either of which I have no power to judge at all: the one ſhewes mee, that I have neither ſtate nor life to make account of, where I have the honour of, but ſimply ſerving you; much leſſe the happineſſe of being bleſt with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying you, as out of the inexhauſtable treaſure of your goodneſſe, you have (beyond all my merits) benignely offered me; the other is ſuch, as I cannot properly terme it extreame, for, the greateſt extreames have their limits; whereas my love, being in me infinite, produceth its infinite ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; ſo as your Highneſſe hath no reaſon to doubt, that I moſt loyally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect you, whom I have ſo great reaſon to love and honour. But as for that which concernes the accompliſhment of our deſires, I confeſſe there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares no meanes of effecting it without evident danger both of life and honour, not in regard of my ſelfe (for my acquiſt hath no hazard equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, nor perill that can equall it) but in reſpect of your royall perſon. For, alas, mee thinkes I already ſee in it toileſomneſſe, travels, ſufferings, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, a ſparing, and peradventure a poore one too, being all of them conditions contrary to your birth and quality; hard, yea and impoſſible for the greatneſſe of your minde to undergoe and endure.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſſe well pleaſed with this his anſwer, (with a countenance that ſeemed to have expelled all clouds of miſtruſt from her till then-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine thoughts) thus cheerefully replied.</p>
                  <p>My choyſeſt and deareſt-beſt of trueſt friends, I have now of you what I moſt deſired, that is, the aſſuredneſſe of your inclination, which facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates unto mee all the difficulties that you in any thing propoſe, ſuch (how great ſoever) having no equality with my affection, which is ſufficiently powerfull to diſpoſe of impoſſibility it ſelfe. That which compels me to tell you this, is, that in reſpect of my being already promiſed to a husband, it is expected I ſhould goe home to him; but then alas! to live ſo deprived of you will be impoſſible for me; and againe to entertaine you for my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret friend, honeſty forbids me; beſides, my reſolution of chooſing rather
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7474:13"/>
to dye than enjoy you in ſuch a way. The ſole inconvenience then, that will follow my determination, is, that I, for being promiſed unto an other, ſhall diſobey my Father; but thoſe that will follow the contrary will bee many, as to dye, if either I enjoy you not at all, or but only for a ſhort time, (for long I am ſure you could not make your abode in <hi>Sicily)</hi> and that ſhort time too, to the diſhonour of my ſelfe, my father and husband; ſuch a determination carries with it, I know, an appearance of no ſmall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, which cannot indeede chooſe but prove ſuch in effect. What then is our beſt courſe? to reſolve of nothing? Shall wee take inſtruction from thoſe who perceiving imminent dangers to environ them on all ſides, dare not, for meere feare of them, uſe the meanes to prevent or ſhunne them, whilſt their irreſolution brings them on to encounter them to their farre greater ruine? The faint-hearted man cannot ſuffer his wound to be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, becauſe he hath not the patience to brooke the ſenſe of the paine, untill it grow to be ſo feſtered, that (in deſpight of his froward will) hee muſt (at laſt) endure both ſearing and lancing-irons, yea and oftentimes the loſſe of the diſeaſed member, and his life to boote. Matters of great conſequence are never unattended on by dangers of all ſides. There is no man that in a dangerous affaire can make other than a dangerous reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the leſſe dangerous is (indeed) the better reſolution, and the beſt the moſt ſuddaine. Our caſe hath no reſolution without danger, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trune not to our former ſtate of freedome, and unlove againe; But with what heart, I wonder, can you returne to what you profeſſe to have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relinquiſht? For my part I am certaine, that I ſhall never be able to unſettle my affection; if then neceſſity require that you be mine, it will ſurely prove a leſſer evill, that I enjoy you in certainty by flying away with you hence (it being ſo but one ſole evill) than, being married to an other, to enjoy you in uncertainty with evident dangers of both life and honour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucano</hi> could have wiſh'd to have beene at that inſtant rather amidſt an army of enemies, than in the ſtraight he was in, being well aſſured, that if once ſhee grew to be obſtinate, they could reſolve of nothing but their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine, nevertheleſſe he thus courteouſly replies.</p>
                  <p>Incomparable Lady! it lies not in the power of me, your devoted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be otherwiſe than altogether obſequious unto your Highneſſe will and pleaſure; ſince that two wils are incompatible in one only ſoule; much leſſe fitting is it for mee to adviſe you in an affaire that tends to my owne good and intereſt, which altogether debilitates my judgement, and cloudes it with paſſion; yet, ſo you be but pleaſed to grant me leave to ſuſpend our peculiar wils for the better accompliſhing of our mutuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, I truſt I ſhall be then able in ſome ſort to adviſe you, my intereſſes being ſurmounted by the feeling conſideration I have of your utter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing. To come to particulars were ſuperfluous, for I am ſure your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe comprehends them better, than I know how to diſplay them; or if I thought that you reſolved of the contrary, for ſome reaſons by me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived, I would then humbly beſeech you not to demand my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell in it, but to command me its execution, wherein I ſhall ever be moſt ready to obey you.</p>
                  <p>At this the Princeſſe, ſurprized with a skarlet bluſh, thus interrupted him.</p>

                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:7474:13"/>
Ah <hi>Lncano,</hi> I ſee now you are not in love, for love is neither fcrupulous nor forecaſting; nay it hazards all, and is uncapable of other conſideration than of it ſelfe. In which point ſhee ſo enlarged her ſelfe, as <hi>Lncano</hi> would have had much adoe to raze out of her conceit the wrong impreſſion of his love; if (laying aſide all perſwaſive reaſons) hee had not expreſſed his willingneſſe of flying away with her; but how to effect it they knew not, doubting whether it were their better courſe to convey themſelves privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away from <hi>Parthenope,</hi> or to ſtay till they went for <hi>Sicily,</hi> and ſo ſteale away by the way; judging the later to be the leſſe dangerous, they agreed to cauſe to be pack'd up in a little fardell all their Iewels and gold Coyne, that ſo they might be ready for their embarking and flight.</p>
                  <p>That night was employed in no other occaſions, ſhee pretending to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate her errours with the title of matrimony, beſides their mindes trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſtinging conſiderations made them uncapable of delight: and though hee thought to make authentick their reſolved ruine with the ſweetneſſe of ſome momentary pleaſure, yet would ſhee by no meanes yet permit him, but promiſed him, that another night ſhee would (as a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wife) be conformable in all things to his diſcretion and will.</p>
                  <p>Lovers moſt commonly at their parting from the objects of their loves have their hearts ſwollen with content, onely <hi>Lucano</hi> parted from his with a minde over-charged with ſad and heavy thoughts, yet were they ſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the vigor of his youth, and repulſed by the power of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that he made no great account of them, preferring the value of the reward before the greatneſſe of the danger; it being the more confirmed, ſince the Princeſſe, conſtant in her promiſe, was contented in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence onely of her Gentlewoman to receive the wedding-ring, not daring as then to acquaint therewith the Dutcheſſe as afterwards ſhee did; which was the occaſion that ſhee (good Lady) kept her bed, deprived of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſtirring thence for a great while after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fridone</hi> Duke of <hi>Daunia</hi> was then Lord high Conſtable of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, a Peere (next <hi>Lucano)</hi> the chiefe of the Realme, and this office of great authority, ſeconded by the greenneſſe of his blooming yeares, made him become both raſh and arrogant. Tis true, that hee was <hi>Lucano</hi>'s own Cozen, but it is not the vicinity of blood that formes the unanimity of friends; for their Fathers having long contended in law, left an heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill-will rooted in the hearts of the ſonnes. Alſo <hi>Fridone,</hi> beſides this hereditary evill inclination, was of his owne nature worſe affected towards <hi>Lucano,</hi> whom he envied at the heart, becauſe he ſaw him ſurpaſſe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in deſerts, and excelling qualities. It happened as hee paſſed one day by a ſhop, where were a making certaine taſſels for his horſes, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into it (not ſo much for any neceſſity or deſire that he had to ſee them, as that he idlely loytering, ſought for any occaſion to paſſe away the time with) where at firſt ſight, he eſpied (lying upon a ſhelfe) a bundle of ſilke, which he having ſnatch'd out of the hands of the ſhop-keeper that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to hide it from him, perceived to be a ladder wrought with marvei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous curioſity; and imagining it was made of purpoſe for amorous thefts, hee ſo earneſtly ſollicited him both by faire words and meances, that hee got him at length to confeſſe, it was the Duke of <hi>Lucania</hi>'s, brought him the day before to be mended, where it was a little worne out by the edge
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7474:14"/>
of a window, Parted thence, he began to bethinke himſelfe, where <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano</hi> could in ſo ſhort a time have gotten him a Miſtreſſe; but finding no probability for his imagination to pitch on, he reſolved to watch him nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly at the next ſhew at Court, being aſſured, that there hee ſhould diſcover what game his fancie flew at; yet found hee himſelfe (when hee had in that behalfe uſed all the beſt meanes he could) as farre to ſeeke as at firſt, <hi>Lucano</hi> ſhewing himſelfe ſtill indifferent in his carriage to all, which ſo madded this other Lord, as he bit his lips for meer anger, accuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for an inapprehenſive and ſimple fellow; yet ſtill nevertheleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in obſerving him, the heedleſſe Princeſſe gave him occaſion to build a great ſuſpition on the foundation of her carriage; for, being allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ſweete baite of his love, and by their ſecret matrimoniall knot, ſhee might be eaſily perceived (by one that were a curious obſerver) to entertaine <hi>Lucano</hi> with termes both of love and reſpect; whereupon the other's envie increaſing, and his jelouſie ingendring an indelible hatred, (himſelfe having had the boldneſſe to love her too in private, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during that another man ſhould poſſeſſe what he durſt not ſomuch as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to) he reſolved to ſound the depth of his deſignes, by his nightly fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the wals of the Pallace; which he had not done the ſecond time, ere the Princeſſe (under pretence of enjoying the proſpect of the water, and of going privately to take the benefit of the freſh ſea-aire in a Barge) was retir'd into a Caſtle ſcituated on the ſea-ſhore, the more conveniently to flie away from thence; having altered her firſt reſolution upon the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her ſelfe to be quick with childe, and upon the comming of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Bride-groome from <hi>Sicily</hi> in perſon to fetch her away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucano</hi> (in the meane time) had (unknowne to his Mother) ſecretly mortgaged ſo much of his lands, as had rais'd him a great ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, wherewith, with the addition of his Iewels and thoſe of the Princeſſe (over and beſides ſome other few but precious houſhold-furniture) hee made account to leade a contented life, which may, perhaps, be lighted on by ſuch, who depending on the ſupply of their owne meanes, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving free from the tyranny of affections (eſpecially of thoſe two diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ones, Covetize and Ambition) have the fortune to live either alone, or in company conformable to their proper humour and wayes. But alas! we ſee it but too frequently fall out, that <hi>humane deſignes prove altogether deceitfull, when the execution of them wholly relies on the favour of content-thwarting fortune.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Dutcheſſe (who was <hi>Corrianna</hi>'s governeſſe) ſeeing her thus preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate her ſelfe (the love ſhee bare her having by this time wrought an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in her minde) determined, now that ſhee ſaw no other remedy, to participate both of her weale and woe, eſpecially ſeeing her to be with childe, little (for her owne particular) regarding how the world would cenſure her; yet repenting, though now too late, that ſhee had not in time revealed all to the King, not without fearing the being puniſhed for them all, in caſe ſhee ſtayd behinde them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucano</hi> glad of this company ſo neceſſary and acceptable to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, by the meanes of a moſt faithfull ſervant of his, provided himſelfe of a pinnace, that by chance then anchored in the haven, ready to way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor and hoiſe up ſailes for the Eaſt, and cauſing him to goe and ſtow
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7474:14"/>
their baggage aboord her; he gave order that ſhee ſhould ride at anchor, juſt but ſo wide off the Caſtle, as ſhee might well heare the ſignall that ſhould be given, which was the throwing of a ſtone into the ſea, in a direct line towards her.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſſe (immediately after midnight) came forth at a private doore where <hi>Lucano</hi> ſtood all alone expecting her comming, and on her waited onely the Dutcheſſe, her Gentlewoman and I loaden with a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of apparell; ſcarce were wee come to the doore which ſtood to the ſea-ward, when the Gentlewoman opening it, and looking out at it, all afrighted, ſkreech'd out to the Duke; Looke to your ſelfe my Lord! I ſee people approaching: And true it was indeede, for three men came ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king haſtily towards us; upon this the Duke having made all of us to get ſpeedily aboord (the pinnace being by this time already come without any ſignall at the noiſe of the unbolting of the doore) knew one and the foremoſt of them to be <hi>Fridone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now he (by vertue of his Conſtables office) might come and goe any where unqueſtioned, yet not without ſpeciall occaſion into that Caſtle, reſerved then (being a time free from all ſuſpition of hoſtile invaſion) to the ſole uſe of the Princeſſe, ſo as <hi>Lucano</hi>'s comming thither was alwayes by ſtealth, even ſo was he alſo faine to uſe the like meanes for his entrance, and now come neere <hi>Lucano</hi> was by him thus greeted.</p>
                  <p>What's, I pray you, the beſt newes Cozen? And (if it may without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence be knowne) whither away wend you ſo late? To chaſtize thee for thy treachery (anſwered the other.) With that word their ſwords were ſuddenly drawn out, &amp; <hi>Lucano</hi> ſet upon by three at once, made ſhort work to rid himſelfe of two of them, whoſe ſo unmanly aſſault hee with two blowes ſo repulſed, that they lay proſtrate at his feete, without hope of ever riſing more to requite the curteſie he had done them; being left now hand to hand with the Conſtable, he thruſt at him with his point, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ran him quite through the body; with this he (feeling the pangs of death ſeaze on him) advanced on ſo forwardly with a deſperate paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, that his mortally-wounded breſt came to touch his enemies hilts, and then throwing away his ſword, he with his dagger ſtab'd <hi>Lucano,</hi> that hee fell to the ground, himſelfe having the precedencie of falling before him. All this was done in a moment, and I beleeve there paſſed not above foure <hi>Stoccadoes</hi> of a ſide, but all mortall, for I having haſtily laid aſide my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then (accompanied with the Dukes ſervant) came in as ſpeedily as I could to his ſuccour, but found him groveling on the ground with a whole ſtreame of blood guſhing out of his fainting body, yet was hee alive, and as yet unforlorne of either ſenſe or memory: for ſeeing us buſied about him, hee ſaid, Leave off now, oh! leave off <hi>Carildo;</hi> ſithence to employ any care about me is but labour loſt; I am alas! a dead man; with that, laying his hand upon the wound in his throate, as though he would a little while have kept in his lateſt breath, he proceeded.</p>

The ſupreme powers have beene pleaſed to let her, by my death, ſee, that I was not worthy of her: Aſſure her alſo, that if in the other world I ſhall finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meaſure of compaſſion, I will then procure a licence to paſſe the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheron,</hi> to come and hover about her; peradventure that favour will not be denied me, my caſe being but too compaſſionable, beſides the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of lovers to continue after death in the perſeverance of their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. There is nothing that makes me diffident therof, but the meanneſſe of my deſerts, which cannot chooſe but fall ſhort of the merit of ſo great a glory; yet hope I with her merits helpe to obtaine it, beauty being ſuch a power, as it once forced <hi>Pluto</hi> to wander out of his infernall dominions. And to the end ſhee be not affrighted, to ſee me appeare all imbath'd in blood; tell her I will come transformed into a gentle breath of winde, and will, without either affrighting or annoying her, ſoftly ſteale under her vaile, and ſo ſolace and ſport my ſelfe in her beloved boſome, which as oft as ſhee feeles, tell her it is I, and pray her to receive me joyfully: Tell her alſo—. But here his ſpirits failing him, his laſt will remained unexpreſſed, to my ſo great griefe, that I had undoubtedly kill'd my ſelfe in the place, had I not more deerely tendred my Ladies welfare, than my owne deſpiſed life. But now, danger not affording us the leiſure to vent our griefe in teares, I ranne to call away the mariners, with an intention to beare him away with us whatſoever came on't; when my companion comming running after me haſtily, told me he deſcried people approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and true it was indeede. Wherefore wee highed us aboord, crying out to the mariners to launch out, which they ſuddenly did, their pinnace being mann'd with fourteene good Oares.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſſe having heard the claſhing of the ſwords, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending (by our feare, by our being alone, and by our faces all beſmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the blood that ſpowted out of the Dukes throate) the diſaſter that had befallen us, incontinently ſwounded; the wofull-hearted Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe, in a plight not much better, uſed for reviving her the beſt meanes ſhee could, which ſoone after ſucceſſefully effected, ſhee, all enraged with paſſion upon her comming againe to her ſelfe, burſt out into theſe ſpeeches.</p>
                  <p>And what, a Gods name, meane you to doe? to contend with the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of fortune and to overcome it? or to procure me a ſenſibility, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make me become more lively ſenſible of death? <hi>Carildo!</hi> how left you <hi>Lucano?</hi> I, miſerable wretch, had not the power to finde out on a ſuddain fit words to ſweeten ſo great a bitterneſſe; whereupon ſhee ſeeing me ſo ſilent, ask'd me if he were dead? But I, weeping afreſh, knew not how to expreſſe ſo dolorous an affirmative; whereat tearing her haire and face, ſhee proceeded.</p>

The Dutcheſſe ſupporting her betweene her armes, comforted her the beſt ſhee could; but alas! poſſibility it ſelfe hath no poſſible arguments availeable in extreame calamities; onely this one good effect it wrought, (which was) the procuring her to be ſilent; ſo as the mariners, underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding litle or nothing of our language, could not comprehend our caſe or being: And although the ſuddenneſſe (at firſt, and afterwards the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) of our lamentations made them curious in better obſerving of both our words and actions, yet did the ignorance of both the fact and perſons keepe them afarre off from the conjecture of the truth. Shee in the meane time never ceaſed from weeping, depriving her ſelfe of all refreſhing &amp; refection, either of ſleepe or ſuſtenance, ſo as her body was reduced to ſuch a weakeneſſe, and her throate waxen ſo dry, that ſhee was ſcarceable to ſpeake any more; yet did ſhee, for all this, pronounce the name of <hi>Luca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> with ſuch a compaſſion-meriting paſſion, as was able to enforce even cruelty it ſelfe to beare a ſhare in her ſorrowes.</p>
                  <p>Greived to the heart was the good Dutcheſſe to ſee her in ſo wofull a plight, yet ſeeing ſhe could not perſwade her to uſe any reſtorative means to her body (already diſpoſed to pine it ſelfe away) ſhee bethought her ſelfe to aſſay if ſhee could any way cheere up her drooping ſpirits with the more ſoveraigne medicines of the minde; wherefore with a no leſſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than compaſſionable affection ſhee thus beſpake her.</p>
                  <p>Madame! the time now preſents you with an occaſion to manifeſt the greatneſſe of your worth; oh then I beſeech you be but pleaſed to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Nature having beſtowed on you a talent larger than that of any other woman, as you may therefore juſly eſteeme your ſelfe to be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar among all thoſe of your ſex, ſo may ſhee as juſtly accuſe you to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other women living ſingularly ingrate, if you make not an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune uſe of her benefits. True it is, that your croſſes exceede thoſe of any one of your ſex, nay though all their ſeverall diſaſters were added toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet could they not amount to the ſumme of yours; for, you have not onely loſt your husband, but alſo utterly abandoned your countrey, your fortunes, your ſtate and parents: yet (me thinkes) that ſhee that had the reſolute boldneſſe to hazard ſuch ineſtimable loſſes, ſhould not want the courage to endure and ſlight them with a magnanimous patience; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes game, Madame, is like that of dicing, at which no body ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture other than ſuch a ſtake as hee cared not whether hee wonne or loſt, yours was (I confeſſe) an unlucky caſt; nor is it any marvell that your loſſe was multiplied upon the <hi>by,</hi> ſince that your hazard was a thouſand to one. But will it not be yet worſe, if you, having loſt that thouſand, ſhould meerely, out of a deſperate folly, throw away all the reſt of your ſtock, without reſerving any thing, if not to hazard another time at a more indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent lay; yet, at leaſt wiſe, for ſetling the foundation of ſome better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed courſe of life? Remember Madame, I beſeech you, that the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Gods ſend us ſhould ſerve us (and you in particular) for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable admonitions, ſince they are the meanes of recalling us into their love and favour; which if they ſeeme ſo greivous unto you, now that they are but the emblems of their anger; how terrible will they then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, when they ſhall be transformed into the effects of their unappeaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fury? It lies, you know, in their power to reduce you to a more
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7474:16"/>
miſerable plight than you yet are in. They have not their hands ſo ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as that they cannot lengthen them at their pleaſures: Although wee cannot with the weake eyes of humane judgement diſcover the manner how, which is the onely argument that makes for your comfort. But if for your corporall croſſes you will needs have a corporall comfort, then doe but looke into your ſelfe, and remember, that you are a bearer of a burthen that will doubtleſſe prove an abortive, if you in time deſiſt not from your grieving, faſting and watching. Vp, up, deere Madame, and be confident, that if worldly fortune hath disfavoured you, the heavenly will not faile to glaunce a favourable looke on your diſtreſſed ſtate, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed, that you muſt both aſpire to, and expect it. <hi>Lucano,</hi> whoſe ſoule is, I am ſure, ever preſent with you, cannot chooſe but be much agreived at your ſo litle eſteeming that deere pledge of his love he left you. Doe him not then (oh doe him not) ſuch an injury; hee already pretends to live againe to you in another quality; and yet you, becauſe you cannot enjoy him alive that way that you would, will in another quality put him to death againe in the perſon of another. This the Dutcheſſe told her in ſo gentle, and yet feeling a manner of delivery, that the Princeſſe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected all her weake powers to returne her this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Mother, the reaſons of one that comforts are ever the ſame, though the griefes of the afflicted be never ſo different; if I had but one ſole loſſe, and one onely griefe, as I have, the Gods know, but too too many of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I am perſwaded you would ſtill comfort me with the ſelfe ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; as indeed the intellect hath not conceits proper for all misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, nor can one and the ſame ſalve ſerve to cure all manner of ſores; ſome afflictions there are, that admit of no conſolation, for want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort proper and proportionable to their peculiar degrees; make triall of it in mine, and you ſhall ſee, that every one is of it ſelfe worthy of thoſe reaſons you inferre for all.</p>
                  <p>Can there any griefe come neerer ones heart, than the loſſe of ones countrey? how many have choſen to die miſerably in it, rather than to live any where elſe? Our goods and meanes, are not they numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our chiefeſt felicities? yet alas! I have loſt them all. Now for my ſtate and quality, what woman will not (for this onely reſpect) deeme me the moſt unfortunate of my ſex, that am from an adored Queene become an ordinary, unknowne, yea and diſreſpected woman? And to come to my parents, what greater miſery can there be imagined, than to loſe the loving care of a provident Father, and the ſweete comfort and charily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender affection of a deere Mother, and to remaine an orphant depriv'd of the priviledge of ever more invoking thoſe endeered names? then for my husband; 'tis, I grant, to a diſaffecting wife, a happineſſe to be rid of a bad husband; but otherwiſe, where there is true, reall, indiſſoluble, and reciprocall love, 'tis a miſery that cannot be paralleld. The loſſe of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, meanes, fortunes, ſtate, dignity, and parents, bring with them a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of heart-ſtinging anguiſhes, but yet with limits, becauſe time may weare them all away; but the loſſe of a loving and a deſerving husband (being withall a man every way moſt worthy and accompliſh'd) is to an affecting wife the ſumme of all misfortunes, in ſo much as that ſhee is not able to endure the want of him, without ever leading an ever-dying-life:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7474:16"/>
Moreover yet, if things in this world be not ſuch as they ſeeme, but ſuch as wee imagine them to be, eſpecially in ſubjects of extreame affection, then certainely my misfortunes farre ſurpaſſe thoſe of all others, ſince for the enjoying of a husband agreeable to my owne hearts deſire, I eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it an happineſſe to become unhappy with the loſſe of my countrey, meanes, dignity, fortunes, ſtate and parents; nay I would have bin conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have loſt more too, had I but had more to loſe. (Here the Dutcheſſe would wilingly have replied, but ſhee commanding her ſilence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.) Beſides all this, I have loſt mine honour, oh that mine ineſtimable jewell mine honour! which you have not as yet reckoned, ſuppoſing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that for being placed among imaginary things, it was not at all to be eſteemed of; but in my caſe, my diſobedience to my Father, my breach of a marriage concluded on my owne word, and my flight from my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive countrey, have all relation to the rule of common honour, againſt which I have not imaginarily but really offended.</p>
                  <p>As for the talent you ſay Nature hath beſtowed on me, I am full litle (God wote) beholding to her for it: Since priviledged ſpirits have (beſides the acuteneſſe of the underſtanding) an equall quickneſſe of ſenſibility, ſo as who-ſo is moſt apprehenſive, is likewiſe moſt ſenſible: Againe, to contraſt with croſſes and to overcome them, proceeds not from the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Nature, but from an habit acquired by us; which if I owne (as it is not likely, ſince I have not beene yet much enured to ill fortune) I then have it among ſo many thornes, that it is a great marvell, if it be not by this time torne to pieces.</p>
                  <p>To game with-fortune is the trade of all that live, ſo to be of the loſing hand is ordinary, but yet not to be quite undone; for that is incident onely to perſons extraordinary as I am, <hi>Princes ſeldome loſe without being ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruin'd:</hi> yet ſhould I not be (for all that) much blamed for hazarding ſo much as I did, for great and right precious was the ſtake that I hoped to winne, which cannot be valued either by quantity or weight, <hi>One pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Iewell is more prized than many maſſes of gold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for what concernes the Gods, I know not how to anſwer you, for I neither know nor comprehend their wayes; no, I have (I confeſſe) but too much ſtraid beſides them, yet if their mercies exceed our offences, wherefore have they not then exceeded mine? They will raiſe mee up (you will ſay) and againe reſtore me to my former ſtate! In good time; but if I voluntarily forſooke it for <hi>Lucano</hi>'s ſake, and they taken him from mee, how can they then any way eaſe my griefe, ſeeing hee is the onely thing I want and deſire? Is their Omnipotencie (can you tell mee) ſo regulated, as to extend even to contradictories? Can they let mee have him in the ſame inſtant both dead and alive? More ſhee would have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but the good Dutcheſſe well knowing that extreame paſſions mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unwholſome conceits, interrupted her, by inferring conſolative rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and ſhee after patiently liſtning unto her, finding her ſelfe at length convicted with her diſcreete arguments, returned to tell her.</p>
                  <p>Mother, the Gods are not ſo firmely bound by the unabſolveable oathes they vow by the infernall Lake, as you have bound me to let him live to me, upon the intereſt of the burden I goe now with childe of. Live then I will, that he may leade a living, and I an ever-dying life, among perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7474:17"/>
teares in eternall ſorrowes. Here ſhee thought to have proceeded further, thereby to have vented out her griefe, but the watry humour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly flowing from her eyes, ſo ſuffocated her words as ſhe could not.</p>
                  <p>In the evening ſhe was perſwaded to taſte of ſome reſtorative conſerves, continuing ſo to doe the other dayes following, untill the marriners touch'd in this Iland to refreſh themſelves. But then ſhee leaving us a-boord with the goods, attended only by her women, would by all meanes goe aſhore; where eſpying (by chance) the cave you ſaw, ſhee boldly entred it, and out of the litle eſteeme ſhee had any more now of her life, a deſire tooke her to ſettle her abode there, for that ſhee judged it a place moſt proper to live concealed in.</p>
                  <p>The marriners therefore, after being largely rewarded, were licenſed, and my fellow-ſervant and I (neceſſity being our crafts-maſter) hew'd out the inſide of the cave, and contrived it into divers convenient roomes that you yet ſaw not; on its backſide we erected a wall, covered ſo artificially with brambles and briars, as no man would imagine to be there either houſe or garden. As ſoone as wee were thus accommodated, the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe <hi>Lucano</hi>'s man, clad in a pilgrims habit, to <hi>Parthenope,</hi> to learne out what ſucceeded after our departure, whilſt we with extreame patience endeavoured to moderate the extreame impatience of the Princeſſe, who calling me (one day) unto her, would needs know of mee, if <hi>Lucano</hi> ſpake any thing of her as he lay a-dying; for, all that while had not I related any of his ſpeeches, for feare of augmenting her afflictions: But now holding my ſelfe obliged in conſcience to performe the will of the dead, I impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her all he had enjoyn'd me to tell her. A ſtrange thing it was, to ſee what a ſudden effect it wrought in her. Shee ſearched in every corner of the cave, without finding the leaſt breath of winde, the ayre being ſo calme, as there was not a leafe that ſtirr'd; till come to the entrie doore, ſhee there felt a gentle blaſt of ayre, (occaſioned by ſome ſubtile exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ariſing there, were kept in by the ayre, which being iſſued from the concavous content of the cave whirl'd round in that ſtreight; for being ſo beaten back as it could not get out, but was forced to turne back againe, converted into a litle breath of winde through the doore where the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe ſtood) which ſhee with opened armes welcomed, conceiting, that ſhee embraced <hi>Lucano;</hi> accompanying this act with teares and words ſo compaſſionable, as none of us could refraine from weeping with her; this imagination nouriſhing her ſo efficaciouſly, as (I am confidently perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) that but for it ſhee had beene dead ere this time.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſhee hapning ſometimes to dreame that <hi>Lucano</hi> was not dead, wee made a ſhew of beleeving it, inferring, that the ſelfe ſame viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are never reiterated but in dreames unquestionably true and certaine, the ſoules of lovers communicating their plights and beeings one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by naturall (though unknowne) wayes, ſo perſwading her upon this uncertainty to ſuſpend the certainty of her griefe, till the returne of <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miro:</hi> (for ſuch is the name of <hi>Lucano</hi>'s ſervant whom wee expect from <hi>Parthenope.)</hi> True it is, that then peradventure wee ſhall be in a worſe caſe than now we are in, being he can bring us no other newes, than ſuch as ſhall augment our griefes; yet ſhall we then (maugre the worſt that can befall us) remove from hence, which will prove no litle breathing to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7474:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſuffocation of our ſo grievous diſaſters.</p>
                  <p>Much did the good old Gentleman commiſerate the ſo miſerable caſe of ſo worthy a Princeſſe, and faine would have beene a furtherer in the employment of removing her thence, but that he ſaw no meanes of effecting it till <hi>Olmiro</hi>'s returne; yet, but that a greater tye of duty call'd him thence, he had ſtaid there of purpoſe to expect the opportunity of ſerving her: Having therefore kindly thanked <hi>Carildo,</hi> hee told him, hee was ſorry at the heart for the ill-fortunes of ſo great a Princeſſe, and the more for her being (untill the hearing of more certaine newes) uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of reſolving how to diſpoſe of her ſelfe; howbeit he hoped that his returne would be in a time convenient enough to dedicate to her his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which he unfainedly meant to performe, it being a caſe that bound any Gentleman to put a helping hand unto; here obſerving <hi>Carildo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a glad man at his offer, he on and told him, that it behoved him of neceſſity to ſtrike over into <hi>Greece</hi> for a certaine affaire which would not detaine him above two or three moneths time, and that if it ſtood with the conveniencie of his Ladies ſervice to ſtay there but for that ſmall while, he would come and ſerve her in all things, eſpecially in removing her from that moſt noyſome habitation ſo obnoxious to her health, and would waite on her whitherſoever ſhee pleaſed to goe: And (withall) would take on him as though hee came thither accidentally, and alſo (for giving her no cauſe of other ſuſpition) attend him without the cave, that ſo gotten out thence they might conferre, and reſolve of what ſhould be done.</p>
                  <p>Full well pleaſed was <hi>Carildo</hi> with what they agreed on, conceiting, that the heavens had ſent thither that Gentleman: (for yeares and gravity fitteſt of any man for ſuch an employment) yet for his better aſſurance thereof (after yeelding him reſpective thankes) he craved his name; which not being denied him, and to him by report well knowne (as it is a thing ordinary to know the names of great perſons eminent in the Courts of Princes) he deſired to kiſſe his hand.</p>
                  <p>Continuing reciprocally in courteous language each to other, they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on till they entred into a very pleaſing ſite for proſpect, where, on the brow of a little hillock, ſtood erected an homely houſe, and cloſe by it a faire Temple, encircled all about with meadowes and a delightſome ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy grove; heere it was that the <hi>Druide</hi> dwelled, and here tooke <hi>Carildo</hi> his leave, whoſe daily exerciſe was to goe ſee if any Veſſell came thither from the Weſt, to the ſatisfaction of the impatient Princeſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now the way to get up to the hill paſſed through the wood, on the one ſide whereof ſtood erected under a lofty Siccamore-tree the Image of <hi>Iove</hi> the preſerver, and on the other one of <hi>Venus</hi> with her Sonne; in the ſhade of the tree at the foote of the Goddeſſe, the Gent: (who was the good old <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona)</hi> might ſee, ſleeping with his face upwards, a goodly and well-featured young Knight, by ſight under ſeventeene yeares of age, his ſhield painted over with a violet-browne, beſprinkled with teares reſted on the footeſtall of the ſtatue; and not farre thence ſtood grazing a horſe of ſuch perfections, as nothing that tended to ſingularity was wanting in him. Hee was of colour bay, with legge, taile, and mane black, daintily criſped and platted with ſilke, his head litle and leane, full
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7474:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of veines and nerves, was beautified with a white ſtarre in the forehead, and adorn'd with ſhort thinne prick't up eares, and a goatiſh large ſparkling eye, his noſtrils were flaggy and ſo puft out, as there lay diſcovered to the beholders eye their fiery coloured inſides, and withall wide enough to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporate the often fumes of his proud lungs; his mouth ragged, full of thick foame ever champing on the Bitt, his neck ſhort, and eminently hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the bent of its creſt; broad and ample was his breſt, his back ſhort and dented downe to his very taile, his crupper large and fleſhy, his legges ſtraight and leane with one white foote, a ſhort paſterne with a hard, high concavous, and round huffe.</p>
                  <p>The ſight of the horſe, and the well-promiſing demeanour of the Squire that ſtood neer him, bred in the Count a curioſity of knowing his Maſters name, which after ſaluting him he dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. I am ſorry Sir, (anſwered him the Squire) that I may not obey you, but hope the command impoſed on me to conceale it, will free me from the cenſure of behaving my ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manerly to-you-wards, with this much only I can acquaint you, that he is of a remote country, and travels abroad guided by a deſperate mellancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſomething more he would have ſaid, but ſtopt his ſpeech, when hee ſaw the Count obſerve the <hi>Druide</hi> deſcending with a Gentleman in his company, who ſeemed to contend as they came, the <hi>Druide</hi> with grave geſtures, the Gentleman with vehement but humble ones. The Count thought it unfitting to intrude (as then) into their company, ſeeing them ſo ſerious in a diſcourſe (to his gheſſing) very important; but retiring behind a fir-buſh, cauſed the Squires to doe the like.</p>
                  <p>Being come before the Image, they adored it, where afterwards eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the young Knight that lay aſleepe, and obſerving him a while to their wonder, they paſſed-on farther without awaking him. What the two diſcourſed of, theſe could not over-heare, till a pretty while after, their paſſion tranſporting them to high words.</p>
                  <p>Sithence you then will not (ſaid the <hi>Druide)</hi> be ſatisfied with what's reaſon, I cannot helpe it; And doth your Highneſſe (anſwered the Gent.) call it reaſon to bee confin'd here without having regard to what you ſhould? And to what (replied hee) ſhould I have a regard to, but to my ſelfe? Mary to theſe (ſaid the other) whoſe weale and woe depends ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on your Highneſſe; or if ſo great a tye of duty cannot yet prevaile with you, (ſince you pretend to be quite ſtript of all humane affections) yet let the duty which you owe the Gods, worke ſomething on you, who preor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd you ſhould be borne a Prince, to governe the people committed to your charge, a charge which you without their conſent cannot lay by, no more than they may without your aſſent accept of any other Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lord. And thus much my duty bindes me to tell you; nor pretend I hereby to perſwade you to give over this kinde of life, which (you ſay) is ſo pleaſing unto you, though (to the end it may prove yet more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome by your continuing it without either ſcruple of conſcience or vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit) I can doe no leſſe than beſeech you to but onely returne home to comfort the King your Father; and then (having once ſetled the Realme-affaires) either to returne hither, or leade a ſolitary life there, as ſhall beſt ſuite with your liking: what the anſwer was could not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, becauſe in reſpect of their diſcoaſting them, theſe could not (being
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7474:18"/>
ſo farre off them) heare other than the confuſed ſound of their voices, ſo as the <hi>Count</hi> (become curious by reaſon of what he had heard) had now a great deſire to know who hee was, thinking the extreames to be paſſing ſtrange betweene a populous court and penſive ſolitarineſſe, a ſpacious Kingdome and an homely hermitage. Whileſt in this manner reaſoning with himſelfe he traced him with an obſervant eye, he might ſee him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken in hand a booke from under his arme, part from the Gent: who the ſame very way returned much confuſed in minde. The Count ſtepping out to goe meete him, they curteouſly ſaluted each other, and the Gent: underſtanding the manner of his landing in that Iland, bade him be of good comfort, with aſſuring him, that he could not be unſupplied with ſhipping by ſuch time as, for refreſhing himſelfe after his ſea-ſufferings, he had made a competent abode in that place, which though it were remote and but a kinde of an hermitage, was yet ſufficiently commodious to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> for which ſole end it was builded: The Count (well pleaſed to finde in ſuch a place ſuch unexpected curteſie) ſaid unto him: Me thinkes (Sir) this hermitage hath a ſociety convenient to it ſelf, which is the variety of ſites, and objects therein, that here all about are to bee ſeene, effects of induſtry and invention more than ordinary; which induce me to beleeve, that the religious Founder thereof hath faſhioned out the rongues of a ladder to heaven by theſe of a foreſeeing and quick-witted humanity, the meanes of enjoying both the one life and th' other. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not what it is that you mean (anſwered him the Gent:) ſithence that though the love to ſerve the Gods ought indeed to ſpring from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, yet beleeve I not thoſe things to be (for all that) humane, eſpecially if it be true that our election depends not immediately on us, but on him that cals us; howſoever it be, ſuch an election ſhould have wings to raiſe us to heaven without any mixture of terrene cauſes, and without making one and the ſame things ſerve both for cart and wheele. By all this meant the Gentleman the <hi>Druid</hi>'s perſon, which (becauſe the Count well conceived him not) occaſioned betweene them a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. The firſt maintain'd, that the vocation of ſuch was no true calling, who either wearied with paines-taking, or forſaken of their pleaſures, make choyce of a ſolitary life; ſuch motions proceeding neither from the ſpirit, nor from any deſire of ſerving the Gods, but either from the deſire of repoſe, or from the irkeſomneſſe of not being able to ſatisfie their own corrupt affections; which the Count oppoſing not, onely added, that the Gods call men ſundry wayes, and that that of wordly intereſſes manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted their power in converting what was ill into good. But the Gentleman (whoſe minde was tranſported with paſſion) not able to containe himſelfe within the compaſſe of generalities, ſaid unto him; And would you thinke ſuch a vocation befitting a Prince, who being tyed in duty to procure the welfare of his Father and Countrey, abandons both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, meerely out of a frantick mellancholy for his love's proving unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate. But the Count not reſolving him, but demanding ſuch an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: I will (anſwered the other) ſatisfie you willingly, hoping that you alſo will (ſince the Gods have conducted you hither) ſatisfie the honeſt deſire I have to be by you aſſiſted in ſo pious a worke, ſithence the <hi>Druide</hi> that you ſaw, is he, who (being deceived in his conceits) goes about to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7474:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cover his affects with the pretext of ſerving the Gods, pretending that charity towards himſelfe which he denies to others, like thoſe who being over-charged with debts for feare of diſincommodating themſelves, pay not one of their creditors though hee ſtarved for want of it; with this, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him gently by the hand, he proceeded.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you (kinde Sir) let us retire to yonder ſhade, where you ſhall be fully informed of our caſe and being, to the end, that knowing us you may be moved to take compaſſion of him, me, and infinite others, who beare a ſhare in his ſufferings; I am confident that you (worthy Sir) may with the authority of your reverend aſpect and preſence much further my charge, it being unpoſſible that the reverence of hoary age worke not much in a young Prince, already, by reaſon both perſwaded and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: As for time and opportunity to accompliſh it, wee ſhall not miſſe of that, it being his ordinary uſe to walke through this grove for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his bodily health, though it conduce nothing to that of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which the Count, not contradicting, leaving his Squire to accompany the other, ſate him downe by him to heare his ſtory.</p>
                  <p>The young Knight (in the meane time) over-wearied with paſt watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, continued his ſleepe, arrived-upon unexpectedly by a Lady, both for complexion, beautifull comelineſſe, and comely beauty worthy to bee numbred among the faireſt; ſhee was cloth'd in a sky-colour'd, ſilke gowne embroydered with gold and pearle, which ſhee wore after the faſhion moſt uſed by Nymphes, tuck'd up with a rich girdle about her ſlender waſte, ſo as there lay diſcovered to the eye her ſilvered buskins, faſtned with tyes of riband, which in the form e of leaves encircled in the mid'ſt of them a litle roſe of diamonds; her breſt ſparingly diſcovered, diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not elſe-where the beholders ſight, but engroſſed it wholly to it ſelf, without giving it any occaſion to repent it's employment; the parts ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to excellencie and defect indifferently appearing; her haire neatly ſmooth'd but diſhevelled, made diſorder become ſo ſeemely and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that never any order could boaſt of ſuch paſſing ſeemlineſſe: There encompaſſed them for honour (for, for ornament themſelves were their ſole adorners) a gay and odoriferous garland: Her dainty hands (the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous hookes of hearts) diſcovered tranſparently, how ſlender-boned they were, fleſh'd tender, ſoft, and almoſt unpalpable; exquiſitely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned and long, delicately hilly, and laſciviouſly dimpled, adorned with golden bracelets, interlaced with claſpes that hooked together hearts inlaid with diamonds. Shee was thither come all alone, carrying with her a basket of Roſes, and in a little ſilver veſſell quick embers. The ſight of the Knight ſtaid her not from adorning with her flowres the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe and her little one, nor yet from burning ſome of her ſweete incenſe, the odoriferous fume wherofawoke him; ſo as riſing from off the ground, and gazing on her with aſtoniſhment, he could hardly (as hee had reaſon for it) beleeve himſelfe; opening therefore his eyes better (and then yet more fixed in his errour) hee opened their fluces, and with a flood of teares, burſt her out theſe ſpeeches.</p>
                  <p>Oh with what words ſhould I thanke you, the Lady of my life, <hi>Liarta,</hi> who having already but too much obliged mee whilſt you liv'd a mortall, are (now that you are celeſtiall) come to undoe me with your unmerita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Which ſaid, he (rapt with a conjugall love) ran to embrace her, which ſhee avoyding, hee ſpake on; And will you not then (deare life of my ſoule) permit mee to claſpe you in my unfortunate armes? No: I am ſure you cannot, for I know you to be unpalpable; yet let me enfold and hold within the circle of my armes this faite Image, which though dead to the world, lives yet in the center of my heart; with that offering againe to embrace her, and ſhee ſhunning him as before.</p>
                  <p>I perceive it is not then true (proceeded he) that to the bleſſed ſpirits, together with the affects of vertue, doth (for their greater bliſſe and glory) remaine the memory of things paſt; for then (I am ſure) you would not have forgotten your <hi>Almadero:</hi> Or was there perhaps together with your mortall body buried my immortall love, as unworthy to be bleſt with you in heaven, to make me onely among all upon earth moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and unfortunate? What! are ſoules dumbe, or can they not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh words as well as repreſent perſonages? But (be it as it be will) I am ſure I ſee you, in whoſe faire countenance I yet diſcerne the lillies I ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed; but ah! what is become of the roſes? alas! death hath gathered them off. Which the Lady with a beck of her head denying, and gently ſmiling, ſhewed him thoſe of the Goddeſſe. When hee (being now come to himſelfe ſomewhat better) perceived ſhee was not indeede the ſame he beleeved her to be, and would therefore have craved her humble pardon, but ſo ſuddenly loſt both his ſpeech and conceit, that hee could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his intent.</p>
                  <p>Shee that attentively had obſerved him in all his deportments, and no leſſe liking his perſon than pittying his paſſion, returned him this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. I am not (gentle Sir) the Lady you take me for, ſince I have a reall body, am yet a woman and live; nor enjoy I ought that is celeſtiall, ſave the ſole hope of this Goddeſſe. I am very ſorry that I awoke you, and crave you pardon for it, but being come hither expreſſely to adore the Goddeſſe, I could doe no leſſe than offer her my accuſtomed oblations.</p>
                  <p>The Knight with a greedy eye examining in her all thoſe beauties that in a faire woman could be deſired, (diſpenſing withall now, if not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, his loyall affection to his <hi>Liarta)</hi> makes her this reply.</p>
                  <p>The favour (faire Lady) that I receive from you, is of it ſelfe too great to be merited, without the unexpreſſible addition of theſe your-to-me-too-too-courteous ſatisfactions: yet wonder I not thereat, knowing that as the Gods extend not their liberality unto us according to our dignity, but conformable to their abundant benignity, ſo cannot thoſe divine beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of yours, chooſe but participate of the ſelfe ſame nature, which if when unimployed it excell the loftieſt imaginations, will (no doubt) when it is well imployed ſurpaſſe all humane merit; both curteſie and beauty in you with equall pace march on to exeedingneſſe; ſo as I being too feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed to behold the ſhining ſplendor of the one, am dazled with the glit-Tering rayes of the other, nor can I poſſibly correſpond with any parity an imparity ſo diſcorreſpondent; for, having beene already dazled with the like beames, I finde my ſelfe ſo weake-ſighted, that my very intellect being, together with my ſenſes and optick organs enfeebled, cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7474:20"/>
nor fully diſcern the good which in its ill it receiveth: yet will I not (for all that) forbeare to acknowledge, meerely out of my being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the greatneſſe of your merits, how deeply I am engaged unto you; to the end you may both know mee to be yours, and withall (ſo you bee pleaſed ſo much to honour mee) declare me being ſuch for your Knight and ſervant.</p>
                  <p>The Lady (who by nature was endued with a vivacity diſpoſed to a pawze-not-intermitting-motion) impatient at ſo long a diſcourſe, would gladly have many times interrupted him, being inclin'd rather to ſpeake than heare; but reſtrain'd or rather curb'd by a certaine unknowne force, ſhee ſtood patiently-ſilent, no otherwiſe than doth a generous Courſer, who though hee bite and champe the Bit, refuſeth not (for all that) to obey his rider. The ſight of this gentle Knight diſliked her not, though ſhee yet liked not well the paſſion of his old affection, ſo as making as though ſhee meant to turne from him with an odde kinde of betweene an amorous and diſdainefull looke, ſhee would oft move her lips, eyes, and body in the action of parting, whilſt part yet ſhee neither could nor would.

                  <p>Sir Knight (ſaid ſhee) the freeneſſe of your ſpeech, and your language it ſelfe ſpeake you a ſtranger, in reſpect whereof though you have not a litle offended mee, yet judge I you worthy of both excuſe and pardon: For know (Sir) that wives live in this Countrey ſubject to lawes not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, whilſt husbands live after the particular lawes of their owne paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate-unjuſt wils; Indeede the maids that live free from them, obſerve no other law than that common one of honeſty, conſerving themſelves (like ſtarres in all aſpects) intirely beautifull; whereas the married women have their wanes in the aſpects of their husbands, from whom proceede both their light and the manner of uſing it: For my part (Sir) I am a married woman, and though living in a Countrey favourable to women, yet with a husband disfavourable to a wife; his age and my youth, his jealouſie and my honeſty, with other contrary conditions (which for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſties cauſe I conceale) have occaſioned many wanes, but many more eclipſes to my liberty; your thus-entertaining mee therefore with private conference is ſo farre from ſteeding mee, that on the contrary it would much prejudice me, if any body but ſaw you here with me, ſince your qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities aſwell by women as by men will ever preſuppoſe arguments of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition, if not of blame, eſpecially in regard of me, who (for many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects) might have reaſon to love any other than the Prince my husband. As for your courteous proffers, I lovingly thanke you for them, and to rid from you all ſuſpition of my being diſcourteous unto you, I kindly and gratefully accept your good will, and ſo commending you to the Gods, I am gone: Yet as though ſhee had beene nayled to the earth, ſtirr'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a foote, but ſtanding with her eyes immoveably fixt on thoſe of the Knight, ſeemed to expect rather a reply than a farewell.</p>
                  <p>Behold wee <hi>Liarta,</hi> before ſo heavily ſighed for, now quite forgotten, yea and of a ſpirit once reputed conſtant; the aſhes (in fine) burne not, they are no more than the memorials and markes of an extinguiſh'd fire, and

death is no progreſſe but an end of love, whoſe object are neither carcaſſes nor buried bones, but a living body, the rather if it be well featured and much more if accompanied with a gentle minde, nay though it be ſuch as participates of neither, yet ſhall it ſuffice that it be endued with affecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons proportionate to the nature or (at leaſtwiſe to the) imagination of the lover. But to thee deceaſed <hi>Liarta</hi> what imports all this? who if thou haſt now no more beeing (as fooles argue) thou haſt ſurely then no organs to expreſſe thy griefe by; or if thou liveſt (as 'tis moſt certaine thou doſt) then queſtionleſſe thy preſent beeing (freed from the rags of fleſh) cares no more for our materialities; but being united to that firſt eſſence, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes in a pure way of action the purity of actions, loathing now what it formerly loved in the materiall beeing of thy ſences, ſo that ſince there now remaines with thee no other love, than ſuch as wholly conformes it ſelfe with the effect of the ſpirit and vertue, thou ſcorne and abhorreſt the other; and now that thou art bleſſed, griev'ſt onely, that hee (being yet earthly and mud) doth wallow ſo in earth. But returne wee now to the Knight, who by the words &amp; actions of the Princeſſe was fatally caught, inſomuch as quite altering his purpoſe and deſignes, hee (reſolved now both to love and waite on her) thus beſpake her.</p>
                  <p>The heavens forbid (Madame) that I who was borne to ſerve you, ſhould ever be the occaſion of your leaſt diſcontent. The duty of a <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> is not to eaſe but to remove and rid the afflicted from miſery. How then can I endure, that you ſo deſerving ſhould be ſo unworthily dealt withall, whilſt I more than any other am obliged to procure your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? It was no vulgar fortune (ſweeteſt Madame) that conducted mee hither, but that eternall <hi>moderatrix,</hi> to the end your wants might by my meanes be ſupplied, ſince Nature made mee a King to attempt it, dignity a Knight to effect it, and love an Orator to crave it at the hands of your promiſing-goodneſſe: Let not your husbands jealouſie any whit diſmay you, for I will protect you both against him and all the world. Yet if you will not either credit or favour mee for the preſent, vouchſafe then (I beg of you) to command my ſtay here, till ſuch time as after being aſcertained of both my quality and affection, you may be pleaſed by accepting my ſervice, to favour my deſires.</p>
                  <p>The title of King wrought on the Princeſſe inclination as much (if not more) than the beauty and youth of this young Knight, but eſpying (with that) from a farre off the ſervants that came for her; My Lord (ſaid ſhee) the time permits mee not to anſwer you, ſee yonder where my folke come, I pray you let them not ſee you, but lay your ſelfe downe diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as you were. For the reſt, ſince I may not pretend any authority over you, you may doe what ſuites beſt with your owne liking.</p>
                  <p>The Knight well comprehending that theſe ſpeeches tended not to a refuſall (to obey her) ſquatted cloſe to the ground, following her never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe with his eyes as farre as hee could ſee her, and fixing her ſhape and geſture ſo deepe in his thoughts, as hee had not for a good while the power to get up, affording thereby leiſure to the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> (whom we left ſitting under the trees ſhade) to finiſh their diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>By this time they two were retired to a place, whence they might (for doubt of being ſurprized by the <hi>Druide)</hi> ſee him as hee returned; and the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7474:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Squires having withdrawne themſelves, afforded them the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and leiſure of ſpeaking freely; whereupon the other (loſing no time) ſaid unto the Count; I ſhall (noble Sir) recite you the ſtrangeſt ſtory that ever you heard or read of; wherein you may obſerve truely miſerable effects, occaſioned by youthfull paſſions, imaginations that corrupt health, mellancholy that phyſick abhorres, and in theſe the occaſion too that I have to finde my ſelfe agreeved: Be then (Sir) pleaſed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that among the Royall and Soveraigne Scepter-ſwayers of no leſſe faire than fertile <hi>Albion,</hi> one of them is entitled King of <hi>Venedotia,</hi> who by a faire and vertuous wife had iſſue three ſonnes and two daughters, whoſe comlineſſe of perſonage and ſurpaſſing beauties were ſuch, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Iland for theſe endowments beareth away the bell from all the people of the world, and <hi>Venedotia</hi> from the reſt of the whole Iland, yet did the Royall Houſe as farre againe ſurpaſſe that way all the Families of that Kingdome, as the condition of a Subject is exceeded by one who borne to ſuperiority, beares the Royall thereof, which are titles and Crownes. The elder they waxed in yeares the more grew they (though borne all of one and the ſame body, and ſprung all from one and the ſame ſeede, to differ in qualities, affections, and inclinations, to falſifie the common <hi>tenent,</hi> that <hi>arguments of the body can determine any ones wit and diſpoſition:</hi> vertues and vices being here individually devided; inſomuch, as, looke what portion of good was owned by ſome of them, even ſo much poſſeſſed the others of evill, and becauſe there was a diſparity in the number, badneſſe would (without any nay) ſeize on the greater part, ſo as two of them being wholly inclined to vertue, the other three gave themſelves altogether over to all lewdneſſe and diſhoneſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The bringing up of them was in every reſpect equall, or if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, yet but ſo much unequall or different as was due to the difference of the diſequality of the ſexes, ſince for the reſt, as time, direction, and yeares, the one enjoyed not any priviledge more than the other: Their vertuous Father thinking it unfitting to bee partiall in the breeding of his children, ſithence Nature had given them him without partialitie in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into the world.</p>

For the firſt remedy, hee determined to ſhunne her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, without taking on him to conceive her deſignes; ſo as hee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ride a hunting, but without her company; whereat when he ſaw her grieve, he excuſed himſelf with diſplaying before her the inconvenience that time had laid before his conſideration, how that a Princeſſe ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoed betweene hunters and ſavage beaſts, incurr'd continually manifeſt hazard of her life; beſeeching her therefore to ſtay at home; or if ſhee would needs goe, he wiſh'd it might be when her mother and ſiſter went. This ſo over-chary circumſpection pleaſed not well <hi>Gelinda,</hi> eſpecially when ſhee once penetrated into the cauſe thereof. And hee on the other ſide (ſeeing that obſtinate courteſie is wont to argue diſcourteouſly in who-ſo denies to accept it) knew not how to diſenvelop himſelfe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by the hope he had of weaning her from it by litle &amp; litle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcontenting her.</p>

Having therefore called before him the <hi>Prince,</hi> he ſhewed him the corps, with asking him if he had ſlaine him: but ſeeing him deny it in away that argued ſomewhat of guiltineſſe, he ſaid unto him; he that makes no ſcruple to murther a Brother, will ſurely make no great conſcience to tell a lye: the blood that at thy appearing gurled out of this wound, both convicts thee, and requires at my hands <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> which I will not deny it; Onely I am ſorry that thy quality (in conſideration of my ſelfe) permits thee no other executioner; with this, ſnatching out his ſword (not as yet wiped fully dry from the blood of his Brother) hee ranne it in his heart; and then (cauſing them to be laid in two coffins) he ſtrictly commanded, that this tragicall caſe might dye with his ſonnes; charging all that knew it, to give out, that they were ſick, and three dayes after dead of a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall fever.</p>
                  <p>Well might the feare of offending the King tye mens tongues (which are ſubject to ſenſe) but not their judgements, which being internall and free, enjoy the priviledges of a free exemption from any humane domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But the beſt was, that the Kingdome made no great reckoning of the loſſe of either, both of them being by their behaviour growne to be as unworthy of bemoaning as of life. But now the Siſter (good ſoule) the innocent occaſion of the evill, could not be either comforted or quieted, till her Father permitted her to retire to the Ile of <hi>Man,</hi> where under the diſcipline of certaine religious perſons there reſiding, ſhee dedicated the reſt of her dayes to a contemplative life. Onely <hi>Feredo</hi> now remain'd of the youngeſt the eldeſt, and his ſo being the ſole ſonne had more endeer'd him to his Father, if his other worthy qualities had not beene more ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and reſpect worthy, than his being an onely Sonne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gelinda</hi> (having underſtood the true tragick ſtory of her Brother (mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified her ſelfe a litle, or at leaſtwiſe ſomewhat depreſt the growing fire of her affection from ſuggeſting occaſion of more diſgrace: till ſeeing <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redo</hi> increaſing together with his yeares, in comelineſſe of perſon, vertue, and the love of all, ſhee deemed it very inconvenient for her to faulter in her affection. Baniſhing therefore from her memory the ſufferings and ſhame of her Royall Houſe, which till then taught her to be cautelous if not honeſt, ſhee began to proſecute her deſires anew, with ſuch fervent affection and winning-allurements, that the Fort of <hi>Feredo</hi>'s conſtant goodneſſe remain'd therewith ſhaken if not battered. But becauſe in him goodneſſe prevail'd more than youth, and continencie more than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing baites of an enchanting love; he purpoſed (for clipping the wings of her inceſtuous hope) to goe live farre off her, praying his Fathers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7474:22"/>
thereunto, under pretext of going to travell, which hee no ſooner ask'd than obtain'd; for, the good old King (having noted his Daughters inceſtuous affection, and fearing the ariſing thence of ſome new accidents) found his abſence for ſome time to bee to purpoſe, hoping that time would in that while dry up in her that ill humour with the medicine of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, or ſome other new affections eaſie to be exchanged for old, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially (as hee imagined) in the inconſtant nature of that amorous ſex.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Gelinda</hi> more conſtant than the vertue of conſtancie permitted her, obſtinate in retaining her firſt deſignes, and reſolved either to die or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute <hi>Feredo</hi> from a brother to a lover; emboldened with her illegitimate love, and raiſed by her mortiferous reſolution within a degree of the height of impudence, taking him from the company of ſome young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that entertained him in diſcourſe, and conducting him in her hand to the garden, ſhee thus beſpake him.</p>
                  <p>I hold it (my Lord and Prince) a thing ſuperfluous, to conſume the ſmall time I have to ſtay with you, in any other than a free and briefe language: ſithence neither the growth of yeares have beene ſufficient to give you notice of my affection, nor the late tragedy of our Brothers ſerv'd for a preſident to mollifie you, which me thinkes it ſhould, if not for my loves ſake, yet (at leaſt) for the honour of our Father, our Houſe, and our ſelves: you are now going to travell, for not having mee neere you, and conceit (perhaps) by ſo doing to ſhunne me; but (alas) you much deceive your ſelfe; for I am reſolved, not onely to be neere you, but alſo cloſely to cleave to you, as doth your inſeparable <hi>Genius</hi> or ſhadow; and if by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence you diſcoaſt or avoide me, I will then ſo accoaſt and haunt you, as (doe what you can) you ſhall not ſhake me off; for, if it lye in the power of ſpirits to doe it, mine then perpetually ſhall doe it, ſince you will not permit my ſelfe to enjoy ſo much happineſſe; Pity mee! oh! (I beſeech you) pitie me, that without you am worſe than nothing: nor let the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of my love ſerve you for an excuſe; for I ſweare by the immortall Gods, that if you quite reject and abandon mee, I will when I am ſo ſcorn'd or hated, transforme me into a Fury, &amp; will haunt you whitherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you goe, nor will I (ſo it be within the reach of my power) ſuffer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any other woman to enjoy you more than I.</p>
                  <p>Strucken dumbe remain'd <hi>Feredo</hi> with this ſo raſh and diſhoneſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; about her eyes (as kindled embers) hee obſerved a deadly blewiſh paleneſſe, arguing a mortall rancor and gaſtly deſpaire; well knew he that neither reproach nor reproofe was able to terrifie one that feared not to dye, nor was hee leſſe confident of her deſperately-bold haſte, which might eaſily raiſe her reſolution to ſuch a hight of frantick deſperateneſſe, as ſhee would not ſtick to kill her ſelfe; holding it therefore his ſafer courſe rather to ſhunne than hazard a certaine miſchiefe, hee return'd her this milde anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Deere Lady and Siſter, the love which I beare you is ſuch, that if you knew it, you would then know you had no cauſe to thinke your ſelfe ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved; I intend to part ('tis true) not to <hi>elong</hi> my ſelfe from you, but to be more worthily neere you, when the heavens ſhall be pleaſed to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour my returne. Love (deere Siſter mine) is not to bee required with hate, (as you ſeeme to doubt of) eſpecially by me towards you, whom I

(for many ſpeciall reaſons) am bound both to love and ſerve; all then that I begge of you, is, that (abandoning your paſſions) you unite your ſelfe to reaſon, which can of it ſelfe alone give you on my behalfe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſatisfaction. Doe then but diſcreetly remember (ſweete Siſter) who wee are, and what the name of a Brother imports in nature, law, and uſe; and next call to mind and conſider the miſerable end of the others, which ſhould ſerve us for an example, not of imitation, but of deteſtation and horrour. Grant mee (I lovingly beſeech you) your good leave to be gone on my intended journey, ſince I deſire it may be with your free aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and good liking. And to the end you may reſt fully aſſured of my true affection towards you, I here faithfully promiſe, that if it come to my hands to diſpoſe of you (my Father not preventing me for manifeſting my brotherly affection to you that way) I will ſpend all the Royall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yea and my very Crowne beſides, but I will ſee you well ſetled to your owne hearts deſire.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this the King calling him hee left her, preparing himſelfe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the morrow following his journey towards the Kingdome of <hi>Logria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſhee (to whom brotherly admonitions were reproaches, courteous language abuſes, and promiſes of a rich dowry an unappealeable ſentence of death) putting on a manly courage, and laying aſide all appearance of griefe, could ſo farre temper nay command her paſſion, as with unbeteared eyes to ſee him at parting, yea to ſalute him, and bid him her laſt farewell; and that in ſo free a way too, as made him thinke her an altogether altered woman; whereby he became ſo conſolated, as hee could not refraine at his departing to drop ſome teares for meere unlook'd for joy, though gaz'd on by all the Ladies that ſtood by her, and accompanied (a good while on his way) by the flowre of the Nobility. But no ſooner loſt ſhee once the ſight of him, than that ſhee remained as a ſtatue cold, ſenſeleſſe, and immoveable: Recovered out of her ſtupifying fit, ſhee retir'd to her bed-chamber too too delicious (God wote) for a ſceane of ſo lugubrous an act. The returne of ſuch as had ſent <hi>Feredo</hi> on his way was the paſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell that rang out her knill of death, the recommendations ſent her from him, ſhee received with diſdaine and contempt: and then preſently (not having the patience or power to ſtay till night) ſhee put off her cloathes and laid her downe; where being (as ſhee thought) all alone, ſhee burſt forth into theſe termes.</p>
                  <p>It is now time <hi>Gelinda</hi> for thee to free thy ſelfe from the tyrannie of thy inſulting enemy [Love] 'tis high time that thou now revenge thy ſelfe on this thy neither brother nor lover. Come, thou muſt die, and that's no newes to thee; death ſhall not ſeize on thee at unawares. Thou ſhalt have the oddes of the reſt of mortals, in being thy ſelfe thine owne Iudge, ſo freeing thy ſelfe both from the judgement of others, and from the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diverſities of deaths, being conditions that make unexpected death looke on the dying wretch with an aſpect ſo fearefull and horrid. A great ſpirit as thine is will flight it, to be by it cruelly revenged on him, that no leſſe cruelly than ungratefully hath injured thee. This ſaid, ſhee would have kill'd her ſelfe, but thinking it too ſhort a preamble for ſo dolefull an end, her deſpairing ſoule roaring from within her with an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and gaſtly noyſe, ſhee proceeded.</p>

But ah me! if this were true, ſure then I had never beene borne; for if among all the things that I am none of, there had beene but one, that in privation of being, had exceeded the not being of others, then ſurely that ſame one thing had beene <hi>Gelinda.</hi> Therefore <hi>Gelinda</hi> (to her greater anguiſh) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves that ſuch a thing cannot be.

More ſhee would have ſaid, when one of her women (that all this while had attentively obſerved her) ranne towards the bed; at the firſt trampling noiſe of whoſe feere <hi>Gelinda</hi> ſtab'd her ſelfe under the left pap, with a long ſilver bodkin, where with ſhee uſed to righten her haire, but by her deſtined for this fatall effect, which ſucceeded her deſire ſo well (if a man may ſay well in ſo ill a caſe) that ſlipping betweene her ribs, it pierced her heart; which prov'd now as tender to the force of hand, as it had before done to the dart of love.</p>
                  <p>The Gentlewoman that faw no ſignes of any violence done, and by conſequence, not ſuſpecting any ſuch matter, did the beſt ſhee could to comfort her, till (ſeeing ſhee could get no anſwer of her) ſhee opened the windowes, and then ſeeing her looke ſo pale, ſhee was againe amazed; yet finding no drop of blood about her (though her lips and eyes looked of a pale blewiſh colour) ſhee gently tooke her by the hand, and reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively kiſſing it, beſought her to ſpeake one word to her, but was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a gaſtly grone, wherewith ſhee expired, becauſe of her wounded heart's being by then quite ſuffocated with blood.</p>
                  <p>The Gentlewoman ſearching over her body a-new, and yet finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, (conſidering that the occaſion of her death was not to be divulged) ſhut the doore, and went and acquainted therewith the King; who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee could not beleeve that ſhee died without violence, commanded to view her better, himſelfe caſting (the meane while) an eye on her pulſes and paps, under one whereof as hee more heedfully obſerved, hee came to diſcover the bodkin by a litle blood that trickled off the orifice of the wound; and ſo comprehending the cauſe of her death, he charged that no words ſhould be made thereof, giving out the morrow following, that ſhee was dead of an apoplexie.</p>

                  <p>One ſole Daughter had he of ſome eighteene yeares of age, named <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite;</hi> for beauty ſingular among the faireſt; and one ſonne (as then abſent) addicted to exerciſes of Chivalry. No ſooner was <hi>Feredo</hi> ſeene by her, than that ſhee began to affect him, ſeconding her Fathers ſecret deſigne with an honeſt open love: and the correſpondencie (as it was fitting it ſhould) had beene by him as forwardly repaid her, but that at his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither he began ſuddenly to feele ſtrange paſſions of mellancholy; which (tranſporting him to turbid imaginations) would never ſuffer him
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7474:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in quiet, for that he thought hee ſaw <hi>Gelinda</hi> every houre in an horrid ſhape with a naked and bloody breſt ſettle her ſelfe by him, whether hee were laid in bed or walking any where abroad, ſo as he paſſed moſt nights without cloſing his eyes; which made him deſire to watch with merry company, who upon his corrupted affects wrought juſt ſuch an effect, as doth one ſingle drop of water on one tormented with a burning feaver, that thinkes all the rivers of the world too litle either to coole his heate, or quench his thirſt.</p>
                  <p>Many a time have I thought upon theſe viſions, whether any ſuch really be or no, and whether that which appeared was the very ſpirit of <hi>Gelinda,</hi> or nothing but the meere imagination of <hi>Feredo.</hi> For if the Gods permit the dead to walke, why more for hatred than for love, ſince we heare not (for the moſt part) of any ſuch apparitions, ſave in the likeneſſe of ſuch as have come to their deaths by violent meanes? betweene husband and wife, father and ſonne, brother and brother, and friend and friend (in whom Nature and long practice imprint reciprocall affections with greater efficacie) wee ſeldome or never heare of any ſuch, though they ſhould be ordinary. Which though they alſo were, yet could they then neither be no arguments making for imagination, and uſe would diſcover unto us thoſe of reaſon, Nature being not able to worke ordinarily by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary reaſons, contrary to it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The Count who attentively liſtned, ſeeing him looke as if he expected an anſwer, ſaid unto him: Nature (gentle Sir) cannot give a reaſon for all things, as (it ſeemes) you expect it ſhould, ſince we have for attaining to it onely the two meanes of the practick and ſpeculation. By the practick we cannot, ſhee requiring time, and we being ſhort-liv'd. By ſpeculation much leſſe, ſhe never ſoaring higher than the pitch of ſenſe. Hence comes it, that our common knowledge (obſcure even in things manifeſt) is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the cenſure of contradictions, where of ſuch as were Antagoniſts chooſed for the ſurer ſide, rather to doubt of all, than to affirme any thing for certaine out of the uncertainty of our underſtanding; and the ſame knowledge, though in much deceivable, is yet nevertheleſſe embraced for want of a better, which well may (I beleeve) be hoped for, but not found by the meanes of humane organs without a long and almoſt eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>
                  <p>If then we be ſo ignorant in things ſubject to our very ſenſes, what can we be in thoſe of the ſoule abſtracted from them? yet ſhould not (for all this) the inſufficiencie of meanes of attaining to the knowledge of things make us deny their effects, if any be; and yet the curioſity of ſeeking out for them is hurtfull, becauſe ſpeculation too much ſubtilized makes a man unfit not only for the active, but even for the contemplative life; ſo as if he be but ſhort in conceiving the firſt heads, he becomes quite dull by that time he comes to the ſecond; ſo blunted ſhall hee finde his intellect with the hardneſſe of what hee underſtands not; therefore a mans choyſer courſe were to reſt at quiet, and to beleeve that which common opinion both drawne from all the lawes, and approved by all the prime School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the world in all ages, induceth us to beleeve; which if otherwiſe it were not ſo, this Prince his very caſe might be a ſufficient argument for it. Since hee was in perfect health when he came from home, nor was he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7474:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ever troubled with any infirmity of his fancie, till after the death of his Siſter, and then too without knowing whether ſhee were dead or no. So as we muſt of neceſſity, either deny all, and by conſequence make the Prince a lyar; or in beleeving him, beleeve the generall terient, which is a reall apparition of the dead, a beleefe due to the obedience of the Lawes.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman that ſtood liſtning unto him, litle ſatisfied with what was alleadged, and loath to let the diſcourſe fall, replied. My doubt (ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd Sir) neither toucheth nor arrives to the law, but is (as I may ſay) an abſtract from it; touch it perhaps it might, if it were incorporated with it, and partaked of its ſubſtance and colour, as wine doth with thoſe of water. The lawes have all of them the ſelfe ſame principals and the ſelfe ſame ends (at leaſtwiſe in appearance) that is, God and <hi>good dealing</hi> or piety, the end of this is to feare thoſe. It will not be denied mee, that apparitions belong to piety, and by conſequence make wonderfully for it: my doubt doth but queſtion the power of Nature; for, if Nature could but be united or conform'd to the Law in things ſupernaturall, and that what the one affirmes might be viſually proved by the other, then had neither wee occaſion to doubt, nor the Lawes to multiply as they have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hitherunto done; ſo as all that I ſay, is, but to attempt their union, (if it may be) if not, I rather retire to the Law, being well aſſured that in ſo doing I cannot erre, though the intellect remaine (for all that) ſubject to be ſnapp'd at by its naturall enemy [ignorance.] Let it not then (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you courteous Sir) offend you, that I ſay, that the denying of the effects of things (when any ſuch really are) is but an ignorant preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now our queſtion is, whether any ſuch be or no: but how can they be, if neither reaſon nor ſenſe comprehend them? Nature ſhewes them us not, the intellect conceives them not, the relations of them are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, &amp; the Prince his example abſolutely concludes them not; conclude them perhaps it might, had he not knowne his Siſters intention. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe imaginations cannot be fully illuſtrated otherwiſe than imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I will fall againe to my ſtory.</p>

pleaſures, but becauſe he (conſidering to how many dangers travell was ſubject unto) would gladly firſt have ſeene a ſonne of his owne, to ſecure the ſucceſſion, in caſe the heavens diſpoſed of him otherwiſe than well. Looking therefore with a no leſſe judicious than amorous eye into the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and affection of the faire <hi>Alite,</hi> he thought himſelfe bound to aſſure her as much as by words could be expreſs'd, of the gratefull correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of his re-affection, entitling himſelfe her Knight and ſervant.</p>
                  <p>The night following aroſe a tempeſt ſo cruell, that at the ayre's being filled with haile, thunder, and lightning, the better halfe of the Citie was burnt amidſt a deluge of water, and the innocent <hi>Alite</hi> ſtrucken with a thunder-bolt, found on the morrow in her naked bed converted to aſhes. The deſolation of the Court, the griefe of the King, the complaint of the Queene, and the ruine of ſo faire a Citie, would have moved even Tigers to compaſſion; and <hi>Feredo</hi> that thought himſelf the ſole cauſe of all theſe diſaſters, &amp; raving exceedingly thereat, baniſhing all further hope of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or content, abandoning his ſervants, and all that ever he had ſecretly ſtole away from this deſtroyed Citie, when poaſting to the next haven, hee ſuddenly embarked himſelfe on the firſt ſhip that launched out, which was bound for <hi>Gallicia,</hi> whence travelling whither fortune carried him, he came to <hi>Catalonia,</hi> making his firſt reſidence in the Citie of <hi>Barcelona.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To acquaint you with his deſignes or intentions for parting from <hi>Logria</hi> ſo unaccompanied and unattended, and wherefore thence to <hi>Gallicia</hi> and ſo to <hi>Catalonia,</hi> without any regard of his quality, or determinate end of his intentions, would prove but ſuperfluous, nor are you to expect of mee any reaſon for it; for that deſperation and love worke not by any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or orderly meanes.</p>
                  <p>Scarce was hee come, when eyed by the <hi>Catalan</hi> Prince, and in him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his diſpoſition, and a certaine majeſtie, farre different if not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his then preſent-ſeeming fortune; a humour tooke that Prince to have him (for certaine ends of his) to the ſervice of the Princeſſe his wife, and <hi>Feredo</hi> (thinking thereby to vaile himſelfe from the eyes of both the world and fortune) willingly accepted of the proffer. Become ſo from a Prince a ſubject, and from an onely ſonne a <hi>punie</hi> ſervant, ſealed this <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis</hi> with his name, which hee by altering <hi>Feredo</hi> into <hi>Calaplo,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured with his preſent condition to raze out the memory of his paſt misfortunes; hoping to appeaſe at full his Siſters Ghoſt with the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch a penance: Wherein (for now ſeeing himſelfe no more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented) hee grew to be ſo confirm'd, as he reſolved with himſelfe never to returne home more, conceiting that very place to be ſubject more than any other to the influence of his horrible viſions.</p>
                  <p>Few moneths had he continued in that Court, when <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> (for ſo was the Prince called) taking him with one other Gentleman and a Gentlewoman in his company, went with his wife on pilgrimage to the Temple of the Goddeſſe <hi>Iuno,</hi> in the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountaines. That Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe was one of the faireſt and moſt vertuous Ladies of the world; but for antipathy of qualities extreamely hated of her husband, who being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to rid himſelfe of her, intended to have her ſlaine in thoſe Mountains, and then by procuring at the ſelfe ſame time the death or flight of <hi>Calaplo,</hi> to make the world beleeve, that ſhee being enamoured of him, was runne
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7474:26"/>
away with him, hoping this report would bee the rather beleeved in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his comelineſſe and bodily perfections, and much more, for that hee having beene with mortall paſſions wooed by the faireſt and nobleſt Dames of all that Kingdome, had (poore as hee ſeemed to be) rejected great fortunes in marriage, which (would be thought) hee did meerely for the correſpondencie of affection, hee hoped for at the hands of the Princeſſe <hi>Eleina,</hi> a worthy occaſion of ſlighting that of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>But come to the Temple, and conſidering that two murthers could not (without great danger) be committed in one and the ſame time, hee gave <hi>Calaplo</hi> a litle wallet ſtuff'd full of Coyne and Iewels, brought thither (it ſhould ſeeme) for that purpoſe, together with a menacing charge contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a few words, but concluding, that without any reply he ſhould take it, and get him gone ſo farre as hee might never be more ſeene nor heard of. Hee not imagining the occaſion of it, knowing the Prince to be no leſſe miſchievous than cruell, and therefore doubting leſt his denying to take the wallet might prove dangerous unto him, thought it his beſt courſe to obey him; ſo as taking it with prompt obedience from before him, hee ſet himſelfe onwards on his way which the Prince himſelfe had ſhewed him. But paſſing the day following from mountaine to mountaine, and chancing to ſee in a deep bottome that vallied a ſteeper precipice, a bare-foote and bare-legg'd woman weeping, (whom upon better obſervance hee diſcovered to be the Princeſſe) which as he thought to turne back to ſuccour, he was ſet upon by three (as he then thought) high-way theeves, but were indeede man-butchers ſent purpoſely thither (for ought I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve) by the Prince; whereof hee having at the firſt blow laid one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long at his feete, and with the ſight thereof put the ſecond to flight, the third remaining alone, thought to ſave himſelfe by the nimbleneſſe of his heeles, till <hi>Calaplo</hi> being now juſtly enraged, by obſtinately purſuing him, overtooke him (after a full leagues race) with a blow ſo mortall, that depriving him both of ſpeech and breath, hee could make no anſwer to any thing he asked him. Endeavouring to returne to the Princeſſe, hee could by no poſſible meanes finde out either her, or the place where hee had left her; but reſolved to leave no where thereabouts unſearched for her, and comming by chance (as hee enquired for her all about) to the ſea-ſhore, he had tidings of her by certaine fiſher-men, who had ſeene her (a-farre off) made a prize by Pirats. Whereupon reputing himſelfe a compend of miſerie, and conceiting that he could not chooſe but infect with his very preſence all ſuch as he ſhould ever but converſe withall; he reſolved with himſelfe at laſt (after he had beſtowed in the ſearch of her foure other moneths in <hi>Africk,</hi> where moſt Pirats have ther reſidence) to retire to ſome-where farre remote from his native home, and there to end the remnant of his dayes. Croſſing over therefore into <hi>Sicily,</hi> hee thence arrived into this litle Iland, and judging it commodious for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, hee by the permiſſion of the Prince of <hi>Feacia,</hi> (who is Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) made this his reſting place, reducing it which before was ſavage, into the ſtate you at this preſent finde it in, beſtowing therein the beſt part of his time to withdraw his minde from more noyſome fancies.</p>
                  <p>The King his Father thus deprived of five children, three of them come to untimely ends, a fourth dedicated to the Gods, and the fifth a

loſt childe, whom (after hee had cauſed him to be ſought for, though in vaine, over the greater part of the knowne world) hee had utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of ever hearing any newes of, had he not beene conſolated with new hopes, ſpringing from the voluntary proffers of certain Knights, who bound themſelves by ſolemne oath never to returne home, unleſſe they found him out, or heard certaine newes what became of him: which comming to the eares of others, the company increaſed to the number of fifty (where of I am one) dividing (by unanimous aſſent) our ſelves over all the Countries of the world, with order to ſend and give intelligence at a place by us agreed on, for that end. Fortune would ſo have it that I found him out, though to my as yet but ſmall comfort: for though the King will be glad to heare that he lives, yet will he be extreamely ſorry, when hee underſtands that hee will not returne home, he pretending to paſſe here a bleſſed life, and thinking the ſhades of theſe trees here to be the <hi>Elizean</hi> fields, for having never ſeene here abouts any apparition of <hi>Gelinda.</hi> And alleadging withall, that ſince he is reſolved never to marry, his returne would be but unprofitable to the Kingdome, troubleſome to himſelfe, and prejudiciall to her he might match withall, in caſe that upon altered determination he might be perſwaded to reſolve of a further triall in that kinde.</p>
                  <p>Much wondred the <hi>Count</hi> at the ſtrangeneſſe of the ſtory, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Knight, hee promiſed him to ſtay there ſome dayes of purpoſe, to further him in his deſignes. But ſcarce had hee opened his mouth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite this ſtory of the Knights, with the relation of his adventures, when he might eſpie iſſuing from out one part of the wood <hi>Feredo,</hi> and from out the other the young Knight. Ariſen up, they went to meete the later that was next them: After reciprocall ſalutes, and complementall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage paſt of either ſide, the <hi>Venedotian</hi> Knight invited the young Knight to dine with the <hi>Druide;</hi> (ſhewing him, with that, <hi>Feredo)</hi> the young Knight eſpying him, and well-liking his garb and habit, went onwards to give him the meeting: And hee underſtanding they were none of thoſe that came to ſeeke him, received them with extraordinary courteſie, with thanking them kindly for the favour they did him. Then would hee have them mount on horſe-back to get up the hill, thinking all of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall provided; but ſeeing the <hi>Count</hi> want one, he told him, hee was ſorry for it, the heate being great, the ſunne of a good hight, and that day as faire and calme, as the preceding night had beene foule and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous.</p>
                  <p>The young Knight was ſo farre from following his advice, as he bluſh'd to heare him, whilſt his proud Steede by his pranſing ſeemed to invite the Knights, to prove whether hee were as good, as well ſhaped. The heate put them off their ceremonies, by cauſing them to haſten to gain the ſhade not farre off them under a thick row of trees, that began at the foote of the hill, which Nature had all about adorned with choyſe vines. The way to aſcend had planted orderly on each ſide thereof (like ſo many halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) fruite-bearing trees worthy the being grafted by a Princely hand; the hillocks top yeelded a fragrant od our from its faire crown of Orenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees; flowers might there be ſeene laid ſcatteringly over the ſurface of the earth, in ſuch a forme as the ſtarres are placed in the firmament, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7474:27"/>
to lie glorying in their rich ſhew, encamped in pavements embroyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with odoriferous hearbs contrived into divers figures.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of the habitation that preſented it ſelfe to the eye, was the Temple, round in forme, and rough-caſt without as farre as its Architrave with fine white lime, ſupporting a ranke of fineſt white marble pillars, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly placed by two and two, with ſo much diſtance betweene them, as ſufficed to afford it light; the ſpire-roofe having no other opening, nor the round body of the Chappell other windowes. Vpon the pillars (which were foure and twenty) was diſplayed a thinne border of fine skie-colour'd mettle, divided into twelve equall ſpaces, every ſpace where of conteyning one ſigne of the <hi>Zodiake,</hi> was againe ſubdevided by very ſmall lines into 30 Degrees, the firſt point of <hi>Aries</hi> touching the laſt of <hi>Piſces</hi> in the very midſt of the Frontiſpice. About this border might bee ſeene to gire the two celeſtiall lights, the one colour'd with gold, the other with ſilver, with an <hi>Index</hi> towards the lowermoſt ſurface of their circumference, which preciſely pointed out the place, which the true lights poſſes'd in that very inſtant in the celeſtiall <hi>Zodiake.</hi> There might a man ſee all the aſpects in their proper characters. Moreover, the Moone (for the better fitting her conjunctions) had an ampler gire than that of the Sunnes; nor could it have other in reſpect of us, though it were contrary to the ſpheare in reſpect of the firmament: that ſame thing repreſenting in the artificiall the <hi>convex,</hi> which indeede is naturally the <hi>concave;</hi> the eclipſes likewiſe might be there ſeene (when any were) by a plate of darke-coloured Iron's covering ſo much of the Moone as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. The figure of the Sunne (drawne to a correſpondent circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) correſponded to the truth of the Eclipſes of the true Sunne, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or rather vailed by his fiſter, according to aſtronomicall ſuppoſitions. And being not able to imitate the ſpheare in ſetting and riſing, it ſhewed inſtead thereof the eclipſes, that were out of our ſight in the other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſpheare.</p>
                  <p>Vpon the ſpiry roofe ſtood a brazen ſtatue of excellent workemanſhip, repreſenting <hi>time,</hi> that in its footeſtall with the but-end of its cive ſtruck the houres and quarters, with ſo dainty an artifice, as the eare could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne no noyſe of counterweights or wheeles, nor the imagination con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that any ſuch could be contained in the ſtreightneſſe of ſo narrow a concave. The doores ſtanding one of them towards the Eaſt equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and the other on the oppoſite, ſide, were both of them adorned with ſeemely pillars, the Eaſterne of ſnow-white Alablaſter with ſtaires, threſhold, and lintell of the ſame. The Weſterne with its ſupplements of a cole-black touch-ſtone; <hi>that</hi> garniſhed with a white Eagle, being the Hieroglyphick of heaven, <hi>this</hi> with a barking <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſad embleame of hell, never opened but when ſacrifice was done to the infernall Deities for <hi>Gelinda</hi>'s ghoſt. For the ſame purpoſe alſo ſtood erected two Altars, and on either of them an Image.</p>
                  <p>Theſe briefly ſurvaid, all of them entred into the Temple, where the ſacrifices were the hearts of two white doves, burnt upon the quick em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; that done, they retired to the houſe, and were invited to ſit at the table, where the two gueſts were ſtrucken with amazement at the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and order of ſervice; they admired at ſuch abundance without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7474:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſuch delicacie without defect; and withall, to ſee conform'd to the humility of faire white earthen diſhes ſuch a royall perſonage, place, and ſervice. The <hi>Druide</hi> entertained them with pleaſant diſcourſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelling his countenance with an aſpect to outward ſeeming cheerefull and blithſome; ſhewing them withall, how that Countrey was the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt bound of <hi>Greece</hi> to the ſea-ward; and then made them a gratefull expreſſion of the great courteſies hee had received at the hands of the Prince of <hi>Feacia</hi> Lord of that Ile, and was about to particularize ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what thereof, when altering his conceit upon turning towards the <hi>Count,</hi> hee beſought him to impart ſome occurrences of the Weſterne parts, it being ten yeares ſpace, ſithence he had heard any newes from thence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Count</hi> willingly embracing the occaſion of aſſaying to perſwade him to returne home, making no ſhew of knowing any thing thereof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt a forwardneſſe to ſatisfie him; ſo as having made ſome <hi>prelueds</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to his ends, he ſpake in this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Irinico</hi> King of <hi>Gaula Belgica</hi> had beſides two ſonnes (the eldeſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of died) one onely daughter, whoſe beauty (though ſingular) was yet ſurpaſſed with ſo many vertues, that the people thought her the compend of the Kingdomes glory; deſired ſhee was of many, wooed by few, and wonne by one that was litle thought of; among her Suitors, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall man was <hi>Teuton</hi> King of <hi>Scandinavia</hi> a Prince, who though rich both in yeares and poſterity, was not yet by his yeares brought to any diſability of body; and now his diſguſts which hee received every day more than other from his ſonnes, made him deſirous of new heires, ſince hee was growne reſolute to raiſe wals againſt wals, till he had levelled with the ground thoſe, which (to his confuſion) were by them built againſt him, a thing practiſed by him many yeares before to the coſt of the lives of ſome of them, and the brothers too. Now hee had already taken many wives, and had uſed them all very ill, as indeede hee married them not for love, but altogether for meanes, nor ever admitted he any one of them to his bed on other, than the ſole hopes of their patrimoniall Kingdomes, which conformable to his expectation failed him not. Knowne it is not whether it was pollicie or nature in him to affect not one of them, the ſole ayme of his love being levelled at the enlarging of his Monarchie, and making himſelfe great.</p>
                  <p>Hee had already by the meanes of ſome Kings of his alliance, gotten a great footing in neighbouring Countries; whereupon growne deſirous to become one day owner of <hi>Irinico</hi>'s Kingdome, hee made ſuit for his alliance, meerely to ground thereupon a foundation for his pretentions, and not to enjoy thoſe incomparable beauties, the onely white whereat the deſire of all other Princes aymed. And having gotten an uſe of letting himſelfe to be ſeene but of a very few, by withdrawing himſelfe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (for many moneths together) from the popular ſight, a fancie tooke him in the head to goe himſelfe in perſon to <hi>Irinico,</hi> and ſo (under the vaile of an Embaſſadour) to prie into the ſecrets of his Kingdome, corrupt his ſubjects, and winne himſelfe a wife, and by her in time a Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Having then left ſuch order as he thought requiſite to ſuch as were to manage the ſecrecie of his abſence, hee parted, accompanied with very few, increaſing by the way his retinew with ſuch perſons as had never
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7474:28"/>
ſeene him before; travelling with all the litle that he went by land, ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly by an invention that he had got, to confine himſelfe for ſome retired imaginations within his horſe-litter, that no man in the whole dominions could come to ſee him in the face.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Irinico</hi> receiving him with all poſſible courteſies, underſtanding the ſumme of his embaſſie would not ſuddently diſpatch him (though he were already reſolved of what he meant to doe) but referr'd the buſineſſe to his privy Councell, not ſo much to underſtand their opinions, as to know thoſe who (ſome while before) were ſuſpected to have beene corrupted.</p>
                  <p>Hee (in the meane time) being admitted to the ſight of the Princeſſe, prov'd to be in love; indeed a ſtrange effect in him, and yet more ſtrange by reaſon of his ſo fretting thereat; for, perſwading himſelfe that he could not chooſe but love his owne perſon the leſſe, by ſuch a portion of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as he ſetled upon any other; ſo as hee could have heartily wiſhed the poſſibleneſſe of diſtinguiſhing the perſon of a Prince from that of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, had beene within the reach of his power, that ſo in perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting either, he might exerciſe his cruelty over the other. But love (as the caſe ſtood) domineering over the fury of his furious projects, brought his pride to ſo low an ebbe, as from a States-man he would have gladly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected his ſtout ſpirit to any inferiour ſervile condition, had it not ſhewed it ſelfe too too apparantly contrary to the iſſue of his deſires.</p>
                  <p>No whole day ſuffered he to paſſe without viſiting <hi>Doricrene,</hi> this ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous Embaſſadour labouring to gaine the favour of her affection to his Prince, which was himſelfe, who for being more than ordinarily enrich'd with a <hi>buffonizing</hi> and jearing humour, was generally in all companies a moſt welcome companion; for, laying aſide all gravity, hee ſerved for a make-ſport, not onely to the Princeſſe, but to all the Court beſides; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as <hi>Irinico</hi> himſelfe (taking pleaſure therein) liked his company marveilous well, and withall affected very much his way of expreſſing himſelfe ſo different from thoſe of other men, for that he never ſpake but by figures and proverbs, applied with particular acuteneſſe, with ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations ever-equivocating to be ſolved as he pleaſed; (it being indeed but reaſon for the ſpeaker to be his owne words interpreter) his countenance, carriage, and habit ſpeaking him to be one that cared for nothing; and though he indeede was rather a Sophiſter than a Philoſopher, yet ſeemed he by his outward expreſſion of himſelfe, to be meerely compoſed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Court-philoſophy. Speake he would the plaine truth when he was ſure there was no credit given to what he ſpake, yet bluſh'd he not to lye loudly, when it made any way for his ends, both the one and the other alwayes moſt falſe and deceitfull like himſelfe; litle gave he, though hee promiſed much, yet the freeneſſe of his carriage in what he did, grounded in mens conceits, a foundation for the performance of his large promiſes. A marveilous ſower hee was of ſoaring hopes, from which ſince there ſprung nought elſe than briars and nettles, he imputed the fault to their ill husbanding, deferring the harveſting both of them and of other new ſeede to the enſuing yeare. Yet with all his ſhifts and devices he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the fortune to arrive to the hight of his firſt deſigne, the true artifice of accompliſhing ſuch, conſiſting indeede either in not having any double meaning, (which is the ſure way) or in a handſome way of concealing it,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7474:28"/>
which is full of difficulties; or being otherwiſe accompanied with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive promiſes, it diſmembers it ſelfe and becomes ſubject to the brand of incredulity.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Irinico</hi> had (long before this) made choyſe for his Son-in-law of the King of <hi>Vlmigaria,</hi> a Prince of knowne great dignity, whom hee thought might ſerve him for a ſtrong linke in the long chaine by him fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contrived on that part of <hi>Europe</hi> in barre of the growing power of <hi>Teuton;</hi> and therefore hee ſo crept ſlily on with his pollitick reaches, <hi>diſſembling being a prime article in gaining or eſtabliſhing the poſſeſion of Kingdomes;</hi> and thought that the affinity with that other King carried with it apparent advantages, yet the counter-poyſing diſadvantages proceeding from it, were alſo ſo apparent, nay ſo palpable, that an ordinarily diſcreete perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage (much more ſuch a ſage Prince as he was) would have not only refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but abhorred the alliance of ſuch a froward old man, ill reported of, and worſe conditioned, cruell to his wives, brothers, and children; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the conſideration of the likelihood of making away the Prince <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante</hi> by ſword or poyſon, the Princeſſe being capable of ſucceſſion, and ſole heire in caſe her brother were dead.</p>
                  <p>Well perceived <hi>Teuton</hi> (though ſomewhat of the lateſt) that his was a journey vainely beſtowed, being ſecretly advertized, that <hi>Doricrene</hi> was otherwiſe to be diſpoſed of, ſo as he now comprehends how his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences in that Kingdome (in hope of furthering his affaires) was but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney caſt away; his dependences and thoſe of his faction being not onely ſuſpected, but moſt of them knowne, ſo that therefore his ſtay there could not be otherwiſe than very chargeable, as the profit hee could expect or hope to gaine thereby could be (in compariſon of his charge) but very ſmall; nay (which ſpited him moſt) that <hi>Irinico</hi> himſelfe laughed (as we ſay) in his ſleeve to ſee his ſubjects and ſtate enriched by his ill-founded projects and bounty. Reſolved for ſuch reaſons to alter his firſt determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he fained the receiving of new commiſſions importing,</p>
                  <p>That his King had commanded him (ſithence he had not, all that while, concluded the marriage) ſuddenly to returne homewards, his yeares now diſſwading him from matching any more; howbeit <hi>that</hi> he ſhould aſſure <hi>Irinico</hi> of his friendſhip, in a degree no leſſe than if the affinity had beene contracted; and in caſe he ſaw him enclined to a croſſe match, to proffer him his Daughter <hi>Celene</hi> for <hi>Elimante.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this laſt propoſition <hi>Irinico</hi> willingly liſtned, &amp; (licenſing the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Embaſſadour with many preſents) willingly embraces the offer.</p>
                  <p>As ſoone as <hi>Teuton</hi> came home, he ſends back thither an expreſſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, giving him charge to keepe the marriage from concluding as long as he could, and yet to ſubſcribe to promiſe all rather than breake off.</p>
                  <p>The faire <hi>Doricrene</hi> was (in the meane time) married to her deſigned husband, abandoning unwillingly her deere Countrey, and deere Brother; a match leſſe fortunate than correſponded to the merit of ſo accompliſh'd a Princeſſe, and indeede the unfortunate and deceiving effect of humane prudence. Before theſe nuptials, pictures of her were ſpread farre and neere over the greater part of the world, ſo as there was not a Prince that therewith adorned not the moſt conſpicuous wall of his Pallace, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and recreate by the eyes the internall ſenſes of the heart with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

of ſuch an excelling beauty; onely <hi>Duriſlao</hi> King of the <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> was that one, that taking it away from the common view, ſtored it up in a ſecret place, thinking it ſacriledge to prophane an image by him reputed celeſtiall, ſo much, as to ſuffer it to be expoſed to the ſurvey of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind eye of popular judgement. And growing to like it every day more than other, he at length arrived to that paſſe, as he knew not whether he were more enamoured of the true <hi>Doricrene</hi> which he had never ſeene, or of her (by him ſo continually courted) picture. When at any time he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to abſent himſelfe from his Realme to goe to <hi>Gaule</hi> to ſee the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, he had not the power to ſtirre when he came but to take a farewell of the Coppy, conceiting he could not be preſent with the one, as long as he was abſent from the other; nay he would ſweare, it did ſtirre, rejoyce and grieve too, according as it ſaw the diſpoſition of his affection enclined; to ſuch a point of inſenſibility had amorous ſuperſtition reduced him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in beleeving falſe imaginations (the <hi>Meteor</hi> of his deſires) to bee the true effects of ſenſe and reality. But when he heard ſhee was married in <hi>Vlmigaria</hi> with a neighbouring diffident Prince, and one whoſe domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons bordered with his, hee was like to dye with hearts-grefe, rage, and ſpite; and had reſolved (even then ſuddenly) to have either forcibly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or ſtolen her away, if the extreame griefe which he conceived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, had not (by corrupting his health) ſtopt the current of that his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
                  <p>The faire picture expoſed then to any ones view, was placed in his ſight, at his beds feete, where he two moneths lay ſick, nor had he then riſen, but for the comforts of his uncle <hi>Teuton,</hi> who upon information re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of its cauſe, ſent to tell him;</p>
                  <p>Hee wondered the fierce <hi>Sarmatia</hi> could ſo much degenerate from it ſelfe, as to have inſteede of a martiall King a dejected lover; who for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine could not poſſibly be other than a changeling, being thoſe of his Royall Family and blood were never owners of ſoft &amp; effeminate hearts; which if otherwiſe hee were indeed a true branch of ſo Royall a ſtocke, that hee ſhould then rouze up his ſpirits and be well, ſince both lay in his power; warranting him, that the noyſe of trumpets would ſoone awake him from his dump of heavineſſe, and a contrary imagination as ſoone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him to his former health, his love being no other than a meere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and his ſickneſſe an effect of the like cauſe: Adding (for his more comfort) <hi>that</hi> he himſelfe had alſo ſought her to wife, but had ſince with more wholſome counſell withdrawne from her his affection; wiſhing him to doe the like; or if affection in him (for being the younger man) bare ſomewhat a greater ſway, yet ſhould its force be weakened, by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that if he could leave and ſlight her when the effect thereof was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, much rather then ſhould this nephew of his deſiſt from an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enterprize, neceſſity teaching him to forget her, and amorous diſdaine to abhorre her now that ſhee was enjoyed by another; or if all this yet ſufficed not, yet ſhould he not droopingly abandon himſelfe to griefe and heavineſſe, but like a brave Bull winne her from out the hands of his rivall, and deprive him not onely of her, but alſo of his ſcepter, ſtate, and life. Since Kings have no other law than their wils, nor other Iuſtice than power and Armes, the reſt being but old-wivestales, and fables of weake

and heartleſſe men. Promiſing if he (like himſelfe) bravely reſolved to doe thus, that then hee ſhould ſee how he would ſhew himſelfe to be an uncle unto him, they being both of the ſame family, and having now a joynt colour of quarrell againſt one and the ſame enemy; and withall, that he was (for his part) content to let him have to himſelfe, and owne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Miſtreſſe, the booty, honour, and conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>This embaſſie delivered, up got <hi>Duriſlao</hi> off his bed, perſwaſion being a hard Chizell to ding out of his fancie his amorous conceit, and a ſharpe ſpurre to prick him on to diſdaine and anger; that ſweete love-comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding countenance, that before with its ſweet perfections ſo raviſhed him, ſeemed loathſome to him, now that violent paſſions were chaſed away by their oppoſites extreame ones; the faire picture rent off his bed was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooted from out his heart, and the diſdaine that ſucceeded in its place (kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by the remaining ſparkles) flaſh'd up with an outragious fury.</p>
                  <p>Behold we now <hi>Sarmatia</hi> reſounding all over with the death-menacing clattering of Armes, and her vaſte Champion-fields covered with ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming troupes of man and horſe; Fame which ſaw them muſtered (carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the newes thereof from the next adjacent to the remoter Regions) cauſed peace to retire to the heavens at the appearance from out their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſſe of the infernall Furies, with all the rabble of their haggiſh traine.</p>
                  <p>There was betweene <hi>Vlmigaria</hi> and the other neighbouring Kings a ſtrong defenſive league, wherein, though the enemy were not expreſſely named, yet their intent levelled at <hi>Teuton</hi> and <hi>Duriſlao;</hi> ſo as at the firſt notice of the being of ſo great an army on foote, they hudled together a great number of bodies though few hearts, and each of theſe few too go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by its feares, and by their inducement rather inclined to truce than fight; whence ſprung the ſource of all the enſuing evils: for, humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence teacheth us to embrace peace till it begin to appeare prejudiciall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; but the dice once caſt, the true <hi>Cavalier</hi> cannot (without expoſing himſelfe to dangers) manifeſt his valour, ſince <hi>life and fame cannot equally be cared for.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Duriſlao</hi> appeared on the confines, where he found Defendants enough, or ſuch at leaſt as ſeemed to be ſuch; who gave him battell, loſt it, and fled, or rather indeede fled ere they loſt it. The extolled prudence of their <hi>Generall,</hi> ſo many yeares before in eſtimation incomparable, being now tried by a true touch-ſtone, diſcovered the falſeneſſe of its mettle; the mountaines-promiſing valour of ſo many Princes that under their pavilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeemed to be invincible, as ſoone as it now appeared in open field was beaten downe and trampled, or (at leaſt) put to flight, chooſing to loſe (rather than hazard their lives) both their dominions, friends, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet among all theſe evils, there was one good thing, that the more baſe and daſtard ſpirits (preventing the time) gave (by their running away the firſt) time to the Court to ſave it ſelfe by flight, the City being unable to defend it under the command of ſo faint hearts: their greateſt care was to informe themſelves, whether the enemy had as yet entred into or ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Citie, the terrour whereof ſo wrought upon their timerouſneſſe, as many of them forgot their very children in their cradles.</p>
                  <p>The ſweetly-majeſticall Queene ſeeing things reduced to ſuch a point, the Citie and Kingdome loſt, the women weeping, and the men ſtanding

ſtaring about them with beteared eyes, and ſo confuſedly crowded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as their diſorderly ſwarming might endanger their eſcaping with ſafety: Shee (mounted on horſe-back) ſaid thus unto them.</p>
                  <p>I have no cauſe to wonder at my women, whoſe weapons are their teares, but at you, who being Knights by your profeſſion, had not the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to defend them, and yet now diſcover your effeminateneſſe ſo far, as to imitate them in weeping; I can doe no leſſe than be aſtoniſhed; yet (now that I conſider it) you doe well; for, it may chance to ſave your lives, ſince the enemy (how litle generous ſoever he be) will ſcorne to embrue his warlike ſword in ſuch cowardly blood as yours. Here without ſtaying for any anſwer, ſhee (putting onwards her Steede) ſpurr'd away, much repenting, ſhee had not made one in the battell, her heart giving her, that her very preſence there had prevented the diſaſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Duriſlao</hi> (having gotten ſo eaſie a victory) with his Lance in reſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in brave order towards the City, where he found the gates wide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and no man that durſt either gaineſay or withſtand him; yet ſeeing himſelfe deprived of his hoped-for ſpoyles, now thought himſelfe to bee rather the conquered than conquerour. Egg'd on therefore by his old love-fits, kindled by the ancient fire that lay raked up in the aſhes of his contrary reſolution, hee ſpurr'd onwards to overtake the runne-away Court troupe, who followed by their King, (having abandoned their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar charges) had betaken themſelves to the ſpeedy legges of their ſwift Courſers. Diſcovering the baggage, he hoped to finde there <hi>Doricrene,</hi> but found nothing anſwerable to his expectation, there being no other than perſons of ſervile conditions, indifferently unworthy of either his love or hatred. Here underſtanding for a certaine, that hee could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake her (for his comming too late, and her having farre out-ſtrip't him, and that in a croſſe-way too) he ſtop't his courſe, taking no joy in any thing hee had got, ſithence he had loſt her, the ſole booty that he made any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeeme of.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt hee ſtood a good while fix't in this imagination, love opened unto his apprehenſion the doore of humanity, by laying open to his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation's-conſideration, a Queene, a great Kings daughter, deprived of her dominions, forced to flye, and wander through woods and uncouth parts, without having (now that ſhee had loſt her baggage) as much as cloathes to ſhift her withall; whereat hee could not refraine from drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out teares amaine; not love now, but meere humanity, a generous ſpirit, and native nobility miniſtring him this ſubject of condoling. Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing therefore the cariages to advance under the convoy of a ſtrong troupe of horſe, hee commanded them to preſent them her from him, offering her there withall his Royall perſon to be her knight and ſervant.</p>
                  <p>The faire <hi>Doricrene</hi> gotten out of the Citie, never once turn'd back to looke on it, ſo diligent was ſhee in her ſpeedy courſe, for not falling into the hands of her well-wiſhing enemy, and unbeloved lover: Onwards galloped ſhe all-alone foremoſt of all the company, without either drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a teare or breathing a ſigh; but yet her fiery eyes kept every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loofe off her, ſhee being (for her diſpoſition) generally knowne to owne a generous heart, that never made reckoning of any loſſes how heavy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; ſo as what now troubled her minde was onely the daſterlineſſe of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7474:30"/>
her forces, and their misbehaving themſelves; and now ſhee fled without knowing or caring whither, when at the King's ſtopping his horſe, all the reſt made a ſtand.</p>
                  <p>My friends (ſaid he) our trouping in this manner were good, if we were to fight, but not to ſave our ſelves by flight, as we muſt doe; we are (yee know) unprovided of victuals, which if we chance to light on by the way, yet will there not be enough for all of us; our better courſe therefore were, to ſeparate our ſelves, and take every one of us that way fortune ſhall direct him in; and if the Gods ſhall ever hereafter behold me with a more propitious eye, I will then remember ſuch as have well ſerved mee. Here licenſing and embracing them one after another, he burſt forth into ſuch a paſſionate weeping, that the Queene become thereat impatient, girked her Palfrey and ſo (followed onely by one Gentle woman) in an inſtant got out of all their ſights: Away ſhee rode ſhee knew not whither, onely ſhee (as neere as ſhee could gheſſe) directed her courſe towards that ſtarre which the King at their parting ſeemed to tend his too, till loſing the ſight thereof at her entring into a Forreſt, ſhee committed her ſelfe to the diſcretion of her horſe, who (ſomewhat after mid-night) brought her to a litle dwelling, where ſhe ſtopp'd her pace, and eſpying ſome light there, ſhee threw her ſelfe off her horſe, her Gentlewoman not being able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light without helpe; peering then through the key-hole, ſhee might ſee an old hermit, that prayſed God with unfained devotion, and ſo attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he heard not the trampling of the horſes, nor had hee but for the neighing of one of them heeded them when he did; but then, not ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till they knocked, he courteouſly opened the doore, without asking who was there: No ſooner ſaw hee the gueſt, than that hee (uſed to the ſplendor of Royall Majeſties) fail'd litle in gheſſing what ſhee was, con-Ceiving in an inſtant the merits, if not the titles of ſo high a preſence: Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king then a light in his hand, he went out, cloathing his countenance with a welcome-ſpeaking charity ſo gravely-gladſome as the Queene become conſolated, thereat ſaid unto him.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Hermit</hi> (drying his beteared eyes) aſſured her, he would guide her on ſuch a way as ſhould (God willing) bring her beyond all danger; and then making her a <hi>frittado</hi> of egges and milke he ſet it before her, whereof ſhee (not having eaten any thing all that day) willingly taſted, and then being by him pray'd to repoſe her ſelfe on his ſtraw-bed, ſhee there laid her downe, giving her ſelfe over (for the ſpace of two houres) to a ſound and ſweete ſleepe.</p>
                  <p>The good man in the meane time looking to the horſes carefully, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his time of awaking her, which was a good while before day, and cauſing her to ride with her woman hard by her, he led them the way, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving much adoe (although he were well acquainted with the Forreſt) to finde the way out, warning them, not to ſpeake a word; all thereabouts being a dangerous place fortheeves, whom hee yet hoped to eſcape by keeping wide off their dens. The journey through the wood endured as long as the night laſted, there appearing unto their view by that time it was day the open fields and houſes, but ſo abandoned that no living ſoule was to be ſeene in any of them.</p>
                  <p>Aſſured of her being out of danger, ſhee thought to licenſe the old man, and in the way of almes to give him a diamond, which he refuſed to accept of, with telling her.</p>

                     <hi>Irinico</hi> that (in the meane time) could not either with embaſſies or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons diſſwade the <hi>Scandinavian</hi> from ſiding with the <hi>Sarmatan</hi> King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſonne-in-law, hearing now of his overthrow, and being not able to re-inſtall him by Armes; ſmoothering the injury, thought with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to proſecute the affaire of matrimony (the Prince <hi>Elimante</hi> being already enamoured of his pretended wife) hoping that this meanes might open him the way to the reſtitution of what was taken away from his daughter; but the marriage being all this while unconcluded on, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to permit the <hi>Prince</hi> to goe himſelfe in perſon into <hi>Scandinavia,</hi> there to proſecute the enjoying of his loves; accordingly he goes thither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7474:32"/>
giving out, that hee went to travell as a Knight-errant into other parts: Arrived there, he ſaw the King, whom (though the home-glaſſe of many yeares were ſince runne out) he yet knew by that Embaſſad our that had beene at his Fathers, a <hi>caveat</hi> that taught his intellect to guide his behaviour ſomewhat the more warily; become in that regard more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous of concealing himſelfe than before, he aſſaid all the meanes his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention could propoſe to come to the ſight of the Princeſſe, who ſtirring abroad but very ſeldome, by conſequence could be but ſeldome ſeene: But prudence and love, or rather a prudent love inſtructing him farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his yeares, and diſcreetely governing him in all his wayes, hee came (I know not how) to have ingreſſe into a parke where for her health's ſake ſhee uſed to walke ſometimes all alone in.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> was cloath'd in the habit of a Squire, and though his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all greatneſſe remain'd not vailed by the diſguiſe of the habit he was cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in, yet was it nevertheleſſe ſhadowed with a certaine taking-kinde of humility, wherewith hee beleeving to hide it from the fight of others, made it become (indeede) in the eyes of all men more obſerved, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardfull for its inexpreſſibly-ſweet delightſomneſſe, and rarely ſelfe-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar hearts-winning amability.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſſe had (given her by her Father) <hi>Elimanto's</hi> picture ſent from <hi>Irinico,</hi> and now walking all alone, ſhee opening its <hi>Diamantine</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, heedfully beheld it; when caſting her eye aſide towards a by-corner not farre off the place where ſhee walked, ſhee diſcovered its true origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: Start back at the unexpected ſight of him ſhee did not, but drew her eye from the artificiall to the naturall; and then beleeving ſhee was not deceived in the certainety of her conjecture, ſaid unto her ſelfe. Sure this is <hi>Elimanto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee pierced through the heart with that ſudden glance, had ſurely fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that love received himſelfe before him the ſhaft ſhot by the bow of her faire eyes, (a pittie not imputable either to piety or vertue, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him without any new wounds to bee already wounded, and withall, that he could not (in caſe he kill'd him out-right) ſo triumph over him as he intended.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elimanto</hi> tooke on him to be by this encounter ſurprized at unawares, and doing her ſubmiſſive reverence, made a ſhew of retiring himſelfe, when ſhee asked him whom he belong'd unto, and how hee got in there: The anſwer was.</p>
                  <p>Moſt excellent Madame, it is not long ſince the Knight my Maſter died, and then I deſirous to ſee, and ſeeke a fortune in this great Court, for the famouſneſſe thereof, came hither to that end; for the reſt, I beſeech your Highneſſe pardon, for my being got in hither as a ſtranger, curious to ſee what I had never ſeene before.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this, <hi>Celene</hi> asking him if he had ever knowne her before, and if not, how he then came to know ſhee was the Princes? I never had (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede) the happineſſe to ſee your Highneſſe before (anſwered her the <hi>Prince)</hi> but yet to know you is as eaſie as to know the ſunne by its ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rayes; beſides, my comming from a countrey, in which your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is knowne by pictures, merits, and relations, I might ſay by love too, if I thought there were any Prince living worthy of your Highneſſe:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7474:33"/>
At this <hi>Celene</hi> ſmiled with a gentle gravity, without taking off him her eye, more certaine than before that hee was <hi>Elimanto;</hi> then asking him what Countrey that hee ſpake of was, and underſtanding it was <hi>Gaula Belgica,</hi> ſhee not daring to paſſe any farther held her peace: But he with a courage ſpurr'd on by a ſincere affection) proceeded.</p>
                  <p>If Prince <hi>Elimanto</hi> could but imagine me here, I am ſure hee would with all his heart exchange beings with me, he owning not that affect that more ſweetly tortures him, than the deſire of ſerving your Highneſſe; ſo as if the affaire of the-by-him-ſo-ardently-deſired-nuptials be not ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined, I would not give one of theſe leaves for his life.</p>
                  <p>Knoweth-you then the Prince? (ſaid <hi>Celene)</hi> if yea, why then ſuffers he you to goe ſeeke any other Maſter? Yes Madame (ſaid he) he knowes me, but is as willingly content that any of his ſubjects travell hither, as he would more gladly come himſelfe, ſo (as I dare ſay) that this ſole favour (I am now honoured with in ſeeing your Highneſſe) would ſuffice, to make him the happieſt of all the Princes in the world; how then can he chooſe but be well content, that others come here for ſervice, your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe being Soveraigne Miſtreſſe of his deſires, and by all his ſo reputed? And could I be but ſo fortunate, in joyning the deſire to the effect ſo farre, as that your Highneſſe would be pleaſed to receive me into your ſervice; Prince <hi>Elimanto</hi> would thinke a great part of his deſires accompliſhed in my being ſo for his ſake accepted, the moſt honourable marke of your Princely favour that your Highneſſe can favour him withall.</p>
                  <p>My favours (ſaid then <hi>Celene)</hi> ſtand at the diſpoſe of the King my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of whom I have not as yet received any command to any ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but you (for being a ſtranger, and hapning to come to me before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other) I will accept into my ſervice, ſeeing the deſire you have to ſerve me. With that, bidding a Lady that followed her, to cauſe him to be (on her behalfe) entertained of her <hi>Stuart,</hi> ſhee yet held him ſome while lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in diſcourſe, growing to be ever more and more aſſur'd, that ſhee had not judged amiſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elimanto</hi> ſeeing himſelfe at his firſt entrance ſo highly favoured by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, conceived a confident hope of a good iſſue therein; and conferring by night with his Fathers Embaſſadour, under colour of bringing him letters, made him when hee knew him) tremble to thinke of his no leſſe bold than dangerous enterprize, <hi>Teutone</hi> being of all Princes the moſt malicious, whoſe honour-deſpiſing reſolutions had no other ſcope, than his owne private profit.</p>
                  <p>Litle leſſe than a whole yeares time lived <hi>Elimanto</hi> in this habit, and yet the buſineſſe went on never a whit all this while, one day ſuggeſting unto the other new articles of difficulty to hinder its concluſion. Nor had he (good Prince) beene yet diſinveagled ſo ſoone as he was neither, (ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent were all his thoughts on the object of his love) but for the Princeſſe her ſelfe, who was the firſt that ſhew'd him the falſe carde dealt him.</p>
                  <p>Now ſhee had endeavoured by all the meanes ſhee could, to carry her ſelfe fairely; for though of tender yeares, yet being at one and the ſelfe ſame time no leſſe prudent than upright-hearted, divers conjectures had made her imagine, that her Father treated of this alliance with no faire meaning; ſo as ſhee gave not her affection full power to ſettle it ſelfe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7474:33"/>
wholly on <hi>Elimanto,</hi> doubting leſt he ſhould be betraid, and ſo excluded from her; watching therefore continually an occaſion to cleere her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of that doubt, Fortune at length favoured her better than ſhe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; for, chancing to be one day in her Fathers gallery, whereinto no man entred but himſelf alone, ſhe at the chamber-doore heard him in diſcourſe with one of his Councell &amp; favourites; ſaying, he was ſorry <hi>that</hi> the King of the <hi>Sarmatans</hi> carried not himſelfe more ſagely in his courſes than he ſeemed to doe, ſince being aſſured of having <hi>Celene,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> the holding of <hi>Irinico</hi> in hopes, was but to eſtabliſh what he had already conquered, and to facilitate the way for acquiring of more; he had (for all that) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned him with perpetuall embaſſies, as if the jealouſie of <hi>Doricrene</hi> could not be otherwiſe extinguiſhed than with the new love of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. A foule ſhame for a great Prince to love women for affections ſake, whereas his love ſhould have no other end than his owne proper ends and intereſſes. Whereof in reſpect hee had divers times written unto him without being able to make him yet conceive the myſterie of his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee was now reſolved to ſend him thither to tell him by word of mouth: <hi>That Celene</hi> was his, and ſhould be no other mans, ſince he neither would nor indeede could ſettle her in a better or fitter place, their blood and intereſſes loudly proclaiming her his; That the late conqueſt of <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migaria</hi> did but make his way to greater enterprizes, if he would be but ruled by him, if not, that then he might chance to encounter with greater difficulties than he yet imagined; <hi>That</hi> his intention was to goe on the way he had begun, which was, to procure Armes of <hi>Irinico</hi> (that hang ruſting on the wals) under the hopes of the marriage of <hi>Celene</hi> to his ſon; <hi>That</hi> therefore if he heard of any treaty about it, he ſhould not be (in the leaſt manner) moved thereat, nor in any caſe beleeve it, though his eares and eyes with all his outward ſenſes ſhewed it him concluded: <hi>That</hi> his deſigne was to negotiate it till ſuch time, as their joynt Standard-royall and victorious Armes (paſſing the <hi>Rhene</hi> and <hi>Elbe)</hi> were diſplaid victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Countries and dominions of <hi>Irinico,</hi> where he had infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents that favoured their faction. And that ſo high a deſigne merited his patience, the delay not depriving him of his Spouſe, but preſenting him (together with her) occaſions to make him become the famouſeſt King that ever wore Crowne; to theſe added he many other inſtructions tending all to one and the ſame purpoſe: But here the Princeſſe (for feare of being eſpied) retired, aſtoniſhed at ſuch a maſter-plot of treachery and being conditioned differently from her Father, could not chooſe but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>Elimanto's</hi> true affection, and correſpond thereunto as farre as her honour permitted her, ſo as ſhee reſolved (whatſoever came on't) to open the matter unto him that he might be gone his wayes, and diſpoſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of his affection.</p>
                  <p>All this while had ſhee governed her ſelfe with ſuch circumſpection, that he could never perceive that ſhee knew him, and he (on the other ſide) was endued with ſuch a ſingular modeſty, as he had not the boldneſſe to diſcover himſelfe, content onely to contemplate in the ſunne (as doth a generous Eagle) thoſe rayes he ſo admired and loved; and though youth prompt him on to more bold reſolutions, yet bore reaſon and diſcretion in him a greater ſtroake than any other affect whatſoever.</p>

                     <hi>Celene</hi> went (according as ſhee was wont) into her parke to walke, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſing to be brought her by <hi>Elimante</hi> (that gave out his name to be <hi>Veluſio)</hi> a litle mantle (which ſhe uſually wore to keepe her from the cold ayre when ſhee walked) ſhee thus beſpake him.</p>

                     <hi>Veluſio,</hi> I have hitherto knowne thee ſo diſcreete, that I hope thou wilt ſerve me faithfully in a buſineſſe wherein I meane to imploy thee; which is, that thou returne to thy countrey, and tell Prince <hi>Elimante</hi> from me, that all the meanes which hee and his Father uſe to obtaine me are but meerely vaine, the King my Father being reſolved to diſpoſe otherwiſe of me; acquaint him further, that his love hath obliged me to correſpond him, if not in love, yet (at leaſt) in good will, which hath tranſported me to diſcover unto him this countries croſſing of his deſigne, ſeeing I cannot (with my honour) requite him with any greater or other expreſſion of my gratitude; here told ſhee him all that ſhee had heard, charging him to part ſuddenly, and to adviſe <hi>Elimante</hi> to alter the object of his love, and thinke of another wife: I know not whether or no there diſtilled at theſe words ſome humidity from her faire eyes, for, the ſtaidneſſe of her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and ſpeech made not any ſhew of any greater affect than her lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage uttered. To deſcribe the caſe <hi>Elimante</hi> was in, were impoſſible for me, whoſe heart (good Prince) was ſo overwhelmed with extreamity of anguiſh, that if anger &amp; diſdaine (which ſerved for a compound cordiall) had not ſuſtained his drooping ſpirits in their functions, he had doubtleſſe ſunke to the ground: But conſidering how much it then ſtood him upon, he with a generous reſolution returned her this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Incomparable Madame, I yeeld your Highneſſe the greateſt thankes that I can expreſſe or imagine, ſince the favour you doe me farre excels any merit of mine, onely in one reſpect I may thinke my ſelfe worthy, which is, that your Highneſſe ſhall not be deceived in the opinion you conceive of my fidelity. I ſee in this buſineſſe two great extreames; the King, and your Highneſſe: Prince <hi>Elimante</hi> (though betrayed) will never repent him of having ſerved ſo high and vertuous a Princeſſe, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary gratitude ſhall make him thinke well employed all the time ſpent in bearing with the ingratitude of others. I ſhall acquaint him with as much as your Highneſſe commands me, beſeeching you to reſt aſſur'd, that he will never forget his beholdingneſſe to your Highneſſe for ſo great a favour; One ſole thing I doubt of, (which is) that the badneſſe of the newes will goe neere to kill him, and by ſo much the rather, that in the loſſe which he ſuſtaines, the ſame in the very act of its loſing ſhewes the ineſtimableneſſe of its excellencie and value. But the Princeſſe having not the heart to anſwer him (her conſtancie beginning now to faile her) without further ſpeech to him, went and placed her ſelfe among the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>The Prince making no longer tarrying (having conferr'd with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Embaſſadour, and changed his apparrell) departed thence, arriving within few dayes at his owne home, where unbuttoning his breſt, he pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out thence the wrongs done him. Hee burſt off the treaty, and would (if his Father had ſuffered him) have broken off the peace too; howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the ſeeming preparation he is now buſied about, makes the world ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for warres.</p>

The other Princes ſtand all of them obſerving the iſſue, deſirous to free themſelves from ſuſpicions and hidden treacheries, though with manifeſt dangers; and I am now going to recall <hi>Polimero</hi> Prince of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> (now many yeares ſithence baniſhed, through the occaſion of the King his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-lawes-doting fits) to the end he, returned home, may (if neede be) make one with the reſt. This is the danger wherein weare: The world on that part hath one ſole enemy, ſuperior to any one, inferior to all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this is knowne unto all, and yet ſuch as can withſtand him, will not; they ſhut their eyes, and runne for company downe the ſtreame of the rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their owne utter ruine, thinking themſelves more hurt with the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a flea that skips in their ſhirts, than with the venemous teeth and poyſoned breath of the dragon, that both infects them and devoures their dominions. Some Princes there are, that (for certaine rules) cannot leave off ſiding with the <hi>Scandinavian,</hi> though they be ſure to be in the end op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, or (which is the leaſt evill they can hope for) to be of free-men made firſt ſubjects, and then ſlaves: Others thinke it a happineſſe to be the laſt that periſh. We have none of us any prudence, but are all carried to action it we doe any thing) by ſpirits of confuſion, and brought to that paſſe, that the Gods (being pleaſed to puniſh mortals) reduce them unto, which is, to deprive them of their diviner part their underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Here held the ancient Knight his peace, ſeconded with a ſad ſilence of all, full of that horror wherewith an unexpected evill encumbers mens ſpirits: But the <hi>Druide</hi> having ſtood a good while with downe-caſt eyes, thinking his preſent profeſſion obliged him to ſpeake, knew not well what to reſolve of; ſo diſtracted was he with a paſſionate affection that egg'd him on, to make others beleeve that, which reaſon ſuffered not himſelfe to give any credit unto. Now he had ever ſince the arrivall of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotian</hi> Knight had great conflicts in his minde about his returne, but his firſt deliberation growne up now to the hight of obſtinacie, tyed him faſt to his reſolution of not parting; though love and filiall duty perſwaded him ſtrongly to the contrary, inſomuch as he perſwaded himſelfe that that was his beſt courſe, now that the entrance into wholſome counſels was ſhut up, and that hee foſtered (in their ſteede) imaginations, which being once taſted, it is a hard matter to forget their ſmacke, &amp; leave them to catch hold of the reall ſubſtance and guile-deteſting truth.</p>
                  <p>Having then heard this ſtory treating of a publick State, which impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on him a neceſſity of changing his purpoſe, hee gladly would for not changing it have deceived himſelfe, with beguiling alſo the reſt of the company, and perſwading them to thinke well of that opinion, which he knew in his owne conſcience to be ſtarke naught.</p>
                  <p>This noble Knights tale (ſaid hee) hath horrible appearances, and minds taken at unawares may eaſily conceive fears to be where none are, by meaſuring the effects, or rather the expectation of them with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable rule of falſe good and falſe evill: Here is preſented to our view an altered and a new world, as if it and its accidents had not ever been the ſame, ſithence it firſt began to have a beeing; not that I deny alterations, but conſider them in the revolution of times, which if they could chooſe but be changed, mutations then could not but be denied; but if they be at this preſent in a bad ſtate, they ſhall (no doubt) hereafter be in a goood

one. 'Tis ordinary for old men to praiſe the greenneſſe of their youth, and for Poets to runne on the commendation of the Spring, yet perceive not the former, that if they were not waxen old, nothing would ſeeme alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto them; Cities, townes, and houſes would then have the ſelfe ſame aſpects, and appeare unto them with the very ſame beauty; menthen ſhould have their delights confined to paſt-ſports, would taſte all meates with the ſame relliſh, and the ſpirit glutted and tired with merry thoughts, farre diſtant from mellancholike Philoſophie, would not be capable of ſuch differences, no not ſo much as to imagine that any ſuch were or could be. <hi>Poets</hi> likewiſe would ſay, that the world were ever the ſame, or if it ever altered, that then it rather bettered than otherwiſe; for, in later ages were never knowne (as in the firſt) brother-killers without any precedent example, promiſcuous luſts without ſhame or puniſhment, inceſts with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor a thouſand other miſchiefes and lewde villanies.</p>

The world though placed in the midſt of the ayre, yet falls not, its owne nature upholds it, and makes it durable for alterations, without which the heaven and earth would ſeeme to us to be of iron. If it be ſo; then things preſent ſhould not ſeeme ſo ſtrange to us, (ſeeing they are but even what have beene before) nor yet afflict us, if leaving naturall conſiderations, we accoaſt to the ſupernaturall, which may alone ſerve us for a true rule in all things. Men talke of a generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in the world, by which moſt beleeve, that the buds of the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monarchy is to be prun'd off, no otherwiſe, than if we thought it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſtrike a naile in the celeſtiall wheele, or beleev'd that the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Gods were unto us as prejudiciall as incomprehenſible: But if we beleeve that there are Gods, and that they have a provident care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, doth it not imply, that the meanes of their providence ſtand above the reach of our knowledge, and that they oftentimes make for our good, when they ſeeme in our eyes to worke our prejudice? Humane mindes (capable onely of the individuall things preſent) meaſure all eternall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall acts by the ſhort Ell of their clouded capacity, not conſidering, how that the infinite eſſence hath a conſtant care of the finite, with an <hi>Idea</hi> of eternity, which we comprehend not: for, to comprehend it, would be required an inſtrument proportionable, which is divinity, being a rule fit to ſquare all things by, from which are derived, and wherein ends the circle of the whole univerſe and all things therein contained, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall undeceivable gire, not caſuall, but predeterminate &amp; certaine, ſo as our oppoſitions cannot hinder it, nor our reaſons perſwade it to alter its courſe.

and feares of the life to come then ceaſe, nor let us any more vainely ſpend either our time or blood for maintaining the opinion of <hi>Deities</hi> in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, not knowing either what or who they are: But if ſuch both are indeed, and will needs have theſe alterations, let's then cede to their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and will, it befitting not us to know or diſpute the reaſon why, but humbly to kiſſe the whip wherewith wee are ſcourged: Nor ſhould our having in our owne hands the diſpoſing of our owne free-will make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that we are (for all that) withdrawne from under the ſubjection of their providence; for if it ſo were, then were that providence in vaine, and divinity quite aboliſhed, or at leaſt idle, unactive, and uncapable of any operation: Now then if any Gods be, doubtleſſe they doe foreſee and provide, not that which we, but what they in their inſcrutable wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome judge expedient for us; And if to withſtand or repine at what befals us be to oppugne the divine providence, then who-ſo beleeveth, oppoſeth it not, but obeyeth their irreſiſtable wils, and ſuffers this wheele to runne round, ſince it cannot but gire, to the end its ſtanding ſtill make it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come contrary to the nature of the eternall motion.

                  <p>Theſe are the reaſons which for the one only (though the onely good) part, may partly be alleadged in this matter.</p>
                  <p>For the other, I ſee no reaſon of oppoſing riſing commands, or growing Monarchies; be it of Prince or people; of Princes, they know that theirs muſt one day come to a period, and therefore the ſignes foreſhewing it being once come, they ſhould not either impugne them, or oppoſe the will of Fate. Alteration is leſſe violent in ceding than withſtanding, <hi>The bow that bends not, breakes:</hi> But grant, that they will defend themſelves, tell me, will they doe it ſolely or joyntly? If ſolely, the inferiority then of forces will be the touch-ſtone of their loſſes; if accompanied, then the diſaccompanying of their intereſſes will reſerve them by ſuch delay for a greater precipice. The colleagues have all of them their particular and ſeverall ends, and when in the extreame ruines of their fellowes they ſee themſelves likely to eſcape the being ruined for that preſent, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect to ſuccour them in the field, and withdraw their hand from the community of their perils, for feare of falling with them. Examples there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have enough in the preſent dayes, without borrowing any from paſt ages; but could a Prince be alwayes in the ſame ſtate, it were doubtleſſe better for him: The worſt is that, which this noble Knight tels us; <hi>That</hi> the world become ſenſeleſſe, neither ſees nor feeles its owne imminent evils; <hi>That</hi> the enemy may ever runne and rove whereſoever he liſt, the impediments being few and weake; <hi>That</hi> who-ſo can withſtand him, is by fatall inconſideration become ſo confident as he will not doe it; being all of them ſignes, whereby Princes are admoniſhed to foreſec, and with prompt remedy to provide for the evils that hang over their heads, which in wils ſo disjoyned in ſuch a conjunction of perils and intereſſes, I ſee not how they can otherwiſe doe than by ceding; ſince yeelding brings farre leſſer loſſes than utter undoing.</p>

For the people, I know no neceſſity of their ruining themſelves with their Soveraignes, they are alwayes ſure to ſerve one or other; to what end then ſhould they purchaſe a ruinous decaying ſervitude at the price of their blood, and ruine of their countrey? Muſt the ambition (forſooth) of Princes deſtroy the world? the Fates forbid that; Why they have commanded already their ſhares, let them therefore (a gods name) give place to others. Have they more pretenſion in what they or their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors acquired, than others have had? Were they borne (trow we) Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with the world, or came they by that dignity after a long ſucceſſion of yeares, and after others that ruled before them? If ſo, the firſt that got it, could he come by it otherwiſe than by violence? and if by ſuch meanes, why then may not another doe the like? The ſelfe ſame ſhall in future a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges befall our preſent Conquerours, who for being by then founded on the continuation of a long poſſeſſion, will thinke it an injury to them what now they make no ſcruple of doing to others, though indeed it neither then will be, nor now is ſuch. The world is a <hi>ſcene</hi> where are repreſented its accidents; the <hi>ſpectators</hi> are the <hi>Gods,</hi> who delighting themſelves in humane things, would take no pleaſure therein, if they continued to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the ſame; they will that their power ſhine over all; and ſuch men as ordinary (though miraculous) things cannot illuminate, muſt bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of darkeneſſe by extraordinary meanes: <hi>In fine,</hi> I beleeve, the Gods deprive not Princes of their judgement and valour, but to bring in new perſonages in a new commedy, and the ſcene being theirs, they may repreſent there what they pleaſe, and we can but ſerve them at a beck, in taking up and letting downe the hangings, and in putting a hand to the machines, and being employed in other common and meaner ſervices, whilſt the Princes appearing in the ſceane (ſometimes happy, and ſome other times miſerable, one while triumphant, and another while captives) ſhew themſelves in the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> to be ſubject to a power greater than theirs.</p>
                  <p>Here ended the <hi>Druide,</hi> when the <hi>Venedotian</hi> Knight, who had many timés changed his colour, ſeeing him now ſilent, roſe up and ſaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feredo</hi> Prince of <hi>Vencdotia</hi> (even this ſame (my Lords) you here ſee in this habit) and with that turning towards him; I beſeech your Highneſſe (ſaid he on) to pardon my diſcovering you.</p>
                  <p>The times now permit you not to be any longer confin'd to theſe weeds, nor with them to thoſe reſolutions that ruine the perſon of ſo great a Prince; you pretend that humane judgement, for being deprived of the right inſtrument to judge things by, is deceivable; and true it is: But be it what it will, either you were not pleaſed to expreſſe it, or elſe you would not ſeeme to know it, for doubt of being induced to yeeld to what you might by irrefuteable arguments be perſwaded unto. The Gods (with your gracious pardon) are not that inſtrument, though they be indeed the Authors and the end thereof; nor in giving it us, give they us themſelves, but their aſſiſtant <hi>grace,</hi> whereby we are made capable of uſing it; nor yet have they been pleaſed to beſtow it upon us in an incomprehenſible way, beyond the capacity of our ſenſes, as they themſelves are; leſt we ſhould then impudently deny it, as they themſelves have beene ſometimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly renounced; to prevent which, they have naturally engrafted it in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7474:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
us, and withall made us doubly ſenſible of having it in our heart, and in our intellect; <hi>Conſcience</hi> that witneſſe againſt our ſelves, is that inſtrument, that conſcience which I will terme <hi>Naturall,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> one. By this <hi>Naturall Conſcience,</hi> I meane that remorſe common to all creatures, which though voide of reaſon, are not (for all that) deprived of a certaine knowledge of the evils they commit, more or leſſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the degrees of their capacities; and ſuch a <hi>conſcience</hi> is ſingular in us in the yeares of our infancie.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Religious Conſcience</hi> I intend to be that, whoſe object is Divinity, but for being built upon divers lawes (contrary or diſaccording) cannot be ſo generall, as to forme this inſtrument; <hi>Naturall Conſcience</hi> then, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon immutable principle, ſhall ſerve us for a rule in our affaires, without neglecting (for all that) the uſe of the <hi>religious</hi> one, when we treate of the Gods, or of their operations in us.</p>
                  <p>Let us now then firſt ſee, if Princes and people be indifferently bound to conſerve, thoſe their dominion, theſe their preſent ſtate; or if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of predeſtination or divine will doth conſtraine them to runne to ruine, for default of defending themſelves: For the Princes, my Prince here beleeves there is no reaſon for it, ſince their owne intereſſes will make them uſe the meanes. For the people, he ſpeakes neerer the quick of the ſeeming trueth; for he holds them exempted of all defence, for not receiving any change thereby (as touching the naturall conſcience) and for not oppoſing the divine will in obſequiouſneſſe to the religious one. But I (being (under correction) of a contrary opinion) ſay, that they ought to ſhunne by all meanes any new principality; for being by the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Conſcience</hi> thereto bound by oathes of fealty and obedience. And the alleadging, that the beginnings of Monarchies were violent, is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that (under favour) proves not his, but my opinion; ſince when the Law declareth things unowned to be his that firſt comes to the enjoying of them, it ſhewes cleerely the property thereof to be by naturall reaſon ſuch or ſuch a ones: And the ſame Law that by the ſelfe ſame reaſons would take away all occaſions of contentions that might ſpring from old pretenſions, gives us likewiſe preſcription of time, which being expired, declares the things in controverſie to be under the dominion of the laſt poſſeſſor; But I admit not this violence, much leſſe beleeve it to have bin a degree to the firſt <hi>Signiories:</hi> For, if it be true, that golden ages firſt were and afterwards degenerated, 'tis ſtrange to me, ſince I finde them not now degenerated nor abaſed, but rather reduced to a finer caract and a better ſtate than ever they were before in.</p>
                  <p>Nature deſires Monarchy and will needs have it; wee ſee not any one thing that depends not on another. The Sunne lords over the Planets, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong beaſts the Lion rules, and of birds the Eagle is ſoveraigne; The ſecondary cauſes alſo depend on one prime ſingular; the affects and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratures are ſubject to one predominating Element; the ſoule rules the body, the father his children and family; if then every litle houſe hath by nature its King, why ſhall not then a City, a Province, nay a whole Nation have one? The firſt that reduced men together, did it not to lord over, but to inſtruct and diſciplinate them; nor can indeed a Teacher diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge well the function of a Teacher, without juriſdiction over his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7474:37"/>
and the Heavens that would have a Monarchy among men, as in other things brought in for Monarches elevated wits, which were the firſt that began to overſway the depreſſed and ſervile: And though I did admit (which I doe not) that the ſtreame of Monarchies ſprung from the fountaine of tyrannie, yet might I gather thence the learning of good government by bad (as by the infirmity the medicine, and by it the reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of health) which being an ineſtimable treaſure, let us endeavour as much more to conſerve it, as in procuring its reduction from tyrannie to a legitimate and neceſſary Magiſtracie, whereby and by whoſe meanes man-kinde is governed and made happy. So farre therefore are thoſe that firſt ruled out of the reach of accuſation, that even antiquity it ſelfe hath (to eternize their memories) honoured them as Gods.</p>
                  <p>The people then ought (for the religious conſcience's ſake) to obey their Princes, and (for the naturall one) to doe the ſame for their owne peculiar intereſſes. Never was there State ſeene paſſe from one govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to another without its owne proper violence of Lawes or cuſtomes, which being ſo violated, breakes the peace, and ingenders factions and ſometimes inſurrections, by reaſon of the Subject's being reſtrain'd to new lawes and orders contrary to the firſt; a paſſion in Nature intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Beſides that, a new Prince, though he enter never ſo peaceably, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet otherwiſe chooſe but come arm'd, ſo as the Subject's goods and houſes remaine to be expoſed to the Souldiers, and juſtice in the hand of new Miniſters under new termes and lawes: And if the change chance to be from a bad Prince to a worſer, or from a good to a bad one, ſhould not then an indifferent and eaſie ſervitude be preferr'd before an heavy and intollerable one: The compariſon demonſtrating unto us, that a great difference in things, though of the ſelfe-ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> makes them become not onely unequall but oppoſite? My Lord (the Prince) counſels as a <hi>Druide,</hi> that which as a Prince hee ſurely would not doe, which is, that conſidering the confuſion and ill intelligence among Princes, and ſeeing the ſignes of the divine will to threaten (as it were) their ruine, it would prove their beſt courſe, quietly and patiently to endure the yoake of the divine will, and withall as willingly to ſubject themſelves to the hand of man for feare of periſhing. But I would faine know, who will or can aſſure me of the will of the Gods? or in caſe I might be thereof aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, yet who will calculate me the degrees thereof, or ſhew me the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of its extent? But will they needs have me undone howſoever? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, if I looke into my owne demerits, it will be no difficult matter to induce me to beleeve it, nay I doubt me, that by this reaſon moſt, if not all the world would be undone.</p>
                  <p>That then which concernes me to know more particularly, is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will deprive me of my dominion totally, or with it ſubject me to another, or neither this nor that, but afflict me with long warres? If no man can tell it me, how ſhall I then behave my ſelfe for not oppoſing the divine will? Nature teacheth me to defend my ſelfe. The Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid me not to doe it, and men will commend me for ſo doing; none will blame me for it ſave mine enemies, to whom only my vertue will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, for being prejudiciall unto them. If to conſerve my ſtate I bow my neck to the yoake of ſubjection, I ſhall then oppoſe the Gods, in caſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7474:37"/>
their will be to have me either afflicted or utterly ruined; the ſame may I ſay of any other election of mine. The Gods when they are diſpoſed to ſubject, ruine, or afflict me, will not ſend me <hi>Geniuſes</hi> to buzze or trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet it in my eares, they need no meanes, but can make my ſelfe ſerve for the inſtrument of my owne raiſing or downefall: yea my owne ill dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted actions will conduct, nay hurry me to the end prefixed me by their will; ſo as under ſuch a pretext to doe this rather than that, will give them cauſe, not onely to croſſe me, but to be withall juſtly diſpleaſed at me, for pretending to pry into that which is inſcrutable, whilſt I ſhould rather ſecond it with the meanes beſtow'd upon me, which is defence.</p>
                  <p>As for the reaſon, that Princes have no juſt title in their poſſeſſions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſing their comming by them anciently to have beene by violence, I would here faine know how the new may be termed juſt, if the old (juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by ancient poſſeſſion, with the preſcription of times, aſſent of ſubjects, and confirmed with blood oftentimes, ſpilt in defending it, yea with the death of the Princes themſelves) be unjuſt? And as touching the <hi>ſcene</hi> and its repreſentations, the Gods would not be ſpectators if there were no ſtage-players, whoſe parts to act, one Prince muſt <hi>defend</hi> if another <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile.</hi> But if there be this day any <hi>Prince</hi> obliged to the defence of his Subjects, you (Prince of <hi>Venedotia)</hi> are ſurely he, you having no brother, your father being ſickly and weake; your people left for a prey to their enemies, without any Prince, or defender. With which, proſtrating himſelfe at his feete, he proceeded. Therefore I humbly beſeech your Highneſſe, that, abandoning your incertaine deceivable conceits, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume the filiall affection that you have forgotten, the inclination of a Prince which you have left off, and the duty of a <hi>Cavalier</hi> by you ſome while ſithence abandoned. More he would have ſaid, but that his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſſe reſtrained him, ſo as, with an affectionate reſpect, kiſſing his knees, he beſought him with ſilence and teares more effectually, than he could have done by either perſwaſions or entreaties: But he graciouſly raiſing him up off the ground, after a ſhort pauſe, ſaid unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cataulo</hi> no more, ſince you have already by doing your duty taught me mine, and though ought otherwiſe than good ſhould come thereof, yet will I preferre the publick good before my owne private intereſſes; I thanke you for the paines you have taken, which ſhall not (on my word) prove to be ſowne in the ſands. Behold, I am now perſwaded to goe and reſtore my ſelfe to my father and Countrey, in hope the Gods will bee therewith well pleaſed: At theſe words, all of them riſing up did him humble reverence, with congratulating and prayſing the reſolution he had taken.</p>
                  <p>All that day paſſed they over exceeding joyfully, and the enſuing, the Prince (deſirous to know them) enquired who they were, eſpecially the young Knight, who now ſtanding in a muſe, diſcovered by his face a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed minde, he ſeeming at the inſtant of <hi>Feredo</hi>'s reſolution, to ruminate ſome till then unthought of deliberations, and to contemplate that ſite with greater curioſity than before. Of which new paſſion of his, the Prince taking notice, could not chooſe but tell him, that he much marveiled to ſee him ſo tranſported.</p>
                  <p>My Lord (with bluſhing thereat ſaid he) I beſeech your Highneſſe not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7474:38"/>
to take it ill I obey you not, my fortunes and quality being ſo meane, as the knowing them cannot be any way ſerviceable unto you; and though that the concealing thereof might diſadvantage me in the way of begging a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at your Highneſſe hands, nevertheleſſe ſuch is the opinion that I have of your generous and noble diſpoſition, that I hope you will grant it me by ſo much the willinger, by how much the leſſe my ſilence merits it; And withall, I ſhould thinke my obligation doubled to your Princely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, if vouchſafing to admit of my excuſes, you deeme me the leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous by beleeving, that I conceale my ſelfe for an urgent and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary occaſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feredo</hi> that by this young Knights Squire had ſecretly learn'd who he was, not caring to know thereof any further, anſwered him. Your aſpect (Sir) promiſeth ſo much, as your quality and unſeene merit cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injury be doubted of; therefore if the deſire I had to be acquainted with you onely to ſerve you, made me deſirous to know your being, the ſame now teacheth me to content my ſelfe with what beſt pleaſeth you, ſo as your ſilence ſhould no whit diſencourage you from commanding me, ſince it deprives me not of the will to obey you.</p>
                  <p>The young Knight bluſhing at this courteous anſwer, with doing him humble obeyſance, ſaid. I muſt then (my Lord) in begging this favour at your Princely hands, firſt tell you this much of my ſelfe, that being a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Gentleman exil'd from my Countrey, and in disfavour with my Prince, I thought (my heart indeede ſo giving me) when firſt I had the fortune to ſee you, that the tempeſt had brought me hither to ſhroude me here as in a ſanctuary: But ſeeing your Highneſſe now reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home, I bethought me of a new courſe, which was to implore of your liberality, the reſignation of this place under ſuch vaſſallage and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation as might ſtand beſt with your Highneſſe good liking.</p>
                  <p>Much wrought this requeſt on the noble heart of <hi>Feredo,</hi> who by his owne caſe had learn'd to have a feeling of that of anothermans; full loath was he to ſay his demand, nay, and yet having beene informed of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate love, he feared that the ſubſcribing to his deſire might turne to his prejudice; Taking him therefore aſide, hee praid him to acquaint him with the occaſion that moved him to ſettle himſelfe in that Iland: But ſeeing he could not draw any thing out of him, he then by laying before his eyes his owne example, counſelled him to alter his reſolution, for the ſuſpition or rather beliefe he had, that ſome deſperation had guided him to ſome ruinous reſolution; but the young man with a gladſome countenance aſſur'd him, no manner of deſperation now troubled him, any paſſion ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that way being cured by that climate, where it behoved him to ſtay ſome time, to take the benefit of that ayre for confirming it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feredo</hi> would not reſt ſatisfied with ſuch reaſons, neither would the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſt unto him his ſecrets, yet ſo much did he by the order and manner of his ſpeech diſcover, that the Prince might penetrate ſomewhat into his new love, or at leaſt free himſelfe of the ſuſpition he had of him before; obſerving now in him thoſe joyes, which cannot eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in thoſe enamoured hearts, which confidently hope for the full fruition of their deſires, ſo as, laying aſide all doubts, he beſtowed on him the houſe with all that was therein, with no other obligation but to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7474:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
acknowledge it the Prince of <hi>Feacia</hi>'s; ſo gladſome was the Knight of this gift, that he would by all meanes kiſſe his hands for ſo noble a favour.</p>
                  <p>As they two ſtood pleaſantly conferring together of divers ſubjects, their diſcourſe was interrupted by the trampling of two horſes, who (prick'd hotly on) thought by the ſwiftneſſe of their courſe to ſhunne the ſting of the ſpurre; the one fled from the other, and the foremoſt (being not able to rule his) ſuffered him to runne his breſt againſt the wall, and his fore-feete into a window of a houſe, that ſtood erected on that plaine, but thence fell downe ſo neere the wall, that his rider (tumbling down topſie-turvy with his head undermoſt) ding'd out his braines, and remained ſtone-dead in the place; The ſecond that purſued him, being already a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, ſeeing him quite dead, remounted on horſe-back, without doing him other harme, but turning back to encounter a great troupe of high-way the eves that made after him; and giving no eare to the <hi>Prince,</hi> (who courteouſly welcomed him thither) hee furiouſly galloped downe the hill, and ruſhing in among them, made of them ſo great a ſlaughter, that by that time <hi>Feredo</hi> arrived (who with the others came in ſpeedily to his ſuccour) the greater part of them lay dead in the field, the reſt (knowing themſelves inferiour in force, and ſeeing no poſſibility of running away) yeelded to the vanquiſher; who being weary, and in ſome parts of his body wounded, went and laid himſelfe downe on the ground, to recover his then well-neere-forlorne breath.</p>
                  <p>Before I tell you who this was, give me leave to let you know, how that the Princeſſe <hi>Elenia</hi> ſtaid a great while in <hi>Sardinia</hi> with <hi>Eromena,</hi> for being ſo fond each of other, as they could not part company; till at laſt the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied meſſengers from <hi>Elenia</hi>'s father, her duty, and deſire of ſeeing him after ſo many yeares, induced her to take her leave, ſhee parting obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, beloved, and preſented with rich gifts.</p>
                  <p>Her tenderly-loving father (that in her misfortunes had refined his love, by the experimented confirmation of the conſtant opinion he had of her goodneſſe) welcomed her with all thoſe expreſſions of a fatherly affection, which could be ſhewed towards an onely beloved and vertuous (though litle fortunate) daughter.</p>
                  <p>Her ſtep-mother having firſt heard of, and afterwards ſeene the reality of her merits, conformed her ſelfe in her entertainment both to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands will and her owne inclination. <hi>Don Eleimo</hi> was ſeene of her with ſuch an eye, as generous Princes are wont to behold with, ſuch as have loyally ſerved them, ſhee thinking it withall no ſhame to publiſh her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, and confeſſe her engagement to him; for which ſhee could never ſatiate her ſelfe in rewarding his merits, and gratifying him, though indeed ſhee thought all money too light for ſuch an uſe. But to <hi>Don Eleimo</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it on the contrary, that ſo great and accumulated favours, brought (in ſome ſort) a prejudice or blemiſh to the greatneſſe of his generous minde; and living perpetually in ſome meaſure tormented with an extreame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of going to ſeeke after <hi>Don Eulavio,</hi> whom he feared to be in a weake and ſuccour-needing fortune, he made ſuit to depart, obtaining at length by his aſſiduall importunity leave, though with much adoe, which but for that ſole occaſion he could not have obtained. And ſo away hee goes to travell, &amp; ſeekes him over all ſuch countries as his <hi>Genius</hi> directed him to;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7474:39"/>
and at laſt (after the ſpending of many yeares in the ſearch of him) found him out, and brought him to the Court of <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> where he reſolved to make a period of his travels, and to ſpend the remnant of his dayes, not truſting to the <hi>Catalan</hi>'s promiſes, but refuſing them, hee (baniſhing the too-tender affects to countrey and kinred) reſolved to let the world ſee, that he could live any where, and that <hi>a ſincere innate goodneſſe is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in forraine countries than in its owne.</hi> Needs would <hi>Don Eleimos</hi> by all meanes beare him company in his exile, to recompence in ſome meaſure his accompanying him in his misfortunes, the ſole occaſion of his ſo living a baniſhed man.</p>
                  <p>Impoſſible it were to deſcribe a happier life than this of theirs, both of them being ennobled Gentlemen of one and the ſame Countrey, nurſt up with the milke of one and the ſame Court, baniſhed for the ſelfe ſame cauſe, both alike magnanimous in enduring misfortunes, and in counting them inſtruments of their felicity, for having beene the meanes of joyning them together, the one ſerving to the other for father and brother, having but one and the ſame purſe, one intereſſe, and one heart. But <hi>Don Eulavio</hi> fortuning to dye a litle after, the other (deprived of ſo deſre a friend) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fortune not yet ſatisfied to have loaden him with perpetuall vexation of ſpirit, thought to lighten it with toyling exerciſes of his body; In ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment whereof, when hee had ſought after death through all the warres of the Weſterne, Northerne, and Southerne parts of the knowne world, and yet not found it; he reſolved to ſeeke then after new enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes in thoſe parts where the Sun riſeth, but being by a ſtorme wind-driven into <hi>Ericuſa,</hi> he happened (as he walked along the ſea-ſhore) to light on that good bird <hi>Cataſcopo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That villaine was fled from <hi>Arelate</hi> the very day before he ſhould have made a miſerable ſpectacle of himſelfe unto the popular eye, by paying with his death the debt due from the deeds of his miſchievous life. Hee had about him in his clothes a flat-faſhioned bottle of a certaine water of ſo ſtrange a vertue, that it made all the iron it but touch'd become inſtantly as brittle as glaſſe, which he had got from one, that having ſpent all his ſubſtance in alembicks, in hope of finding out the richeſt tranſmutation of mettals, had by chance lighted on this rare ſecret: Nor is it a thing to be wondred at, for ſuch men happen ſometimes (after many loſſes and much time and coyne ſpent in vaine) to meete by the way with many excellent things, without being therefore beholding either to other mens doctrine or their owne proper judgement. And this purchaſe came in that arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caitive his way, juſt as (returned from the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountaines) he lived in doubt how to diſpoſe of himſelfe, when he had counterpoyzed in a juſt ballance his Maſters nature with his owne foule demerits.</p>
                  <p>Having then oftentimes experimented the ſecret, and found it by proofe to be right and good for his purpoſe, he bought it, miniſtring thereby mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the poore <hi>Alchimiſt</hi> to waſte his braines about his endleſſe ſearch of his rich gold-hatching <hi>Elixar,</hi> though the others conſcience made him eſteeme this water farre more precious than the Philoſophers-ſtone itſelfe: yet never was he favoured with the opportunity of making uſe of it all the time of his long impriſonment in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> nor yet in <hi>Arelate,</hi> till the very night that ſhould have preceded his ignominious death; But then

being caſt into a low priſon not much peſtered with company (as in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places is uſuall and ordinary, to the end the condemned may diſpoſe of what they have, and prepare themſelves for death) he having by his waters vertue made brittle and beaten to pieces firſt his manacles and ſhackles, and then his heavy boults, eſcaped ſheere away: And then, not knowing either whither to goe, or what courſe to take, his worſe than bad inclination (depriving him of the leaſt good thought) brought him to rob on the high-way; but being weary of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> he paſſed the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and got into the faire Provinces of <hi>Auſonia,</hi> where growne to be for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy famous, he in a ſhort time aſſembled all the murtherers and theeves of that Countrey, by whom he being proclaimed king of the fields, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp'd the authority of commanding often contributions and exactions, not onely from Villages and Caſtles, but even from walled Townes and ſtrong Cities, till ſuch time as being deſirous of a ſtaid life, he entred into the pay of the <hi>Eugaenean</hi> Republick, entertained by them to confront o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theeves like himſelfe that peſtered their ſea coaſts; but hee neither obeying them in any thing committed to his charge, nor going whither he was by them directed and ſent, but buſying his braines about the ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Cities, that he might afterwards retire againe to his wonted haunts, and ſheltering groves, was ere he could execute his purpoſe ſet upon una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares by the <hi>Generall</hi> of that noble people, and conſtrain'd to flie away with but ſixteene of his conſorts, leaving the reſt a prey to the fiſh and Vulturs; whereof when ſixty of them were hang'd, the reſt were reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the galleyes: Hee in the meane time chanced to be wind-driven into <hi>Ericuſa,</hi> where lighting on a Barke (that launching out of the <hi>Illirian</hi> Bay, was bound for <hi>Peucetia)</hi> laden with horſes, he robb'd her of them, and then mounting thereon his confederates, was (as hee ſtood buſied in putting them in order to diſorder the Iland) unexpectedly arrived on by his old betrayed Maſter <hi>Don Elcimos,</hi> whoſe phyſiognomy and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, though not ſeene by him long time before, nevertheleſſe ſo ſtung his horrid conſcience with a feeling of his owne infamous treachery, as his eyes unable to endure the juſtice-menacing-lookes of his betrayed Lord, forced him to fly his preſence, but was as ſpeedily purſued by him, who with prompt counſell mounted on one of the very ſame horſes, and fiercely chaſed him, till the hapning of what hath beene already related.</p>
                  <p>Iuſt that very morning had <hi>Feredo</hi> put off his habit of Prieſthood, ſo as it was now lawfull for him in his comming downe to buckle on his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which hee alwayes kept in a by-roome for that purpoſe, thinking (nor did he therein thinke amiſſe) that ſuch a <hi>ſtore</hi> was <hi>no ſore,</hi> as might ſteede no leſſe a peaceable man in conſerving his quiet, than a man of a contrary inclination to a contrary uſe. Yet had hee now no occaſion to make uſe of them, the troupe of theeves being before he came, put to route and forced to yeeld; ſo as he needed to take no other care, than about <hi>Don Elcimos</hi> wounds, which though not very deepe, did yet ſomewhat trouble him in minde, becauſe he had not wherewithall to cure them; but the patient himſelfe making no reckoning of them, (for having beene uſed to be his owne Chirurgion) courteouſly thanking them all for their care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full loves, ſuffered himſelfe to be convayed to the houſe, where with Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine incorporated with the yoalke of an egge (an eaſie and ſoone made

medicine) hee in a few dayes cured himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Cauſing in that meane ſpace to be brought before him all <hi>Cataſcopo</hi>'s companions, and enformed by them at full of their quality and beeing, he determined to let them goe free, for not knowing what to doe with them; now, that he had already reſtored the horſes and barke to the Merchants that owned them: Having therefore admoniſhed and perſwaded them to leave off that wicked courſe of life, he licenſed them to depart, when one of them ſpeaking for the reſt, after having humbly thanked him for ſo great a favour, ſaid thus unto him.</p>
                  <p>My life's Lord, we have promiſed you to leave off the wicked life which hitherunto we have led, and that ſurely with a ſincere and fraudleſſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe (if nothing elſe induced us ſo to doe) our very being wearied therewith neceſſarily enjoynes us thereto, beſides the being impoſſible that fortune alſo be not as much wearied in conſerving us. But yet <hi>no man can be bound to doe more than he can doe,</hi> wee are now in ſuch a caſe as wee cannot live anywhere ſafe, ſince that the eye of juſtice being bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our paſt life, will (without making any reckoning of our preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall repentance) puniſh us whereſoever we be reſident. The propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore of reducing us to a civill life, is (though weebe moſt obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious thereto) a thing even unpoſſible for us to performe, ſince we enjoy not the leaſt aſſurance of our ſecure living by ſuch a life, our offences being innumerable, our enemies infinite, there being no Prince by us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offended, and our ſelves, though accuſtomed to toylſomneſſe and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, yet be not enured to the miſerableneſſe of poverty or want, the ſole motive that compels many men to take leude and deſperate courſes of life; Nay give me leave to tell you yet further, that any he of us that ſhall have the greateſt deſire to be reduced to a good courſe of life, cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thereto but by wicked meanes, (and that is) by the murthering of one or more of us his companions, without whoſe deaths it is certaine he is ſure not to obtaine the impunity of his delicts; therefore as it lay in your hands to give us both life and liberty, ſo may you alſo (if you pleaſe) conſerve thoſe lives of ours to a good uſe, without ſuffering them to be the meanes of greater miſdeeds. You have here <hi>Cataſcopo</hi> dead, his head (ſo your goodneſſe be pleaſed to give it us) is of a value ſufficient, not only to reſtore us to our liberties, and procure us our free pardon in our owne Countries, but alſo to raiſe us to a competent eſtate, which may ſerve us to live honeſtly withall, it being worth many talents which ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us equally ſhared.</p>
                  <p>This requeſt of theirs no whit diſpleaſed <hi>Don Elcimos,</hi> who freely granting it, gave them leave to depart with it, and uſe it as they pleaſed. Whereupon they taking it off the trunke, emblamed it to preſerve it from putrefaction, and then carried it to <hi>Parthenope</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of thoſe happy Countries, where (crowned with a counterfeit <hi>Diadem)</hi> it was placed on the principall Gate for a perpetuall example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Elcimos</hi> was courteouſly viſited of all, and eſpecially of <hi>Feredo,</hi> who having firſt heard <hi>Cataſcopo</hi>'s name, and then ſeene his wicked head, knew him for that of the Traytors: But becauſe <hi>Don Elcimos</hi> had need of repoſe, hee thought it unfit to trouble him with any diſcourſe till the day following, and then he acquainted him with his being alſo a perſonall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor

in the Tragyck-comedy of that vertuous Princeſſe <hi>Eleina;</hi> the other aſtoniſhed at ſo ſtrange an accident, (with humbling himſelfe before him more ſubmiſſively than before) told him, he was heartily ſorry to have had for companion in his miſeries ſo worthy a Prince, howbeit hee now beleeved the Gods had ſo many yeares reſerved <hi>Cataſcopo</hi> to make him in both their ſights an example of his juſtice, to ſatisfie both of them the debt due to their revenge, the Princeſſe being partly avenged before by his long impriſonment.</p>
                  <p>The Prince afterwards falling into diſcourſe of the generall affaires of the then-preſent times, and deſirous to know why <hi>Polimero</hi> lived an exil'd Prince, the Count of <hi>Bona</hi> not knowing how to conceale himſelfe, tels him what he was, relates unto him all <hi>Polimero</hi>'s affaires, and what had hapned him from his firſt parting from <hi>Sardinia</hi> even to his ſecond, where he continuing his diſcourſe, proceeded in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Arato</hi> remain'd ſo profoundly heart-ſtrucken with the death of Prince <hi>Peroſphilo,</hi> that not ceding in his love to him to the Queene his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would needs evidently teſtifie it, though not by being ſtarke fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick as ſhee was, yet by raving in ſuch a manner, that as oft as hee hapned to remember it, he (deprived of his underſtanding) ſpake and did things unworthy of his Regall quality; and if hee chanced to obſerve in any young Gentleman any extraordinary good parts, he would then inſtantly repine at them, as robb'd from his ſonne, and withall extreamely hate ſuch as owned them. But if there was any accompliſh'd Gentleman, that in bodily feature and excelling qualities exceeded all others, and paragoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed <hi>Peroſphilo,</hi> then ſurely that ſame one was the excellent <hi>Polimero,</hi> who returned from <hi>Mauritania</hi> with his wife and daughter, paſſed three yeares time without any notable diſturbance, his father-in-lawe's doting humour being not as then growne up to its full ripeneſſe, but increaſing proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably with his age, and by his remarking every day more than other in <hi>Polimero</hi> ſuch qualities as were peculiar in <hi>Peroſphilo,</hi> he began firſt to envy and then by degrees to hate him, till at laſt he grew to that paſſe, that hee could not endure the ſight of him.</p>
                  <p>In all things elſe <hi>Arato</hi> conſerved his ancient prudence with other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues wherewith he was well ſtored; nor were they alwayes obſcured with this frantick humour of his, which being a motion of the imagination con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ordinary motion of reaſon, prevailed onely then when reaſon (oppreſſed with this frantick humour) remained impedited in its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, free in any other thing where the minde was not obſtructed by its malignity, onely in this one thing he loſt, nay went beſides himſelfe, ſo as there was no man about him that could or durſt either ſhew him his error, or appeaſe or divert him from the paſſion of his no leſſe unreaſonable than violent deſire, either to ſee <hi>Polimero</hi> dead, or never to ſee him at all.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Expreſſe I would (if knew how) the faire <hi>Eromena</hi>'s griefes in their pure eſſence (eſpecially at her parting from her deerely-tendred girle) and the adorations which ſhee made her father to remove him from that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if the expreſſion of them were leſſe difficult than their imagination; yet this beteared privation neither augmented nor diminiſhed, onely it ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated his frenſie, for not diſcerning before which of the two it was that he hated; but now ſeeing himſelfe ridde of the one, which confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his judgement, in diſtinguiſhing the hatred he bare to the other, hee came to know that he had erred, the plummet of his paſſion falling not on <hi>Lindadori,</hi> but on <hi>Polimero;</hi> it may be, he would have thought the ſame of her if ſhee had ſtaid, becauſe the violence of the humour was come to ſuch a paſſe, as it paſſed all limits of diſcretion and judgement, the firſt effects of his infirmity taking up all his minde, and ſtaying it from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to any other operation. And withall, to contradict or diſſwade him from any of his <hi>Capricio</hi>'s, was as dangerous as booteleſſe, for then he becomming raging mad, both commanded as a King, and executed as an officer; the Court being taught by other mens harmes to ſhunne him in thoſe fits, or at leaſt to ſtand quiet without contraſting with him, who in the rage of his fury would have gone neere to have kill'd <hi>Eromena</hi> her ſelfe, had ſhee not prov'd as ſtrong in reſiſting as diſcreete in evading his furious paſſions.</p>
                  <p>The noble-hearted <hi>Polimero</hi> was therefore conſtrained to give his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour way, and to retire into <hi>Corſica,</hi> a kingdome (by his prowes) acquired and united to the Crowne of <hi>Sardinia.</hi> But becauſe <hi>Eromena</hi> went often to ſee him, the craſie-brain'd King, upon calling to minde the repining hate of the <hi>Corſes,</hi> the reaſon that <hi>Polimero</hi> had to deteſt him, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his reputation in both kingdomes, together with the neereneſſe of his affinity and alliance with the two neighbouring Kings of <hi>Majorica</hi> and <hi>Mauritania,</hi> reſolved not to have him by any meanes abide ſo neere him. And knowing that it was his beſt courſe to confirme his baniſhment with the authority of his Privie Councell (a prime article in the art of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7474:41"/>
to make other men the authors of things odious and diſpleaſing to the people) he call'd them unto him and told them:</p>
                  <p>That hee well knew that his kingdomes, and ſome (or perhaps all) of them there preſent diſliked his demeanour towards his ſonne-in-law (a <hi>Cavalier</hi> in all things elſe of royall parts, and reall worth) but yet that the reaſons moving him ſo to doe were of ſo high a conſideration, as would aſtoniſh them, were it but lawfull for him to publiſh them; That now then the ſame reaſon that before induced him to baniſh him from <hi>Sardinia,</hi> conſtrained him alſo now to exile him from <hi>Corſica;</hi> hee would have ſaid from <hi>Majorica</hi> and <hi>Minorica</hi> too, if in thoſe parts hee had had the ſame juriſdiction over him as King, as he had as predeceſſor and father-in-law; but where the one wanted, his intention and will was, that the other might ſupply its defects, with promiſing, that if (as a good ſonne) hee ſo made appeare unto him the reſpects and obſervance he owed him by this implicite obedience, not retiring into <hi>Majorica</hi> or <hi>Mauritania</hi> places by him ſuſpected, that then his ſuch obſequiouſneſſe ſhould ſerve as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to ſcrue into his favour by, and a prevailing Orator for obtaining leave for his more ſpeedy returne, <hi>telling them plainely</hi> therewithall, That his ſending for them to come to him, was not to aske their counſels, but to make them the authors of his, which he ſtraightly enjoyn'd them to execute in ſuch forme as beſt ſuited with the accompliſhment of his deſire.</p>
                  <p>The ſweetly-majeſticall Princeſſe that till that inſtant knew nothing of her fathers deſigne, remain'd blanke at ſuch an Oration; what to reſolve of ſhee knew not; contraſting with him being as perilous as profitleſſe, till at laſt with bending one knee, ſhee thus briefly beſpake him.</p>
                  <p>My Soveraigne Lord, there is no reaſon for any one to contradict your Royall will, and yet leſſe for me than any other; yet, becauſe I know that Prince <hi>Polimero</hi> is to you both a good ſonne, and a loyall ſervant; and that though declared for ſuch by your owne mouth, you are for all that reſolved to baniſh him; it is not fitting that I (being his wife) be here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to any ſuch decree againſt him, much leſſe by diſſenting to oppoſe any will or command of yours. Which ſaid, ſhee went her wayes out, though then neither her warlike ferocity, nor native generoſity was able in that delicate ſex to ſtop the lubrick channels of her eyes from dropping a few pearlike teares.</p>
                  <p>The King let her goe without ſpeaking any word to her, but ſeemed by his actions to expreſſe, that he would not have her know all; the decree was hard to be expounded, it being unpoſſible for colours to ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſubſtance. But that which made it the more difficult, was, that the King unwilling to expreſſe himſelfe, would yet have his intention effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as if they had underſtood him; which was the occaſion, that they there ſpent the whole day about it, the Secretaries being puzled in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning each his peculiar draught, and the King leaning on the ſhoulders while of the one and while of the other, was ever buſied in reading, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling or interlining, all-to-be-blurring and blotting it, as black and foule indeede was all that was there done. At length a long edict was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon, couched in abſtruſe words with an equivocall ſenſe, to make it the more difficult to be underſtood of any that would conſter it in the right and worſe ſenſe, plainely diſcovering abſolute authority in the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7474:42"/>
whole, juſtice never a whit, words enough without any kinde of ſenſe; The contents of as much as might be underſtood thereby was:</p>
                  <p>That Prince <hi>Polimero</hi> was at the requeſt of the Privie Councell baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both kingdomes (during his Majeſties pleaſure) for ſecret reaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the State: In this decree were involved particular letters from ſome of the Councell to <hi>Polimero,</hi> wherein were plainely expreſſed their unwilling ſorrow to be drawne to ſubſcribe to ſuch a reſolution, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to retire to ſome place unſuſpected, farre diſtant from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Majorica</hi> and <hi>Mauritania,</hi> from which it lying not in their power to baniſh him, they did as good as pray him to baniſh himſelfe, otherwiſe that the puniſhment of his tranſgreſſion would be, his being deprived of all hope of ever being recalled againe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eromena</hi> preſently upon her going out (as I told you) from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, gave order that (whilſt ſhee arm'd her ſelfe) the fleeteſt galley that then rode in the bay ſhould be made ready to part ſuddenly; nor knowing how otherwiſe to evaporate the bitterneſſe of the anger ſhee conceived againſt her father, ſhee wrote him a letter, and then accompanied onely with <hi>Aretia</hi> and a few ſervants, ſhee went to the port, where turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that had attended her thither, ſhee ſaid unto them.</p>
                  <p>Countrie-men and friends, I goe in expedition of a buſineſſe that much imports both yee and me, I leave you in a ſetled peace, and recommend to your care, obedience, and love, the King and Realme; and you <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Toralba</hi> I ſhall enjoyne to deliver the King this letter.</p>
                  <p>The people that no leſſe loved than honoured her, ſeeing her arm'd at all peies (a habit not uſed to be worne by her, ſave in time of warre or tourneyes) remain'd amaz'd thereat, kiſſing with all affectionate reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſome her faire hands, and other ſome the skirt of her baſes; but ſhe cauſing the ladder to be hoiſt a-boord the galley, that none might follow her, went a-boord the long boate, and then (without permitting either the Ghing to ſalute, or any Trumpet to be touch'd) launch'd out, ſteering a direct courſe for <hi>Sardinia,</hi> where the ſecond day ſhee ſafely arrived, and being there landed, would not ſuffer any other meſſenger than her ſelfe to bring her husband the newes of her arrivall thither.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Polimero</hi> abode in <hi>Corſica</hi> adored by all, inſomuch as even thoſe, to whom (by occaſion of the warres) he had beene ſomewhat prejudiciall, ſeeing now in ſo many occaſions his royall demeanour, grew to be ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate towards him, as that they accounted their loſſes well imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for having made ſo advantageous an exchange of <hi>Epicamedo</hi> for him: And though his domeſticall affaires, as the privation of his wife and daughter much troubled his minde, yet the noble company of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Oriſtanio</hi> &amp; other accompliſh'd Gentlemen much ſollaced him, who alſo diſcreetly endeavoured to weane his mind from griefe, by being alwayes employed in ſome exerciſe or other.</p>
                  <p>And now it ſo pleaſed fortune, that he was that day rode forth on hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that very ſame way that <hi>Eromena</hi> came galloping to finde him out, who hearing the winding of the hornes, and deepe crie of the hounds, imagined what was there a doing; following therefore the crie, ſhee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unawares juſt as the Prince, the Marqueſſe, and I were alighted to the fall of a goodly Stagge: Shee leaping from off her horſe into her
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7474:42"/>
husbands armes (that with great amazement was by then runne to helpe her downe) having affectionately kiſſed him with out anſwering to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of her ſudden comming, would needs come benignely to greete us and all the reſt one after another.</p>
                  <p>The Prince moſt glad of this unexpected encounter, ſaid unto her; Your comming (ſweete Lady of my bliſſe) cannot prove but moſt welcome and happy unto me, be it for what occaſion it will; though in token of my extreame content I cannot (at this preſent) dedicate to your welcome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the life of this <hi>Hart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The tired beaſt lay on the ground expecting his death with beteared eyes, grieving perhaps, that Nature having beene liberall in enduing him with ſo long a life (if what is thereof reported be true) humane cruelty for an inhumane delight corrupted his enjoying it, without the curioſity of as much as trying in him, whether his life could extend it ſelfe to many ages; whether hee had in himſelfe any ſuch diſcourſe or no I know not, though I well know, that the gentle <hi>Eromena,</hi> accoaſting and ſeeing him a goodly one, and to ſeeme (at the very point of death) to begge favour at her hands, anſwered: Be your preſent (my endeer'd Lord) waited on by a good augury, which I accept with a better, and will (ſo pleaſe you) that he live: with this, calling for the huntſmen, ſhee asked them what yeares he might be of; But becauſe the Gods gave us the world in controverſie, not excluding as much as thoſe things whereof practique and obſervation are our maſters, they could never accord about his yeares, by reaſon of their diſagreeing in the markes of his age: The beliefe then of knowing any thing certaine, ſo as others thinke they have not their certainties to contradict it, is a beliefe notoriouſly falſe.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſſe (whoſe minde was buſied in a more important thought) remounting with the reſt, rode towards the Citie, where being come, ſhee would needs have the Marqueſſe and my ſelfe to be partakers of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation contained in a few words: By which ſhee unfolded her fathers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate minde, her departing without his leave, and reſolution to live and dye with her husband; diſcourſe there was enough, without (for all that) ſo much as once propoſing any thing that ſavoured of violence; the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe and I being old enough to know what are the troubles of a civill warre, eſpecially of ſuch a one which (for all the reaſons making for it) cannot but bee unjuſt againſt a father with the ſchiſme of ſubjects and ſtates; and they though young, and undeſervedly hardly uſed, being yet of a ſweete nature, patiently bare with the author of their injuries, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to ſuffer, than to endeavour to avenge or right themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The whole difficulty conſiſted in the choyſe of a place to reſide in; for <hi>Majorica</hi> and <hi>Mauritania</hi> being prohibited, they knew not whither to betake themſelves; wee argued a long time whether or no it were her beſt courſe to follow him, and leave the Realme in the hands of a frantick father, whoſe infirmity might encourage the <hi>Corſes</hi> to attempt innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſpurr'd on by the <hi>Tingitan</hi> with promiſes of men and ſhipping. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the ill conſtitution of <hi>Sardinia</hi> whoſe dangers were manifeſt, by reaſon of the intelligences of <hi>bandities</hi> (beeing the reliques of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls conſpiracie) who, back'd by the <hi>Tingitan,</hi> daily wrought and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded their kinsfolkes and allies to revolt; which once hapning, who
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7474:43"/>
alas was there then to ſuſtaine the ruine, ſhee being farre off, the <hi>Corſes</hi> become rebels, and the King for his weakeneſſe contemned? theſe reaſons the Princeſſe would neither give eare to, nor admit of. <hi>Polimero</hi> knowing them to be good as he oppoſed them not, ſo contradict his wife hee durſt not, yet wiſh'd he that ſome body elſe would perſwade her to ſtay: but becauſe the decree was not as yet come thither, and that for the executing thereof there was no neceſſity of an immediate departure, they reſolved to ſtay till it came, their deliberations in the meane while ripening with the priviledge of this ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arato</hi> gone out from the Councell, was by the Earle of <hi>Toralba</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with <hi>Eromena</hi>'s letter, whereat he asking if ſhee could not come to ſpeake to him her ſelfe? No (my Liege) anſwered the <hi>Count,</hi> for ſhee is ſome two houres ſince gone aboord the vice-admirall and lanch'd out without acquainting any body whither ſhee went, but for ought was ſeene ſhee made towards the Promontory of the Eaſt. <hi>Arato</hi> confuſed in mind opened the letter, which I afterwards often read, ſo as I beleeve I ſhall not faile much in repeating it, whoſe tenor was ſuch.</p>
                  <p>My Soveraigne Liege, I goe to <hi>Corſica</hi> to finde out <hi>Polimero,</hi> a husband taken by me by your Royall aſſent, a Prince every way worthy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd, to whoſe vertue and prowes the kingdome owes its conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and you both the Crowne of <hi>Corſica</hi> and <hi>Peroſphilo</hi>'s revenge. I know not whether I ought or no to excuſe my ſelfe for departing without your Royall leave, nor yet in caſe I ſhould, know I to whom to doe it, to a King, or to a father; your Majeſtie uſing towards me the power of the diſtinct perſon of a King, and quite debarring me from the priviledge of the other; I well know that I ſpeake to a <hi>King,</hi> yet forget I not that I am a <hi>Kings</hi> daughter and heire, and that I ought to be uſed as ſuch a one. I am ſure I have ever honoured you as a daughter, ſerved you as a vaſſall, and borne with your paſſions in ſo obſequious a manner, as other than ſuch as have the gift of obedience (as I have) could not have done. I will not (my Liege) exaltmine owne merits, though the having the power to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe and not to doe it, is in ſome reſpects eſteeme-worthy. Onely I muſt tell you, that as I have from you the right of the Realmes ſucceſſion by nature, ſo have you from me the poſſeſſion thereof by prowes, for (though as then a may den) I onely with the aſſiſtance of Prince <hi>Polimero</hi> ſaved both it to you, and you to it; and did (when your infirmities brought you to be uncapable of holding its ſcepter) binde it to your hand, and with my owne hands faſtened on your head the kingdomes Crowne: whereas you now ſuffer your ſelfe to be upbraided, rather than you will acknowledge, much leſſe remunerate the deſerts of others, ſo conſtraining mee to leave you for your unjuſtly-depriving me of my husband, and more cruelly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaving me of my daughter, to whom by the Lawes both of God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the mother is ſo expreſſely bound to tender and bring up; from which ſince I cannot otherwiſe conjecture, than that your pleaſure is to live all alone in the world, I leave you to live ſo (in Gods name) and pray Heaven (to the end you may the longer live) to ſhowre on you all content and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. <hi>Eromena.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This letter wrought not that effect that reaſon required it ſhould, for, the King more enraged for it than before, would (by all means)
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7474:43"/>
diſinherit his daughter, ſuſpending the decree againſt his ſon-in-law, with an intention to unite them in the fault, that ſo he might winde them both in one puniſhment; ſo as it was very difficult to weane him from that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, with the conſiderations of his being aged, his having no other childe, and the being of no other Princes of the blood to ſucceede him, have the Marqueſſe of <hi>Oriſtanio,</hi> who was not onely old and iſſueleſſe, but above all others the moſt faithfull ſervant to <hi>Eromena</hi> and her husband: Beſides the being of <hi>Corſica</hi> in dange to be loſt, for, being environed with enemies, and bereft of her friends, unleſſe it yeelded to the ſubjection of the <hi>Tingitan,</hi> the onely meanes to deprive (together with his daughter and grandchilde) himſelfe alſo of the <hi>Sardan</hi> Crowne, ſince other than he would never accept of a kingdome in the midſt of the ſea, ſo farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, with ſo many difficulties, and undergoe the charge and trouble of defending it from ſo many enemies, which were <hi>Right,</hi> the <hi>Corſes,</hi> the <hi>Moores,</hi> and the <hi>Balears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King bare an innate hatred to the <hi>Tingitan,</hi> than whom hee knew no other would have accepted the proffer of ſucceſſion, being ſo deere a purchaſe, conſidering the danger &amp; charge wherewith it was to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; but that which moſt of all vexed him, was, to thinke that his children in all probability would (if all other helpes failed) put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (out of meere deſperation) under his protection, which hee would not ſee come to paſſe for as much as his life was worth. Doubting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, leſt they ſhould ſettle themſelves in <hi>Corſica,</hi> and bee there crowned, he commanded his horſe and foote to be ſuddenly muſtered, marching himſelfe in perſon towards <hi>Luogodori,</hi> followed by all the Nobility and attended by his Councell. Hee received by the way the Marqueſſe of <hi>Oriſtanio</hi>'s letters with newes of the Princeſſe's arrivall, and how that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the decree againſt her husband, ſhee prepared to accompany him in his baniſhment: Hence taking occaſion he ſhewed him the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and inconveniences that might thence ariſe, diſplaying before him his ſonne-in-lawes merits, with the advantages hee had in keeping him neere him.</p>
                  <p>The King was upon theſe newes ſomewhat pacified that his daughter departed not for any evill intent of doing him any hurt, yet not quite freed from ſuſpitions, and reſolved not to ſuffer <hi>Polimero</hi> to live either at home or neere him, hee wrote to the Marqueſſe, ſending him the Councels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and commanding him to put it in execution, compoſed nevertheleſſe of moderate words, as if he deſired rather to triumph over his ſonne-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawes obedience, than to harbour any intention of keeping him long a farre off him; The ſame made he his daughter alſo beleeve, writing unto her a kinde letter, and recalling her home with the hope of her husbands ſpeedy returne.</p>
                  <p>Theſe letters being read, <hi>Polimero</hi> knew not what to reſolve of, well conceiv'd hee that the humbling himſelfe to his father-in-law could not but be imputed unto him for glory, ſo as the ſatisfying of his deſire trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him not, but to be deprived of a beloved wife, &amp; debarr'd of either ſeeing his daughter, ſaluting his brother, or viſiting his father, without knowing whither to betake himſelfe, was that which tortured him much, but much more <hi>Eromena,</hi> who not caring for her father, was reſolved to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7474:44"/>
neglect all other affaires and follow him; company (God wot) of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to him the deereſt, and incomparably moſt deſired, but yet neither expedient or neceſſary; Oppoſe her (as I have already ſaid) hee would not, love being a thing too too delicate, and too much incumbred with feares and jealouſies; Who knowes (thought he with himſelfe) but that prudence may be by her conſtrued for an effect of ſmall love, which (for being blinde) neither ſees nor admits of vertues if they thwart it, nor any other affect ſave it ſelfe? But the Marqueſſe and I wrought ſo much, that wee both perſwaded the one, and diſpoſed of the other. The agreement was, that ſhee ſhould ſtay, becauſe that beſides her watchfulneſſe over the ſtate-affaires, ſhee might light on an opportunity of procuring his more ſpeedy returne, and that he ſhould travell towards the Eaſt, where having ſpent ſuch time as he pleaſed in ſeeing of forraine countries, hee might (in caſe his returne were not by that time procured) make his abode in ſome part of <hi>Greece; Athens</hi> was named for the place of correſpondencie, whither were to be directed, ſent, and conveyed their letters, meſſengers, and monies. Of this his reſolution to part, they ſent the King word, to free him (as much as in them lay) of his doubts and jealouſies, which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe alſo ſignified unto him by writing, praying withall leave to ſtay there till her husbands departure, wherewith hee was well contented, not abandoning (for all that) the ſight of <hi>Corſica,</hi> but ſtanding alwayes in a readineſſe with his Army, and Galleyes preſt to croſſe the channell if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion requir'd.</p>
                  <p>The few dayes that the Prince ſpent with his wife were by her paſſed in qeeping and heavineſſe, which made us endeavour to haſten his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that ſo ſhee might the leſſe waſte her ſelfe with the imagination of this privation; but the day being come, ſhee ſaid thus unto him.</p>
                  <p>I ſee then (my Lord) you will goe, and leave behinde you your <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> which wanting you will want both heart and ſoule, impoſſible will it be for her to live being ſeparated from you, or if any thing keepe her alive, it muſt needs be the hope of ſeeing you againe ſhortly. I am ſorry that her love hath ſo ſmall intereſt in you, as that other conſiderations exceede it; ſuch force have they not in her, whom if you permit to goe along with you (as by your mutuall affection ſhee thereto conjures you) no loſſe (though it were the heavieſt that could be by any imagination conceived) ſhall then taſte bitter in her pallate, might it be but ſugred with the unexpreſſable ſweetneſſe, which ſhee ſhall receive in being preſent to ſerve you; with that word ſhe affectionately kiſs'd him without ceaſing to importune him with more earneſt entreaties mingled with her teares, till hee being no longer able to refraine from accompanying her in the weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-expreſſion of her heavineſſe, return'd her this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>I part hence (deere directreſſe of my deſtiny) 'tis true! but not ſo, as not to have you continually with mee; the tempeſt of my travels ſhall ever have repoſe in the pleaſant calme of your ever-deere memory, the onely ſoveraigne cordiall to my misfortunes; which without it would ſinke me into the gulfe of an unmedicable deſpaire; as for my love I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine how you can in the beſt manner doubt of it, or how you can but imagine that I can preferre any neceſſity how urgent-ſoever before that of enjoying your preſence, ſince it is in you onely that I both joy and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7474:44"/>
live. But if ſuch whoſe judgements are not clouded with our paſſions hold it convenient, the execution of it then depends on you; for, I not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the power to diſcontent you in any thing, would much more unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly diſpleaſe you in that whereon all my content and joy depends.</p>
                  <p>Their kiſſes confuſed among their teares were numberleſſe, their grievings meaſureleſſe, all in extreames and endleſſe. But goe hee needs muſt howſoever; I would have had our departure to have beene about midnight without making any words of it, but that the Marqueſſe would not; laying before our eyes the diſtaſte which ſhee would have conceived threat, beſide the being unpoſſible for us to ſteale away whilſt ſhee lay aſleepe, for ſhee as then never clos'd her eyes; the laſt parting-words were <hi>Polimero</hi>'s concerning his daughter, which were not well heard of any, or at leaſt I was ſo heart-ſtucken with their griefes as I heeded them not; but I ſuppoſe that their purport were to adviſe her not to take away their daughter from her uncle, as long as <hi>Arato</hi> continued in his madde whimſees.</p>
                  <p>Arrived that we were in <hi>Greece,</hi> I would by all meanes paſſe further on, and accompany him whitherſoever he went: But no ſooner came wee to <hi>Athens,</hi> than that he made me returne back to bring tidings of him: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I went, and carried firſt to <hi>Mauritania</hi> to the King his father the packet I had for him, and thence paſſed over into <hi>Sardinia,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with his letters and my relations comforted <hi>Eromena,</hi> I found unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly the King a quite altered man; for hee not onely (contrary to his wonted cuſtome) vouchſafed to admit me to his preſence, but alſo with great tenderneſſe kindly asked me how his ſonne-in-law did. And I being afterwards deſirous to goe to <hi>Maurica</hi> to ſee the young Princeſſe, he hearing her but named, was ſuddenly moved with a paſſionate tenderneſſe of affection, which made him (after he had ſtood a pretty while ſilent) ſay thus unto me:</p>
                  <p>My Lord, you ſhall doe me a ſpeciall courteſie in thanking the King of <hi>Majorica</hi> and Prince <hi>Metaneone</hi> his ſonne-in-law for the favours I receiv'd from them in my <hi>Lindadori,</hi> and to tell them, that I meane ſhortly to ſend to fetch her away, which friendly office I would have now pray'd you to have done me, if I thought that you could paſſe with her hither in ſafety. But our ſeas being full of the veſſels of the <hi>Tingitan,</hi> I doubt ſhee cannot ſafely be conveyed hither without a fleete, and I hope that to ſtrengthen the convoy, both he and the King of <hi>Mauritania</hi> will for ſuch an occaſion prove ſo courteous, as to lend me their galleyes. The Princeſſe (hearing this) ranne to kiſſe his hands, and he courteouſly (lifting her up) kiſſed her on the cheeke, promiſing her to performe it the next Spring, willing her (in the meane time) to take the charge of putting all the galleyes in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, and me on his behalfe to write to <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and to further the offices which he would cauſe to be there done by his Embaſſadour; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that he would to that end ſend by me letters to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Majorica.</hi> And further promiſing her (on his Royall word) that when this were done, he would (for the accompliſhment of her content) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately recall Prince <hi>Polimero,</hi> aſſuring her, that he was already well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that he came when he thought good.</p>
                  <p>Having heard this good newes, and ſent them in writing to <hi>Polimero,</hi> I
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7474:45"/>
went to <hi>Majorica,</hi> where I found the no more now <hi>Lindadori,</hi> but <hi>Donzella Deſterrada,</hi> ſo diſpleaſed at her grandfather, as that ſhee openly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, that ſhee would never ſee him more; which I at firſt conceiving to be ſome by-phraſe that ſome Lady had taken pleaſure to teach her to ſay by rote, perceived it afterwards to be no ſuch matter, ſithence her uncle and aunt, and all the reſt with perſwaſions, and pretty alluring toyes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to winne her to the contrary, though to no purpoſe; for, the generous girle, by reciting the occaſions ſhe had to diſaffect him, ſhewed, that ſuch conceits were her owne, and not infuſed into her by others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arato</hi> (by this time fully returned to his ſenſes) not onely diſliked his former extravagancies, but was ſorry that hee heard no newes from his ſonne-in-law, who (not making account to returne till after his father-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawes death) was parted for <hi>Greece,</hi> with a reſolution to ſurvey the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the earth, leaving in <hi>Athens</hi> his letters which were received of <hi>Eromena,</hi> with that heavineſſe which an interrupted hope brings with it. Faine would ſhee have gone in perſon to ſeeke him out; but <hi>Arato</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing no more now the authority either of a King or father, ſhewed her ſo many diſſwaſive reaſons, and ſo earneſtly entreated her to the contrary, that ſhe yeelded to his perſwaſions upon the uncertainety of finding him out.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Donzella Deſterrada</hi> were galleyes a trimming, and new ones a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in three ſeverall <hi>Arcenalls;</hi> meane while the <hi>Tingitan</hi> had his ſpies every where, it being ordinary with him to ſpend more on them than on his ſouldiers.</p>
                  <p>The South hath for its ſcourge the <hi>Tingitan,</hi> as the North hath the <hi>Scandinavian,</hi> who for their age, nature, and ends, a man would take for one and the ſame thing; In thoſe parts the one enjoyes all, in theſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confounds, entangles and devoures all that he can; ſhewing himſelfe very liberall to the corruption of States, taking example from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an humane body, after which followes ſickneſſe, and after ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe death. Being fortunate in having an advantage over all other Princes, not one of them uſing ſuch pollitick reaches and cunning wayes in gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as he doth; for which ſole reaſon he would by this time have gotten into his ſubjection all that part of the world, if the great body of his dominions, and monſtrous diviſion of its members (which in maintaining themſelves contraſt with nature) had not made the end of his deſignes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible. The three kingdomes of <hi>Majorica, Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania</hi> lye ſo neere and fit for him, that he thinkes himſelfe no King till hee acquire thoſe, ſo as he hath many complices in every of them, brought to bee at his devotion by penſions and hopes which many times prevaile more than even preſent gifts themſelves; for, when Kings governe after the manner of ancient times, when there were not any ſuperior forces, without altering upon new occaſions their old forme of government, they doe (in ſome ſort) foreſhew their downe-fall; whereupon the more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, aſpiring to the raiſing of their owne particular fortunes, cannot chooſe but deſire if not attempt the ruine of their Prince and Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tingitan</hi> then having underſtood by theſe his ſpies, the ſecret pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the fleete with the occaſion thereof, was exceeding glad of it, and being rich of invention hatch'd many projects, whereof he would be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7474:45"/>
well content if but any one tooke effect. Firſt then he ſent Embaſſadors to all three, to expreſſe how ſorry he was, that the pirates (without any feare or danger) inſolently ſcoured all the coaſts, and commanded the ſea, whilſt their galleyes (to the common prejudice) lay rocked in their havens, of three things therefore he demanded any one, that they would agree to, (which were) either that they would cleare the ſeas alone, or unite themſelves with him, or elſe give way to him to cleare them alone at his owne ſole charge, which he would doe, upon condition, that the parts of all three ſtood open and free for him, and that withall his fleet might have for money ſuch proviſion as it ſhould ſtand in need of.</p>
                  <p>This embaſſie was by the wiſer States-men taken for a martiall defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the Embaſſadours reputed for Harrolds, who entertaining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the charge of the Kings, (under pretext of ſtaying for new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions) pried into the ſecrets of the King and State that entertained them, the <hi>poaſts</hi> and veſſels of intelligence (in the meane while) going and comming inceſſantly without any buſineſſe; long it was ere the anſwers were return'd, by reaſon of the Kings communicating them betweene them, that ſo they might the better accord on them; for which end I was ſent from Prince <hi>Metaneone</hi> to <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and thence to <hi>Mauritania.</hi> The ſumme of their contents was;</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Tingitan</hi> complain'd of what they had farre more reaſon to complaine of, none of them having to doe in that buſineſſe. Sithence as for the Kingdome of <hi>Majorica,</hi> that (alas!) could not be tearmed other than a <hi>point</hi> (as it were) in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and withall ſtood ſo farre diſtant from <hi>Africk,</hi> as there was no reaſon to charge it, where it had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther utility nor intereſt. That the parts neereſt it were the <hi>Tingitans</hi> now acquiſts in <hi>Iberia,</hi> and the fartheſt off it <hi>Africk</hi> it ſelfe, being the <hi>Tingitan</hi>'s ancient poſſeſſion, ſo as the defence thereof concerned him moſt, the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates (a few excepted) being his naturall ſubjects, and neſted in his owne ports, where he might (if he pleaſed) take them without a fleet; a deede well becomming both the juſtice of a good King, and power of a great <hi>Monarch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame was anſwered for <hi>Sardinia,</hi> for being ſeparated from <hi>Africk</hi> and its commerce; ſhee trafficking and trading with the oppoſite ſhores of <hi>Gaule, Liguria,</hi> and <hi>Auſonia;</hi> adding, that ſhee was ſorry for the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent roaving of the pirates, whoſe pride ſhee would be glad to ſee abated; yet held it not fitting to doe with more that which well might as well be done with leſſe; eſpecially ſince each by himſelfe (but with an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous accord) might in one and the ſame time purſue and extirpate them, if the neighbouring Kings would but accord as well to doe good, as they did to effect what was evill: which was not indeede to be hoped for, becauſe the pirates being his ſubjects and harboured in his ports, had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencie with many great ones, and (what imports more) the ſpeech went, that they were countenanced by him himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>And for <hi>Mauritania</hi> the anſwer was, That ſhee wondred at his demand, ſhee ſuffering no dammage by ſuch raſcally ſea-ſcummers, who having their abode in <hi>Tingitana,</hi> lye lurking onely for the ſhipping of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> from whom they got more than they were like to get from his, and whoſe being ſo moleſted and hindered, redounded to the <hi>Tingitan</hi>'s no ſmall
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7474:46"/>
profit, the greater part of them being ſuch as before were his ſubjects, and colourably pretend to be rebels againſt him; beſides, that in caſe ſhe were any way incommodated by them, ſhee would not expect to be led on or aſſiſted by any other, but would with her owne ſole forces &amp; power cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe them conformable to their demerits. So might the <hi>Tingitan</hi> alſo doe (if he liſted) being potent enough to effect it, without borrowing forreine galleyes, or needing the uſe of forreine havens.</p>
                  <p>This laſt anſwer netled the <hi>Tingitan</hi> more than the other two, which he had made knowne to the world too; but that hee had enough to doe elſe-where, yet being deſirous to lay a foundation to the ruine of that kingdome confining with him by a long ſpace of ground, beſides its being that of his, its competitor by name, and ancient enemy by neighbourhood, he bethought himſelfe how to gaule him another way, without making any ſhew of it, and that was, by putting in execution a conceit of his, ſprung from his fertile braine many yeares before.</p>
                  <p>There ſtands Eaſt of <hi>Mauritania</hi> the Iland <hi>Melita,</hi> of a moſt ſtrong ſcituation, under the command of a particular Prince; many times had the <hi>Tingitan</hi> thought with himſelfe, that to ſeparate the countries, he had acquired in the Weſt of <hi>Europe</hi> from their aſſiſtants in the Eaſt, it behoved him to become Lord of the ſea, without which he was never able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his acquiſts, nor to pretend claime to the reſt, or live much above the common opinion of other ordinary Princes: But not knowing where to ſet footing, he was advertiſed, how that in this Iland (owning moſt ample ports, under the juriſdiction of a weake Prince) he might by ſending thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unexpectedly a ſtrange fleete, build a good fortreſſe, wherewith hee might not only ſhut up the ports on that part of that ſea, as he had block't up on the other part thoſe of the Ocean by his conqueſts in <hi>Iberia,</hi> but alſo make way to the conquering of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and by it to that of <hi>Auſonia,</hi> barring up the paſſage betweene <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> and penning in the Ilands within it, together with <hi>Mauritania,</hi> ſo as all thoſe Kings could never hope to be ſuccoured by other than their owne forces.</p>
                  <p>This project till now being (as I ſaid) immature in the fertile ſoyle of his braine-plot, grew upon this occaſion to be fully ripened; for, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together his galleyes (under pretence of ſending them againſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates) and ballacing them with tooles and materialls to build withall, he firſt ſcouring amaine along thoſe coaſts, paſſed before <hi>Majorica</hi> and <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia</hi> to terrifie them, and then (with his ſayles ſwollen with a faire ſtiffe gale of winde) went and landed unawares at port <hi>Euro</hi> in <hi>Melita,</hi> where (diſembarking his troupes) hee in a few dayes built a fortreſſe, which at this day is unexpugnable. To the Prince's Embaſſadours (that came to know what that fleete pretended was anſwered, that the King of <hi>Tingita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> taking into his carefull conſideration the ſafety of that ſea, becauſe of the large ſhare of dominions hee had thereabouts, (deſirous to cleanſe it from pirates, and underſtanding that the Prince of <hi>Melita</hi> kept ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a port in danger of being ſeiſed on by ſome forreine power for want of being fortified) had ſent to build the ſconce they there ſaw, for the good of the Iland, Prince, and all the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Kings: A charity by the Embaſſadours judged tyrannie and wicked hypocriſie, as if it were lawfull to rob and enjoy that which is another mans, for feare ſome other
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7474:46"/>
ſhould rob him of it and poſſeſſe it. To this they anſwered, that their owne Prince would make one himſelfe; whereunto was replied, that then he ſhould doe well to treate of it with their King, for that ſubjects were bound to execute ſuch orders as they received.</p>
                  <p>The walls being thus reduced to a defenſive forme, the Generall leaving there a ſtrong Garriſon and a Squadron of thirty galleyes, returned back, paſſing and repaſſing in a braving manner before the channell of <hi>Birſa,</hi> ſo to hinder <hi>Catalampo</hi> from joyning with <hi>Arato:</hi> It was my chance to bee then there, where I ſaw the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> King ſtand a good while in a muſe not knowing what to reſolve of; at length hee thought of diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching me into <hi>Sardinia,</hi> for counſelling <hi>Arato</hi> to ſend privily to fetch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the litle Princeſſe with a ſwift ſhallop under my conduct, ſaying, that <hi>in deſperate caſes unlook'd for attempts thrive beſt.</hi> Since he could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly unite himſelfe with him and <hi>Majorica,</hi> for being hindered by the fleete that coaſted his kingdome, but much more for the danger hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in, if when he wanted his fleete, the enemy came and aſſail'd him; beſides, that although they were joyn'd, yet lay it not in their power (ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they muſt have done in the open ſea) to ſhunne the fight, wherein if they chanced to have the worſt, then they loſt all, if the better, yet could they not reape from that victory other fruite than forcing the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to a retreate, their forces being too weake to aſſault him at his owne home, the ordinary diſadvantage of all thoſe that warre in defence.</p>
                  <p>Having received my inſtructions, I paſſed over to <hi>Sardinia</hi> upon a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley re-inforced to the full, where having delivered my embaſſage to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato,</hi> I added: That if the counſell ſeemed dangerous in his eyes, it might then very well be ſuſpended, there being not any urgent neceſſity that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired (for ought I knew) the returne of the Princeſſe in that inſtant, ſince that <hi>Metaneone</hi> and <hi>Eromilia</hi> tendred her deerer than any daughter of their owne, and would be loath to hazard her unneceſſarily to ſo great a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Vpon this <hi>Eromena</hi> ſeeming to ſparkle fire out of her eyes, turning towards her father thus beſpake him.</p>
                  <p>My Lord and Soveraigne, it is a foule ſhame for us to endure to be ſo braved and cubb'd in as we are; the returne of my daughter (though nor otherwiſe neceſſary than to enjoy the favour you have done me) ſhould be haſtened, were it but to let the <hi>Tingitan</hi> ſee, that hee with all his forces are not able to hinder it, my opinion therefore is, that embracing the King my father-in-lawes counſell, you ſend the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona</hi> to fetch her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>The King conſenting thereto gave order to the Admirall to arme ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly the ſhallop of the <hi>Royall,</hi> and to double-man her with the beſt and choyſeſt of the whole fleete. I embarked my ſelfe the very ſame night, leaving my owne galley riding in the bay, which made every one thinke, that I was in <hi>Caleri,</hi> the King giving out, that I was ſick, and cauſing a fame to be ſpread abroad by a moſt truſty phyſitian of his, that my diſeaſe was both infectious, very dangerous, and paſt all hope of recovery, with ſtrictly forbidding all men from comming to viſite me.</p>
                  <p>I, in the meane time (reſting neither day nor night, but changing rowers every five miles, and leaving ſome to repoſe themſelves whilſt the others laboured) arrived (by force of oares in the ſtill calm of ſummer with freſh
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7474:47"/>
ghing) at <hi>Majorica;</hi> where wondring to ſee me come in ſuch a veſſell ſo unexpectedly, they expected ſome bad newes after the ſubjection of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita;</hi> but the letters being read, they reſolved to deliver me, the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> that I might depart with her that very night; and ſhee (being already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the altering of her grandſires humour) was now moſt willing to returne; for though ſhee loved well her aunt, yet had ſhee a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee her mother; whom though ſhee did not otherwiſe remember than (as it were) in a dreame, yet hearing that ſhee was fierce and marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given, ſhee thought every houre an yeare till ſhee might feaſt her eyes with the delightſome ſpectacle of ſeeing her clad in compleate armour, that ſhe alſo might arme her ſelfe with her. Shee was then neere thirteene yeares of age, of a ſtature ſomewhat taller than ordinary, and withall ſo well proportioned, and in her deportment ſo gracefull, as that ſhee had not her equall; her manners and demeanour were formed altogether after the <hi>Idea</hi> of honour by nature, education, and hight of courage; for the reſt, ſhee was endued with peculiar pure ſpirits, and inclinations quite different to thoſe of all other girles, yea and unto her very ſex; It griev'd her to be a woman, becauſe ſhee could not endure man ſhould be term'd her ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, which made her profeſſe him open enmity. Love ſhee would and hate too without any mediocrity, friendſhip ſhee would have to exceede reaſon, and reaſon to be trampled under the feete of diſdaine; being all affects extreame, and unjuſt, but yet generous.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt then it was thought, that I (wearied with my ſea-voyage) lay ſleeping in bed, having taken leave of the King and <hi>Metancone,</hi> and of <hi>Eromilias</hi> teares (the children-princes and all the reſt knowing nothing of this my parting) I embarked this martiall girle, accompanied with one onely damoſell and two Knights: and returned (in the ſame manner as I came) without any breath of winde, when the third night the ariſing of a thick dusky cloud (the Moone then not appearing for being weary of running through almoſt all the Signes of the <hi>Zodiake)</hi> ſo deprived us of the benefit of our ſight, that in the maine ſea, we (thinking we were runne againſt ſome rock) fell foule on the larbur ſide of a fleere-galley of pirates, which (carried by the tide) fell towards us. The ſhallop entangled in the ſhrowdes could not put off, &amp; the pirates (perceiving themſelves ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bruiſed) fell to their Armes, and killing ſome of our Oare-men, became maſter of our ſhallop, ere wee could well put our ſelves in defence.</p>
                  <p>My griefe for this unexpected diſaſter cannot be deſcribed, whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportableneſſe would ſurely have forced me to drowne my ſelfe, had there not ſprung from my heart I know not what kinde of hope, which raiſed my ſpirits to that hight of boldneſſe, as to aske who they were, whereunto they as boldly anſwering mee, prov'd to be ſuch as I well knew; yet doubting leſt they ſhould violate the Princeſſe, I (turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the principall among them) ſaid thus unto him:</p>
                  <p>Captain, you have in your hands a prey of a great value, from which you may raiſe as great an utility, I beſeech you then to uſe her with all due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, for which I promiſe you ſuch a ranſome as ſhall well merit your being courteous unto her; upon this hee asking me who I was, I told him freely; and for the Princeſſe, though I once thought to faine her my daughter, yet doubting my being found a lyar, would redound the more
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7474:47"/>
to her prejudice, and knowing that the worſt was but a matter of ranſome, I preferr'd her ſecurity before any intereſt of treaſure whatſoever. Hee (glad of ſo rich a booty) promiſed me to uſe her with all the reſpects that could be, praying me onely to bring her aboord the ſhippe, where ſhee ſhould be well accommodated more at her eaſe in a convenient chamber.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſſe that from out the poope Roome of the ſhallop had heard all, yet ſpake never a word, till after ſhee had cauſed her ſelfe to be halfe cloath'd, ſhee asked who was there? whereupon I acquainted her with our misfortune, but yet told her, that we were in the hands of a noble fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that would not ſuffer her to be any way injured; whereunto ſhee (being very ſleepy and voyde of apprehenſion, peering out in the darke through the caban window, anſwered, that it was no great matter; yet changing her diſpoſition in an inſtant, with ſhaking off her drowſineſſe, and making a reflection upon my words, ſeeing before her the ſhippe and thoſe ſmotty-faces, ſhee concealing her diſdainefull anger, ſaid, ſhee would ſleepe no more, becauſe it was day, which by then was ſo indeede, the cloudes together with the night vaniſhing away for feare of the fiery looke of the approaching Sunne.</p>
                  <p>Then wee paſſed over into the ſhippe, where we were with intereſſed kindneſſe conveniently accommodated in the Caſtle of the poope, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being peſtred with any of their company, and bringing thither our bedding, they laid the Princeſſe's bed in a litle chamber, whereon ſhe lay a while in her clothes, cauſing her woman to lye downe by her.</p>
                  <p>The pirates ſearching our ſhallop, and finding nought there (ſave victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, our Armes, and the Princeſſe's Iewels) towed her along, having firſt aſſur'd her with ſix of their men to ſecure her from the rowers already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed.</p>
                  <p>At Sunne-riſing there began to breathe a gentle breath of winde, ſo as deſirous to ſpread the ſayles, one of the ſaylors came abaft to the miſen maſt neere us, and where the Princeſſe (come out of her chamber with her Gentlewoman, to ſhunne the ſweltry hot ayre of her caban) was laid her downe upon a quilt. This fellow being a luſty young lad (as ſoone as he eſpied them) in beaſtly manner threw himſelfe upon the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was neereſt him, ſtraightly embracing her to force a kiſſe from her, The Princeſſe not accuſtomed to ſuch ſports, ſeiſing on a whinyard ſhee ſpyed hanging at his ſide, ſtabb'd him with many thruſts, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endangering th Gentlewoman; the young fellow eſcaping out of her hands, lept downe, ſhewing of himſelfe a miſerable ſpectacle to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</p>
                  <p>The Caſtle of the poope was the ſtanding-place of the archers, and therefore well furniſhed with bowes, arrowes, ſpeares, and javelings to ſteede them in occaſions of boording. The Princeſſe tooke a bow in hand without any further intention, than to aſſay if ſhee had well learnt that art. Whilſt the pirates looking for no worſe than what was paſt, deſirous to chaſtiſe our boldneſſe, and not beleeving that ſuch ſtabbes were given by a maydens hand, would needs come up to us: wee (fortified by the oddes of our ſide) kept them off with halfe pikes wee there found, which (for all that) had done us but ſmall ſervice, if the Princeſſe had not ſecured us with her bow, whoſe aſcendent being <hi>Sagittarius</hi> it was no marveile, if
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7474:48"/>
ſhee never ſhot that ſhee either wounded or kill'd not.</p>
                  <p>I ſeeing the two ſides well defended, ſeconded the ſtout Princeſſe with another bow, the Gentlewoman ſupplying both of us with arrowes; but it was not poſſible for me to levell one ſhaft aright, for ſhee triumphing in her hits, came to me to rejoyce for them, as it our ſhooting had beene in jeſt, and thoſe living bodyes immoveable markes not to be accounted of. Our good-fortune indeede was the indiſcretion of the pirates, who excepting in the poope, and on maine Top, had never a bow; therefore they went climing along the ſhrowdes to get to the maine-yard, but ere they ſcarce could proffer to touch a rope, they ſtill fell downe dead or wounded; yet they having no other ſave this one (though dangerous) way to releeve themſelves, thought to attempt it in ſo many ſeverall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at once, as the obſtinate reſolution of many might gaine time of our few ſhaftes, ſo as they endeavoured to get up by clammering by three and three upon divers ſeverall tackles.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſſe glad to have the pleaſure of varying her ſhots miniſtred her by their ſo varying of her markes, bethought her of a ſubtiltie fitter indeede to be experimented ſome other time; and that was, to try if (lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the men) ſhee could cut in two the ſhrowdes; whereupon making her ayme at the file of the rope, ſhee clove it in twaine, which for being well twiſted, received the blow for them that climb'd it up; but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to beare their waight, burſt juſt in the cloven place, letting the three fall downe on the hatches betweene dead and ſtupified: Of this ſhot the Princeſſe was ſo exceeding joy full, as ſhee ranne to embrace me, ſhewing me (by pointing at) thoſe that tumbled downe with ſuch gladſomneſſe, as greater ſhee could not have conceived at any recreative ſpectacle whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And I buſied in ſhooting, did applaude her for it, to the end ſhee might neither give over her ſelfe nor hinder me.</p>
                  <p>The Captaine ſeeing the bloody ſlaughter of his men, ſtood crying, and lifting up his hand, with a deſire (it ſhould ſeeme) to ſpeake ſome thing: Be there the Princeſſe deeming that poſture of his worthy one of her arrowes, ſhot at him, wherewith ſhe nail'd faſt his hand to his mouth, as if the one had enjoyn'd the other to ſilence, ſo as in the ſelfe ſame time ſhee paid and he received her ranſome. <hi>In fine,</hi> ſhee ſlew ſo many of them, as I with the two Knights durſt (though unarm'd) deſcend to make an end of the reſt, who were crouch't and ſquatted downe to ſhelter and hide themſelves, ſome behinde the maſts, and others beneath in the ſinke.</p>
                  <p>In the ſhall op were heard theſe great out-cries, though the occaſion thereof was unknowne, till the accoaſting of the ſix to one of the ſides af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded our Knights the commodity to tell our Oare-men that the ſhip was by us taken, and all her men ſlaine; whereupon they, ſuddenly aſſaulting their guardians, ſlue three of them, and had not then ſtaid their hands, but for my crying out to them to ſave the reſt alive.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſſe then laying aſide her bow, return'd all-quiet into her ſhallop, and having given the ſack of the ſhip unto her rowers, wee ſet her a fire and ſo left her, arriving in <hi>Caleri</hi> the day following.</p>
                  <p>The King underſtanding that ſhee was arrived at the haven, would needs goe in perſon to meete her, followed with ſuch ſhoutings for joy by the Court, Citie, and whole kingdome, as the like was not ſeene for many
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7474:48"/>
yeares before. The old King could never ſatiate himſelfe in making much of her, and blaming himſelfe for his fault, for which he had done ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent penance by being (for ſo long a time) deprived of her all-delighting company. <hi>Eromen a</hi> likewiſe (giving full reines to her extreame affection) expreſſed unto her a mothers unparalleled tenderneſſe to an only childe.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt thus ſhee ſtood halfe-extaſied with joy, there were preſented her letters from <hi>Polimero,</hi> written from <hi>Peluſio,</hi> wherein he promiſed to returne ſhortly into <hi>Greece;</hi> Whereupon both father and daughter praid me to goe to finde him out, and bring him home: Whence being for this effect parted, I hapned to come hither in the manner you already wote of.</p>
                  <p>Extreame was the delight which all of them conceived at the <hi>Count</hi>'s narration; in way of courteous expreſſion where of the Prince aſſur'd him, he would not depart till he ſaw him accommodated, who ſoone after ſent <hi>Cataulo</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Feacia</hi> (that reſided not farre thence in one of his houſes of pleaſure) with order to tell him who hee was, and alſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with his reſolution of parting thence, (though not without firſt thanking him for the favours received of him) and to intreate him, that he might (with his Princely aſſent) leave that place to a Knight, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baniſhed from his Countrey, would (ſo it ſtood with his Highneſſe good liking) make his abode there. Hee charged him further, to enquire out for ſome ſhip bound for <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Full ſorry was the old Prince, for having had in his houſe vail'd under ſuch a habit ſo great a Prince, without honouring him conformable to his high quality; cauſing therefore his horſes to be ſadled, he went to viſite him. <hi>Feredo</hi> taking by the hand the Knight of the teares, went to meete him, whom (when they had done complementing) hee preſented unto him, with ſaying, that he had ſubſtituted him to be his ſervant in his ſteed, whereunto the Prince anſwered, that he was ſorry for his parting, but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the favour of his ſubſtitute, not to expect any ſervice from him, but to doe him the ſervice he owed his ſubſtitutor.</p>
                  <p>Going afterwards to take his leave, hee had much adoe to finde juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations againſt the courteous quarrels of the Princeſſe, to whom hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented (as unknowne) the Knight that ſhee well knew before; and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving courteouſly reſign'd him his houſe and ſervants, he parted for <hi>Feacia,</hi> whence taking his journey towards the Weſterne parts, he kindly tooke leave of the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona</hi> and <hi>Don Eleimos,</hi> who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked themſelves together, turning their prow towards the Eaſterne territories.</p>

                  <p>True it is, that at his arrivall there, hee thought (by frequenting thoſe famous Schooles) to eaſe the paine of his wounded minde, with the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne balme of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which he heard to be there propagated with precepts directed to its uſe. But when hee came to experiment it by his owne occular obſervation, he found it farre ſhort, if not quite different from his expectation, in that the lives and manners of the profeſſors held no conformity with what they profeſſed, the later requiring the ſolide truth, the former content with the ſuperficiall truth-reſembling, the one reality of matter, the other formality of words.</p>

Paſſing then Eaſtward of the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> his Soveraignty reached even to the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> placed betweene the <hi>Arabian</hi> ſea (as farre as the <hi>Troglodites)</hi> and that continued file of Mountaines which ſever it from the <hi>Garamants.</hi> The ſcope of his intent was to come as farre as the ſprings of <hi>Nile</hi> in the Mountaines of <hi>Luna,</hi> and there to bound and terminate his dominions, but that the dangerous ſands, the ſcortching heat of the Sunne, and (above all) the uncertainety of finding them out, made him alter his deſigned intention.</p>
                  <p>Return'd home, he would needs there alſo out-doe, and ſurpaſſe his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours in all things, for ſlighting the <hi>Piramides</hi> (as but Tombes of the dead) he with a till-then-unheard-of-wonder founded a Citie in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the midſt of the Lake <hi>Meride,</hi> aſſembling there ſuch as (for having beene by the ſword expelled from elſe-where) were deſirous to give this <hi>new miracle</hi> a beginning.</p>
                  <p>The Streets there were Channels, the Coaches ſtately Barges fortified at both ends with long necks of bright <hi>ſteele</hi> engrailed, &amp; covered with ſuch pompous ſtatelineſſe and ſtately commodiouſneſſe as ſtirr'd up envy in the ſtarry ſhip of the firmament. The buildings (emulating the great-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of Kings) were not private, but royall edifices, and from one part of the City to the other were (in various proſpectives) reared up divine-ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Temples,</hi> and ſumptuous <hi>Pallaces,</hi> enriched with furniture worthy to entertaine <hi>Soveraigne Princes;</hi> for the reſt, as the beauty of the women, the commerce of trade, the liberty and concourſe of all ſorts of people, 'tis a deſcription not to be comprehended otherwiſe, than by the Organ of the eye guided by the ray of a perfect judgement: And withall, that this his Citie might not be any way defective, he made it a free State, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to nothing but lawes, and ſuch lawes too as indeede raiſed it to a pitch of immortality, for being grounded on equity the onely law written in mens hearts by the hand of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Thither would <hi>Polimero</hi>'s will have preſently guided his longing eyes, but that it was retarded by the inviting commodity of his being ſo neere the <hi>Piramides,</hi> where Architecture bred in him no leſſe admiration, than their exceſſive charge aſtoniſhment: Surveying them therefore with an obſervant eye, he chanced to eſpie in one of them a great deale of blood, and a litle further a young woman wounded, whoſe habit denoted her to be of eminent quality, her yeares ſeemed to be ſhort of ſix and twenty, her countenance was pale and wan, yet not ſo altered as to hinder the conceit to diſcerne the perfections of an exquiſite (though martirized) beauty.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Polimero</hi> had with him a guide and two men, who carried upon
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7474:50"/>
two camels his pavilion and victuals, having ſent then <hi>Caraſio</hi> to cauſe the former to be pitch'd, and to fetch thereout ſome unguents, he night ſee her a litle after come to her ſelfe; her tongue and voyce were deprived of the uſe of their organs, yet ſeemed ſhee by the expreſſive ſignes ſhee made with her eyes and hands, ſilently to pray him not to diſcover her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caraſio</hi> being returned, found to be in her breſt and lower downe in her flanke three deepe wounds: yet the <hi>probe</hi> managed by a gently-expert hand (long before to his Lords coſt Maſter in that art) aſſured her of her life: <hi>Polimero</hi> being (in the meane time) buſied in comforting her, and uſing courteous force in conſtraining her to endure the being dreſs'd, without being able to get one word out of her, till (a while after) when her paine was by the medicaments operation ſomewhat aſſwaged, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the <hi>Greeke tongue,</hi> to aske where ſhee was? and being by <hi>Caraſio</hi> anſwered, In mercifull hands, unlike to thoſe that ſo hardly had uſed her, ſhee thank'd him; and then turning to <hi>Polimero-</hi>wards, and pittifully weeping.</p>
                  <p>Courteous Sir (ſaid ſhee) I am in good hope you will not aband on mee wretched woman, but that (to oblige me the more to your goodneſſe) you will cauſe me to be (by ſome meanes or other) brought to <hi>Memphi. Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero</hi> (aſſuring her that he would rather abandon his owne life than leave her unaccompanied) perſwaded her to take her repoſe; and ſending the day following for ſome that (for the ſervice of paſſengers) dwelt neere the <hi>piramides,</hi> he having cauſed them to contrive with many poles joyn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a kinde of a litter, made them therein carry her to the next village, becauſe it was impoſſible to bring her to <hi>Memphi</hi> in the dangerous plight ſhee then lay in, her weakeneſſe withall ſo increaſing as they many times reputed her dead, many dayes expiring ere they could conceive any aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hope of her life.</p>
                  <p>Exceeding loath was <hi>Polimero</hi> to leave her, though hee yet had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame great deſire to ſee thoſe countries ere his returne to <hi>Greece;</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore the <hi>criticall</hi> dayes, and forecaſting with himſelfe how that by the judgement which by them and by the wounds <hi>Caraſio</hi> made, it would be long ere ſhee could be cured, he reſolved to goe thence alone, and to leave <hi>Caraſio</hi> with her, whereunto he would by no meanes aſſent, but become now (contrary to his accuſtomed carriage) diſobedient, would in any caſe obſtinately follow him, endeavouring by all meanes poſſible to perſwade his Lord to the acceptance of his neceſſary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, by laying before him a thouſand accidents that in ſuch a journey might befall him. Till in the end his Lord was faine to command him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to ſtay there behinde him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Polimero</hi> then ſetting himſelfe forwards on his way to <hi>Memphi,</hi> without knowing any foote thereof, loſt the direct rode, ſo as his horſe the third day of his journey carried him to ſome of thoſe low grounds, which the <hi>Nile</hi> by its frequent inundations makes in many places to become fenny; where not knowing which way to get out, hee made towards a plat of ground bearing canes, whereunto the neerer that hee approached. the more diſtinctly might his attentive eare heare one while the loud ſhoutes of skreeching voyces, and another while the uncouth murmure of dying grones, which though they ſtill more and more increaſed, yet depriv'd

they him not of hearing alſo the ſound of blowes as of men fighting; come thither on a ſpeedy gallop, and diſcovering what (for the canes) he could not before diſcerne, he ſaw one Knight alone combated, beaten off his horſe and wounded; the aſſaulters being above thirty, and all <hi>Arabians,</hi> the greater part whereof lay downe on the field either dead or wounded, (with ſuch marveilous dexterity ſway'd that one his ſword) ſo as he being armed ſeemed to fight with them being unarm'd, as with beaſts that had neither tooth nor tallent, yet had they for all that unhorſt him with the rude blowes of poles and clubs, whereto hee was for feare of killing his horſe conſtrained to cede.</p>
                  <p>But no ſooner came <hi>Polimero,</hi> than they were forced to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by flight, for, he encountring him that had ſeiſed on the Courſer, bare him to the ground with a thruſt, and then taking the Steede gently by the reines, courteouſly preſented him to the Knight, who lightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting him, ſlew of them as many as he could come at, aſſiſted by the valour of his companion, who ſeeing them betaken to their flight (not daigning to purſue them) came to him and asked how he felt himſelfe; he affectionately thanking him, anſwered, that he had no hurt at all, which indeed was true, though his wounded thigh by its free bleeding gave the ſpectators eye occaſion to ſuſpect the wound to be farre more dangerous than it was.</p>
                  <p>This Knight ſeemed not to be above eighteene yeares of age, which bred the greater wonder in <hi>Polimero,</hi> who taking from out his ſaddle-bow a box of oyntment (prepared for him by <hi>Caraſio</hi> for ſuch like occurrences) carefully dreſt him, underſtanding by him (in the meane while) that the fray ſprung from no other occaſion, than from the deſire they had to rob him, the ordinary profeſſion that theſe bloody villaines liv'd by.</p>
                  <p>Deſirous therefore to know whitherward he went, (for that he was loath to leave him in thoſe perilous places alone) he underſtood that his way tended towards the red Sea, to paſſe over thence into <hi>Arabia,</hi> where he had ſome ſmall affaires of his owne to diſpatch: and this expreſt he in a ſtrangely-intricate manner of ſpeech, which being compoſed of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry languages, would (for the well underſtanding of it) give a good <hi>lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſt</hi> ſomewhat to doe. It ſeemed to <hi>Polimero,</hi> that he ſhould know that accent whereof he grew ſoone afterwards to be more aſſured, when ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the deviſe of his ſhield, he ſaw there a <hi>Swan,</hi> which comming out of the <hi>Sea,</hi> pitcht his foote upon an <hi>Iland,</hi> that (by the number of <hi>bones</hi> that there might be ſeene) ſeemed to be a <hi>Church-yard,</hi> environed with a <hi>motto</hi> in the <hi>Etrutrian</hi> character and tongue, which imported, <hi>No matter ſo I but ſing.</hi> And being in that tongue praid to diſcover what that device intimated, he anſwered:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That</hi> fortune having now at length driven him a-ſhore on a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Iland, he (having till then champed on the bit of a continued though undue affection towards his, to him unjuſt and ungratefull Countrey) had reſolved to end there his dayes, yet in ſuch a condition as he might not dye there obſcurely. And that as the <hi>ſwan</hi> (if it be true that he dyes ſinging) publiſheth his <hi>death</hi> with the melody of his <hi>ſong,</hi> even ſo deſired he alſo to have his actions appeare to be ſuch, as might leave a good name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, ſo as death ſhould gaine nothing by him ſave his bones onely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:7474:51"/>
Full well pleaſed was <hi>Polimero</hi> with ſo accompliſht a ſpirit, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that <hi>contemners of fame are commonly deſpiſers of vertue;</hi> and though the deſire of eternizing it be indeede in ſome reſpects a moſt vaine affect, yet is it nothing ſo in ſuch as conſider the branch whence bud forth thoſe generous acts which make a man become beneficiall to the community of humane ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Beholding him therefore more obſervantly, hee might ſee his upper garments and baſes all over ſlaſht and ſhagg'd, rather with ſwords than with any inſtrument of ingenious invention, ſo as in an <hi>habit</hi> of ſimple ſhew his <hi>quality</hi> promiſed very much, and that too very contrary to the preſent being he then appeared in; but in his face (being the paper where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Heaven imprints the character of good and evill) might be read a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant nobleneſſe:</hi> There alſo might be diſcerned lampes of <hi>heroicall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> ſo as neither <hi>poverty</hi> nor <hi>deſtiny</hi> were able either to <hi>remove</hi> the one or <hi>obſcure</hi> the other, wherewith <hi>Polimero</hi> was ſo taken, as he would (by all meanes) beare him company to ſome ſecure place, no more now for pitties ſake, but to ſatisfie the ardent deſire hee had to enjoy his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>Being both then come (with no meane toyle) to a Countrey-farme, and there informed, how they were (by then) come paſt <hi>Memphi</hi> to the ſeaward in the confines of <hi>Arabia,</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Egyptian; Polimero</hi> told him, that (for his part) his affaires made no diſtinction of Countries, ſeeing that Knight-errantry governing it ſelfe from one accident to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was neither obſerver of dayes nor provident ſtorer for after-times; and that therefore ſince he was come on ſo farre, he now intended to ſee whether the further <hi>Arabia</hi> enjoyed with juſt title the ſurname of <hi>Happy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The young Knight (with his cogitations parted betweene perturbation and pleaſure) ſtood pawſing a good while, without making him any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; till after having by the examination of his judgement found him to be neither <hi>Araba</hi> nor <hi>Egyptian,</hi> but rather of thoſe countries where himſelfe was bred in, and by conſequence not to be ſuſpected, hee thus beſpake him.</p>
                  <p>Noble Sir, if you had not already ſo much obliged me to your merits, you then had at this inſtant bound me to be eternally yours by this your reſolution, which (but for doubt of arrogating too much to my ſelfe) I ſhould conceive to bee done in favour of mee. But bee it as it bee will, it cannot but conſtraine me to kiſſe your hands for it, beſeeching you to beleeve it employed on one that ſhall ſerve you whilſt he breathes. Or if I be deceived in ſo flattering my ſelfe, and that you have a deſire to ſurvey thoſe parts meerely for your pleaſure and mindes ſake: Behold me then moſt ready and willing to attend and ſerve you: If neither that nor this, but that this dayes example, or your pittying my youth and weakeneſſe, moves you to leave me not unaccompanied; be pleaſed then (worthy Sir) to give me leave to tell you, that the profeſſion I am of, wills mee to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to ſpare your ſelfe that labour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Polimero</hi> (having from the beginning of his ſuſpenſion obſerved in him ſome concealed ſuſpition, and in its progreſſe many reaſons which deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a kinde of a ſtrange reſervedneſſe in his demeanour, deſirous to know what he was) fram'd him this reply.</p>

I cannot (Sir Knight) deny my going for <hi>Arabia</hi> to be a new reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conceived in this very inſtant, though I ſhall entreate you to beleeve me, that to goe thither rather than elſe-where is to me a thing indifferent, my buſineſſe conſiſting wholly on the paſſing away of two or three moneths time, nor will I tell you, that my deſire to wend that way is ſprung from the guſt I conceive from your company (which I would not confeſſe unto you to be ſo, though it were, leſt you (whom I ſee ſo repleat of courteſie) might pretend your ſelfe beholding to me for it) onely this much I affirme, that theſe countries make me hate ſolitarineſſe; and ſince that fortune hath made me ſo happy as to light on your company, I would not willingly forgoe the benefit &amp; content of enjoying it, but rather hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily offer (for the accompliſhing or furthering of any affaire of yours) my perſon at your free diſpoſe and ſervice.</p>
                  <p>The excellent <hi>Polimero</hi> had in expreſſing himſelfe a naturall efficacie, accompanied with a kinde of winning behaviour farre from any diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, a quality as noble againe being diſcreetly employed, as prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all being uſed indifferently to all men: this was it that perſwaded the Knight, not onely to accept but deſire his company.</p>
                  <p>That night they repoſed themſelves, riding the day following towards <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> during which time <hi>Polimero</hi> by taking a particular ſurvey of all his actions, obſerved how in his diſcourſe his minde would be often alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the ſubject treated of, and (then a litle after) recover it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which gave him occaſion oft-times to tell him ſmiling, that ſurely love ſhould be the occaſioner of theſe abſtractions, in which point the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forbore a while to ſatisfie him, yet could not at length (after divers excuſes and new demands) chooſe but returne him this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Worthy Sir, I acknowledge and judge my ſelfe over-diſcourteous in concealing from you my being and affaires, yet feare my proving much more injurious in drawing on (perhaps) (by acquainting you with-them) your forward goodneſſe to beare a ſhare in my perils. I beſeech you then to beleeve, that this was the ſole cauſe of my being hitherto ſilent, and the obligation of obeying you the onely ſpurre that now pricks mee on to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale unto you the true and whole ſtory of my life and beeing, albeit I yet know you for no other than for the moſt courteous <hi>Cavalier</hi> living. Heere <hi>Polimero</hi> ſuddenly interrupting him, anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Gentle Sir, your knowing me in ſo favourable a conſtruction is too too courteous, wherein if you bee miſtaken (which I would bee ſorry you ſhould) yet ſhall you not be deceived in knowing me for <hi>Polimero</hi> of <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania,</hi> Prince of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> who if before he were inquiſitive of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, onely to be acquainted with you, deſires now to know you, to the end hee may lend you his aſſiſtance in any thing he may ſteede you in; wherein I pray you ſpare mee not, for I aſſure you, that the greater the danger which you propoſe me ſhall be, the more ſhall I thinke my ſelfe favoured by you.</p>
                  <p>The young Knight exceeding glad of this offer, excuſed himſelfe in the beſt termes he could imagine, for not having borne him the reſpects due to the eminencie of his quality, with promiſing, that he would yet make him amends (in part) for that defect, by acquainting his Highneſſe with ſome newes which (hee was ſure) would well pleaſe him; and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7474:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
told him; How that his Father-in-law King <hi>Arato</hi> had (now ſome-while ſithence) fully recovered his health and ſenſes; whereof the firſt ſigne was, his ſending to fetch (by the Count of <hi>Bona) Donzella Deſterrada</hi> from <hi>Majorica,</hi> relating unto him the ſtory of the pirates, and acquainting him with what teares of joy ſhee was welcomed home by her Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The ſecond was, the ardent deſire he had to ſee him his ſon-in-law againe; for which end hee (not knowing how to accompliſh it otherwiſe more ſpeedily) had with the privity and counſell of the Princeſſe <hi>Eromena</hi> given order to the Count of <hi>Bona</hi> to goe fetch him home, who (at his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thence) had not for ought hee could learne (as then) begun his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, but could not (for all that) chooſe but bee by then at <hi>Athens,</hi> where he was to enquire whither to goe to finde him out.</p>
                  <p>Ineſtimable were the joyes that <hi>Polimero</hi> conceived at theſe good newes, for which hee (affectionately embracing the Knight) aſſured him, that hee was not able to expreſſe his thankfulneſſe; But gathering by his diſcourſe that hee came not thence, hee ask'd him, how hee came to know theſe paſſages: Sithence it is (anſwered him the other) your Highneſſe pleaſure to command me to lay open unto you my being and quality, you ſhall therefore by the ſtory of my life underſtand where I might have heard them, aſſuring you in the meane time, that your Highneſſe neede no whit to doubt of their certainty. <hi>Polimero</hi> (more curious now than before) praid him to doe him the favour of relating it. Whereupon the other (who was <hi>Coralbo</hi> ſonne to the Queene, and heire of <hi>Arabia)</hi> ſuccinctly recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him his paſt fortunes; the beginning whereof is in the ſixt Booke of <hi>Eromena,</hi> whoſe progreſſe he continued in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sotiro</hi> kept me in the Iland of <hi>Capraia</hi> till I came to be ſix yeares of age, miſtruſtfull of the very ayre, and obſerving with a jealous eye even the poore fiſher-men that came thither, and many times ſuſpecting their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity to be ſome counterfeit traine to ſteale me away; till upon diſcreetly conſidering, that <hi>ſuperfluous and over-nice care in bringing up a childe, doth often deprive him of the meanes of well-receiving any good breeding:</hi> hee thought it needfull to hazard me ſomewhat more, by committing me (my yeares now requiring it) unto a civill ſociety. Away then tooke he me from the Iland, and with me as much of the treaſure as he thought neceſſary for my maintenance for many yeares, burying the reſidue under the rubbiſh and ruines of the Cottage, (having firſt burnt all its timber and thatch, leſt the commodity of the materialls might invite any man to build it up a-new:) which done, hee placed me to the ſtudie of Arts (I having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand during the time of our abode in the Iland learn'd of him my firſt rudiments of humanity;) But hee (good man) entertained of me too too elevated an opinion, in being perſwaded, that Nature had beſtowed on me a peculiar ingenuity of examining her wayes, ſeeing that in the inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thereof, no meanes which I judged either inſufficient or vaine could give me any kinde of ſatisfaction. Pedants and their wayes were unto me inſupportable, I could not brooke the being neceſſitated to beleeve what they ſaid, onely becauſe they ſaid ſo; as if the intellect could be ſatisfied with the bare authority of ſuch kinde of people, when the true reaſons (being by them either harſhly or not at all explicated) are ſo farre diſtant from their purblinde ſight, as is the South point from the inhabitants of the <hi>Artick</hi> Pole.</p>

A glad man was <hi>Sotiro</hi> to ſee mee to his thinking ſo punctuall, hoping that the ſpeculation of generall things would weare out of my memory the ſmarting thought of my owne particular croſſes; and that by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſtupified by continuall poring on bookes, I might happily ſhunne the eminent dangers which hung over my head, by occaſion of the waking curioſity of knowing what I was. Yet I vow unto you by <hi>Mars,</hi> that, though no man gave me ever any ſuch inkling, I yet never beleeved him to be my father (albeit he ever preach'd me ſuch a doctrine) were it for the reſpect he bore me, or that ſome <hi>Genius</hi> ſo inſpired mee. Suffice it, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong my generall ſpeculations, I never abandoned my private and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ones, to looſe the knot of this my ſo important doubt, which I redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at length to this certaine propoſition, that (for certaine) hee was not my father.</p>
                  <p>Moſt true it is, that I called to minde my having ſeene the Princeſſe <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romilia,</hi> who with her husband the Prince of <hi>Mauritania</hi> (your renown'd brother) chanced to land in our Iland, when I was yet but foure yeares old; and that he having admitted them to our ſecret dwelling, had (without heeding mee) made them a punctuall relation of my fortunes, whereof there remain'd in me a certaine impreſſion, which though then obſcure and imperfect, became afterwards in time more cleere and perſpicuous; ſo as I was no ſooner growne up to be ten yeares old, than I began to raiſe my ſpirits to ſuch a pitch, as to pretend to become from his ſonne and pupill, to be his Maſter &amp; Prince, which though I declared not openly in words, yet did my carriage &amp; actions manifeſt as much; for (rejecting my bookes) I then tooke no pleaſure in any thing I had formerly learnt, ſave onely Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, the exerciſe of Chivalry and Armes growne indeede to be now the chiefe Lords of my deſires, which I dranke thirſtily with my eyes, for not being yet able to practize them, becauſe of the tenderneſſe of my yeares; and with the ſame facility wherewith I had learnt the Arts, conceived I alſo the precepts that I heard given in the exerciſe of Armes, intentively meditating on the tearmes and wayes of both warding and ſtriking, and conſideratly practiſing it alone by myſelfe; ſtrictly obſerving if one foot correſponded in due diſtance to the other, if my pace were conſtantly-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, my point continually-moving, or rather giring about the center of a true guard, and my thruſts put on with a faire reach, ſeconded with a proportionate, firme, and nimble retire, or nod; handling otherwhiles (for looſening of my hand, and confirming of my nerves and pulſe) ſome maſſie thing or other, with enduring and practiſing my ſelfe in advancing, retiring, and imitating whatſoever I had ſeene done by any judicious wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon-man.</p>
                  <p>Theſe wayes of mine <hi>Sotiro</hi> noted with great diſguſt, ſprung from the feare hee conceived, leſt ſuch a ſtudie united to the nobility of my birth, might in time occaſion my fatall overthrow; for which he (become now ſevere) did often jerke me; ſo as I being unable to endure him, determined with my ſelfe to runne away from him; which determination of mine grew ſoone afterwards to be confirm'd to a reſolution, by my chancing to get into my hands a Booke of errant-chivalry, in ſo much as I perſwaded myſelfe to find (as ſoone as I were gotten out of the walls) an <hi>enchantreſſe</hi> to furniſh mee with horſe and Armes, and ſome unknowne <hi>Prince</hi> to dubbe

mee a <hi>Knight.</hi> But meeting by chance with a pilgrime, and putting my ſelfe into his company; it was my fortune to be ſtopt for getting out by ſome of the watch that knew mee, whom a litle more had incited to ſtay for company my new <hi>Camerade,</hi> out of the ſuſpicion they conceived of his having ſeduced me away.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this occaſion <hi>Sotiro</hi> advertiſed my mother of my diſobedience to him-wards, whereupon ſhee (good woman) egg'd on with a motherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection tooke on her to goe to performe a vow ſhee had made to <hi>Iupiter Ammon,</hi> and ſo came in pilgrims weeds to ſee me; which journey of hers (though farre) was yet neither very toyleſome nor over-difficult; for ſhee fraighting a-ſhippe in one of the mouthes of <hi>Nile,</hi> fared by ſea as farre as the port of the Goddeſſe <hi>Venus,</hi> and thence without any great adoe came and found us out at <hi>Nepa,</hi> where we then ſojourned. I know not whether was then greater, the wonder or diſcontent of <hi>Sotiro</hi> to ſee her, conceiting, that her comming tended to the deſtruction of the foundation of my edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, laid by him rather with an intention to conſerve me in ſafety from the knowledge of my cruell brother-in-law, than to reſtore me (with ſuch eminent dangers) to the greatneſſe of my birth; and thus much made he knowne unto her ere ſhee ſaw me. All which notwithſtanding ſhee (were it for the greatneſſe of her minde, or that ſhee were impatient to live long without me) having a purpoſe quite contrary to his, would needs make me know her for my mother, with intention to take me home with her; till he (diſcreetly reaſoning with her of the imminent dangers that hung over my head, and letting her plainely ſee, how ruinous a foundation the relying on the wavering love of the people was) after ſhee had for two moneths ſpace ſtaid with us, perſwaded her (with much adoe) to returne without me, having firſt ſtraightly charged me to the obedience of <hi>Sotiro,</hi> as of the faithfulleſt and trueſt friend, ſhee had found and tried in the worſt of her adverſe fortunes.</p>
                  <p>The courſe they reſolved on, was, to ſuit my education to my yeares, (wherein I went advancing) and in ſuch a way as might enable me when I came to mature yeares to be mine owne counſeller, as ſoone as I had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the ſtrength of putting it in execution, and yeares not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned of ſuch as yet conſerved in the cloſet of a loyall breſt, her and my fathers memory and affection.</p>
                  <p>My mother being then gone, I remain'd with a minde more prompt and heedfull to the inſtructions of <hi>Sotiro,</hi> being aſſured, I ſhould one day take ſuch a courſe of life as were moſt conformable to my owne <hi>Genius.</hi> Yet began I now to addict my ſelfe to the exerciſe of Armes and riding, retaining of my old ſtudies, onely ſuch things as bred in me the greater delight and liking; for being ſuch as might really ſteede me in ſome of my important occaſions, it being indeede a tenent undeniable, that <hi>diſciplines illuminate the intellect, making it more apt for humane affaires,</hi> and that from them diſcourſe receives ornament, and prudence an eſſentiall ſtay.</p>
                  <p>By now I was got free from under the ſubjection of Pedants, the onely inſupportable weight that over-loaded me; the obſervant <hi>Sotiro</hi> was well pleaſed to ſee me (without abandoning ſuddenly my firſt education) apply my minde of my owne accord) to the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> with an intention to ſteede me there with in the Art Millitary: But the habit which I had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7474:54"/>
in ſpeculation, was the cauſe that not contenting my ſelfe with that part which that ſtudie required, I would needs aſſay the other which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to meaſure the heavens, calculate the courſe of the Planets and ſtars, and to know their nature, influence and inclinations. From which ſprung the curioſity of knowing alſo what they promiſed me, excepting alwayes the divine providence, againſt which neither influence, ſcience, art, nor artiſt can in the leaſt meaſure prevaile. I comprehended that all was but vanity, and found the wiſe-mans ſaying true, that <hi>who-ſo accumulates know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, heapes up but trouble and vexation of ſpirit:</hi> For I found an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate aſcendent, a fall of parents, loſſe of goods, recovery thereof none or ſmall, late, and ſubject to the will and power of others; the love of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but without effect, a good fame and repute, but a fortune bad, lame, and weake; ſo as I could have wiſhed never to have knowne it; ſuch adoe had I in ſtriving not to beleeve it, though both divinity and reaſon diſſwaded me from giving any credit to it.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſpent I my time while <hi>Sotiro</hi> lived, which was till I came to bee thirteene yeares old; with being by him ſometimes inſtructed for travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling State-pollicie and practices of Princes Courts, as farre as that age was capable of, not as yet of the fitteſt for ſuch judgement-requiring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines; yet (me thought) it did me good in razing from my intellect ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, and in its ſteede bringing in the memory of ſuch things as I poſſeſt when I was laſt in the world: If ſo be it be true, that when the Firmaments ſlow gire is ended, we either returne to live again with the ſame accidents, manners and qualities as before, or that we paſſe from one body into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>After my mothers departure, wee continued there ſome two yeares without hearing any newes from her, or ſending any body to her; for that we daily expected ſome meſſenger from her, till at length, ſeeing no body came, <hi>Sotiro</hi> (miſtruſting that ſome diſaſter had befallen her) reſolved to ſend to learne the truth thereof. Hee and I having ſpent ſometime in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying of forreine parts, were by this time returned from our travels to <hi>Etruria,</hi> and thence to <hi>Capraia,</hi> where we were to expect what anſwer the meſſenger would bring us, but there (to our griefe) we found the <hi>Caban</hi> leavelled with the ground, the dwelling under the ſoft ſtone broken open, and diſcovered, and all the treaſure ſtollen away: The other loſſes, though no leſſe than of kingdomes were all nothing in compariſon of this, which made the good <hi>Sotiro</hi> (who examined its conſequences more feelingly than I) to fall into a mellancholy ſo deepe and grievous, that for its being incureable by either Phyſitians skill, or vertue of medicines; hee (ſhortly after our returne to <hi>Nepa)</hi> tooke his laſt leave of both me and the world: which I, that (drawne on with childiſh affections) had till then wiſh'd him dead, tooke (now that I had obtained my deſire) ſo to heart, as I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that I in ſome of my many extreame fits of griefe, died not after him. Then was it and not before, that I came to know his tender loving care, &amp; my obligations to him for it his happineſſe to be rid of worldly troubles, and my hard fortune to remaine over-loaden with them in a tender age, without parents, government, meanes, or counſell. Onely the Heavens (who cauſed mee to be borne for toyle and ſorrow) had given me withall bodily force and courage, that I might live to endure their influences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:7474:54"/>
I had yet left me a ſmall reſidue of that coyne which <hi>Sotiro</hi> tooke with him, when we firſt parted from the Iland (as I told you) wherewith I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to expect the anſwer of our meſſenger, and then to goe for <hi>Arabia.</hi> Till after ſeeing, that for the ſpace of a yeare and more I had expected it in vaine, without hearing any newes of either our meſſenger or any other in his ſteede, I reſolved by going my ſelfe to be both embaſſadour and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie: For Nature having together with making me to be borne a Prince, endued me with a ſpirit conformable to that dignity, drew mee on to the impoſſibility of the journey, and yet ſeemed to delay it by violently hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying me on the wheeles of an over-free diſpoſition to bounties diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the ſtate I was in; and this chiefly, becauſe (poore as I was) the miſeries of other men touch'd my compaſſion neerer the quick than any of mine owne. So is it (for the moſt part) wont to befall ſuch, as are predeſtinated to periſh; for, whom fortune cannot bring to ruine by meanes of open vices, thoſe ſhee precipitates downe the precipice of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery by the meanes of masked vertues, which loſe their name, though not their luſtre. Becauſe impoveriſhing by malignity of deſtiny, engenders compaſſion, whereas ſuch as hazard the falling into a greater poverty when fortune hath forewarned them of it, deſerve to ſuffer for their folly: and liberality itſelfe growne to be prodigality, and ſo become its owners foe, both drawes contempt on them, and ſhewes others the way of being ingratefull towards them. To be ſhort, I ſtaid ſo long till the wings of my liberality were ſo clipped, as I was faine to depart accompanied with no other than my old foſter-father, even he that whilome had carried mee in his armes one of <hi>Cardamina.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Come neere that we were to <hi>Parthenope</hi> in the <hi>Sannits</hi> Countrey, wee lighted on a company of high-way theeves, from whom whilſt I did my beſt to defend my ſelfe, the poore old man was ſlaine before my face; his death I to my utmoſt power endeavoured to revenge, till beaten off my horſe, robb'd and ſtript, I lay on the ground halfe dead and ſenſeleſſe all the night, ſcaping narrowly from being trodnn under foote, by a ſtrong ſquadron of horſe that came prancing that-a-way by the breake of the next day, if two of their Scouts had not (by good fortune) chanced to heare me groane; who making thereupon a ſtand, and eſpying the dead bodyes, and among them my unfortunate ſelfe, robb'd, ſtript, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they ſoone imagined what had beene done, which made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to give an account of what they had found and ſeene; On this, the reſt ſpurring on in a faire troupe, with a Lady in the midſt of them, came where I was: But ſhee, commiſerating my youth and wofull plight, (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my weakeneſſe diſenabled me of ſatisfying any demand of hers) cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my wounds to bee bound up; and then being by her commandement laid in a horſe-litter that followed her, I began to come to my ſelfe, and to beſeech them either to bury my foſter-father, or to let me lye there and dye with him for company, with giving them ſpeciall markes and counter-ſignes to know him from the reſt; whereupon he was laid athwart one of their horſes, and ſo carried to a Caſtle hard by and there buried; and thus the firſt <hi>act</hi> of my <hi>tragedy</hi> ended.</p>
                  <p>I remain'd a long time in cure, my wounds (which were all deepe and inward) being aggravated with many raving-feaveriſh fits, my body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7474:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
become now ſo voyd of blood, as it was a wonder it remain'd not voyd of life.</p>
                  <p>The noble Lady, touch'd with a fellow-feeling pitty of my hurts, came often to viſite me, the deſire to ſee me cured daily increaſing in her noble heart, ſo as at the recovery of my ſpirits, ſhee began to change her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion into a love-preceding pitty.</p>
                  <p>This Lady being the greateſt Princeſſe of that Countrey was a widow freſh and faire, and a mother of two ſonnes. Litle dream't I (God wot) of any affection of hers, nor had I (alas!) any reaſon to hope for any ſuch matter, my weakned body being ſore all over by reaſon of my wounds, my dejected minde afflicted for my irrecoverable loſſes, and my wretched ſelfe ſo bereft of my good hopes, as I knew not how to diſpoſe of my ſelfe if I were recovered: And though hope-inſpiring youth endeavoured the beſt it could to cut off the plummets thread wherewith the depth of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries were ſounded, yet the extreamity of my over-hard fortune forcibly countermanding it, vanquiſhed both youth and nature, and ſubjected their bold necks to the heart-maſtering yoake of deſpaire-uſhering mellancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in ſo much, as upon conſiderate examination of my deplorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I heartily wiſh'd rather my death than recovery; till after that the <hi>channels</hi> of my veynes began to be repleniſh'd with freſh <hi>ſprings</hi> of blood, I then grew to bee ſomewhat better conſolated, though I yet knew not whether it then proceeded more from the ſweete pitty or rare beauty of the Dutcheſſe <hi>Criſanta,</hi> for ſo was ſhee called. I had (I confeſſe) lightly aſſaid before ſome touches (if not ſlight wounds) of loves ſhafts that had already ſpurr'd on my deſire to the knowledge of its ſweetes, which was of me (being then but a raw youth) as eaſily undergone as forgotten. For I was a ſhort time a novice at <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Academy at <hi>Nepa,</hi> where though I was as yet but fifteene yeares old, yet had my ſtanding there freed mee from the name of a freſh-man. Oftentimes would I contemplate the fairer parts of her ſweetly-featured face, contending among themſelves for gracefull comelineſle and comely gracefulneſſe, from whoſe attracting preſence (me thought) I breath'd ſo vitall an ayre, as my wounds were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cured by it, than by the vertue of the unguents. Full oft would my captiv'd heart pant and beate in hot deſire, when ſhee feeling my pulſe, (through inward alteration diſtempered) would with a kinde of fellow-feeling compaſſion bemoane it to the <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> who finding it by that time they touch't it to be otherwiſe, admired thereat, for not conceiving, that th'artire touch'd by the delicious hand of a beloved <hi>Mistreſſe</hi> beates differently from what it doth at the feeling of the cold hand of a <hi>Phyſitian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Scarce was I freed from the perill of death, when I found my ſelfe ſo dead for love, as (having quite forgotten all my paſt diſaſters) I thought now no more of being <hi>Coralbo,</hi> of the loſſe of my eſtate, or my naked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but baniſhing all ſuch like conceits, I ſuffered my ſelfe to be by my imagination tranſported to thoſe guſts, which were (as I then thought) farre from any effect, which plunged me anew into the gulfe of ſo deepe a mellanc holy, that if timely remedy had not hapned, I am perſwaded I had in few dayes remain'd irrecoverably dead.</p>
                  <p>The Dutcheſſe (on the other ſide enflamed with the ardencie of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) led (good Lady) a life ſubject to greater ſufferings; becauſe ſhee
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7474:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſaw no meanes of ever accompliſhing her deſires, in that ſhee durſt not diſcover them, fearefull was ſhee of imparting to me her affection, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtfull of my greene yeares, which ſhee conceived to bee either hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous or unfit to bee truſted unto, for being as yet too young to diſcerne a reall fire from an imaginary ſparkle; and againe to acquaint mee with her flames, as it ſtood not with her honour, ſo beleeved ſhe that it might bring her into manifeſt danger.</p>
                  <p>All this while left I not my bed, but (ſimple as ſhee tooke me for) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived (though) which way the winde blew, to my ſo exceſſive joy, that if I had beene to ballance it with all the pleaſures of the world, I would have beene heartily content for the enjoying of it alone to reſt deprived of all others: Then (and never till then) was it, that I firſt began to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betweene charity and love, betweene the <hi>effects</hi> of the one and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of the other, the conſolation whereof reſtored me to both fleſh and colour: But now the more I amended, the more ſhee drooped; the more I fatned, the leaner grew ſhee; my recovery occaſioning her ſickning, for that ſhee feared that I would not (when I were fully recovered) make any long abode with her.</p>
                  <p>Her ſonnes following the mothers example, came likewiſe often to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite me, who though they punctually examined not my qualities, yet did the neereneſſe of our yeares and other proportions betweene us procure me (beſides their friendſhip) their good opinion and affection, ſo as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in my converſation, they (out of the hope they had of enjoying it ſo much the longer) made wondrous much of me, not without expreſſing (withall) ſo much unto their mother, who therefore began now to hope ſhee would not looſe mee ſo ſoone as ſhee-once feared ſhee ſhould: No ſooner was I fully recovered, than I began to manifeſt my ſelfe to be other than fortune ſhewed me to be; In publick exerciſes I appeared no more him that was the other day robb'd, ſtript, and wounded, now that it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me (being wounded with a freſh and more inward wound, and robb'd of my wonted liberty) to ſubject my ſelfe to the cruell hazard of a ſevere and deſpaire-threatning deſtiny.</p>
                  <p>There was then <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Canne</hi> one named <hi>Cripaſſo</hi> a wealthy and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteemed <hi>Cavalier,</hi> who (being ſome-while before enamoured of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe) had done what he could to gaine her liking, though for being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of an indeede odious ſimmetry, he could never gaine as much as her leaſt good liking, much leſſe her affection. His age was conformable to hers, nor came he much ſhort of her for nobility and riches, I would ſay for vertue and good parts too; but that the end of his actions and life toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deprived him of the merit of ſo ſplendent attributes; he was indeede famed to be one of the moſt courteous and valiant <hi>ſpirits</hi> of all that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; but yet growne (to be for his perſon) much deformed through the <hi>diſſolution</hi> of his youth conſumed in diſordinate luſts. For his forehead growne to be deepely dented and foulely ſcarified through the want of a bone (which for being rotted by the <hi>French malady</hi> was taken out of his skull) made him looke monſtrous ugly; beſides, the littleneſſe of his face diſproportioned to the reſt of his body, and yet more disfigured, with his hollow-ſquint-fired-eyes; ſo as if the ſweetneſſe of his carriage, his libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and ſuch other like noble conditions of his, had not in ſome ſort
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7474:56"/>
countervailed thoſe his imperfections, hee would have beene notoriouſly noted for the monſtrous deformity of that age.</p>
                  <p>Many yeares before was <hi>Criſanta</hi> (being left a widow in the flowre of her fairer yeares with two male babes) ſought for and ſued unto by him in the way of matrimony, though ſhee could not by any meanes bee drawne to hearken thereunto, his good parts and laudable conditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not onely obſcured, but come to be of no value in compariſon of the contrary, and therefore ſhifted ſhe him modeſtly off with an excuſe, that ſhee never meant to marry any man; the ſtate of her ſonnes, and good (as ſhee would alleadge) of her houſe requiring her being free from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of husbands.</p>
                  <p>Hee not thinking himſelfe (for all that) rejected, for being ſo excluded onely in generall termes, daily waited on her, and obſervantly ſerved her, hoping in time to enjoy her as a <hi>Mistreſſe</hi> if not owne her as a <hi>Wife,</hi> wherein though the courſe of many yeares had ſhewed him his miſtake, yet lay it not (for all that) within the power of his diſcretion to withdraw from her his affection; love being now growne a tytant over him, and his deſires not onely linked-in him but in ſuch ſort enflamed, as meerely cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall reſpects ſerved him for touch-powder to fire it the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently. And ſince it is a thing in us ſo ordinary and naturall to conceit well of our ſelves, it was no wonder, if that hee never once obſerved as much as one among ſo many diſproportions of his, becauſe his ſelfe-love flattering him hid in one and the ſame bundle among his good qualities his worſer, which later becauſe he ſaw not, he could not chooſe but be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of, and preſume on thoſe others which he ſaw, by which he thought he merited not onely the Dutcheſſe <hi>Criſanta,</hi> but even the worthieſt, fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and greateſt Lady of the Vniverſe.</p>
                  <p>I know not how hee came by ſeeing mee to know himſelfe ſomewhat better than he did before, not in regard there abounded in me any woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delighting qualities, but becauſe there ſuperabounded in him conditions not onely ill-beſeeming, but even odious in any man, and by conſequence more eminent in a perſon of his quality. Mee then hee envied and beheld with a jealous eye before he knew of any of my doings, without concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for all that) any thing the worſe of himſelfe, envy (or rather emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in love) being numbred among the more generous defects. But under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding how I was found on the high-way robb'd &amp; ſtript-naked, he then imagined he had no cauſe to feare or doubt of mee; as if love and hatred had forſooth) their dependencies on the favours or defects of deſert-ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome favouring fortune.</p>
                  <p>In the meane while <hi>Criſanta,</hi> in whom during the time of my ſickneſſe love had (as I told you) ſowed its heart-enflaming ſeeds, felt them (now that I was recovered) ſprowt up and grow to the prejudice and anguiſh of both her life and ſpirit. I know not if or no it were her modeſty that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd her from having recourſe to me for remedy; in that I beleeved, that <hi>true modesty neither proceedes from feares, nor hath other ends than it ſelfe;</hi> onely I muſt tell you, that her ſilence interpreted by my ſimplicity to be coldneſſe of affection made me reſolve not to loſe my ſelfe in an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative ſenſe, doubting or rather beleeving that all former demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which made mee thinke my ſelfe beloved of her, were but meerely
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7474:56"/>
ſweete effects of a noble minde, which then gave mee occaſion to learne to diſcerne the true difference betweene well-wiſhing and affection. For my owne part I hated the ordinary preſumption of ſuch young men as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that a woman cannot (as much as) glance on them a looke, with out intimating to her eyes object the homage of her liberty and perſon; well might I indeede perſwade my ſelfe, that ſome internall gift might perhaps ſerve me for a ladder to climbe up to mens good opinions, but was never (for all that) ſo ſelfe-conceited, as to beleeve, that either my lookes, face, or perſon had the power to allure or gaine me the affection, liking or good opinion of any one ſex or other: Then began I to make ſome ſignes of my departure not without an internall hearts-griefe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by a truly-affectionate love: But ſcarce had I therein opened my mouth, when <hi>Criſanta</hi> repoſing her hand on my arme as we walked alone in a large alley in the garden, ſpake thus unto mee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Celio,</hi> (for ſo made I my ſelfe be called) I underſtand that this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey likes you not (no more doth perhaps this houſe neither) and that you therefore intend to be gone; But I could wiſh you would prove ſo cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, as to make firſt knowne unto me the reaſon why you doe ſo; for if it ſo be that you received any diſguſt here, take my word, I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſee you righted; becauſe indeede my intent and deſire is, that of mine you be honoured, as of me you are beloved and held in as deere and reſpective an eſteeme as are my owne ſonnes. But if this be not it that ayles you, and that nought elſe ſave meere heate of youth ſpurres you onwards to ſuch a reſolution, I could then adviſe you to thinke better on it firſt, and to conſider how you are (now that you have loſt your old ſervant) left all alone; &amp; although I would not be backwards in ſupplying you with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you ſhould want for your journey, yet ſhould you (me thinkes) have already learnt to your coſt, that ſimple proviſions ſuffice not, being you may in your way light on not onely high-way theeves (as you did in my countrey) but a thouſand other inimaginable miſadventures: now then ſo you be pleaſed to oblige me ſo much as to let me but know who you are, and to make withall your buſineſſe appeare to me, ſuch as require your ſo ſudden departure, I will then (on my word) take order that you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by ſuch a company, as ſhall ſecure you from all perils: But if the caſe with you ſtand quite otherwiſe, and that there be no ſuch matter, I ſhall then lovingly entreate you, to ſuſpend the deliberation thereof, at leaſt ſo long, till I have time to reſolve with my ſelfe, whether I can bee without you or no, whom I love (though you know it not) deerer than my owne life. Theſe laſt words drew ſhee out of her mouth with a kinde of a pretty unwilling willingneſſe, which ſo got out had drawne others after them, if baſhfulneſſe (having diſplayed its vermilion colours on her betea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red cheekes) had not ſtaid her tongue with the modeſt curbe of the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of her ſex.</p>
                  <p>At the ſweete ſound of theſe her ſweeter words I altered my firſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, more ſpeedily than doth a dancer at the change of the muſicks tone alter his manner of footing. Nor held I it my beſt courſe to tempt fortune, by doing the office of a woman in refuſing, ſince ſhee had already done that of a man in proffering; for, having beene already ſufficiently turred therein at the coſt of others: That a woman (unleſſe ſhee be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently-bold)
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7474:57"/>
can hardly reſolve with her ſelfe to aske a ſecond time a bleſh-procuring queſtion. The conſideration where of made mee returne her this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>This is (unparalled Madame) the onely Countrey where I have lighted on the beſt and worſt of fortunes ſpite and favour, your Excellencie being the beſt of good, and the theeves that robb'd me the worſt of ills. But now the evill (ſince paſt and gone) corrupts not the ſweete relliſh of the preſent good, which is the onely ſubject whereabout my thoughts are buſied; and that the rather, becauſe diſcontent hath no abiding place either under the heaven you breathe in, or in the ſpirits that receive from you their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And for my owne part (Madame) I ſee my ſelfe both honoured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my fortune and beloved beyond my merit, ſo as the reſolution of my parting hence ſprings not from theſe grounds your goodneſſe thought good to mention, nor yet from my (in that behalfe) innocent youth, but indeede from the conſideration of my being a meere ſtranger, and from the doubt I conceived of abuſing with a too too bold (if not odious) indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion the noble courteſie of ſo long an entertainment; beſides ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar affaires of mine owne requiring my croſſing the ſea, to ſee the ſtate and being of my poore houſe and mother, though I know I cannot doe that neither without your courteous and obliging furtherance, which in its time I neither can nor will refuſe to accept of. The loſſe which I ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the death of my deerely-tendred ſervant was indeede exceeding great, but millions of degrees ſhort, nay nothing in compariſon of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of ſo high and noble a Miſtreſſe. Heere ſtopping my ſpeech with coloured cheekes and downe-caſt eyes, I ſtood (ſome ſhort while) mute, when ſhee taking mee by the hand and gently wringing it) thus beſpake mee.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto <hi>(Colio)</hi> doe I hold my ſelfe ſatisfied, but what anſwer make you mee for the reſt? What further anſwer can I make you Madame (ſaid I) ſeeing that for as much as depends on mee I have already expreſt my ſelfe; and then for that which depends on you, the anſwer thereof lyes in your owne breſt: Depends it on mee (replied ſhee) to know either your being, ſince I am a meere ſtranger to it, or your ſtay here, ſince I cannot divine your thoughts? yea Madame (ſaid I) very well both the one and the other, becauſe my beeing depends wholly on you, nor can I in ſuch a caſe either make my ſelfe better knowne unto you, or receive any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being without you: But ſhee not yet fully conceiving me, I then with a bolder courage thus proceeded.</p>
                  <p>Noble Madame, of my native being I beſeech you queſtion mee no farther at this time, leſt the ſtory thereof ſeeme a fable unto you, all other beeing of mine is yours, and hath its whole dependance on you. By you and through your meanes I live to the world, for having beene (through your compaſſionate benignity) from being left for dead gathered up and cured: And by you alſo (thankes to your obliging love) I now live to my ſelfe, being cured of a wound which for not daring to manifeſt, I ſhould (if I had parted hence) have carried along with me bleeding in my heart. No ſooner heard ſhee this, than with a blithſome countenance, ſhee ſaid unto mee.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>Celio,</hi> I know not whether I may confidently beleeve or no what
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7474:57"/>
you tell mee, I beſeech you deceive me not, though I muſt confeſſe, that my douot of it ſprings but from the difficulty of beleeving what is ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired. But if it ſo be indeede, that your words are true interpreters of your heart, reſolve (I conjure you) then to ſtay here with me: for, the company of my ſonnes and the excuſe of expecting to heare ſome newes from your home will give a ſufficient colour for the occaſion of your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode here.</p>
                  <p>This adviſe of hers being by our mutuall conſent growne to the ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a reſolution, wee (after having firſt taken ſuch order as was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the fruition of our loves) returned in gladſomely diſpoſed, delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no time of confirming our words with actions, to the ſo paſſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of both of us, as there was no degree (I am perſwaded) of joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that could exceede that of our furtive converſation. The darkeneſſe with us was light, our ſunne eyes, its beames amorous glances, our ſincere affection the faire weather, heaven our bed, and its truer influences dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and kiſſes, ſo as the large ſcope of our imaginations could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend any felicity or condition more deſireable than ours: And I, though of yeares but greene, burned yet in love ſo vehemently, that the more I enjoyed her, the more ardently found I my ſelfe enflamed; whereas ſhee being of fully ripened yeares, and therefore conſequently capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying its pleaſure at full, found her ſelfe ſo raviſhed with its delicious ſweetes, as for not being able to endure the tedious longſomneſſe of the day, which deprived her of them, ſhee would often come with divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes to take mee away from her ſonnes, for engroſſing me to her ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; ſo had her affection blinded her, as ſhee neglected or rather forgot both the dignity of her place and quality of her perſon.</p>
                  <p>But after that love had reduced us both to one onely heart, taking from us all other diſtinction, except (to make us the happier) that of our perſons and ſexes, it lay then no more in my power to conceale from her either <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralbo,</hi> or his birth or harſh fortunes, which wrought in her a confirmation if not augmentation of her affection. But tormented afterwards with the <hi>Idea</hi> of my States privation, reaſon perſwading her, that the recovery thereof was neceſſary, ſhee would oft-times ſigh to thinke of it, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing mee divers proffers for the accompliſhing by other mens meanes, what none but my ſelfe could well effect; but comprehending every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition defective, as hatcht by the blindneſſe of an extreame affection ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by any perfect rule of a prudent judgement, ſhee aſſented to the reaſons that contradicted her, but diſſented againe, when to put them in effect, the diſcording ſtring of my departure was to betouched.</p>
                  <p>Her deſigne was to give me martiall forces under pretext of employing them in ſome ſecret enterpriſes; but the conſideration of the way being for diſtance farre, and for paſſage difficult, and through the dominions of ſundry Princes, ſtopt even in its very ſource the current of any ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. But admitting that both all thoſe difficulties were removed, and all theſe wayes levelled; yet (alas!) what could they have done without me? ſhe proffered me a great ſumme of money to leavy ſouldiers in thoſe parts by my mother or ſome other, yet made not this neither for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as well becauſe no man could put a hand to the enterprize without mee, as alſo for that the principall meanes for the recovery of a State con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7474:58"/>
not either in forreine forces or expence of treaſure, but chiefly (if not wholly) in the love of the ſubjects, which onely being wanting, all other meanes would prove no leſte vaine than ſuperfluous.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time ſhee ſeeing me deſirous to be knighted would by all meanes procure my content, the age of her ſonnes become now capable of the like honour; therefore ſent ſhee all of us to <hi>Parthenope</hi> to receive the Order of Knighthood, with the occaſion of the marriage of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Corianna</hi> the Kings onely daughter, which was then ſhortly to bee ſolemnized, accompanied with a traine of many noble Knights, &amp; among them the Lord of <hi>Canne,</hi> who thought by this ſervice to manifeſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of his affection towards her, with the opinion of meriting it, or to ſhew the conſtancie of his affections to be ſuch, as could not be blowne downe by any blaſt of ſmall hope.</p>
                  <p>Arrived at <hi>Parthenope,</hi> wee were all three of us dubb'd Knights, the Court favouring us, though ill ſatisfied with the Dutcheſſe for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither, ſhee being knowne to be the faireſt Lady of the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: But the reaſon indeede of her not comming, was an agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us, that I being to part away from my company under the colour of ſome ſecret enterprize, ſhee ſhould take on her to be ſick, that ſo ſhee might expect me at her houſe, whither I was privily to retire my ſelfe for the enjoying of each other free from the ſcanning of ſo many eyes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe of her ſonnes, which troubled her more than the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Sicily</hi> was expected to come and eſpouſe the Princeſſe, when one night ſhee fled out of a Caſtle that lyes on the Sea, whither (feigning her ſelfe ſicke) ſhee was retired, and where were many found ſlaine, the Duke of <hi>Lucania</hi> &amp; the Lord high Conſtable, two of the chiefe <hi>Peeres</hi> of the Realme, together with two ſervants of the later: The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ground of which accident could not bee poſſibly learnt out. There was not a Knight that ſet not himſelfe in the ſearch of her, and among the reſt the two brothers my companions, I taking for an excuſe of not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them a blow of a launce which the day before had both beaten off my helme, and bruiſed my head, which (me thought) hapned very fit for my purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Lord of <hi>Canne,</hi> who with rather enamoured than ſquint-eyes had noted ſomething betweene me and <hi>Criſanta,</hi> ſeeing me now ſtay behinde, reſolved to doe himſelfe the like, and then watching the time of my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, dogg'd me a-farre off, till upon his obſerving my way tend towards the <hi>Sannits,</hi> hee aſſaulted me unawares, with calling mee unworthy vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine and baſe traytor; I unuſed to be ſo ſtiled anſwered him with ſword in hand: The fight leſted a good while, both of us being armed, and each of us reſolved to kill the other; of my death, his valour and my youth made him confident, till my agility depriv'd him of that hope; for being, becauſe of the wearineſſe of our horſes driven to alight, I then ſo tired him, as he was glad to fall from purſuing me to defend himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The danger and earneſtneſſe of this our combate could not (for all that) withdraw my thoughts from muſing what ſhould be the occaſion of this affront; ſeeing him therefore ſtand in neede of a breathing-time, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to heare mee a word; whereunto when he condeſcended, I ask'd him why he had ſo aſſaulted me and called me traytor? he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7474:58"/>
Becauſe I had violated the bonds of hoſpitality by enjoying a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe whom I was not worthy as much as to name, whileſt others farre worthier than my ſelfe were of her favours in the way of affection moſt injuriouſly excluded; At theſe words I was ſo exceedingly vext at the heart, as I cannot tell you which at that inſtant was greater my ſpite and rage, for having a rivall, or feare that my ſecrets were revealed: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, I made no conſcience to lye boldly, in telling him, that hee lyed moſt falſly, and to defend (by ſo belying him) the Dutcheſſe's honour and mine; howbeit my words were few, aſſured and confirmed rather by the ſword than by a good conſcience: But by this time, for being expoſed to the open violence of the ſunne, even halfe melted with heate, and growne fainty for wearineſſe, thirſt, and ſweat, wee therefore agreed to diſarme us, and ſo make a quick diſpatch one way or other: In execution whereof, we haſtily cut off each others armour-ſtrops, throwing there withall away our ſhields together with our daggers, the uſuall ſucceſſors in that office.</p>
                  <p>Our faces ſo now uncovered, there provoked us on more eagerly, him my youth, and me his uglineſſe, the diſequality encouraging each of us to ridde himſelfe of his enemy by no milder meanes than death, the one to free himſelfe of a rivall which could not bee ſurely effected by other meanes than by killing him; the other to cure the wound given <hi>Criſanta's</hi> honour could not be ſalved otherwiſe than by his rivals death; ſcarce had wee force enough left us to weild our ſwords, being now growne ſo weary and faintiſh, as we could not lift them up to make uſe of our edges, whilſt our eyes ſtood fixed or rather chained (as it were) to the enemies ſword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, to gather thence the time, and ſo either to prevent or put him by:</p>
                  <p>By this time we were both of us ſlightly wounded, rather through the defects of our ill-cloſed hilts, than for any great oddes that either of us had of other in fencing, and by our ſwords-points ſlipping through the hilts into our hands and armes, though then in our heate we had no feeling of being ſo mangled.</p>
                  <p>For my owne part I perſwade my ſelfe that I had ſooner obtained the victory, if I had but made uſe of, and followed the advantages I ſaw; for, holding it (though I know not why) foule play, to both ſtrike and thruſt when the enemy made onely uſe of his point, I ſtill followed on my play conformable to his, as if there had beene a law ſo to doe. But conſidering at length how this kinde of play did but dally out the time, and obſerving my advantage of having my pulſes both firmer and leſſe wearied than thoſe of mine enemies, I began to alter my play, falling from thruſts to downe-right and back-blowes, and thoſe laid I on too with all the force I had, ſo as the back of the contrary ſword (ſuſtained by a tired arme, and withall carried without the compaſſe of my offers and his true ward) fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured mee with the opportunity of ſtriking him firſt in the face athwart the midſt of his noſe, and afterwards on the head; at which blow the ſword dropt out of his hand to the ground, and cloſe by it himſelfe (to my thinking) dead; which ſo freed me of a rivall, and <hi>Criſanta</hi> of infamy.</p>
                  <p>But now the worſt was, that I could not poſſibly re-arme my ſelfe, my armour-tyes being (as I told you) almoſt all of them cut off. And though my <hi>Genius</hi> ſeemed to prompt me to make <hi>Cripaſſo</hi> cock ſure, with freſh and more certaine wounds, yet could I not finde in my heart to doe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7474:59"/>
ſo, for that I deemed ſuch a deede unworthy a Gentleman, yet parted I not preſently (for all that) but ſtaid to ſee whether he would revive or no; till the wound of his head (which was the dangerous one) occaſioning a ſtrange wrigling of his members with hanging out his tongue betweene his teeth, (he being at beſt but very ugly, and now in ſuch a plight gaſtfull for being aſſail'd with terrible convulſions and ſhiverings) made me confident of his being dead; ſo as to ridde me off ſo hideous and horrible a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, I went my wayes without any longer ſtay, leaving him laid along in the field, and my Armes hard by him.</p>
                  <p>The Dutcheſſe (to expect me with more conveniencie in a place where I might bee received by night, without being incumbred with any watch) was retired to the Countrey, having at my parting from her given me the key of a Towre, that ſo I might ſteale in unto her unknowne to any body, and ſo indeede I came in thither unexpected, and found her a-bed broad waking, and entertained in diſcourſe by the Gentlewoman that was our counſell-keeper, who lay on a pallet at her beds feete. The Lampe let her ſoone ſee who I was, yet were her (at firſt ſight) exceſſive joyes mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeeing my right hand ſwadled up, and my arme hung in a ſcarfe at my neck, howſoeven ſhee imagined the diſaſter to be farre leſle than it was; for having found me herſelfe once before in a farre worſe taking, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving underſtood how the caſe ſtood, ſhee was like to ſinke downe dead at the conceit of it, but for my aſſuring her that I had ſlaine him: the ſenſe of this her griefe was aggravated by the accident of <hi>Corianna</hi> befallen in the ſelfe ſame time, but much more by the departure of her ſonnes; ſo as our content remained corrupted by the mortifications that ſuſpicions and feares wrought in her: Full often conceived ſhee (as indeede ſhee had good reaſon ſo to doe) that all ſlippes of women would be more rigorouſly examined for the Princeſſe's errours ſake; ſo as ſhee could by no meanes be perſwaded to deſiſt from weeping and grieving; beſides ſhee ſlept never a winke, which cauſed our before-amorous-watchings to be now changed into conſultations, diſcourſes, and preſages of evill: But Nature requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in me ſome repoſe, I was faine to ſleepe (as I may ſay) waking, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly was I troubled with the heart-rending tones of her lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; till at length I (unable to endure them any longer) grew to be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd thereat, that chooſing rather to dye than to ſee her ſo languiſh, I thus beſpake her.</p>
                  <p>Deere bliſſe of my joyes, I beſeech you prevent not the uncertaine evill with a certaine, what cauſe (I pray you) of feare have you, now that <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſo</hi> is dead and gone? ſithence wee may ſo behave ourſelves as the very ayre cannot ſmell out our ſecrets; twas nothing (alas) but meere jealouſie that made him beleeve the truth to be true, though (for all that) ſuch as he could not poſſibly be ever an eye-witneſſe unto, nor conſequently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelfe thereof. For, otherwiſe he had never (I warrant you) this long have deferr'd its diſcovery. Here interrupting me, Ah! <hi>Coralbo</hi> (ſaid ſhee) you are but young, you thinke that <hi>Cripaſſo</hi> is dead, but (the more woe is me) I feare me he yet lives, the accidents that you ſaw in him were (for what I gather by your deſcribing them) no other than convulſions and violent ſtupifying fits. I cannot beleeve but hee is by this time come to himſelfe againe, ſince hee hath not any wound, ſave that of his head that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7474:59"/>
can prove mortall: you tell mee that hee ſunke not downe preſently, but fought a good while after, whence I gather, that it was a ſtrangely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtupifying blow but not otherwiſe dangerous, which if it ſo prove to be, I am then a woman utterly undone. Beſides, your reaſon of our not being otherwiſe diſcovered than by a bare imagination is not good, ſince meere imagination in this caſe is ſufficient to make me loſe both life and honour. Beſides which, even <hi>Cripaſſo's</hi> behaviour towards mee ſpeakes him to bee more diſcreete, than to diſcredit himſelfe in blazoning to my infamy upon bare conjectures any miſcarriage he certainely knew not in me, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did him other injury than deny him my love, which nothing in him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged me to grant him: But now that hee hath for the ſelfe ſame occaſion beene ſo roughly handled by you, he will doubtleſſe endeavour to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of us both at once.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutcheſſe</hi> perſiſted conſtantly in theſe her opinions, from which I could not by any meanes divert her, eſpecially becauſe of their likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of being true, upon the divulging of newes, that <hi>Cripaſſo</hi> was found dangerouſly wounded, and that the Chirurgions had warranted his life; howbeit the wound on's face had ſo disfigured him, as he had not beene knowne but by his former and more ugly ſcarres; but how this had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him no man knew, becauſe of his concealing of both its author and occaſion.</p>
                  <p>On this, <hi>Criſanta</hi> began in her deſperation to conceive ſome hopes of comfort, from the conſideration of <hi>Cripaſſo's</hi> wonted modeſt demeanour, wherein his concealing the caſe ſeemed (to her thinking) to argue a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; but alas (good Lady) ſhee was therein exceedingly miſtaken. For, his affection (being corrupted by the injury ſuſtained, and extinguiſhed with deſire of revenge) egg'd on his cruelty to plot the miſchiefe, which afterwards he put in execution againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Cured that I was of my wounds, we reſolved upon my returne to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenope,</hi> that I ſhould goe finde out her ſonnes, and on my going (as ſoone as I had reconducted them home) to goe looke to my owne affaires, with an intention to ſend her (when I had recovered my kingdome) Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to eſpouſe her for mee. Accordingly I went, and found the two brothers in <hi>Parthenope</hi> confuſed in minde for my being departed, <hi>Cripaſſo's</hi> lying wounded, the impoſſibility of finding out the Princeſſe, the extreame perplexity of the King, and both deſolation and diſſolution of the Court. Returne home they would not, but deſired to goe travell as Knight-errant; I ſignified by letter ſo much unto the Dutcheſſe, who was well pleaſed therewithall, for being thereby freed of her minde-afflicting feare that in their way homewards they would call to ſee <hi>Cripaſſo,</hi> as they could (indeede) no leſſe than doe, his houſe lying right on their rode, which was (I profeſſe) a thing that I never dreamt of.</p>
                  <p>Some moneths ſpent we in this our journey, (wherein I was favoured with occaſions of obliging them ſundry times) and had continued it lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, had not the <hi>Dutcheſſe</hi> (who now thought her ſelfe ſecure) ſent for us home, where the affection betweene her and me (more ardent now than ever before) recalled us to our wonted pleaſures, when <hi>Cripaſſo</hi> ſent the brothers word to have a more chary reſpect to their honours, which for being ſo drily written, made them the more earneſtly deſirous to know the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7474:60"/>
occaſion thereof; but finding him unwilling either to come himſelfe to them, or to ſuffer them to come to him, they appointed a place to meete and conferre together, where he telsthem.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That</hi> hee having long before taken notice of the note-worthy favours which the Dutcheſſe hourely ſhew'd me, and of her good liking to mee, conſtrued them for no other than effects of noble courteſie; till ſuch time as he comming one day to ſee her, found the doore of her back-chamber faſt-locked, into which hee (becauſe hee heard there within ſome gentle ſtirring) obſervantly peeping through the key-hole, might there ſee her and I, in cloſe embraces together, whereof hee had no reaſon (though) to make any words of, the fact not concerning him otherwiſe than as a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſher to their houſe and honour: Beſides, his being the more unwilling to diſcover it, as well becauſe he thought it could not be remedied other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by violence, as alſo for the hope he conceived that my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would bring that evill to an end. Till ſeeing how I had in <hi>Parthenope</hi> left them embarke themſelves alone, of purpoſe to ſneake homewards without them, he reſolved to trace me, with an intention (in caſe I went that way) to prove a rubbe in my way: aſſuring himſelfe, that if he did not ſo, the infamy (till then kept ſecret) would for want of circumſpection in us be noted and made ſhortly knowne to all the world. But that fortune disfavouring him, he was by me ſhrewdly wounded and left for dead in the open field; with all which paſſages he thought fit to acquaint them, now that growne to mens eſtates, and honoured with the dignity of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, they might have an eye to their owne honours, wiſhing them withall to provide for the executing of what was intended, ſince he could warrant them, they ſhould without any great adoe <hi>catch</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>the hare in the parfley-bed.</hi>

                  <p>The young Noble-men (prickt to the quicke with ſuch unwelcome newes, and being beſides of their owne nature prone enough to any cruell reſolution, and yet more feelingly incenſed by his egging them on) reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to murther us both in the act; from which <hi>Cripaſſo</hi> diſſwaded them, by ſhewing, that it was fitte indeede that their deſigne ſhould be effected, but yet not at one and the ſame time, ſince it was beſt, firſt to kill mee and the Gentle-woman <hi>mediatrix,</hi> under pretext of having found us twaine naught together, and ſo ſave their owne honours with that of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; whom they might afterwards (without making any ſhew of ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting her) ſtrangle or make away by poyſon or other meanes, as they ſaw occaſion: Having thus concluded, they knew ſo well how to diſſemble, that we (having by this time cleane forgot <hi>Cripaſſo's</hi> injury) were taken napping when we leaſt thought of them.</p>
                  <p>It was paſt midnight when the Gentle-woman ruſh't in furiouſly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake us, whereupon I (gheſſing by the bouncing at the doore, what ſhee had to ſay, taking a farewell-kiſſe of the Dutcheſſe, and clothing my ſelfe as well as haſte permitted me) tooke my weapons in hand: By when the doore (for not being opened from within when they knocked) was beaten downe from without, with no leſſe force than fury. Whereupon the <hi>Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe</hi> (fearing leſt her ſonnes ſhould come and finde me) beſought mee to flye, which I would not, for not letting her be ſlaine unrevenged; till at length upon her aſſuring me, they would beare her reſpect, I gave way to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7474:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
her perſwaſions. My reſolution of obeying her, and the burſting open of the doore hapned in the ſelfe ſame inſtant of time, ſo as they ſaw the firſt ſteps of my flight: Vpon this, leaving the reſt, they haſtily purſued me, though their being unacquainted with the roomes marr'd all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne; for, they beleeved, that my comming in was through the ordinary doore, through which they had entred, which alſo made them miſſe of me many nights before, that they had ſpent in watching my comming; not without ſuſpition that <hi>Cripaſſo,</hi> to revenge himſelfe of me, had maliciouſly invented this ſlander; whereupon ſome diſpute fell betweene them, till hee cauſing mee to be ſearch'd for in my chamber, underſtood that I was gone thence, though he was yet confident, that I muſt needs have come in the right way through the lodgings, (which indeede I did never) ſo as he made full account to penne me in; ſince having (as he thought) but one way to enter, they had now left me none at all to goe out through.</p>
                  <p>The Dutcheſſe's withdrawing chamber butted on an arch, erected on a backalley through which no man paſſed; it had anciently ſerved for a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to another houſe, which (till it happened to be burnt) was a member of the Pallace, the arch remaining ever ſithence unuſefull, and its doore ſhut, and ſo covered with the Arras-hangings, as there was none but her ſelfe and ſome of her ancienteſt ſervants that knew there was any ſuch: On the out-ſide of this Arch ſtood an old ladder to get downe by, which wanted in ſome places one, and in other two rongues; the roome was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low, full of filth and rubbiſh, and o're-growne with brambles, weedes, and briars, having two other roomes adjoyning to it, the foremoſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was aſſured with a good lock and key, through which I ſecretly came and return'd without any danger.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that purſued me were foure, <hi>Cripaſſo,</hi> the two brothers, and one ſervant; but the foremoſt of them was <hi>Cripaſſo,</hi> who came running after me with ſword in hand; faine as live would I have turn'd to ſtrike at him, but doubting to bee overtaken by the brothers (whom I had no will to injure) I went fairely onwards, fortune favouring mee beyond either my expectation or imagination; for being ſlowly purſued, becauſe of their conceiting to penne me up in the farther chamber, where-hence they ſaw no way for me to get out; I had leiſure to deſcend the ladder without any danger; for in drawing onely the Arch-doore together after me, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived them of the time (although it were but ſhut with a latchet) of hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering my deſcent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cripaſſo</hi> marveiling to ſee me gotten ſo low downe, unacquainted with the place, but much more with the defects of the ladder, (the torch which the ſervant carried not ſufficiently illuminating all thoſe darkeſome by-corners) and he withall ſeeing but very litle for being very weake-ſighted, tumbled (for the extreame haſte that he made to purſue mee) headlong downe from one end of the ladder to the other; whereat I reſolved now neither to loſe any time, nor to faile to kill him as I did the other time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore runne him (for making the ſurer worke of him) at two thruſts through the neck and breſt; in the later whereof, I ranne my ſword up to the hilts, conformable to my deſire, whileſt the reſt of his company ſtood immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſpectators from above for feare of the precipice: This done, I went my wayes, keying faſt after me the doore that had the lock on it, to hinder
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7474:61"/>
them from purſuing me, and ſo hying me to the City walls, I got me out without any great adoe, and then (during all the reſt of the night) travelled a-foote the ſpeedieſt pace I could towards that part of the country where its territory was narroweſt, for I thought my ſelfe ſafe enough in any other dominion.</p>
                  <p>Continuing this my journey, I chanced to meete (by good fortune) a Knight with whom I had beene acquainted at <hi>Parthenope,</hi> who by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of certaine lands was a great enemy to <hi>Cripaſſo;</hi> to this Knight enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the occaſion that he ſaw me ſo a-foote, I unmasked the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſave that in ſteede of the Dutcheſſe I made him beleeve, that I went to enjoy her woman, and was faine to ſave my ſelfe with <hi>Cripaſſo</hi>'s death; Whereupon the Knight affectionately embracing mee, told me, hee was much bound to me, inviting me withall to his Caſtle, where he aſſured me, that I ſhould not neede to feare or doubt of any thing; I thankfully accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the invitation, but deſired (for his ſafegard aſwell as mine owne) to abide there undiſcovered, whileſt he ſuddenly diſpatch'd away a diſcreete Gentleman, to goe learne if <hi>Cripaſſo</hi> were dead indeede, and how ſlaine.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman after a few dayes return'd and told him, That fortuning to bee entertained and lodged by a Knight who was an intimate friend of his, and a boſome one of the brethren, he had not onely beene informed, but was alſo by him favoured to ſee under the ſeale of ſecrecie the whole truth of the fact; which was, <hi>That Cripaſſo</hi> was dead for certaine; <hi>That</hi> the brothers having dragg'd the Dutcheſſe's Gentlewoman to the top of the ladder, had tumbled her downe headlong over it, and then ſlaine her upon <hi>Cripaſſo</hi>'s corps, martyrizing her with ſo many wounds, that her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ſeene all over pierced through with ſtabbes: <hi>That</hi> the Dutcheſſe could neither with authority nor entreaty obtaine life for her, but was (oh unnaturall cruelty!) her ſelfe the day following by them-themſelves cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly ſtrangled; and the Coffin happening to be too ſhort for her, one of them ſtept up on her legges that reached out of the Coffin, and with his feete cruſh'd them to pieces, that the Cheſt might containe them; and all becauſe ſhee was taken with me, they having beene before advertized by <hi>Cripaſſo</hi> of all the particulars by me related.</p>
                  <p>Now though they had not publiſhed the caſe to bee as it was indeede (they giving out, they had ſurprized me with the Gentlewoman, and that the Dutcheſſe extreamely affrighted to ſee her ſlaine before her face, died in the place for meere feare) yet had they (for all that) imprudently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the truth to moſt of their friends, ſo as the people came to know it by having their conjecture in that behalfe confirmed by the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin's being nail'd up and pitched, ere any body was ſuffered to ſee it; <hi>That Cripaſſo</hi>'s corps were embalmed up, and ſolemnly ſent to his owne <hi>barony,</hi> (upon a chariot of black velvet, drawne by eight horſes covered and trapp'd with the ſame downe to the ground) accompanied with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Gentlemen, clad they them ſelves and their Courſers with their head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalls plumes and trappings all in black, with unbraced drummes, ſordine trumpets, trailed ſtandards and mournefull muſick.</p>
                  <p>On would <hi>Coralbo</hi> have proceeded in his ſtory, but here interrupted with ſudden ſobbings he was forced to reiterate by the dropping of a few great pearle-like teares his (in this manner many times re-ſolemnized) fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7474:61"/>
of his beloved <hi>Criſanta; Polimero</hi> therefrom not diverting him, for his conceiving the not giving way to juſt griefes to be a thing too farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from humane putty: but ſoone after the water being ſoaked away with the drought of reaſon, ſtopp'd of it ſelfe; and then hee bluſhing to ſee himſelfe (according to the opinion of ſome) contrary to a manly ſpirit o're-maſtered by his affections, after a ſhort pauſe thus ſpake on.</p>
                  <p>Of the two hundred Gentlemen which accompanied (as I told you) <hi>Cripaſſo</hi>'s corps, fifty ſolemnly vowed, to ſpend one yeares time in the ſearch of me, and in caſe they found me out, to bring and ſacrifice mee on the ſlaine <hi>Cripaſſ</hi>'s tombe; And miſſing to light on mee in that yeares ſpace, though they were thence forwards freed from further ſeeking after me, yet remain'd they (in caſe they ever fortuned to meete me) ſtill tied to the ſame obligation. Vnderſtood that I had theſe unhappy newes, I would needes part ſuddenly, all perſwaſions of retaining me any longer proving diſſoluble and to no purpoſe. Having then procured (of the Knight my hoaſt and friend) the favour of furniſhing me with compleate Armes, and refuſed thoſe he would have had me take for being too ſuperfluous, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me with thoſe I now weare, I cauſed to be pourtrayted on my ſhield the <hi>Impreſa</hi> of the <hi>ſwan,</hi> ſtampt in the internall part of my imagination ever ſince I was a childe, upon the occaſion of the old diſaſters of my poore home, whereunto this new one in my conceit came neere enough.</p>
                  <p>It was my luck to meete ere I embarked my ſelfe, with eight of the fifty Gentlemen, of whom underſtanding the oath they had taken, I had the fortune to abſolve them of it, by from ſome taking and to others giving their lives. Come to <hi>Taranto</hi> I met with the ninth, without either know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him or he me; Wee embarked both of us in the ſame ſhippe, where, upon his telling me whom he ſought after, I could have found in my heart to have fought with him then inſtantly; but (conſidering the ſhips being full of paſſengers) I forbare till we arrived in <hi>Feacia,</hi> and then made my ſelfe knowne unto him, where gone a-ſhore, <hi>Mars</hi> favoured my cauſe with the death of the purſuer. And then paſſing over into <hi>Creete,</hi> I came thence to <hi>Egypt</hi> where you found me, and by your valour ſaved me from my ſecond murtherers. My intent now is, to croſſe over hence to <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> there either to recover my kingdome or loſe my life; or if neither this nor that, yet ſhall I (at leaſt) ſee with my owne eyes the reaſons that exclude me from all further hopes thereof, that I may then returne me thence to the Iland my nurſe, and there ſpend and end the reſidue of my dayes.</p>
                  <p>The noble <hi>Polimero</hi> was ſo taken both with the relation of theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and with the perſon that related them, that (embracing him with an affectionate reſpect) hee thus beſpake him. <hi>Prince Coralbo,</hi> I crave you humble pardon if in any thing I have failed to tender you the honour due to your quality, whereinalthough my not knowing you might (in ſome regard) ſerve me for an excuſe, yet meane I not to ſteede mee therewith, becauſe my not diſcovering in you thoſe indelible markes of a Prince ſtamptin you by nature, merits juſt accuſation. But ſithence it cannot now be otherwiſe remedied, I ſhall endeavour to make my future ſervice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in part an amends for my paſt miſcarriages, and will beſides (ſo you but favour me with your courteous leave) be a fellow-ſharer in your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7474:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the being of both of us ſtrangers in Armes and language will ſecure us from all dangers, ſo that you ſhall not need to make your ſelfe knowne to any other than ſuch, whom (for your affaires ſake) you ſhall reveale your ſelfe unto.</p>
                  <p>This courteous proffer <hi>Coralbo</hi> could not but accept of, acknowledging him no ſmall obligation for this his ſo highly-engaging favour. So travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling toward <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> it grew to be twilight ere they were aware that they had ſtraid out of their way, yet even then and later too the clime of <hi>Egypt</hi> is canoped with ſo bright a skie, that there the night (though deprived of its greater light) is yet very brightſome and cleare, the golden ſplendor of the ſtarres being of themſelves (for not being clouded with any foggie va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours ariſing from below) ſufficiently lightſome to illuminate that portion of the earth: the ayre alſo enjoying there a faire open <hi>horiſon</hi> (for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damm'd in by any neere bordering mountaines) glories in having no other ſhade ſave onely ſuch as are meerely accidentall.</p>
                  <p>Thus in darkened light or lighting darkeneſſe continued theſe Princes on their intended journey till almoſt midnight, without meeting with any one, of whom they could enquire the way, ſo as now imagining they had loſt it (as indeed they had) they were much perplext in minde, their Steeds being well nigh quite tired and fainty with extreame thirſt, when of one ſide of them they might deſcrie glimmering a litle light; yet not certaine of its being really ſuch (the interpoſing trees not ſuffering them to judge whether it were indeede ſuch or no) <hi>Coralbo</hi> deſirous to be cleered of his doubt, and at length through his accurate obſerving infallibly aſſured it was no ſtarre, told <hi>Polimero,</hi> that for certaine there were houſes neere at hand; riding then towards the light, they ſaw it vaniſh them in an inſtant, yet holding on their way directly thitherward, they were ſoone gotten into a faire large greene, encircled with a pleaſing row of palme-trees or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly planted; about the which in an artificiall channell rowled over a bed of ſnow-white pible, a litle chriſtall brooke moſt pleaſantly murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; from thence they diſcerned (faſt by them) a houſe with lights in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of its roomes; whereat they no ſooner knocked than they were cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly ſpoken unto; but yet the porter would (ere hee would open the doore) needs firſt goe know his Ladies pleaſure, which was not needfull;) for ſhee appearing her ſelfe preſently at a window, courteouſly asked them who they were? Two ſtranger-knights of a remote Countrey (anſwered her <hi>Polimero)</hi> who being out of their way, pray to be either favoured with a nights lodging, or directed where they may get one; which hee (endeavouring to expreſſe in that countrey language) uttered with ſuch difficulty, that ſeeing the Lady returne him no anſwer, he perſwaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that ſhee underſtood him not; till upon his returning to repeate his former ſpeech, ſhee told him, that ſhee had already underſtood him, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſhee praid him to tell her what countrey-men they were? Wee are (ſaid <hi>Polimero) Auſonians;</hi> how <hi>Auſonians</hi> (replied the Lady) your pronunciation (me thinkes) and accent hath but ſmall affinity with thoſe of that Nation? Yea Madame (anſwered her then <hi>Coralbo</hi> in the pure <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trurian</hi> tongue) we are indeede of <hi>Auſonia,</hi> and now goe travelling abroad through the world, to finde out warres and adventures.</p>
                  <p>The Lady now bethinking with her ſelfe, that ſhee ſhould know that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7474:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
voyce and accent, commanded the gates to be preſently opened; ſo then the Knights (demounting off their Steedes in a faire courtelage) were with a paire of torches lighted into the hall, where they were courteouſly received by the Lady, accompanied with a moſt beautifull damoſell her daughter, the neere reſemblance ſhee had with her confirming her to bee ſuch, both of them as well in geſture as countenance diſcovering an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable majeſty: They entertain'd theſe two Knights not after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of countrey gentry, but with a ſtately grave deportment as the moſt accompliſht Ladies of the Court, preſenting them (in expreſſion of their welcome) with a glaſſe of faire fountaine water deliciouſly tempered with Sugar and the juyce of Lemmons, to qualifie their internally diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring heate, and then commanded ſupper to be ſpeedily made ready: But the Knights already infinitely ſatisfied both in the way of welcome and ſweetely-grave aſpect of the noble Lady, beſought her to forbeare the incommodating her family for them, it being ſo late as they wondred they found them not all a-ſleepe, telling her, that a dry cruſt with a litle fruite, and that moſt delicate water ſhould ſuffice them to their exceeding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
                  <p>To this the Lady ſmilingly replied, that ſhee had not as yet ſupp'd her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe, but ſeeing them admire thereat; 'Tis my cuſtome (ſaid ſhee) to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my hunger at the ſummons not of the clock but of my ſtomack, and therefore I now meane to ſuppe, for I onely eate when my appetite invites mee, a cuſtome that I have ever obſerved, and ever found my ſelfe the healthier for it; This the Knights did well approve of, inſtancing the like in a Queene and a great Prince of their countrey. But the Lady deſirous to be enformed of their occaſions, with a gravely-limited boldneſſe asked them; Whitherward could any affaire of theirs leade them that way, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they could not travell on any farther, without firſt croſſing the ſeas, whereunto <hi>Polimero</hi> endeavouring to make anſwer, but expreſſing it with much difficulty. Sir, ſaid the Lady (in a moſt ſweetly-reſpective manner interrupting him) I am loath to prove ſo unmannerly troubleſome unto you, as to put you to ſpeake a language you cannot readily expreſſe. Bee therefore pleaſed (I beſeech you) that this other Knight your companion eaſe you of that trouble, by ſpeaking in his owne native tongue, wherein I having got a little knowledge (out of the curioſity I formerly had in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing ſometime in the reading of it) ſhall underſtand him very well, and his accent too farre better than I can yours; which ſhee ſaid, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning now to grow yet more ſuſpicious that he was <hi>Coralbo,</hi> ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be cleared of that doubt. <hi>Polimero</hi> glad to be eaſied of that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, with willingly obeying her, aſſured her, that his companion was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in that tongue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coralbo</hi> thank'd him for his good opinion of his language, and then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſively inclining to the Lady, told her, that he received her commands as eſpeciall favours; and that touching their journey, they intended to croſſe the ſeas, to ſee the Kingdome and Court of <hi>Arabia Foelix,</hi> which in the laſt deceaſed Kings time was famed to be very great.</p>
                  <p>The Lady greedily peering him in the face, and then ſuddenly glauncing her eyes on her daughter, made no anſwer at all: In this often tranſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her lookes ſhee ſo long perſiſted, that ſhee gave <hi>Polimero</hi> occaſion
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7474:63"/>
to take notice thereof, who doing by her example the like, perceived ſhee did it not without very good reaſon, conſidering the affinity of favour ſhee might obſerve betweene the Knight and the damoſell; which later when he had well obſerved together with <hi>Coralbo,</hi> favoured both of them very much the Lady her Mother; who (with that) eſpying his left arme hung in a skarfe, ask'd him, what hurt he had there; hee (not as yet cured of the wounds lately received of the <hi>Arabians)</hi> anſwered, It was nothing but a ſlight ſcratch; whereat ſhee ſeeming to bee ſorry, told him, ſhee would then preſently cure him her ſelf, being provided of the beſt wound-balme that ever <hi>Arabia</hi> diſtilled; But he replied, that he durſt not ſo farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to treſpaſſe on her goodneſſe, as to repute himſelfe worthy of ſo great a favour, and that ſhee needed not trouble her ſelfe about it, ſince he could very well make a ſhift to dreſſe it himſelfe as hee went to bed: To that ſhee agreed not, but taking in her hand a golden viall (that her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had by now brought her) ſhee dropt thereout two or three graines weight, which yeelded ſo pleaſing an odour, that all the ſenſes and ſpirits were thereby exceedingly comforted and recreated. And then it behoved <hi>Coralbo</hi> to ſuffer himſelfe to be dreſt, the Lady caſting (the meane while) her eye on that hand, to ſee if he had there a litle halfe moone-reſembling ſcarre, that hee had once cut with a knife neere the roote of his thumbe, which ſhee eſpying, remained (though ſhee made no ſhew thereof) the joyfulleſt woman breathing.</p>
                  <p>Supper being by this time laid on the table neatly furniſhed, with napery and ſervice ſurpaſſing the quality of a private Lady, they ſate downe to meate, ſhee (all ſupper-while) ever-enquiring ſomething of <hi>Auſonia</hi> &amp; <hi>Etruria;</hi> But when ſhee named <hi>Nepa</hi> and the Iland of <hi>Capraia, Coralbo</hi> could have bitten his fingers for meere madneſſe thereat; which obſervantly perceived by her gave a ſupplement to her content. As ſoone therefore as the cloth was taken away and the ſeruants departed the roome, ſhee thus beſpake them.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, yee are much bound to fortune for being ſo favourable to you, as to conduct you hither, ere your paſſing over into <hi>Arabia,</hi> ſithence when you had beene there knowne to be of that countrey whence you are come, you would have incurr'd the danger of being unrecoverably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, eſpecially you (Sir Knight) being <hi>Coralbo,</hi> or another in his ſhape in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhable; whom if you be, as I am well aſſured you are, let mee then tell you, that you cannot repoſe truſt in any, that either more deerely loves him, or can perhaps in ſome reſpects better adviſe him in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of his affaires than my ſelfe; feare not therefore to diſcover your ſelfe to me, for (howſoever) I certainely know you to bethe very ſame.</p>
                  <p>Here ſeeing them gaze with admiration one upon the other (as though they ſummoned all their wits to counſell how they ſhould beſt deviſe an anſwer for her) ſhe proceeded: You neede not ſtand gazing ſo ſtrangely each on other, nor yet feare or any thing doubt of the preſence of this my daughter; for ſhee deſires more to ſee in happy ſtate <hi>Coralbo,</hi> than doth any other wight living: At which words the damoſell wept, the Mother after a long reſtraint accompanying her with her teares.</p>
                  <p>By this time <hi>Coralbo</hi> was ſo diſtracted in minde as he knew not what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſay or thinke, imagining, that being ſo ſoone knowne by a woman,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7474:63"/>
he muſt neceſſarily be ſooner ſitted out and ſounded by any man that he ſhould happen to converſe withall; and that it could not otherwiſe be, but that ſome private marke of his was made manifeſt by ſome ſecret ſpies. Conſidering therefore with himſelfe, that his intended journey could not but prove dangerous unto him, he thought it his ſafeſt courſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the diſcovery of his perſon and being to the truſt of that noble Lady, who by her words and teares could not chooſe but love him, and be of the Queene his mothers faction; yet amidd'ſt all his feares and doubts he had (though the worſt that betide might, betided him) this one comfort to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him, that he was as yet in a countrey free from all dangers, and remote enough from any power of his enemy: <hi>Polimero</hi> likewiſe grew to be thereat exceedingly confuſed in minde, till lighting on the ſelfe ſame reaſons, he beckened unto the other to diſcover himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The Lady having (the meane while) dried her beteared eyes, boldly tooke him by the left hand, and ſmilingly obſerving it, For certaine (ſaid ſhee) you are undoubtedly <hi>Coralbo;</hi> To this he now o're-come with the confidencie of her affirmation, anſwered: I cannot imagine (noble Lady) what ſhould move you to ſay I am hee, what markes (I beſeech you) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrie you in me that denote me to be ſuch? What markes (ſaid ſhee) mary the age of ſeventeene yeares as hath <hi>Coralbo,</hi> a face ſhaped and favoured like his, when he was as yet but ten yeares old, and this ſcarre that <hi>Coralbo</hi> cut in his hand at table, his mother being preſent, when ſhee came ſeven yeares ſithence to viſit him at <hi>Nepa;</hi> other markes too I yet know beſides, but will not tell them you, unleſſe you confeſſe that you are he: <hi>Coralbo</hi> now looking on his hand, and therewithall calling to minde that cut, and how his owne mother had dreſt it and bound it up, remained more aſtoniſhed than ever, ſo as he now could hold no longer from ſaying:</p>
                  <p>Much honoured Lady; the markes and deſcription which your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and noble courteſie have vouchſafed to impart and particularize to me, are ſo punctuall and unrefuteable, that I cannot deny me to be <hi>Coralbo;</hi> whom if I were not, I would yet heartily wiſh to be, were it but to ſerve you: At theſe words ſhee riſing off the table with her daughter, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him about the neck; Since you then (ſaid ſhee) are my ſonne <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralbo,</hi> behold here your diſinherited mother and ſiſter, not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, ſince their eyes are once more bleſt with the now heart-extaſing ſight of you: <hi>Coralbo</hi> who at their firſt motion of riſing up, was riſen with them, at the inſtant of his hearing theſe words proſtrates himſelfe on his knees to her, whence ſhee raiſing him up, ſtood ſome while embracing him with a motherly tenderneſſe; Nor had ſhee ſo ſoone freed him from out the weake priſon of her armes, but that reaſon commanded her to communicate him to her daughter his ſiſter, the affects thereon enſuing proving ſuch as even <hi>Polimero</hi> himſelfe was ſo o're-maſtered with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame tenderneſſe of a fellow-feeling compaſſion, as he could not refraine from bearing a part in their weeping conſort. The Mother afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding who he was, and wherefore come thither, could never be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in manifeſting by moſt lively affects the gratefulneſſe of a royall minde obliged. But ſeeing that the night was (by this time) farre ſpent.</p>
                  <p>Right noble Prince (ſaid ſhee) it is not convenient that my joyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come diſcommodious to you; the preſent reaſon requires repoſe, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7474:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Coralbo</hi>'s wounds eaſe and reſt; To morrow is a new day, and then wee will conferre together at better leiſure: With that, ſhee leading him on to a withdrawing chamber there hard by, conſigned him to the care of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Gentlemen to helpe him to bed. Whileſt <hi>Coralbo,</hi> not having the power to part from her, would needs know of her the manner and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her comming to reſide in that place. But ſhee differring it till the enſuing day, got him at length (with much adoe) to goe to bed; where ſleeping litle or nothing, by reaſon of ſuch alterations of affections, he got up earlier than his paſſed toyle would have another time permitted him.</p>
                  <p>The day being come, there needed no conſort of Muſick to ſummon them to come together, their ſeverall deſires being ſufficiently powerfull to effect that office. The Queene finding <hi>Polimero</hi> juſt as he had made an end of cloathing himſelfe, entertained by <hi>Coralbo</hi> who was already dreſt, leades him into the garden, to take the benefit of the freſh ayre; when ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her ſelfe betweene them both under an arbour of <hi>Gelſomine,</hi> and her daughter cloſe by her brothers ſide, ſhe thus framed her ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>I know that I cannot well deferre the relation of your affaires <hi>(Coralbo)</hi> though I would gladly doe it, ſince they cannot but prove unpleaſing unto you; yet ſince it pleaſeth the heavens they ſhould ſo be, we muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at their unreſiſtable predeſtination. I perſwade my ſelfe that you came hither in hope to make triall of your valour: But (alas!) ſuch a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſhould be of the fortitude of the minde, and of other vertues thereto correſpondding; the ſtrength and valour of the body comming now too late any way to ſteede you. This much I thought good to acquaint you firſt withall, for preventing of thoſe paſſions which Nature &amp; Reaſon might adminiſter you: And now to goe on with your ſtory.</p>
                  <p>At my comming to <hi>Nepa,</hi> I left in <hi>Cardamina</hi> (the onely reſiding-place I had then left me) <hi>Dariacan</hi> a ſervant once deare to your Father, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent ſecret intelligence of my departure to King <hi>Bramac</hi> my ſonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law, capituled to yeeld him up that Hould, on condition that all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure there found ſhould be his, <hi>Bramac</hi> made a ſhew of being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented for the treaſure, but not for the reſt, pretending to have delivered up into his hands together with <hi>Cardamina</hi> your perſon, imagining (it ſhould ſeeme) that I would at my returne bring you back along with me, which induced him to deferre the effecting as then of his firſt complotted treachery, for the aſſurance that he had of putting in execution at the ſelfe ſame time both the one and the other.</p>
                  <p>Faining then to have beleeved that I was gone to the Oracle, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the bordering Governours to have a care of my eſtate, that it were not incroach'd on, nor prejudiced by any whatſoever; making by this ſeeming-good office a ſhew of being not only alienated from any evill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but alſo tenderly carefull that no other ſhould offer me any injury. So that at my returne I had cauſe to give him tharkes for it, hee then alſo making a ſhew of honouring me, by ſending me Embaſſadours, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of congratulating my returne, came to eſpie whether you were come with me or no: But getting afterwards out of-<hi>Dariacan</hi> all my ſecrets, he bade him counſell and perſwade me your returne, as being the requeſt of the greater part of the Barons ill ſatisfied with the preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; I ſimple woman, beleeving him, taking his having conſerved
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7474:64"/>
me <hi>Cardamina</hi> (whereof I ever doubted) for an aſſured teſtimony of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable fidelity, reſolved to ſend you <hi>Cogamar</hi> the brother of <hi>Stelinete</hi> your Squire, him whom (from among a number of others) <hi>Sotiro</hi> had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for your ſervice: which happened the ſelfe ſame time that <hi>Sotiro</hi> (for not having heard any newes from me ſince my parting from <hi>Etrunia)</hi> had ſent to mee <hi>Stelinete:</hi> And as fortune would have it, the brothers met by the way, and reciprocally truſted each other with the ſumme and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of their ſeverall commiſſions: There <hi>Cogamar</hi> (through the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he held with <hi>Dariacan)</hi> being acquainted with the Kings deſignes, and conſequently corrupted, imparts it to the other, not to make him the inſtrument of remedying or preventing it, but rather a meanes to content the Tyrant, by effecting his deſire; ſhewing him, how all our hopes were quite extinct, <hi>Bramac</hi> poſſeſſed of all, and they in the way of being (for ſuch a maſter-piece of ſervice) advanced to great honours and ſpeciall favour; objecting unto him on the other ſide, the poverty and miſeries of ſo long an exile, the irkeſome tediouſneſſe of a ſolitary life in an Iland, (eſpecially in a Countrey ſo remote from their native clime) without any likelihood of ever expecting (after all theſe ſufferings) from our excluſion and poore condition, other than poverty, excluſion, dangers, and a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and unhappy end.</p>
                  <p>The wicked <hi>Stelinete</hi> who till then had continued honeſt, meerely for the hope he had, that you (reſtored to your royall ſtate) would richly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him; ſeeing now the effect (to his thinking) impoſſible, preſently turned coate, and that (as you ſhall heare) a moſt villanous way too; for reaſoning with himſelfe upon other mens infidelity by the argument of his owne, hee concluded it a point of wiſedome to prevent the uncertaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Princes, but more particularly of <hi>Bramac,</hi> knowing there was no reciprocall relation of any vertue (eſpecially of that of gratitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Tyrant &amp; the Traytor) with a certaine one, whereof he might beſides'be himſelfe his owne carver; So being firſt perſwaded by his brother to one arch-plot of wickedneſſe, he now perſwades him to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more baſe, if not more wicked.</p>
                  <p>For hee tels him of the treaſure reſerved and truſted to the guard of ſtones in the Iland of <hi>Capraia,</hi> and buried under the fained ruines of a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cottage, with letting him ſee, how the taking it away would prove a ſervice very ſteedable to <hi>Bramac,</hi> for thereby depriving you of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall meanes of recovering your kingdome; eſpecially now that I (for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived of the treaſure I had in <hi>Cardamina)</hi> had not wherewithall to maintaine my ſelfe, much leſſe ſuch an Army as were requiſite for ſo long and expenſive an enterpriſe as this of ours was like to prove.</p>
                  <p>This deſigne of <hi>Stelinete</hi> was partly conformable to <hi>Cogamar</hi>'s avarice, though he could not ſuddenly approve of it, bethinking with himſelfe, that being ſent to put one plot in effect, it lay not within the reach of his braine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece to forme thereof a ſecond. But at length the eye of his judgement becomming dazled with the certainety of lucre, made him blinde to more wholſome conſiderations, ſo as diſpencing with the expreſſe commiſſion firſt given him, he reſolved to follow <hi>Stelinete</hi>'s counſell, who fraighting a ſhip of purpoſe, ſteered from <hi>Paphos</hi> (where they had met) by <hi>Creete, Feacia,</hi> and <hi>Parthenope</hi> to the <hi>Elbe,</hi> and thence in a good fiſhing-boate to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7474:65"/>
                     <hi>Capraia,</hi> where they alone (having firſt eaſily removed the rubbiſh that ſtopp'd up the paſſage to it) tooke thence away the treaſure, packing up ſuch things as they had pick'd out for <hi>Bramac</hi> in the ſame manner that they were brought thither, a trade that <hi>Stelinete</hi> was well verſed in, this not being the firſt time he had done it.</p>
                  <p>They had once determined before their going to <hi>Capraia,</hi> that <hi>Cogamar</hi> ſhould paſſe over to <hi>Nepa,</hi> &amp; having there executed his commiſſion ſhould then returne to <hi>Stelinete</hi> who was to expect him: But the difficulties that oppoſed that propoſition were many, and among the reſt one, that he could not ſo part thence without miniſtring ſubject of jealouſie to <hi>Sotiro,</hi> who in caſe he beleeved him, would (as was preſumed) have come along himſelfe to conduct you, which he could not have done, neither, ere hee had firſt gone to <hi>Capraia;</hi> where, upon miſſing the treaſure he would have ſmell'd out the treachery: On this confideration, then they concluded, that the one could not be handſomely effected, without leaving the other altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unattempted.</p>
                  <p>Being come to <hi>Zambra,</hi> they there found the King, where <hi>Cogamar</hi> knowne by ſome (who were altogether ignorant of the Kings ſtratagems) was laid hold on, upon ſuſpition of being ſent by me as a ſpie to the Court, and upon this conjecture laying a thouſand criminall matters to his charge. <hi>Bramac</hi> commanded him to be brought before him, as though he would have examined him himſelfe; but finding his command unexecuted, hee cauſed both him and his brother to be firſt gagg'd, and then cruelly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to death, giving out, that they were ſent thither by <hi>Sotiro</hi> to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt with the treaſure of the Crowne the Subjects loyalty and States qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe. At the ſelfe ſame time he commanded <hi>Dariacan</hi> to lay hands on me too; but I (being by ſome of my more truſty friends advertiſed thereof) ſaved my ſelfe by flight, taking on me to goe to <hi>Are</hi> a neighbouring Iland, to take the ayre, carrying along with me a ſmall part of the gold, but well nigh all my Iewels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dartacan</hi> having preſently after my departure received order to arreſt me, cauſed me to be purſued in vaine, I being (by that time they had traced me to the kingdomes limits) got (out of all danger) over hitherward on the ſhore and territory of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bramac</hi> hearing the newes of my eſcape, not imagining that I could be advertized by any in a matter ſo ſecret, but beleeving (or at leaſtwiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſhew of beleeving) that <hi>Dariacan</hi> himſelfe had beene the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall meane of my flight, went in perſon to <hi>Cardamina,</hi> upon the walls whereof he cauſed him to be hanged up, ſo giving him (as he had before done to the reſt) the guerdion due to their treacherie.</p>
                  <p>I (truſting on the King of <hi>Egypt</hi>'s royall protection) retired me hither, where in this private manner of life I could live more contentedly than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, were it not for the conſideration of your perſon, whoſe ill fortune is the onely thing that makes me miſerable and unhappy. Vpon this ſhe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd with two fugitive teares, but repelling their followers with a more than womanly conſtancie of courage, thus proceeded.</p>
                  <p>Now upon this ſtate of things it remaines, that wee ſee what reſolution wee were beſt to fix on; whether to tire our fortune or no, or whether or no the very trying it be not dangerous to our weakneſſe. I know there is no
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7474:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man can better counſell us herein than your Highneſſe, Prince <hi>Polimero;</hi> yet I hope you will hold me excuſed that I begge not that favour of you; becauſe I perſwade my ſelfe that you being come hither in favour and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of <hi>Coralbo,</hi> will thinke it unbefitting your great ſpirit to adviſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than for the enterpriſe: at the Queenes thus hitting the very white of the truth <hi>Polimero</hi> bluſht; But ſhee not ſtaying for his anſwer ſpake on.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall herein deſire no other than <hi>Coralbo</hi>'s opinion, whereunto I will (ſo his reaſons convince mine) willingly ſubſcribe. Hee after a ſhort pauſe with a demurely-reſolute aſpect, made her this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>I pretend not to convince you (Madame) but onely in humble manner to expreſſe my ſelfe, ſeeing it is your will to command me ſo to doe. Many things there are which out of reaſon and honeſty ought to be done, and yet are not done for being thought unexpedient, which I beleeve beares a great ſtroake over you in the conſideration of this our caſe. I (for my part) was borne a Prince, and am by Order a Knight, it behooves mee then to dye like whom I was borne, and doe like whom I am; if dangers had wherewithall to binde our hands, there would then never any thing be done in the world, Beſides, that ſecurity and danger ſometimes ſo neerly reſemble each other, and are in humane actions ſo confuſed (as it were) that they glide through our hands undiſtinguiſhed; in ſo much as we often take (or rather indeede miſtake) the one for the other, ſo as if reaſon will that wee take hold of this, the ſelfe-ſame commands us not to deſpaire of that.</p>
                  <p>How many from out of lothſome priſons (hourely expecting the deadly ſtroake of the executioner) have beene happily transferr'd to the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of honours and crownes? And how many againe ſwaying Royall Scepters have by their owne guards (in whom they repoſed the ſafegard of their lives and perſons) beene cruelly butchered and inhumanely mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered? A <hi>Prince's heart</hi> therefore ſhould never be either <hi>elevated</hi> with felicity or <hi>deprest</hi> with miſery, but <hi>ever indifferent</hi> though in farre different fortunes; never beleeving deſtiny to be growne ſo powerfull, that valour back'd by diſcretion can no more countermand it, and though no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit could be reaped from it, yet will it in all the ſeaſons of his age be for a mans honour and commendations to dye valiantly a faire death. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerving he had thus ſet a period to his ſpeech, with a gravely-ſad ſmile thus replied.</p>
                  <p>I ſee then you anſwer me not in jeſt <hi>(Coralbo)</hi> ſince in ſteede of reaſons you give me ſentences; yet (alas!) did you but know, how eaſie they are in their <hi>explicating,</hi> and how hard in their <hi>experimenting,</hi> you would then (I am perſwaded) have omitted the reading them. <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>ſpeculation,</hi> doing and ſpeaking, are as <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>pourtraiture;</hi> the one really <hi>makes</hi> what the other but viſually <hi>repreſents.</hi> And although thoſe firſt reall bodies be not in that degree of perfection as the exactneſſe of the unfallible Art of the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> would require, yet are they nevertheleſſe both lively and neceſſary, whereas the ſecond being either meerely <hi>imaginary,</hi> or at the beſt but the brats of fancie, are but <hi>inanimate</hi> and ſuperfluous.</p>
                  <p>The Philoſophers (humanities picture-drawers) have indeede drawne many pictures of her, without being (for their hearts) able to adde to her
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7474:66"/>
other beauties, than ſuch as are apparant in her face, covering the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (whereunto they knew not what proportion to give) with ſide gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they called <hi>habits;</hi> but if Nature had not her ſelfe given them their true <hi>proportions,</hi> which are good inclinations, bootleſſe then and vaine were their habits, well might they vaile but never take away their imperfections; a Maske (we know) may well cover a face, but never cleere off it one litle mole, or ſcarre; and the bodies habit (by the ſelfe ſame reaſon) cannot by any meanes take quite away the halting of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken legge, though it be never ſo neatly rejoyn'd and knit together. I could therefore wiſh, that vertue were conſidered by you <hi>(Coralbo)</hi> not according to the imaginary abſtracts of the <hi>theorick,</hi> but reall experience of the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick.</hi> Theſe <hi>ideall</hi> tranſcendent vertues are proper ſolely to <hi>God,</hi> and ſuch men as, abandoning humane actions, pretend to ſeize on them by maine flight, come tumbling downe with them to the earth, where they burſt their necks with the fall.</p>
                  <p>The world hath its generall rules, and <hi>with honest men, profit and honeſty goe hand in hand.</hi> Let us then ſquare our caſe by this <hi>rule,</hi> and by it exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our reſolutions.</p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Coralbo</hi> knew not well what he were beſt anſwer, for that hee before thought his mothers words would prove to be ſuch as might by ſome critick (had they beene a ſubject to a poeticall pen) have beene cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured for not obſerving a <hi>decorum;</hi> as though there could not be among wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men either that hight of ſubtilty of ſpirit and wits acuteneſſe, as to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend things well, or that ſupreame degree of copious and ſweete language as were requiſite to expreſſe themſelves in the beſt and moſt elegant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but ſhee ſtanding ſo ſeriouſly attent to her conceits, that ſhee nothing heeded her ſonnes admiration held on her ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>I once (ſaid ſhee) in my happier yeares knew a decrepit <hi>Prince</hi> (whom both the graces and heavens had endowed with the beſt gifts that lay in the power of their beſtowing (a memory which of mee ſhall be ever ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured though unpleaſing) this Prince gave for his deviſe a <hi>Leopard,</hi> his <hi>motto [I either take or ſurceaſe]</hi> taken from the propriety of that beaſt, which as ſoone as he conceives that he cannot overtake the beaſt he hath in chaſe, gives over his purſuite; ſo could I wiſh, that you (without a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning your <hi>ſwan)</hi> weare that <hi>Leopard:</hi> For applying of whoſe ſenſe to our occaſions I ſay, That if to ſuffer ones-ſelfe to be carried away to great but poſſible enterprizes be greatneſſe of ſpirit, then ſurely to attempt things impoſſible is meere temerity and preſumption.</p>
                  <p>If the kingdomes title were to be tried by a ſuit in Law, and we withall ſure to have juſtice, then needed we not doubt of its recovery; or though the title were uncertaine, yet ſhould we doe well to try if the uncertainty of the Iudge's owne judgement, his inclination towards us, or ſome other humane affect in him might any thing availe us; for then without hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding either our ſelves, our honours, our friends, or ſervants, we might well adventure (being at the very worſt) the hazard of the better. But (alas!) who can hold plea with a tyrant Prince, who being entred into our poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by fraude and force, thinkes he deales fairely enough, though he ſay he will have no other Iudge than his owne conſcience? a judgement in Law unreverſable, ſince (for having no conſcience at all) he hath no Iudge

                  <p>Then for ſervants, I cannot now name you one that depends on us, <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac</hi> having but too cunningly wonne them to be all at his devotion, beſides that he hath not a Governour in any place of importance that is not a <hi>Suſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anian.</hi> And for the <hi>Arabians</hi> (which is the laſt of the conditions I ſpake of) he hath ſo handſomely ſcrew'd himſelfe into their good opinions with an outward ſhew of juſtice and liberality, as there is not one of them that

deſires any change, eſpecially now that they ſee him bleſt with a goodly progeny, ever preſent in the eyes of the people, and nurſt up by thoſe who once lov'd and honoured us more than all the reſt. This is the contents of all that which with more words, reaſons, and examples might have beene produced againſt your propoſitions in generall, whereunto I will notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for your in that behalfe more ample ſatisfaction, anſwer in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                  <p>Firſt you alleadge, that all honeſt and reaſonable things that are not done, are leſt und one meerely by reaſon of inexpediencie; as though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expediencie were not a reaſon ſufficient enough: why? I know no reaſon why all things ſhould not ſuddenly decay and fall to ruine, but that it is not expedient they ſo ſhould. Againe you ſeeme to beleeve, that your being by birth a <hi>Prince,</hi> and by Ordera <hi>Knight,</hi> obligeth you to attempt ought beyond your ſtrength. For the firſt, doe Fortune what it doe can, you ſhall dye a Prince howſoever; the Title is Natures gift not Fortunes, and hee ſhall ever be a <hi>Prince</hi> that's borne of <hi>Princely</hi> parents. And for the other, to doe the acts of a <hi>Cavalier,</hi> I both adviſe and entreate you, but would faine know of you firſt, what you conceive them to be? and whether a Knight be bound to attempt any enterprize whatſoever, wherein is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red courage and ſtrength? As for example, if ſingly to affront an Army, if at a leape to skippe over from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> to the <hi>Arabian</hi> ſhore: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if neither to feare <hi>Neptune</hi> in his tempeſts, nor <hi>Iove</hi> in his thunder-bolts, be a quality befitting a <hi>Knight,</hi> or rather ſome impious brutall vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine given over to execrable deſpaire, I would gladly know?</p>
                  <p>For the reſt, you heare not me ſay, that you ought to leave any honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enterprize unattempted for feare of dangers, or ſuffer your ſelfe to be trampled downe by misfortunes, or that vertue cannot doe more than Deſtiny, or that you ſhould in a juſt and honourable occaſion ſhunne a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant death; God forbid I ſhould give you any ſuch counſell, onely my wiſh and deſire is, that all your actions bee ſquared out by the rule of reaſon. But yet admit, that I approved of your deſignes, to aſſault <hi>Bramac,</hi> and take from him the State or dye: I would faine know how we ſhall doe it? whether by us foure, two women and two Knights, or with forces of men? if we alone ſhould attempt ſuch an enterprize, I then feare me the world will ſay, that none of us either did or died like Knights, or diſcreete per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage: If with Armies, where ſhall we leavy them? In <hi>Egypt,</hi> the King will not permit us, nor hath he indeede any reaſon to profeſſe <hi>Bramac</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity without any ground or foundation of quarrell. Shall we promiſe him in recompence all our States ſave onely <hi>Arabia?</hi> well I am willing wee ſo doe, yet tell me, dare you truſt him? or in caſe we did, where (I wonder) are the monies to leavy thoſe Armies? nay admit we either had or could make ſhift for them too, where will you make up a Fleete to tranſport them? We'le conduct them (you'le ſay) by land through the deſerts: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but where are the proviſions? will they raine downe (trow you) from heaven on us? or will the rocks diſtill waters for us to drinke in thoſe ſands? No, no, the Gods worke not ſuch miracles, but when they pleaſe, nor can wee expect that they'le doe ſo for us, ſince they are not miniſters but avengers of humane avarice and ambition. And though in our caſe we have (indeed) juſtice which they are accuſtomed to favour, yet ſhall we be

                  <p>This ſharpe redarguing of the truth pricked <hi>Coralbo</hi> neerer the quick than the truth it ſelfe; well could he have found in his heart to have repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (though weakely) rather than have yeelded the field at the firſt aſſault; but conſidering with himſelfe, that ſo doing could not any way ſteede him, nor indeede worke other effect than bring him within the cenſure of an obſtinate and indiſcreete diſputant, he anſwered her with ſilence.

                  <p>Renowned Prince (ſaid ſhee) I doubt I have abuſed your noble cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie in troubling your ſpirits (contrary to the tearmes of civility) all this while with our triſting affaires; for which I humbly crave your benigne pardon; let us therefore now (ſo it pleaſe you) walke forth to recreate our ſelves a litle: and though you here finde nothing worthy of you, yet I ſhall beſeech you to take in good part ſuch entertainement of me as may be afforded, not by a <hi>Queene</hi> to a <hi>Prince,</hi> but by a poore diſinherited <hi>widow</hi> to a benigne and courteous <hi>Cavalier.</hi> To this <hi>Polimero</hi> having firſt done her humble reverence thus anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Royall Madame, you neede no ſuch preventions, for vertue hath ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fortunes defects with ſuch an extraordinary liberality, that there is not any participant there of but muſt therefore remaine your eternall debter; And for the houſe, although it be not worthy your Royall perſon, yet is it ſuch, as with its conveniencie might give as good ſatisfaction as a more ſumpteous. Yet were there no other conſideration, its very homelineſſe would argue the malignity of the Harbinger that ſo lodg'd you. But I hope to ſee you one day in another-guiſe-ſtate.</p>
                  <p>No; no, (redoubted Prince) ſaid ſhee, comfort proceeds not from ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining an alteration in misfortunes (becauſe in caſe the ſame ſucceede not accordingly the paine becomes greater) but rather by arming ones-ſelfe againſt them, and correcting the <hi>venome</hi> of fortune with the <hi>antidote</hi> of patience; which if I have not yet conſtantly obſerved and wholly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, yet doe I every day more than other profit ſomewhat in that to me ſo neceſſary Philoſophy.</p>
                  <p>Which divinely-philoſophicall ſpeech of hers was indeede evidently demonſtrated by the irrefuteable <hi>theoreme</hi> of her deportment and actions, for ſhee nothing leſſe expreſt the greatneſſe of her ſpirit within the narrow circuite of theſe private walls, than ſhee had at other times done within the ſpacious cloyſters and comportments of her royall pallaces; ſince ſhee wanted nothing ſave the ſuperfluity of Nature, without which Art can hardly ſhew the hight of her excellencie; conducted ſhee had through ſome ſmall channels of the River <hi>Nile</hi> a great quantity of water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhee not onely watered her garden, but alſo nouriſhed curious foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and ſpacious fiſh-ponds, wherein were, as well for delight as conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie, bred and fed a great number of choyſeſt fiſh and daintieſt water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowle; whence the ſpectators eye was variouſly attracted to divers ſtatues

of Marble (in ſtately order erected about thoſe well-contrived ponds) ſo as ſucceeding ages tooke models of them, which added to the skill of the moſt famous moderne Sculptors. Shee made a triall alſo (though not with a ſucceſſe anſwerable to her expectation) of planting the weeping balme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, and cultiving the ſeeds of the other <hi>Arabian</hi> odours, the only affect now leſt her after ſo many loſſes, but the obvious clime rejecting (out of a diſcourteous antipathy) thoſe her labours, fruſtrated that her ſo noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.</p>
                  <p>Now ſhee had (the firſt day of <hi>Coralbo</hi>'s arrivall, and at the very inſtant of his diſcovering himſelfe) asked for <hi>Sotiro,</hi> and could not (when ſhee heard of it) reflaine from bemoaning his death, an affliction by her jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be farre greater than any loſſe or croſſe ſhee had ſuſtained either in her owne perſon, or thoſe of her children; conſtruing her being thus by degrees depriv'd of all meanes of comfort, to be an evident ſigne of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens continuall wrath; hee being that onely one, among ſo many, that faithfully ſtuck to her till his dying houre; preferring the intereſſes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before his owne, and contemning honours and riches, for becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in a ruined State, a ſingular example both of flouriſhing loyaltie, and of a moſt conſtant, and till then unheard of fidelity.</p>
                  <p>The Knights continued there to repoſe themſelves well-nigh a moneth, in which time it was reſolved, that <hi>Coralbo</hi> ſhould not, without good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, aſſay any impoſſibility, nor yet make his abode in <hi>Egypt,</hi> for not hazarding the danger of being made knowne to his brother-in-law; where the one enjoyed the benefit of a diſcreete mothers counſels, and the other the royall converſation of a peereleſſe woman; nor had they then parted ſo ſoone neither, if ſhee (well knowing <hi>Polimero</hi>'s occaſions) had not her ſelfe expreſt, how ſorry ſhee would be, that their ſtay there ſhould any way prejudice them.</p>
                  <p>And though her daughter (fond of her brother, and hopeleſſe, for ought ſhee knew, of ever ſeeing him any more) earneſtly beſought her to detaine him there ſomewhat longer; yet ſhee would often tell her, that it was a folly to thinke to cure one griefe with many, and that the privation of things deerely loved were leſſe inſupportable after a long than after a ſhort fruition of them; and that when <hi>Coralbo</hi> had ſojourned there a whole yeares time, ſhee would have beene then more loth to part with him, than if he had ſtaid but a day, inſtancing for an example a feaver, in the hot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of whoſe burning fit, the more a man drinkes, the more he thirſteth, and yet the gaine that the patient reapeth thereby is enfeebling of his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and prolonging of his fit; conſiderations all of them though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, yet (for all that) inſufficient to extirpate from a tender heart the rootes of a naturally-affectionate remorce.</p>
                  <p>Their parting day being come, the Queene went to viſit <hi>Polimero,</hi> to whom (after having in moſt lively colours expreſt the obligations ſhe owed him) ſhee recommended her ſonne, therewithall preſenting him with a box of gold full of moſt precious Balſome, on whoſe out ſide was with curious artifice formed the face of a woman weeping, her teares repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with rich orient pearles, ſprinkled with artificiall ornament here and there one, on the anterior part of her countenance, the reſt being all over richly beſet with Diamonds of an ineſtimable value: A preſent (as ſhee
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7474:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
told him) unworthy of ſo great a <hi>Prince,</hi> but neceſſary for ſuch a <hi>Cavalier,</hi> whoſe heroike ſpirit might by ſpurring him on to great enterprizes, bring him dangers, and thoſe dangers wounds which by that precious liquor might in a few houres be cured: Her ſonne ſhee both enriched with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and accommodated (for prevention of adverſe Fortune's incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity) with her richeſt Iewels. Shee once thought to give him a ſquire too, till upon calling to minde the infidelity of the others, ſhee conceived it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for him to be ſerved with ſuch as knew him not. The laſt charge ſhee gave him, was, to thinke ſometimes on her, praying him after a while to come againe, that ſhee might ſee him yet once more ere ſhee died: With that word (after dreſſing her face and eyes at the looking-glaſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, and giving him a farewell kiſſe) ſhee parted from him, and left him to begin his journey, accompanied with his ſiſters eyes and teares.</p>
                  <p>The two Princes rode on their way diverſly affected, the one being me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and penſive, the other blithſome and merry; the later being now reſolved (leaving the way of <hi>Ammon</hi>'s Temple, whither hee once purpoſed with himſelfe to goe) to returne directly to <hi>Athens,</hi> his heart telling him, that hee ſhould ſhortly light on ſome unexpected good acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; <hi>Coralbo</hi> he comforted more with offers than reaſons, an argument of an unfained comforter; and he (knowing it now booteleſſe to contraſt with the will of Heaven) having his minde fortified with generous reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſtoutly trampled under the feete of his courage both want and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe Knights being deſirous to ſee (by all meanes) the great Court of <hi>Egypt,</hi> put them ſelves on the way to <hi>Memphi,</hi> where the King then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, faring ſometimes well, and other timesill, conformable to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their lodgings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Phebus</hi> now haſtened to bathe his ſwealtry Steeds in the foaming Ocean, when they might deſcrie a-front of them a Grove of Palme-trees, and in it might heare a great rumor of voyces; whereupon, lacing on their helmets, they ſpurr'd onwards as faſt as their horſes could gallop, where come, they might ſee two knights and no more, buſied in ſlaughtering their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulters, at leaſt forty in number, who ſeemed rather to turne tayle than to fight; obſerving (though) their time of charging and wheeling about al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in ſuch an orderly diſorder, that the fight ſeemed to ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it from a farre off, rather a ſhew than a skirmiſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Polimero</hi> ſuddenly ſtarted (as one amazed) at the ſight of one of them, whom he thought he ſhould know by a black Eagle which he wore on his creſt, and was aſſured thereof when he ſaw his Squire, by that time beaten off his horſe by ſix of thoſe theeves that preſently fell a-ſtripping of him maugre all his ſtruggling to get out of their miſchievous clutches; and full ill would he have fared (they being already fully bent to butcher him) but for the timely arrivall of <hi>Polimero,</hi> who ſacrificed their curſed lives as an oblation due to the infernall ſpirits; his well guided ſword ſo conforming to his heroïke ſpirit, that he ſtrooke never a blow without expected ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, for doubt of comming in too late to the reſcue of the other two, who bravely maintained the fight againſt a ſtrange ſquadron of theſe raskals. <hi>Coralbo</hi> ſeeing them skirmiſh in ſeverall diviſions, affronted one of them, charging it with ſo reſolute an arme, that he diſconfited it in a moment,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7474:69"/>
and then without lofing any time ſet upon the ſecond, which with as much facility was rowted by the ſame valour: upon this the third fronting to their flanckward ſpurr'd towards him, which one of the two unknowne Knights perceiving, he (leaving his companion, to make good the field a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch of their enemy ſquadron as ſurviv'd their deaths-right uſurping blowes) reſolutely ſpurr'd on all alone to encounter it; whilſt <hi>Coralbo</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his aſſiſtance ſo well imployed, turn'd to ſecond him with as brave a reſolution.</p>
                  <p>Of a great number that the enemies were, there remained now but the hardieſt of them, the reſt lying all ſcatteringly groveling about the palme-trees, as the <hi>trophey</hi> of theſe foure Knights valour, ſo that the remnant of them, knowing they were not able to make long defence, diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their flight into ſeverall wayes, which occaſioned the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the foure Knights alſo in their purſuite; <hi>Polimero</hi> and the Knight of the Eagle went together, and <hi>Coralbo</hi> with the other followed by the Squire: never was chaſe ſo obſtinately maintained, nor hunted Deere ſo fleetly purſued, as either of theſe couples did theſe fugitive villaines, which was the cauſe that they loſt ſight each of other in the confuſed order of the wood, maſſacring (all the while) without any remorſe thoſe, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſeleſſe and voyde of pitty or humanity lived on the blood of innocent travellers. At length <hi>Polimero</hi> with the Knight of the Eagle being left (though well-nigh tired) ſole Maſters of the field, ſpeedily ranne to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and take acquaintance each of other, the twilight having by that time ſurrendred his dominion to his elder brother [Darkneſſe] whilſt the Sunne plunged in the depth of the Ocean, left ſight-depriving night in her full poſſeſſion. When <hi>Polimero</hi> lifting up his beaver thus greetes his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</p>
                  <p>I know not whether or no mine eyes or imagination deceive me, but if you be not <hi>Eromena</hi> my Lady and Princeſſe, Angell of what <hi>Hierarchy</hi> (I beſeech you) be you then of, noble and valiant <hi>Cavalier?</hi> The other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly knowing him by his voyce, impatient of any delay embracing him with his Armes about his neck, made him this anſwer. If I then bee her, for certaine you are my Lord and Prince <hi>Polimero.</hi> Delightſome it was to ſee, how readily (without any more words) their amorous affects adapted their nimble hands to unbuckle each others helmes, that the wounds of their kiſſes might have the deeper impreſſion in their love-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed faces. Nor had they beene ſo ſoone weary of this as they were of the other battell, had not <hi>Eromena</hi>'s telling him that the Knight her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion was <hi>Landadori,</hi> put him in minde to goe ſeeke her out, whom accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they rode a whooping &amp; hollowing for, overall the wood (though in vaine) till their horſes in the end growne weary neere a homely houſe that ſtood in the open field, they repaired thither to repoſe themſelves; hee freeing (by the way thither) <hi>Eromena</hi> from all feare of her daughters miſcarriage, by the confidence he had of <hi>Coralbo</hi>'s valour, ſeconded with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Caraſio</hi> (who was the Squire) and order before hand taken to meete at <hi>Memphi,</hi> in caſe they happened to looſe one another.</p>
                  <p>Come to the lodging, after replied embracements, the firſt thing that <hi>Polimero</hi> deſired to know, was, the occaſion that moved her to come through ſo many dangers into thoſe ſo remote parts. Whereupon ſhee
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7474:69"/>
having told him as much as hee had formerly underſtood by <hi>Coralbo,</hi> ſaid on.</p>
                  <p>That after the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona</hi>'s departure the King her father was fullen into another farre different but better frenſie, upon conſidering with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>That</hi> the Count being now (good man) growne decrepit and of a craſie conſtitution might fall ſick by the way, and ſo finde him either not at all or too late; and <hi>that</hi> upon propoſing therefore of ſending ſome other, <hi>Lindadori</hi> offered (to the paſſing content of her Grandfather) to undertake her ſelfe that ſervice; and <hi>that</hi> whileſt the buſineſſe eſteemed but a jeſt, paſſed unthought on, a great many that were named (fearing the girle's humour) made their excuſe with confeſſing its occaſion, but the conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſpatching her, appearing to her at length to be but in jeſt, ſhee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly fretted thereat, and boldly told the Councell, that ſhee was now in yeares to beare Armes as well as any other whatſoever; and <hi>that</hi> in reſpect ſhee could not be diſſwaded neither by hers nor by the King or Councel's perſwaſion, ſhee was forced (out of the tender care ſhee had of her well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare) to become her ſelfe her companion, and that ſo leaving the <hi>King</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeaſed than ſatisfied, they had departed to ſeeke him out: <hi>That</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding at <hi>Athens</hi> what way he had taken, they (without hearing any newes of the Count) croſſed over into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where meeting (by good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune) <hi>Caraſio,</hi> they travelled towards <hi>Memphi,</hi> where they were by the way ſet upon by thoſe villanous Robbers in manner as he had ſeene them.</p>
                  <p>Exceſſive were the joyes that <hi>Polimero</hi> conceived at the relation of theſe good newes, rejoycing withall, that he was ſo fortunate as to be an eye-witneſſe of his daughters valour, though ſorry hee heard no good tidings from the good Count, doubting his Father-in-law had not in vaine preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſome ill that might ſince have betided him, which (if any ſuch ſhould happen him) he would have beene as fully or litle leſſe ſenſible of, than if it had befallen his owne Father.</p>
                  <p>The morning being come, they returned againe to their ſearch, but hearing no newes of them they enquired after, they put themſelves on the way to <hi>Memphi,</hi> to meete them, as was formerly concluded on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Donzella Desterrada,</hi> for her part, gave her runne-away villaines the chaſe with ſuch an intentive eagerneſſe, that ſhee thought not of as much as what concerned the ſecurity of her owne perſon, ſo intently were all her thoughts buſied in chaſtizing them. Shee had under her an <hi>Andalaſian</hi> Courſer of ſuch ſurpaſſing ſpeede, as was able to beate one after another all the horſes that ever drew in <hi>Phebus</hi> fiery Chariot. And ſuch a one had ſhee indeede neede of, to conforme with the velocity of her fiery humour, now alſo exaſperated with the eagerneſſe of her reſolution of not leaving one of them eſcape her avenging hand, conceiting that ſhee added edge to her blade, and nerves to her arme by this her maiden hand-fight, and firſt encounter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coralbo</hi> on a paſſing fleete <hi>Arabian</hi> Steede, given him by the Queene his mother, ſpeedily followed her; well might he have out-ſtript the winde for ſwiftneſſe, but not overtake her; nay he would have loſt ſight of her, had not her ſtaying to fight and kill given him time to get neere her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caraſio</hi> in the meane time ſollicited his horſe with the ſharpe Rhetorick of his ſpurres; but loſing ſight of her, hee followed as faſt as hee could

drive <hi>Coralbo,</hi> whom he might ſee Northward of him, till at laſt he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke them both glutting their ſwords with the blood of thoſe ſlaughtered caitives; A ſtrange marveile, that two generous young ſpirits inclined to piety, nay that ſeemed to breathe nothing but compaſſion, ſhould in their fights ſhew themſelves to be (or at leaſt ſeeme to be) ſo mercileſſe, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and cruell; unleſſe the reaſon thereof be, either that true compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſprings not from any ſoft diſpoſition which ſenſibly feeles in himſelfe anothers ſmart or ſufferings, for ſuch were not vertue, but rather faint-heartedneſſe a brat of imagination; Or, that thoſe vertues depending on Iuſtice (their true nurſe) hold compaſſion in the puniſhment of the wicked to be meerely vicious.</p>
                  <p>But to goe on with our ſtory, Of all that miſchievous ſquadron there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd unſlaine but two for the two knights to deale withall, nor had thoſe neither ſurvived their fellowes, but that by their wily dexterous ſhifts and favourable ſcituation of the cloſe-growne Palme-grove they found a way to ſave themſelves a while maugre the fleetneſſe of the purſuers horſes, ſo as watching their time, and retiring from one tree to another, they made a ſhift to recover (hard about the waxing browne of the evening) to the mouth of a grot, whereinto they being ſuddenly entred, uſed all poſſible diligence to damme up its entrance with great ſtones, logges of wood, and ſuch like heavy materialls.</p>
                  <p>The two Knights thus mocked and o're-reached by the wylineſſe of theſe villaines, amazedly ſtaring each other in the face, knew not what to reſolve on, when <hi>Caraſio</hi> with a modeſt ſmile thus beſpake them.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould under favour (Gentlemen) conceive it requiſite, that valour ſometimes cede to diſcretion, theſe fellowes are ſafely lodged, whereas we are ſhut out without either ſupper or lodging; leave them (I beſeech you) with a miſchiefe to ſome others chaſtizing hand, ſince we muſt either leave them, or hazard the loſing of our company. But <hi>Lindadori</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving patiently heard him, as impatiently anſwered; that ſhee would by no meanes part thence, without firſt chaſtizing them, they well meriting it, were it but for fooling her ſo long as they had done; bidding him (with that) goe ſeene out for their company, whilſt they would expect him there without ſtirring thence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caraſio</hi> obeyed, but ſeeing after a ſhort gire that his light was turn'd to darkeneſſe, he hollowed till he grew hoarſe againe, and then conſidering with himſelfe, that hee might both miſſe thoſe of his company that hee looked for, and hazard the loſing of the reſt too, hee returned and found them in the ſame place he had left them, buſily endeavouring (though in vaine) to force open the entrance of the denne, and had no ſmall adoe to perſwade them to a ſhort truce, upon hope that he would (ſo they had but a litle patience) fire it open; taking then from off his ſaddle-bow a <hi>port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manteau,</hi> and out of it ſome victualls, he got them to ſit downe and fall to, neceſſity being in ſuch a caſe of all other the beſt perſwading Orator.</p>
                  <p>Their helmets being taken off, they marveiled each of them at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beautifull youth and youthfull beauty, ſo as (without ſpeaking a word) they gazed each other in the face, either of them expecting that the other ſhould ſpeake the firſt word; when <hi>Coralbo</hi> thinking it ſtood him upon to ſweeten the envenomed fury of the maiden, whom hee tooke to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7474:70"/>
bee a man, thus broke firſt the yee of their ſilence.</p>
                  <p>Sir, mee thinkes we ſhould doe well to follow this gentle Squices diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet counſell, though (in caſe you diſlike it) I ſhall be moſt ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to obey your commands. She without making him as yet any anſwer, ſtood with her eyes ever fixt on the denne, ſo fired with diſdainefull anger, that they ſerved for a candle in the pitchie darkneſſe of the night, made yet more horride by the interpoſing ſhade of the thick grove: onely mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out at length ſhee did in anſwer to him ſome few halfe-pronounced words which could not be underſtood, ſhee having peculiar to her ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone one unexpreſſible quality, which was a pretty pleaſing kinde of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and now ſhee was ſullen and ſwaggerd though it could not bee diſcerned why, or with whom it was: But <hi>Coralbo</hi> continuing ſtill his courteſies and ſhee her ſilence, he held it more diſcretion to excuſe her for the tenderneſſe of her age, than accuſe her of ſmall diſcretion. And though he well obſerved how richly ſhee was armed, yet judged he her to bee of ſome great quality, not ſo much by her <hi>Armes</hi> as by her face, wherein her magnanimity and native greatneſſe, though vailed under a maiden ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity &amp; exceeding greene yeares, ſhewed by her diſdainefull &amp; haughty geſtures more than common merits of reverence and love, being no kinde of defect, ſithence ſuch a generous affect in a Virgin, is (to my thinking) haughtineſſe of ſpirit, that like a fierce maſtiffe in the garden of honeſty ſecures her from the preſumption of either too luſtfull or over-bold lovers.</p>
                  <p>Her forces being refreſhed by the meate ſhee had eaten, inflam'd her choller; up then ſhee riſes, and bundles together whatſoever comes to hand of her, every bough, ſhrubbe, bramble, and ſtick, heere or there (whereſoever ſhee could light on them) would ſerve her turne: Rend off and gather ſhee did all that ſhee found either dry or greene; of the later whereof there was good ſtore, the theeves having the day before (for their owne uſe) lopped many trees: All that <hi>Caraſio</hi> did (to that purpoſe) could not pleaſe her, ſo as ſnatching the tinder-box out of his hand, ſhee her ſelfe would needs, and did ſtrike fire; which well performed its office, by kindling in a few houres the matter it fed on into ſuch flames, that the defenders unable to endure its violent heate, left the field of the denne's entrance free for their aſſaylers.</p>
                  <p>The hot-ſpirited Princes, having not the patience to ſtay to ſee the (though ſhort) courſe of that ſufficiently furious element, aſſayed by all the meanes and wayes ſhee could imagine, to force an entrance through the caves mouth, by thruſting by the logges that ſtopp'd it (without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that for not being acquainted with the perhaps many entrances &amp; windings of the cave, ſhee could not without light doe there any good) but could not poſſibly move them (for their being ſo unwildy and maſſive) till ſuch time, as they being halfe burnt diſſevered and fell downe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſo making a narrow though dangerous paſſage, to ſuch as had a will to enter; which the Princeſſe would inſtantly have done, and had (twenty to one) ſpoyl'd her ſelfe for ever, if <hi>Caraſio</hi> by entreaty, and <hi>Coralbo</hi> by perſwaſion had not for a litle while reſtrain'd her, by ſhewing her both the danger of the fire in entring, and that of the place within being entred, where ſhee might (by very probable conjecture) reſt overcharged in the darke by the deſperation of theſe two (by her unſeene) enemies; but ſhe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7474:71"/>
not approving of this their cautelous conſideration, bethought her of a ſtrange invention to lighten her paſſage; for, finding among many ſtocks halfe burnt, one fit to bee waved circlewiſe, ſhee went onwards waving it in her hand to the inmoſt part of the grot, <hi>Coralbo</hi> there eaſing her of that labour, by doing himſelfe that office, till come to the farmoſt part of it, they found the fugitives prepared for their defence: But litle availed it them, miſerable caitives, to oppugne (unarmed as they were) the unreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable valour of theſe now with juſt anger enflamed warriors. <hi>Coralbo</hi> hand-faſting his, with faſe got him under him, now trembling with feare of ſeeing his dagger at his throat-pipes, whileſt the maiden had already ſlaine hers. And there being proviſion enough, and among the reſt chaines and cords to binde ſuch as they retain'd to be ranſomed, <hi>Caraſio</hi> takes one, and therewith bindes his hands and armes, ſo as he could not ſtirre to help himſelfe, whileſt hee lay mumbling out many words underſtood by none but him, which was to begge his life; for ranſome whereof he promiſed him both riches and priſoners: The Princes being told of this, would faine know where thoſe priſoners were, that they might free them. And being anſwered, neere a Lake not farre off thence, they granted him what he craved.</p>
                  <p>Come forth to the ayre, they put off their helmes, <hi>Lindadori</hi> ſoone after ſettling her ſelfe to her reſt, and ſleeping as ſoundly as if ſhee had beene in her owne naked bed, whilſt <hi>Caraſio</hi> watch'd for doubt of ſome ſiniſter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, till ſuch time as <hi>Coralbo</hi> awaked, perſwaded him to goe ſleepe, with telling him, it was now his turne to ſtand centry: But upon <hi>Caraſio</hi>'s hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that inconvenient, they fell into further diſcourſe, whereby the Squire perceiving that <hi>Coralbo</hi> knew <hi>Polimero</hi> by his right name, and was withall very deſirous to know the other two unknowne Knights, he thought good to reveale him their names; whereat the other became ſo aſtoniſhed, as he knew not what to ſay of it, expreſſing himſelfe infinitely ſorrowfull fot having loſt them; till upon hearing how they were to meete againe at <hi>Memphi,</hi> hee was ſomewhat conſolated, but would without any gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying, when they had ended their diſcourſe, that <hi>Caraſio</hi> ſhould (by all meanes) lay him downe and ſleepe.</p>
                  <p>In the morning as ſoone as the Princeſſe awoke, they put themſelves on their way, arriving to the Lake in a piece of an houres ſpace, where (having paſſed through a plat of mariſh ground thickly over-growne with bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes and canes) they found in an uncouth by-ſlad a ſlender Barge that ferryed them over to a ſmall Ile, where having among thouſands of thorns and brambles deſcried a large cottage, they thence heard a pittifull mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure of voyces and lamentations.</p>
                  <p>The Princes had upon their comming into the Barke cauſed the thiefe to bee looſed, whoſe being ſeene in liberty by the villaine of a Boate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, was the occaſion that he threw not himſelf into the water for feare of the two Knights. Entred the cottage, the firſt thing they did was looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the priſoners, which betweene men and women were ſome foureteene in number, all pale, leane, and weake; and among theſe her, who was found wounded in the <hi>Piramide</hi> and dreſt by <hi>Caraſio,</hi> and who ere ſhee was fully healed had fled away by night, to the great diſcontent of him, who for her had beene left there, and forbidden to follow his Lord <hi>Polimero:</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:7474:71"/>
And now ſhee well knowing him, was more confuſed in minde to ſee him, (whoſe preſence ſo upbraided her ingratitude) than joyfull of getting out of ſo loathſome and miſerable an impriſonment. Shee ſtood with neavy downe-caſt eyes, not in ſeeing her nakedneſſe appearing through her tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ragges, (ſithence who-ſo hath once loſt her honeſty, ſtands not upon ſuch termes of modeſt ſhamefaſtneſſe) but for having before her eyes him, who by replicated good-turnes proclaimed (in being ſilent) her faults and ingratitude: Being then ask'd, why ſhee parted from him ere ſhee was throughly cured, her anſwer was ſilence and weeping: But the <hi>Princes</hi> knowing nothing from this buſineſſe, cauſing the cottage to bee emptied and ſearch'd over all its corners, found therein more than ordinary riches in Iewels, Coyne, and <hi>aromaticall</hi> odours and ſpices, all which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>(Coralbo</hi> having reſign'd to her all his authority of diſpoſing them) ſhared among the priſoners, not ſo much for defraying their charge to their owne homes, as for recompence of their paſt ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>Cauſing afterwards the Cottage and the Boate too (when they had paſt the water) to be burnt, ſhee gave, though unwillingly, to the two theeves their promiſed liberty, ſhee imagining that promiſes ſhould not bee kept with ſuch mens-names-uſurping <hi>Canibals,</hi> to the dammage and prejudice of the weale publick.</p>
                  <p>Thence going altogether in a company, they got to a channell of the <hi>Nile,</hi> where they ſhipp'd themſelves all ſave the faire woman of <hi>Caraſio</hi>'s acquaintance, who would by no meanes imbarke her ſelfe, but yet would for all that (a foole as ſhee was) follow the Knights; who for being there ſurprized by the night, reſolved to make it their lodging, with intention to take the enſuing day the right way to <hi>Memphi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this time the noble <hi>Coralbo</hi> had his mind taken up with new thoughts, for being caught with the graces of the faire <hi>Princeſs,</hi> without daring to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it, upon examination with himſelfe of her tender yeares and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, both thoſe and theſe being incapable of any ſuch affect. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (which ſeemed moſt averſe to him) of a nature farre from an amorous inclination, a contemner of men, and a mortall enemy of ſuch of her ſex, who for conforming to their lovers paſſions, ſhewed themſelves any thing pliable to their loves: And though hee hoped that time might alter her, yet did the ſuſpence of the ſelfe-ſame time alſo torment him, for being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuffer the agony of ſuch long-expecting and uncertaine hopes, hee being but a traveller without either ſtate or meanes, deprived of any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place of abode, yea and of all power to reſolve of any thing, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch as fortune might favour him withall. But being unable to contraſt with heaven, upon re-examined deliberation with himſelfe, hee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſerve her in a ſomewhat more than uſuall manner, and withall to ſmoother his flames, by aſſaying if approached her, they could by any meanes without her knowledge warme her. Or in caſe nought elſe come of it, yet ſhould he not neede to deſpaire wholly, were it but for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that he hoped to receive from her moſt lovely preſence, and yet more lively (becauſe unparalled) geſtures; and though the worſt that could happened, yet ſhould hee not be the firſt that for nouriſhing his amorous hopes, had beene voluntarily deceived, for not yeelding himſelfe up to deaths tyrannie.</p>

The princely Mayden on the other ſide, far (God wot) from any ſuch thoughts, beheld him with an indifferent eye, onely fretting her ſelfe for his being ſuch as ſhee could not hate. Her youthfull ſpirit ruminated on nought elſe ſave warre and death, with cruell revenges of wrongs, which poore women every day (as ſhee conceived) received from men. She held the ſubjection of her ſex to be tyrannicall, and conceiv'd, that both Nature and the Law were therein deceived, and that onely for being abaſed by tyrant cuſtome, it ſhew'd not its native vertue: <hi>That</hi> it was now high time to let the world ſee it, and (by reacquiring their loſt liberty) to make the ſo inured female ſex, if not ſuperior, equall and companion to the other, in favour whereof ſhee was egg'd on by examples. Well knew ſhee, that in <hi>Egypt</hi> (where ſhee then abode) the Kings had effeminated the men, put them to domeſtick ſervices, to the diſtaffe and ſpindle, to free themſelves from dangers and ſuſpitions; ſhee had alſo read the <hi>Amazon</hi>'s valorous enterprizes, and thereupon, contemplating the greatneſſe of her owne ſpirit, was confident of accompliſhing the full of her intentions. Wherein ſhee perceived but one ſole difficulty, which was, to deprive women of their naturall feares, though ſhe beleeved them to be rather habituall than naturall. Her ſelfe ſhee knew to be valorous, not ſo much by the force of her body, as by the <hi>courage</hi> of her heart; ſhee comprehended, that valour conſiſted, in being neither carefull of ones perſon, nor incumbred with the feares of death: <hi>That</hi> the ſenſibility of wounds enfeebles the forces and blunts the edge of courage, ſeeing it is the ſole cauſe that makes it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and backward in aſſailing, and diſadvantagious and ſlow in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: Shee therefore concluded, them onely to be more valiant than the reſt, in whom had taken deepeſt roote the indifferencie of either living or dying, confirmed in ſuch an opinion by the nature of irrationall animals, whereof the fiercer are not the ſtronger but the more courageous. Since that for being endued with more force than men, they would merit the title of fortitude rather than they, if ſuch vertue had its ſeate in bodily force; that then ſince women were equally capable of the conceits of the minde, wherefore then not of their effects too? Such were her internall diſcourſes, which if they ſometime tooke a turne about any paſſages, told her of divers effects of love, ſhee then ever ſparkled out diſdaine againſt the ſhee-lovers, and could have found in her heart to have torne in pieces ſuch of her ſex, as being rejected or ſlighted, tormented themſelves with love, an affect (to her thinking) neither neceſſary nor neceſſiting, but a ſimple propoſition of free will, an incompatibility by conſequence unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to love one that hates the perſon loving, which if it be not (conceiv'd ſhee) a frenſie, muſt needs be an infirmitie of the braine to be cured with penance and faſting.</p>
                  <p>The day being come and the horſes ſaddled, the young woman there waited in a readineſſe, with her coates gathered up for the better trudging a-foote, which the Princeſſe abhorring, and failing to perſwade her to make uſe of the benefit of the channell, was therefore faine to conſent that ſhee came along with her, upon the importunity of her entreaties, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſuch a quantity of teares, that never mother ſhed ſo many for the loſſe of her children. Cauſing her therefore to be put on horſe-backe behinde <hi>Caraſio,</hi> ſhee asked her who ſhee was, and whither ſhee meant to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7474:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
goe; having already underſtood how ſhee was found, and runne-away from <hi>Caraſio,</hi> ſhe (conſidering that no evaſion could any thing ſteed her) reſolved now (though not without being thereof aſhamed) to recite in the termes of truth the ſtory of her ſelfe in ſuch like words,</p>
                  <p>I (redoubted Sir) am the moſt miſerable woman that ever was yet borne, ſince whereas others miſeries proceede from fortune, mine ſpring meerely and wholly from my ſelfe, ſo as though but too unworthy in all other reſpects, yet in this above all I deſerve to be pittied of no man, in ſo much as if the unfained repentance of my faults had not enabled and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared mee for ſupporting the pennance due for them with an intention to impoſe on my ſelfe others ſomewhat greater, I ſhould then not onely finde my ſelfe to be in a deſperate caſe, but ſhould alſo have together with a perverſe minde a lying tongue, that in ſteede of faults and diſhonour would blazon my merits and honours, not ſo much to conceale from your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my diſhoneſties, (which ſhould indeede be buried in the center of the earth) as to finde pitty in you, and to gaine your better opinion. At the hearing of theſe words, the Princeſſe, kindled as fiery-hot embers, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to make her hold her peace, till upon her becomming more pliable becauſe of <hi>Coralbo</hi>'s expectation, and ſhortning the longſomneſſe of the way, ſhee gave way to her relation.</p>
                  <p>My name (ſaid ſhee) is <hi>Diatistera,</hi> by Nation a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and by birth of the nobleſt blood in <hi>Chio,</hi> not becauſe my Father poſſeſſing himſelfe of its liberty, became tyrant thereof, but for that no other one Family in all <hi>Ionia</hi> is of more ancient memory than ours, nor any anceſtours more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable for vertue, nor renown'd for trophies than are our Forefathers. I was conceived in a private eſtate, my father then (conformable to the ſtiles of republiques) being himſelfe but a Citizen, &amp; though in greater eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than the reſt, yet marked with no titulary dignity of apparent greatnes or eminency above the other prime Senators: This cockarrice of ambitious Soveraignty was then but a-hatching in his braine, for acquiring whereof, he with more than common wyles and ſubtilties made a ſhew of thoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which indeede he never own'd, concealing thoſe vices, which being borne with him, were both his nurſe and nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>Hee fell enamoured of my mother, not for any great beauty of hers, but becauſe the malicious ſubtilty which hee diſcovered to be in her, pleaſed him extreamely; a thing ordinary to the worſt people, to have an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuch as live by quillets and inventions, chooſing and indeed loving to be rather deceived by ſuch, than well ſerved by better: Now <hi>Nerca</hi> my mother in the beginning of this their love was married, and wife to one <hi>Rotildo,</hi> a perſonage of conditions moſt noble, (and to praiſe them well) quite contrary to hers. Many times had ſhee tempted him to bring his Countrey into ſervitude, with the favour of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who then ruled (as they doe alſo to this preſent day) all <hi>Aſia.</hi> Shee would alwayes be a ſhewing him the facility of the enterprize, by him rejected without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any account of her words, which being ſharpned on the whet-ſtone of ambition, endeavoured to foine him, as if generoſity (a royall vertue) would bee lodged with tyrannie and treacheries. But ſeeing it nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile her, and conſidering withall, that though ſhee could have perſwaded him in time, that yet he was not (for all that) to be truſted (ſeeing that <hi>a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7474:73"/>
minde fast cleaven to vertue cannot be from it diſſevered, without danger of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance)</hi> ſhee caſt an eye on <hi>Pridale</hi> my Father, the ſtate and nature of whom being well examined, ſhee thought by his meanes to withdraw her ſelfe from equality by her ſo much hated, and to be reduced to principality which ſo impatiently ſhee long'd after, taking for example the Tyrants of <hi>Mileto, Epheſo, Colofone,</hi> and <hi>Pirene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt ſtep to the enterprize was Adultery, wherein they found ſuch ſweetneſſe, that the avidity of enjoying each other waxed ſo inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as they began to thinke of the making away of <hi>Rotildo,</hi> and then of the ſubjection of <hi>Chio,</hi> and climing to the right of their pretended greatneſſe. 'Twas ſtrange if not marveilous, that they ſhould have (as they had) both of them ere ever they knew one another, the ſelfe ſame deſigne, and after being acquainted, that this ſecond (which I now told you of) ſhould ſerve them for a reciprocall inſtrument: And yet a man (when hee well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it) may ſee, that both theſe make no greater matter of marvaile, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the good, and yet leſſe among the wicked if their thoughts ſtrike all in one white. Shee judged him to be the prime and moſt ambitious man of all the Citizens, and he knew her to be of great parentage, which might afford him matter if not more apt for ſervitude, at leaſt leſſe difficult, for being leſſe ſubject to envy and dangers.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Rotildo</hi>'s death muſt not be effected by violent meanes, his Nobility and power accompanied with the favour of the Lawes ſuppreſt their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall end; ſithence the very ſuſpition of being his murtherers had beene as much as their lives were worth; by ſo much the rather that (hee being endowed with no leſſe milde than amiable conditions, and having no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) no man could miſſe of conjecturing the truth. So as the moſt favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſentence that could be denounced againſt them muſt have beene ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which would burſt the neck of their principality, whereunto they could never aſpire as long as they were exiled perſons, and deprived of their eſtates, goods, and fortunes. The beſt courſe then they could thinke of, was to cauſe him to be put to death legally, by laying to his charge that crime which he moſt abhorr'd, and which was indeede parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly theirs, by plotting the treacherie with malicious accuſations ſo ſubtle as might deceive the world, the Magiſtracie and the Lawes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Now my Father had a baſtard-brother named <hi>Timocle,</hi> more miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous yet than himſelfe, to whom he had no ſooner communicated his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and what he had to doe, than he picking (againſt all reaſon) a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with one of the principall Citizens ſlew him, and then getting a-boord a Veſſell for that purpoſe mann'd, paſſed over into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and thence to <hi>Suſa,</hi> whilſt his brother (then chiefe of the Magiſtracie) ſeeming to deteſt more than all the reſt both the foule fact, and the guilty actor, baniſhed him (under a capitall paine) for ever returning againe to his Countrey for any occaſion whatſoever, ſubjecting to the ſelfe ſame puniſhment all ſuch as ſhould but propoſe his recalling.</p>
                  <p>The infamie of ſo enormous a fault was in a loud crie ſuppreſt by the juſtice of his brother, for which the people adored him as a reſtorer of the ancient integrity, and as the true <hi>Idea</hi> of a juſt Citizen in a well-governed <hi>republick.</hi>

                     <hi>Timocle</hi> arrived at <hi>Suſa,</hi> laying aſide the popular <hi>Greekiſh</hi> arrogance, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored the King after the <hi>Perſian</hi> manner, and told him, hee was rent from <hi>Pridale</hi> a brother of his and the prime Citizen of <hi>Chio,</hi> not concealing the abominable murther committed expreſſely to ſhadow the plot, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him the Soveraignty of the Ile under the principality of <hi>Pridale.</hi> Hee propoſed, for bringing the affaire unto a head, that under pretext of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a revocation of his baniſhment, the <hi>Perſian</hi> King ſhould ſend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Embaſſadour, becauſe in caſe they did not (as he knew they would not) grant it, they ſhould then be conſtrained to ſend him another, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Majeſtie with the reaſons why they did it not; <hi>That</hi> then <hi>Pridale</hi> would cauſe to be choſen the moſt potent of them, to the end that taking occaſion of calumniating him as corrupted by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> hee might be put to death, which ſucceeding, the City would then reſt wholly under his brothers authority.</p>
                  <p>This was not the firſt time that the King had treated with other <hi>Grecians</hi> of the like affaires, ſo as their legeritie &amp; inconſtancie were already known to him, though he would never have beleeved them to have beene ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous: But the inſatiable deſire of domineering, having no regard to either vertue or vice, he being already poſſeſſed of the greater part of the Cities of <hi>Ionia</hi> in the Continent, deemed the occaſion moſt opportune for getting footing in the ſea. And therefore accepting of the proffer, after being ſundry wayes (but more eſpecially by <hi>Pridale</hi>'s Letters) aſſured, that <hi>Timocle</hi>'s relations were no falſe alarums; hee wrote to <hi>Farnabazzo</hi> his Lievetenant in <hi>Aſia,</hi> to execute as much as by him were propoſed him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Farnabazzo</hi> readily obeyes, ſending a Captaine to <hi>Chio,</hi> to demand on the Kings behalfe, the revocation of <hi>Timocle.</hi> To whom <hi>Pridale</hi> making a ſhew of being now a more irreconcileable enemy than before, cried out; That ſuch favours from a King ſo long ſince a pretender to the ſubjection of <hi>Greece</hi> could not be obtain'd of a <hi>Timocle</hi> without conventions dangerous to both the State and Liberty; and though it ſo were not, as it could not but be ſo (ſince hee would not have the boldneſſe to returne with danger where he was hated without the ſecurity of ſome ſecret forces) yet ſhould he not at any hand be ſo gratified, were it but for not ſhaking the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lawes; an example apt to miniſter occaſion to other Princes to require the like, which in effect was to bring under the free diſpoſe of ſtranger-princes both the liberty and republick: Declaiming afterwards againſt the caſe, he was ſo loude on it, that the very walls ſeemed to ſhake thereat; particularizing withall, the circumſtances, to make him appeare ſo much the more unworthy of clemencie: But ſeeing the moſt part of the Councell reſt ambiguous, for not knowing how to deny the favour without injury, he propoſed the Embaſſie in deſigned termes. To him it was eaſie to obtaine all, yea they would that he himſelfe propounded the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, which was even all that he deſired; he obeyes, and (after many long and tedious excuſes, carried with a no leſſe artificiall than counterfeined modeſty) he at length names <hi>Rotildo,</hi> with a faire <hi>encomio</hi> of his praiſes, ſaying, hee did it not for his Nobility and riches, but for the amability of his conditions and carriage; and alſo becauſe he being of an incorruptible goodneſſe, and already gracious with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> would with univerſall ſatisfaction obtaine as much as he required or deſired.</p>

                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:7474:74"/>
Accordingly <hi>Rotildo</hi> was (conformable to the wiſh'd deſires of all of them) created Embaſſadour, he (harmeleſſe Gentleman) not repugning it, for being deſirous to doe his Countrey any good ſervice. But on the contrary, expreſſing an obligation to <hi>Pridale</hi> for having done him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of making choyce of him among ſo many, an election for the which he came to be declared (and not without envy) the beſt and worthieſt of all the Citizens. Nor failed he to thanke him alſo apart, taking with the publick inſtructions his counſels; (by the direction whereof he beleeved he could not erre) and with them the company of two young Gentlemen, not onely a kinne, but alſo partiall to <hi>Pridale.</hi> Arrived at <hi>Suſa,</hi> the King tooke on him to be beyond all meaſure incenſed at the negative, ſo as hee was faine to ſtay there above three moneths, to worke out of his minde the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant miſſe-impreſſions; the King ſuffering himſelfe to be (in that while) gain'd by litle and litle, in ſo much as placing him (at length) among the number of his freinds, he did him all ſuch favours as could procure him to bee envied, and ill-ſpoken of the Courtiers, by ſending to him often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (contrary to his cuſtome) the greateſt favourites of his Peeres and great ones, making them ſtay and fall into private conference with him, as though they had treated of ſome affaires of exceeding great conſequence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Timocle</hi> on the other ſide (who at the firſt made a ſhew of being his enemy, by ſaying and doing againſt him all the ill offices that ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance required) ſhew'd himſelfe now in the ſelfe ſame time more milde, and afterwards honouring him with the favour of his often viſits, would ſtile him the light of <hi>Greece,</hi> the honour of <hi>Chio,</hi> and a perſonage worthy to be for his vertue honoured, nay adored even of his very enemies. And becauſe all this was true, his words were taken to be really and truly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and his fained courteſies to be friendly offices to the Embaſſadour, who afterwards parted gratified and honoured to the joy of all his retinue, who returned triumphant, for bringing (to their thinking) along with them to the republick both peace and the Kings favour.</p>
                  <p>In the meane while of this his ſtay abroad I was conceived, ſo as my mother doubting leſt her husband ſhould take notice of the effects of her adultery, ſollicited my father to the precipitation of the buſineſſe. But he (who would ſave all) contented her, with aſſuring her, that the time ſhould worke out her ſafegard without diſordering any thing.</p>
                  <p>Two moneths were not paſſed after <hi>Rotildo</hi>'s returne, when <hi>Timocle</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into <hi>Ionia,</hi> with order from the King to leavy in the neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces ſuch forces of men as he ſhould thinke fit, and by faining the order to be ſecret, cauſed its fame to be ſpread overall <hi>Greece.</hi> The Governours ſhipp'd the leavies of men and ſent them him from all parts, he keeping his <hi>rande-voo</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to make up there a Fleete of Ships, whilſt all the Iles and Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> prepared themſelves for defence, each of them ſtanding in feare, this warlike-ſtorme would fall on her; onely <hi>Chio</hi> ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Rotildo</hi> never thought on it; In ſo much as the people aſtoniſhed that ſhee thought her ſelfe ſo ſecure, ſhewed her her ruine ſo palpably, as if they had pointed at it with their fingers, arguing it from the preſence and authority among enemies of an injured and baniſh'd Citizen, who for the deniall given to the Kings Embaſſie on his behalfe, could ruminate no other than affects of anger, diſcontent, revenge, and deſpaire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:7474:74"/>
There chanced to be then in <hi>Epheſus</hi> one <hi>Chirito</hi> of <hi>Lisbo,</hi> who whilſt he liv'd a young man at <hi>Athens,</hi> was a very intimate friend of <hi>Timocle,</hi> (both of them having not onely liv'd under one roofe, and for a long time dieted at the ſelfe ſame table, but had alſo in common (together with their ſtudies) their pleaſures, commodities, and incommodities) and was now come to <hi>Epheſus</hi> to a ſiſter of his, who being left a widow, had ſent for him to take order for her widowe, eſtate and children. This <hi>Chirito</hi> as he was a lover of liberty, ſo was hee an enemy to the tyrannie of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> in particular; for ſeeing them on the point of ſubjecting <hi>Greece,</hi> as was not unknowne to <hi>Timocle,</hi> whom the other wonders to ſee now ſide with them, but more at the authority he there exerciſed, which was much for ſuch a man as he to attaine unto, under ſo great a King as that of <hi>Perſia,</hi> which he imagined could not but be to the prejudice of either <hi>Chio</hi> or that Countrey. The newly-conceived hate therefore more than the old friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip made him deſirous to goe ſee him, meerely to eſpie his actions, and get what he could out of him, whileſt <hi>Timocle,</hi> who deſired nothing more than to be eſpied, made as though he tooke no notice of it. After recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſalutations <hi>Chirito</hi> tels him, how glad hee was to ſee him neere ſo great a King in ſo eminent a degree; for which <hi>Timocle</hi> courteouſly than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, with telling him, that his fortune ſhould not yeeld a barren re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to his friends obliging favours, ſince the chiefe end of his deſire to be advanced to any eminencie, was to be able to gratifie and ſerve them. But as concerning his enemies, hee would let them ſee, that he knew how to make uſe of it to their ſmart and prejudice. So afterwards in his further diſcourſe, complaining of his Countrey and brother, he vowed he would ſo worke his revenge, that the world ſhould have ſomewhat to talke of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chirito</hi> purpoſely fallen on this propoſition, ſtood watching the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to draw out of his mouth his intended deſigne, whereas the other on the contrary faining that he did all he could to keepe it in, expected but the occaſion of telling it, making now a ſhew of being heate with anger, and that the fury of his choller had made him thus vomit our his ſecfet; And with that he praiſed heaven, for having changed unto him <hi>Greece</hi> for <hi>Perſia;</hi> pride, and the diſdainefull Citizen into the gentleneſſe and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome delights of a great Court, and the tyrannie of an inhumane and cruell brother into the favours of the greateſt and moſt courteous King of the Vniverſe; who miſſing to reſtore him by any faire meanes, bad given him forces, thereby both to reſtore himſelfe to his liberty, and alſo avenge him of his enemies. But <hi>Chirito</hi> with counterfeit charineſſe ſhewing him, that the Fleete hee there ſaw was not enough for his turne, <hi>Chio</hi> being ſtrong of it ſelfe; beſides that in reſpect of the confederate Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes contributing all of them towards her defence, (as he might bee aſſured they would) the enterprize would not prove to be ſo eaſie, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering that they would perhaps have ſought with him ere his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall in <hi>Chio;</hi> To this <hi>Timocle</hi> in a deſpiſing manner anſwered him; That before the Fleetes could joyne together to offer him fight, he would have hang'd up without the Walls upon the Gate of <hi>Chio</hi> that Traytor his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And for the reſt, that he was not ſo fooliſh to ſtirre in it without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certaine of the enterprize. <hi>Chirito</hi> (with ſhrinking in his ſhoulders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied) that he conceived not how that could be, without ſecret intelligence.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7474:75"/>
To which <hi>Timocle</hi> ſmiling anſwered; But admit I had ſuch, what would'ſt thou ſay of it then? I tell thee then I have, and ſuch too, that litle ſhall my brothers malice or ſome others preſumption availe them. Here he named <hi>Rotildo,</hi> and then taking him by the hand proceeded. From hence forwards thou maiſt know <hi>Chirito</hi> how much ancient friendſhip can doe, I have now committed to thy truſt the greateſt ſecret that is this day in the Court of <hi>Perſia:</hi> ſee therefore (I pray thee) that it be ſafely lock'd up in the ſecret cabinet of thy breſt: If thou wilt continue my friend, I will further thy advancement, and doe for thee; if otherwiſe, yet ſhalt thou have no cauſe to thinke hardly of mee. Come along with me in this expedition, and I will give thee (over and beſides the merit and favour thou ſhalt gaine thee in the Kings eyes) a worthy place of command among the chiefe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. And that thou maiſt ſee that my proceedings are grounded on a ſure foundation, I'le tell thee all. Know then that <hi>Rotildo,</hi> upon promiſe of the Principality, agreed with the King to ſow at my arrivall ſedition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Citie, and to bring mee in with his faction; which may bee eaſily done, by aſſaulting <hi>Chio</hi> both within and without.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chirito</hi> remained at theſe newes ſtruck to the heart: <hi>Rotildo</hi> hee knew wonderous well, but the treaſon was ſo handſomely contrived, and the apparances thereof ſo correſpondent, that the argument of his goodneſſe conceived to be now o'recome by his ambition, had no force ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude for him, as <hi>Chirito</hi> punctually beleeved not all that hee had heard; and then without ſtaying to heare any more, commending him for groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his affaire upon ſuch ſure foundations, accepting the offer of going along with him, and infinitely thanking him for honouring him with ſuch a favour; he thought every minute a yeare till he returned to his lodging; where writing a letter thereof at full, he ſent it to <hi>Chio</hi> by a truſty friend of his, forbearing to ſend it by any of his ſervants for feare of being diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The ſea was then free, for though the ſuſpition of the warre was great, yet was there not (for all that) heard of till then any hoſtile effect.</p>
                  <p>The meſſengers with moſt proſperous winde arrived in <hi>Chio,</hi> a litle after that my fathers two kinſmen that had beene with <hi>Rotildo</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or ſuborned, preſented themſelves to a certaine Magiſtrate of ſupream authority in State-matters. An accidentall branch of whoſe office was to keepe inviolably ſecret both the accuſers &amp; teſtimony of witneſſes. There they expoſed and depoſed, That they never had ſince their returne from <hi>Perſia</hi> had the heart to beleeve, much leſſe relate that which they had with their owne eares heard againſt the perſon and faith of <hi>Rotildo;</hi> but that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the paſſe whereunto things were now brought, and underſtanding for a certaine, that <hi>Timocle</hi> was in <hi>Epheſus</hi> with an Army, they mov'd with the love of both their countrey and themſelves, accorded to be no longer ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, now that the ſaid apparances made them beleeve that to bee true, which till then they did not: This <hi>preludium</hi> ended, they ſaid on.</p>
                  <p>That fortuning to be locked up in ſome of the Royall lodgings of <hi>Suſa,</hi> neere the chamber where ſate the privy Councell, who were wont to ſhut themſelves up when they were come together, they heard them ſerious in diſcourſe about <hi>Chio</hi> and <hi>Rotildo,</hi> theſe two names being all they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, (the Councell ſpeaking in their owne language) till they heard <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocle</hi> call'd for, and a litle after ask'd in Greeke, if <hi>Rotildo</hi> had power en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7474:75"/>
to give up <hi>Chio</hi> to the King; and if alſo having gotten the principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof he would prove faithfull and loyall to his Majeſtie? Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered yes, diſcourſing with that a long while upon his Nobility, riches, and traine; That for his faith they might well be aſſured of it, becauſe of his being a marveilous upright and honeſt Gentleman, and ſuch a one as would not have accepted of any condition that prejudiced the liberty of his Countrey (hee being not naturally ambitious) but for the exceeding pride of the Citizens becomming extreamely inſupportable. This ſaid, there was no more Greeke ſpoken, nor <hi>Timocle</hi> any more heard ſpeake; and we being beſotted with <hi>Rotildo</hi>'s famed integrity, firmely beleeved, that <hi>Timocle</hi> had maliciouſly cauſed us to bee locked up there, to make us beleeve what he had made us heare. Vpon this depoſition, the good <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tildo</hi> was ſuddenly ſhut up in cloſe priſon, ſo as no man could come to ſpeak with him: And whilſt upon his examination hee called the Gods to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his innocence, thither came <hi>Chirito</hi>'s letters: Whereupon without being any more ſuffered to ſpeake for himſelfe, being ſo accuſed by two, and now convinced by the third, he (unfortunate Gentleman) was miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably and injuſtly ſtrangled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Timocle</hi> underſtanding of <hi>Rotildo</hi>'s death, ſeeming to be then apparently deſperate, as if by it all his deſignes had beene fruſtrated, and the neck of all his projects broken, made a ſhew of licenſing his troupes for returning to <hi>Suſa,</hi> but yet entertained them howſoever, having by his former ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-reall fame diſſolved the conjunction of the <hi>Greekiſh</hi> forces, whilſt my Father (not without being therefore cenſured) eſpouſed my Mother, ſhee telling ſuch as thereof ſpake to her, that ſhee would have married not only <hi>Pridale,</hi> a perſonage ſo eminent, but any baſe man whatſoever, rather than heare her ſelfe called after the unlucky ſurname of a wicked Traytor; a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, which as it attoned all my mothers kindred, ſo was it the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that thoſe of <hi>Rotildo</hi> retired for abſenting themſelves from the City the time of that marriage, to my Fathers exceeding content, for being ſo ſecured from any more contraſting untill the full accompliſhment of his deſigne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Timocle</hi> being advertized of what he had to doe, parted one night, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at <hi>Chio</hi> ſo ſuddenly, as her Citizens had not time to ſhut their Gates. And my Father gathering together his old and new kinred and alliance, and guarded with a great ſquadron of arm'd followers (as himſelfe was too from head to heele) hee bade them cheere up their hearts, ſince that Fleet was come thither at his requeſt: Heere without ſtaying for any anſwer, they being bid follow him, did ſo, nor had they indeede time to conſider of a deniall. His Brother he met at the Gate without the City, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many Captaines ſalutes him by the title of <hi>Prince,</hi> pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching with that the colours royall of <hi>Perſia</hi> on the Walls of the City and publick Pallace, wherein the new Soveraigne immediately lodged, expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thence the Magiſtrate, and altering the Orders of the Government, over which he placed <hi>Timocle</hi> Preſident.</p>
                  <p>Vnexpreſſible was the amazement of the Citizens, ſeeing themſelves baffled with the moſt maligne and envenomed hypocriſie that ever was heard of; the juſteſt, honeſteſt, and moſt zealous among them, having bin under pretext of juſtice and zeale betrayed and put to death; whileſt the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7474:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other complotted ſuch a buſineſſe by wayes twice as wicked as wylie, who yet had made them beleeve, yea and ſee too the contrary in the contrary, and gotten himſelfe to be deemed the beſt, whereas he was full of all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable wickedneſſe and villany, and was whileſt hee tooke on him to bee the ſole <hi>vindicator</hi> of the Common-wealth's liberty, a-mounting up to the throne of his tyrannie at the coſt of their ſimplicity and folly. And yet their evils had beene leſſe, if they had here ended. But the <hi>Perſians</hi> being departed, after having firſt left him ſecured by a ſtrong band of their old <hi>milice,</hi> hee called before him the Citizens, the greater part whereof hee cauſed in divers Temples to bee put to death by ſundry torments. But I will paſſe over this relation ſerving now no more for my purpoſe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooving me to come to the ſtory of my ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>I was borne the fourth moneth after that the Matrimony was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by my Parents, they adding to the ſumme of their former hatred and infamies that of adultery, before not publickly knowne; which (for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring me theirs) was by them themſelves moſt ſhameleſſely publiſhed. The Gods were pleaſed to ſhew in me their Omnipotencie in my creation, by giving mee the faireſt body and the fouleſt ſoule that ever creature in this world was compoſed of. I grew in beauty, and with it in the worſt conditions, my parents having no other ayme than to pleaſe mee, nor I other examples than their diſhoneſties. At three yeare old I was miſtreſſe of ſhameleſſeneſſe. Growne to ſixteene, my brother (borne a yeare after mee) was my ſweete-heart and lover; but we had both of us rivalls, I my mother, and hee my father; wee therefore had runne away together, ſo worried were we with their importunity &amp; hinderances that they brought us, if they perceiving it, had not given us way: I conceived almoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the occaſion of providing mee for husband the Tyrant of <hi>Samo</hi>'s ſonne, who a few yeares before had alſo uſurped that Principality by my Fathers meanes.</p>
                  <p>The young man came and married me, with an intent to bring me home immediately; but I for being gone by then five moneths of my time, would not aſſent to goe, for feare of ſubjecting my ſelfe (in caſe I were diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) to the dangers of any mans paſſions. The firſt night that we came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether I ſhew'd my ſelfe a daughter worthy of him that had begotten me; There was not any <hi>ſpecies</hi> of ſimplicity that I counterfeited not affectately, nor teares ſeconded with ſobbes &amp; skritches, that I ſeemed not to ſhowre abundantly, and act to the very life: The toyle and adoe he had to poſſeſſe himſelfe of mee were ſufficiently manifeſted by his ſweating and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. There was not the leaſt marke nor ſymptome of untouch'd virginity to be deſired in me, that I had not ſufficient to beguile the beſt experienteſt living in that kinde. Nay I was not aſhamed with my crying and frequent skritches to turne the houſe topſide-turvie: In runnes my Mother (as was before betweene us accorded on) to act her part of the <hi>tragicomedy,</hi> and ſhewing how I was (forſooth) ſwounded, ſhee revives me by beſprinkling me with vineger and odoriferous waters.</p>
                  <p>My time of childe-birth being come, as I was laid a-bed, upon the very point and inſtant of my delivery, in came my husband, ſo as I was forced with compreſſing my cries and teares, to bring forth my burthen under the quilt in his preſence, ſmothering the babe with my knees, leſt its crying
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7474:76"/>
might bewray me. I called my diſeaſe fits of the Collick. And the very fame night ſupped (as I was wont to doe) out of my bed, and had (ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently bold was I) layne with my husband too, but for my mother, who ſaid ſhee would ſleepe with mee her ſelfe, to helpe mee with medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines if my fits returned.</p>
                  <p>Hee in the meane time all enflamed with love of me, could not endure the want of mee, nor beleeve mee to be his as long as I abode among my owne kindred. Every day would I promiſe to goe along with him; but the inceſtuous blinde love of my brother had mored my anchors ſo faſt, that my ſhip could not be looſened from thoſe ſhores; and my husband impatient of my ſtay, did the more importune mee, for conceiving this brotherly affection to bee of another ſort than that of them which were borne of one and the ſame wombe: Hee therefore began now to open his eyes better, though better it had beene for him that he had not; For chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to come ſuddenly into a chamber, and finding us there together in an act not of the honeſteſt, hee drew out his ſword, my brother doing the ſame with his, and ſo (there being no body to part them) miſerably kill'd one another in my preſence; my brother dying ſuddenly, to whom I ranne, and affectionately kiſſing him, reviled my expiring husband with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious language, that had (but for my being in the higheſt degree impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) beene capable to make me for a third dye for meere ſhame. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed to care for nothing, this diſaſter being paſt, I cared litle for it, and leſſe for my brother, whom I had lov'd meerely for my pleaſure, which failing with him, I was to ſupply by others.</p>
                  <p>This diſaſter was (as others were) masked by the ſubtilty of my father and mother; who conſidering how prejudiciall my preſumption might in time prove, began to hate me, upon the aggravation of <hi>Timocle</hi>'s perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them either to curbe or kill me. All affections in him, though in all vices extreame, ceded to that only one of reigning; ſo as though enclined to all kinde of miſchiefe, he became to be in outward ſhew vertuous, for not falling at the fall (or deceaſe) of his brother, from that ſtate wherein he (in his conceit) liv'd happily. And my father knowing, that as hee was the inſtrument of his greatneſſe, ſo he might be alſo the like for his depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſtood ſo in feare of him, as he doubted he would be angry if he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not his counſels, having a perpetuall eye to the good opinion the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and many great ones had of him, to whom he was become gracious by his nature, pliable to all humours; ſo as <hi>Cameleon-</hi>like he with the good would appeare in the beſt colours, and with the wicked in the worſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nerea</hi> my Mother an hundred for one more malicious and miſchievous than my Father, and that for her owne ends, had eſteemed his brother more than he, entertaining him with the carriage rather of a ſtrumpet than a ſiſter-in-law, and ſalving her husbands jealouſies with the ſelfe ſame cunning; endeavouring to make him beleeve, that ſo ſhee muſt have done to ſave them both from being undone: Reaſons (at firſt) perhaps good, but no longer now after the diſaſter of his ſonne; doubting, and with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon too, that ſhee carried her ſelfe towards him as ſhee had done towards her other husband; obſervantly therefore examining her demeanour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his brother, he conſidered it to be the fabrick of his danger &amp; ruine.</p>

                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:7474:77"/>
All my Mothers wit was after the death of her ſonne employed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning the intereſſed continencie of <hi>Timocle,</hi> which being once battered, ſhee hoped to be whole directreſſe and commandreſſe of all. Much adoe ſhee had in aſſaulting it, but at laſt ſhee wonne it. <hi>Timocle</hi> as wylie, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and miſchievous as ſo many more, ſubjecting himſelfe by degrees to the webbe of the ill-warpt thread of a worſer ſpinſter. The buſineſſe went not far onwards, becauſe my Father was now reſolved to make ſure worke of them, who conſidered that the Principality being to him and his heires, tooke from all others all pretext thereunto, as long as he and I ſtuck toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; not without forethinking, that womens diſability to tyrannie (an engine to bee managed with forces and terrours, conditions farre diſtant from the nature of their ſex) and my being horribly deteſted of every one, would have brought him no ſmall diſadvantage: Yet howſoever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other prop to leane upon, hee chooſed this for his preſent ends, <hi>any ſhade ſerving his turne that lyes ſcorched by the Sunne.</hi> And though that innovating might goe neere to ſpoyle all, and move on to a certaine end uncertaine perils, yet thought he it not his beſt courſe to put it in doubt, ſince preventing a miſchiefe and ſurprizing the miſchiefe-plotter is better than to be prevented and ſurprized. Hee therefore began to honour mee, uſing me (as preſumed heire) with much reſpect, by participating to mee his affaires, calling me into counſell, and giving mee a Family, and among them, ſome of the beſt reputed and honeſteſt Matrons of <hi>Chio,</hi> perſwading me to vertue, good conditions, and more eſpecially to a modeſt and honeſt courſe of life, framing himſelfe alſo to the ſame in outward appearance ſo punctually, as hee now ſeemed to be no more that firſt <hi>Pridale:</hi> And to the end that <hi>Nerea</hi> and <hi>Timocle</hi> might prove the authors of their owne ruine, hee ſeemed to be hoodwink'd at their actions, by cheriſhing and making more of them now than before, making an account, that their becomming odious unto the world would preſerve him in his Principality, for doubt of a worſe, if not for choyſe of the better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Timocle</hi> penetrating his brothers thoughts by his behaviour, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how the government had wonne him many, all favours having beene done either mediately or immediately by him, and all rigours and injuſtice imputed and conceived to be <hi>Pridale</hi>'s, although his conſcience told him, that he was ever hated but in an equall degree with himſelfe, who was a murtherer, a betrayer of his Countrey, and good men, a complotter of tyrannie, an adulterer, and an inceſtuous miſcreant; abandoning therefore all domeſtick hopes, hee faſtned on forraigne, better founded and more certaine. Hee wrote to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court, and complain'd of <hi>Pridale,</hi> not in termes of enmity, but as a well-meaning man, propoſing the dangers of ſedition in the people, who were like enough (ſo they but once recovered their liberty) to breake the hedges not onely of <hi>Ionia,</hi> but even of all the Provinces of <hi>Greece.</hi> That therefore order ſhould be given for ſome num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of good Souldiers and Galleyes to keepe the Ile in awe: Hee obtained as much as he deſired, upon a conformable letter of <hi>Farnabazzo</hi> Lievete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Generall in <hi>Aſia,</hi> an ancient friend of <hi>Timocle</hi>'s, and conſerved ſuch by preſents, and by the common opinion of the Peeres, that hee was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Perſian</hi> than a <hi>Grecian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Father looked pale at the hearing of the order of ſending him Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7474:77"/>
and Garriſons. And ſeeing himſelfe in ſuch a ſtreight, reſolved to clip his brothers ambition's wings, by having him guided to the precipice of his downe-fall. Hee ſurprized <hi>Timocle</hi> and his wife together on the fact, or as wee ſay with the manner, whileſt they were more careleſly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious, for thinking themſelves ſecure enough from him; and ſhewed them in the act both to the Principall of the City, and to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Officers, and then ſpeedily convicting them, put them to death; the moſt welcome accident that had befallen <hi>Chio,</hi> ſince ſhee had loſt her liberty, which ſhee judged to be a very good beginning: Faine would my Mother have ſeene me before her death, but that laſt boone of hers was not granted her.</p>
                  <p>Having ſtepped this irrevocable pace, my Father not knowing how to refuſe the deſtinated <hi>milice,</hi> bethought himſelfe of ſending me into <hi>Perſia,</hi> that I ſerving for a ſilent hoſtage might more handſomely excuſe him thereof, hoping that my beauties were ſufficient to obtaine of the King &amp; Court all that I knew how to demand. Having received my inſtructions, we gave out (to vaile with a modeſt pretext this till then unheard-of femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine embaſſie) that I went to be entertained in the Queenes ſervice, till I married againe.</p>
                  <p>Come to <hi>Aſia</hi> accompanied with a Noble Family of Knights and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, I came to ſpeech with <hi>Farnabazzo;</hi> I ſtood not to praying, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him (ſo much authority conceived I to have over him in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant) to forbeare to ſend the forces either of men or galleyes deſtinated for <hi>Chio,</hi> till he had further order from the Court. I was obeyed, paſſing afterwards from place to place without any expence, beſides my being gratified by all, even till I came to <hi>Suſa,</hi> reſerving (all the while) apart my naturall conditions, to the end the coyne of my beauty (being conſerved in its full weight) might be the more currant to ſteede mee where I went to ſpend it; I arrived in Court, with a noble conduct of ſuch as beyond any expectation of mine came to meete mee by the way, although indeede I ſtrongly relied on my winning qualities. Being preſented to the King, I carried my ſelfe Courtier-like, having in three monethes time learnt the Court-cuſtomes and phraſes, of ſuch as had honoured me with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and attendance, ſo as I now knew well how to convert the <hi>Grecian</hi> demeanour into that of the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and the odious popular audacity into venerable adoration; inſomuch as I cannot tell you, whether the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained thereat more amazed or taken. I ſuperficially paſſed over the faults of my Vncle and Mother, and enlarged my ſelfe upon their conjuration, giving it ſuch colours as pleaſed me beſt, I ſhewed him that my Father could not diſplay before him any more evidently viſible enſignes of his devotion, than by ſending mee his onely Daughter and heire, to doe him obedience, and put my ſelfe at his feete, to the end, that ſhee being formed after the <hi>Idea</hi> of his royall will and pleaſure, might give him certaine aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our loyall ſubjection, for obtaining the favour of conſerving thoſe branches, which by the favour of his Majeſty and our good fortune were grafted to the ſtock of ſo high and noble a Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>The King liſtened to me with great attention, and then without ſuffering me to kneele any longer, raiſed me up, and put me to ſit on a cloth of Tiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue Cuſhion, himſelfe being ſeated upon a Throne of pure gold under a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7474:78"/>
large canopy chaſed all over with pearle and precious ſtones, adorn'd with faire banners enriched with deepe fringe of fineſt gold. He ſate environed with his Peeres divided into two wings, with that ſemblance of humility that comes neereſt adoration. His anſwer was ſhort, his joyfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſmiling garbe partly expreſſing his intended ſpeech, which was, That he was glad of my comming, and that <hi>Pridale</hi> could not thinke of a better meanes to free him from blame; whom, to gratifie me, he received into the number of his friends; whereat I being riſen up to adore him, he tooke me by the hand, and amorouſly beholding it, asked me if I were not weary after ſo long a journey; whereunto (I ſubmiſſively kneeling down, and kiſſing his unawares of him) anſwered; that weariſomneſſe had no place in ſuch, who were honoured with enjoying the paradice of his cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall preſence. So pleaſed was the King with my action and adulation, that raiſing me up himſelfe, and kiſſing me, he ſaid to his Peeres, that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all his live's time ſeene either a fairer or a diſcreeter woman; giving (with that) order to the Lord high Chamberlaine to aſſigne me lodgings; which was ſoone done, for he accompanying me out, conſigned mee the richeſt Chambers, and neereſt the King of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>I cannot expreſſe unto you the joy that I conceiv'd from ſo good a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, not that there ſtuck not in my heart a certaine internall doubt of the iſſue of the enterprize, upon laying before the eyes of my conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion womaniſh envies, from which (for all that) my heart would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven mee a free iſſue, if miſchievous ſubtilty could have done it. But what I doubted of was Fortune, a thing above the reach of humane will.</p>
                  <p>Scarce was I poſſeſſed of my Lodgings, when I pretended to goe ſee the Queene, a favour rarely granted to ſtrangers, the women being there ever retired, not ſtirring abroad, but vailed and waited on by Eunuches. But to mee any thing was eaſie to be obtained of the King (who was diſpoſed to will even what I willed) and of the Queene too; becauſe ſhee being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of my comming, and of the graces and favours I had received, had an extreame deſire to eſpie out ſome imperfection or blemiſh either in my face, body, or demeanour; I found her indeede of rare beauty, though inſipide &amp; liveleſſe, of a meane ſpirit, and that litle poorely pieced up with ſimplicity and an ill grace; ſo as it was no wonder, if the King growne weary thereof became enflamed of mee, rather for my garbe or carriage (as I perceived) than for any excelling beauty of my face, for that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently beleeved (and that without miſtaking too) that the Queene was fairer than I. Beyond meaſure then remain'd I conſolated, when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the advantages I had of her; I had now therefore no more feare of my ſelfe, ſince I was aſſured to bring the King ſubject to my beck, for that I was to encounter with a <hi>Genius</hi> inferior to mine. I formed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe (with my ſeeming foreſight, and penetrating the unexpert craft of thoſe women) an ocean of jealouſies and abſurdities; becauſe <hi>who-ſo meanes to beguile another, must make a ſhew of conditions uncapable of begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any.</hi> I ſhould be too tedious in recounting unto you all the particulars of accepting and entertaining me in her ſervice, the grace I thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, her ill will being changed into liking, &amp; her envy into well-wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>trophies</hi> litle eſteemed by mee, otherwiſe than as they ſerved to my principall end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:7474:78"/>
The enamoured King, thinking to gaine me with the ſmoake of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and preſents, remained aſtoniſhed to ſee me ſo deceive his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and asking me the reaſon of my (as he tearmed it) cruelty; I anſwered him; That it was not the uſe of Princeſſes in my Countrey to ſerve for Concubines, nor could I with my honour bee ſuch, though to ſo great a Prince; ſo as he was excluded from enjoying me otherwiſe than as a wife. But the plurality of women not of wives being accuſtomed in <hi>Perſia,</hi> gave him by my words an inkling of either repudying or making away of his preſent wife; hee that conceived well enough my meaning, extazied with exceſſive love anſwered no.</p>
                  <p>That he had no other occaſion to put her away, than for her barrenneſſe; and then againe to take another without being aſſured of having iſſue by her, was a thing hee could not doe, becauſe in caſe that that other proved barren, it would behoove him (for his States ſatisfaction) to follow the firſt example, a point that troubled me much, ſo as I thought upon it many dayes with my ſelfe, till ſeeing that my conſideration hammered ever on the anvill of the ſelfe-ſame conceits, I was forced to condiſcend to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire upon his royall promiſe, that as ſoone as I were knowne to bee quick with childe, hee would make me his wife. But taſted that he had once the ſweeteneſſe of my embraces, and ſeene the difference betweene a woman of froſt and one of fire, he became ſo tranſported with the exceedingneſſe of his content, as he thought of nothing elſe ſave to ridde himſelfe of his wife. Now he never thought of making her away with poyſon as I would have done (the eaſieſt way for him,) nay I was a good warrant to doe it without asking him any leave, if I could, but that I wanted the ſimples and meanes to effect it withall; ſo that there now reſting mee no other hopes than from being quick with childe, I quite deſpaired thereof, after five or ſix moneths time, wherein I tried ſo many experiments, as went neere to coſt me my life, by endeavouring (as much as in me lay) to prove my mothers prognoſticks falſe; who upon my delivery of childe-birth told me, that I ſhould never ſuffer any more ſuch paines, my incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous delivery having ſo bruiſed me within, and its ſoreneſſe ſo augmented by my naturall heate, as deprived me of all poſſibility of conceiving any more.</p>
                  <p>I made many trialls of my ſelfe according to my Phyſitians direction, eſpecially of certaine ſuffumigations of <hi>Mirh, Incenſe,</hi> and <hi>Storax,</hi> which paſſing from the inferior parts of the body to the mouth and noſe, denotes a poſſibility of conceiving, but through me (to my but too great diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent) they paſſed not, though upon experimenting it on one of my Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, I found a different effect.</p>
                  <p>Miſſing thus of the Direct way, I turn'd to the Oblique, and to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with cunning the defects of Nature. For, I cauſed to be laid waite for in three ſeverall places, three women great with childe litle or nothing differing in their time, my Phyſitian ſerving me faithfully in that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and making each of thoſe women beleeve, that he would reare it up as his ſonne, in performance of a Vow he had made to <hi>Eſculapio.</hi> And my will was, that they ſhould be three, out of the likelihood that one of them might be a boy, and that I might (in caſe one of them died) have my choyſe of the other two; ſo then I tooke on me to be great with childe,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7474:79"/>
to the Kings ſo great pleaſure and joy, that hee went neere to grow wilde thereat; I wanted (you may well imagine) no ſymptoms, being therein helped by certaine vomitive pils, which by me ſwallowed downe in the morning wrought on me at ſo meaſured a time, as they began their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion juſt at my riſing off the table; In the night time likewiſe (by taking halfe a glaſſe-full of certaine water, privily laid by one of my women at my beds head) I awakened with my vomiting the King, who forgetting what he was, ſerved me for a ſervant and waiting-boy: That which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled him, others, and (well neere) my ſelfe too, was the comming no more of my ordinary viſits, &amp; the appearing of milke in my breſts within two moneths after; inſomuch as I beleeved that I was with childe in good earneſt; but my Phyſitian ſoone lopp'd off that pleaſing branch from the tree of my conceit, by letting me ſee, that the veines being over-ſtuff'd with blood, which ſhould have runne elſe-where, had tranſmitted it up into my breſts, where it converted into milke; which in caſe it (for my not purging my body) continued, would occaſion mee a dangerous and violent diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Delivered that one of the three women was by night, and by good fortune of a goodly male-childe, he was brought mee by the Phyſitian, and handſomely conveyed under my coates, cloſe to me, with all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances needfull for keeping the plot undeſcried; my Midwives and nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers I had ready at hand, and one Lady that the Queene put with mee to ſee mee delivered, by me long before ſo beguiled, as ſhee now no more doubted of my being great with childe. For, I having lately cauſed to be taken away from too kitlings newly littered the clawes and tongues, and handſomely fitted them under my ſmocke, made them feele thereabouts with their hands, whilſt they made juſt ſuch another motion, as babes doe in their mothers wombe.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner was my Phyſitian departed, than that I ſhriked out ſuch loud cries, as waked all the Pallace, I haſtily roame to my bed, where I lay in ſuch a plight, as they tooke me for dead, ſo handſomely did I counterfeite my ſelfe for ſuch, by my faſt-graſped hands, and eyes ſo rowled up, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the white of them appeared. They all-to-be-rubb'd me over, and kept ſuch a doe about me, as they had kill'd the little creature, but for the moiſtneſſe of the blood that diſcovered it. Lifting up the bed-clothes, they found nothing wanting in me for manifeſting my being delivered.</p>
                  <p>The King hearing I was on the point of death, came running into my Chamber, the ſame did alſo the more than me dead Queene, it behooving her in ſpite of her heart to make a ſhew of gladneſſe on this birth, which pierced her very heart, and of ſorrow for that evill, which would have proved the ſupreameſt of her joyes, if this had beene the laſt and extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt diſeaſe that ever I ſhould be ſick of: The babe being waſh'd eſcaped hardly the being ſmothered by the Kings hugging and kiſſing it: At the newes of this adored birth-day the night was turned into day, every body ſtirring abroad, and all the City with lights in all their <hi>balcons,</hi> and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires in all their ſtreets, though not before that my Phyſitian (to whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone I would needs give the honour thereof) had with his counterfeite me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines cured my counterfeite diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Vp riſen that I was from childe-bed, my firſt buſineſſe was to haſten
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7474:79"/>
the repudiating of the Queene, and next my wedding not as yet obtained; becauſe wiſe (though potent) Kings will not at all times doe what they both can and have a deſire to doe. They have their owne ends, and yet will give the people ſatisfaction, and diſcreetly waite for the opportunity of time to put in execution ſuch things as they are ſure cannot pleaſe them: Yet well might I upon this occaſion have beene married, if the Gods had beene pleaſed to have permitted my wickedneſſe to have reſted perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concealed.</p>
                  <p>The King had neere his perſon a great Lord named <hi>Gobria,</hi> his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary for age, bred up with him from his infancie, and his companion in Armes in all enterprizes. This Lords integrity was never ſhaken with thoſe infernall blaſts, Avarice and Ambition; for the King never gave him ſo much, as that his liberality gave him way to enrich himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall; neither did ever his dignities and favours make him either ſo proud or diſcourteous as to neglect to any man any reſpect due to him. He was naturally a mortall enemy to all corruption, ill-ſpeaking, and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakers, but above all things to diſſembling and treaſon; never ſaw hee the King incenſed againſt any man, that in an humble and prevailing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he excuſed him not, ſo he but thought he deſerved it. Or if at any time he ſeemed to accuſe any man, it then was but to ſecond his Prince's nature, which he knew to be more apt to pardon upon confeſſion, than excuſe of errours; ſo as it is not knowne that ever he did any prejudicing office a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any man, but upon great and ſound reaſons, hee being in all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment more ſatisfactory and familiar, than indeede befitted either his greatneſſe or the ſtatelineſſe of the <hi>Perſian</hi> cuſtomes. And yet he that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in his lives time had harmed any body, was nevertheleſſe the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſe of my utter ruine.</p>
                  <p>My Phyſitian had infore-ſpeaking the women (as you have heard) made every of them beleeve, that (becauſe he had no children of his owne) he would beſtow nurſing and breeding on what they ſhould bee delivered of, ſo it were a boy, ſo as the firſt that was delivered, obſerving how haſty he was to disburthen her of hers, and how that without as much as binding up his navell they had borne him away, with leaving her in his ſteed a great purſe of gold, ſhee firſt doubted that it was to make uſe of him for ſome ill purpoſe; ſeeing that if he had a minde to breede him up, he might well have had the patience to ſtay till he were weaned; But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards upon better conſideration of the buſineſſe, and of him, me, and my being with childe, ſhe conceived the caſe juſt as it ſtood; which though ſhee liked not very well, yet joyed ſhee that her ſonne ſhould runne the carriere of ſo great a fortune, keeping in minde a mole ſhee had taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of under his left pap: But growne deſirous now, (ſince ſhee could no more get a ſight of him, to know what was become of him) ſhee went to Court, where renewing her acquaintance with an under-maide-ſervant that ſerved the Queenes waſh-woman, (an ancient acquaintance of hers) ſhee ſaw her weepe, the occaſion whereof ſhee underſtood to be, that by reaſon of the Queenes being repudiated they ſhould bee all of them tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of ſervice. For in reſpect I had brought forth a male childe, the divorce was concluded on for my ſucceeding her, to the end the heire of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchie might be no baſtard. The woman (glad of being
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7474:80"/>
ſo eaſily aſſertained of what ſhee was come thither of purpoſe to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of, more deſirous (as it ſhould ſeeme) to have her ſonne though poore to be hers, than a King and anothers; or elſe hoping, that ſhee ſhould not onely by diſcovering the truth ſatisfie her conſcience, but alſo reape there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from both reward and preferment, which in the other ſtate could not (as ſhee conceived) befall her; for that ſhee imagined, that ſhee ſhould never come to be known of her ſonne, (and by conſequence muſt have led a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented kinde of life) bethought her ſelfe of ſome courſe of remedying it, and having made meanes to come to ſpeake to <hi>Gobria,</hi> ſhee began to count him up the ſtorie, when he penetrating its ſubſtance, interrupted her with telling her, that hee would have her ſpeake what ſhee had to tell him in the Queenes preſence, and with that, leaving her in his owne Chamber, with order that ſhee ſtirred not thence; he a litle after returning, tooke her along with him to the Queene, where having ſent for ſome of the beſt and prime perſonages of the Privy Councell; <hi>Gobria</hi> in preſence and hearing of them all, thus gets out of her the whole buſineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Good wife (ſaith he) you were telling me of a certaine paſſage of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which for ſome convenient reſpects I would not then heare out, I pray you therefore come out with it now boldly here before this noble company, who will vouchſafe you a benigne audience.</p>
                  <p>The woman beginning againe her relation, punctually accounted the importunity of the Phyſitian, her delivery, the ſudden convaying away of the childe, the gift received, and the marke of the mole.</p>
                  <p>I leave you to thinke whether the Queene were a glad woman or no at theſe newes. Taking then the woman aſide, commending her for her good conſcience, and promiſing her large rewards for her diſcovery; they fell to conſultation of what was beſt to be done, the harmeleſſe Queene's ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low braine furthering it no otherwiſe than by her teares and ſupplications: when the no leſſe diſcreete than true-hearted <hi>Gobria</hi> ſhewes the reſt, that reaſons prevailed but litle with lovers, leſſe if they were great men, and leaſt of all if Princes. That therefore truth ſhould bee inſtill'd into the eares of Kings ſeaſonably and by litle drops. Accordingly then their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations were at length reduced to an agreement. That every of them ſhould impart the ſecret to ſome truſty friend or other. But a full houres time was ſcarce expired, when all the Court was full of it; ſo as penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the eares of my Phyſitian, me, and my retinue, it put us all to our wits end.</p>
                  <p>The King marveiling to ſee me ſo troubled in minde, never left mee till he had drawne me to tell its occaſion; and I thinking it would advantage me very much to be the firſt that ſhould ſpeake of it, ſet on the bold face to tell him: That the Queenes ſervants had ſpread abroad ſome maligne ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which could not chooſe but vex mee extreamely, beſeeching him to free me thereof ſpeedily, if he deſired that I lived. Vpon this he asking me of whom I had underſtood them, and I telling him that I had heard them of ſuch a one, he found the relations thereof ſo entangled, as he could not poſſibly finde out the ſource thereof; willingly would he have whoſh't them up, but that the importance of the buſineſſe permitted him not ſo to doe, conſidering the difficulty of the divorce, becauſe of the opinion of the child's being but my ſuppoſed ſonne. Therefore thought he it neceſſary
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7474:80"/>
to convict thereof the <hi>Queene,</hi> and puniſh her, and in ſuch a determination ſent for her.</p>
                  <p>My trouble of mind was in the meane time augmented long of the babe, who ſeeming to bee at firſt a goodly well-ſhap'd childe, was now growne hunch-back'd, by reaſon of the becomming crooked and ſhrinking up I know not how of his Cheine-ſtring, a naturall defect (it ſhould ſeeme) in him that had begot him. Now neither the King nor the reſt knew nothing thereof; howbeit it grieved me, that after having (as I conceived) accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed my intent, there ſhould yet be added to the ſumme of the reſt this other affliction, hard to evade, if by ill fortune together with the generall relation of the caſe, this particular of the childs father were alſo publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I ſuddenly ſent my Phyſitian to the mother, who miſſing her, and hearing that ſhee was ſome foure dayes ſince gone to Court, without being yet returned home, comes running to mee like a man halfe diſtracted, and haſtily rounds me in the eare, that all the affaire was diſcovered, and wee undone; this ſaid, he ſlipping ſuddenly out of my ſight, and fetching ſome monies that he had in ſtore, got on horſe-back, and rode away with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſave himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The Queene came (in obedience of her Lords command, clad in a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gubrous habit with a ſide-traine) ſupported under the arme by <hi>Gobria</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and accompanied with moſt of the Lords of the Councell. A ſight that ſtruck the King to the heart more than all the reſt; for knowing <hi>Gobria</hi> to be of a minde ſo upright, and diſpoſition ſo well tempered, that paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could not any way ſway him. They proſtrated themſelves all of them at his feete without ſpeaking a word; when ſeeing the King mute, upon his ſpirits becomming amazed with the object: The Queene animated with <hi>Gobria</hi>'s friendly ſupport, ſighed out theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Behold here (Royall Sir) your Majeſties moſt humble hand-maide, who in all humility beſeecheth your royall goodneſſe to vouchſafe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto her the oracle of your Soveraigne will and pleaſure; I am come here ſent for by your Majeſties command, not daring to preſume to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent my ſelfe otherwiſe before your royall preſence. The King ſomewhat mollified at the ſight of thoſe rare (though mortified) beauties, told her, There was broach'd by ſome of her ſervants, a moſt malicious calumny, which was; That the ſonne borne him was not his, whereof in caſe ſhee prov'd the Authreſſe, he could doe no leſſe than inflict on her ſome exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary puniſhment, ſince it concerned together with the intereſſes of his mother, that of the kingdome, whereunto the babe was borne Prince. And that therefore it behooved her, either to ſhew her ſelfe innocent of that calumny, or dye the death. At that word the poore ſimple Lady ſunke downe in a ſwound, and had therewithall by her ſo falling hurt her ſelfe, but for <hi>Gobria</hi>'s ſuſtaining her. The King unable to endure the ſight of her, committing her to the charge of her women, leaves the roome, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Councell to follow him, out of a deſire of hearing their opinions in this caſe. <hi>Gobria</hi> thereupon being beckened unto by the others, in a moſt ſubmiſſively-humble manner thus beſpeakes him.</p>
                  <p>My Soveraigne Liege, that which your Majeſty hath intimated to the Queene might be as well intimated to all of us here preſent, ſhee knowing in this no more than we, nor wee no more than ſhee: Therefore, if what
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7474:81"/>
is reported be a calumny, your Majeſty ſhall then have the calumniator at his mercy; but if there be no ſuch matter, then I (under pardon) hope, it were ſpeciall ſervice done to your Majeſty, that the truth were manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and the faulty chaſtiſed: Heere he relates him the whole ſtory, and then calling for the woman, made her both confirme the ſame, and ſhew him the purſe of money given her. Which he (to my ill fortune) finding to bee the very ſame that hee himſelfe had given mee, preſently knew it, which was the onely impreſſion of truth in his minde; inſomuch, as he that at firſt had caſt an ill eye on <hi>Gobria,</hi> ſent (now that hee ſaw the paſſages prove true) in all haſte for my Phyſitian, whom (ſeeing he could not bee found) he imagined to be fled away; he then ſent poſts after him, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertooke and reconducted him: But yet calling to minde (for all that) how deerely he had lov'd me, he came unto me (as ſoone as he was parted from the Councell) and told me, how aggrieved he was in himſelfe, that I had ſo abuſed and fooled him; whereunto I (ſuppoſing he was now too well informed for me to ſtand either on my owne juſtification or deniall of the truth) anſwered, that my fault was but an effect of love: ſince that for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying him ſolely and ſecurely to my ſelfe, I had found out this invention, without any intent of harming the Queene, which therefore was both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable and excuſable. His reply was, that he was ſorry to leave and loſe me, ſince it behoved me either to fly or dye: I muſt confeſſe to you, that at that word my ſpirits fainted; yet he as though the laſt minutes time of our being together ſtood on the moment of its expiration, with a haſty-gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe taking me up in his armes, threw mee on my bed without ſpeaking ever a word, where having taken of me his pleaſure, he charged me to get me gone that very night: But upon my anſwering him, that I knew neither how nor whither; he replied, he would give me a guide, wiſhing mee at no hand to faile to be ready to follow whomſoever ſhould reſtore mee that Ring; and with that, ſlipping a Diamond Ring off my finger, away he hyes.</p>
                  <p>I aſſoone as my women were laid a-bed (truſting not one of them) cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th'd my ſelfe in mans apparell, when juſt as I had pack'd up in a fardle all and nought elſe ſave my Iewels, I might heare ſome body knocking gently at my doore, which I no ſooner opened, than that a young Gentleman ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniouſly kiſſing my Diamond reſtored it me, with ſaying, that the King had commanded him to come and ſerve me; I tooke the Ring, and inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed him; and then mounted that wee were on Steeds for their ſpeed advantagious, I (having even from my childehood beene bred up, as in many other manly exerciſes, ſo in this of riding in particular, which was one of the many linkes that formed the chaine of the Kings love to me) left that Countrey which I once hoped to be <hi>Queene</hi> of, galloping with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible ſpeede that remnant of night without any whit repoſing me: ſo as the enſuing morning with our horſes dropping wet with ſweate, wee came to a Caſtle, where (ſhewing the Kings order ſigned by his own hand, and under his Privy-ſeale, requiring that freſh horſes ſhould be ſpeedily delivered us) we remounted, continuing thus our changing of horſes and riding-poſte untill the evening.</p>
                  <p>I profeſſe to you I never till then found my ſelfe ſo weary; yet repoſed I that night without any kinde of feare, for being aſſured by the Gentleman my guide, that the King would not cauſe me to be ſought after, ſave on the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7474:81"/>
Rode of <hi>Aſia,</hi> under colour that he thought I was fled to <hi>Greece.</hi> Howbeit that it ſtood us upon to ride poſte, leſt any others ſent by the <hi>Queene</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to light on that way. Hee then likewiſe tels mee, that the King had commanded him, to conduct me as farre as the <hi>Perſian</hi> creeke, being the narroweſt and neereſt confine of his Empire, to the end my toyle of riding and danger of being overtaken might the ſooner come to an end. 'Twas my good fortune, that before the arrivall of this accident, the King had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to come (for ſome important affaire of his) to <hi>Perſelope,</hi> a place di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the ſea, litle more than tenne dayes journeyes of ſuch as wee made; ſince if I had taken the direct way to <hi>Greece,</hi> I muſt then (after I had gotten out of <hi>Perſia)</hi> have croſſed <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> ferried over the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> foorded the <hi>Antitauro,</hi> and meaſured in its full length all <hi>Aſia minor</hi> o're, ere I could have arrived to either <hi>Eolide</hi> or <hi>Ionia:</hi> which to doe, a whole moneths time (alas) had not beene enough for a poſte to run without any intermiſſion. Againe, if I had gone to <hi>Suſa,</hi> I then (neither) had no other than the ſelfe-ſame way, unleſle I would aſſoone as I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into <hi>Media</hi> have furrowed the <hi>Ircanian</hi> Sea, and thence paſſed the <hi>Caucaſus, Iberia,</hi> and <hi>Colchis,</hi> re-embarked me on the <hi>Euſin,</hi> and ſo ſtricken homewards over the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> and <hi>Obeleſpont,</hi> with many dangers, theſe wayes being yet more peſtred with <hi>Scythians,</hi> than thoſe other with <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians.</hi> But when I ſaw my ſelfe in the middeſt of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulfe, I then (and not till then) thought my ſelfe indifferently ſecure, but much more, at my arrivall in <hi>Arabia;</hi> where I ſoone regained my wonted vigor, nature, and cuſtomes: And thinking then no more on the <hi>Perſian</hi> King, who had (as I by that time pretended) againſt all right and reaſon put me to ſhift for my ſelfe, I being (as it is an ordinary thing in women of my humour and quality) more excelling in that of ingratitude than in all other vices, fix'd my eyes on the Gentleman my conduct: whom for all his being as modeſt again as truſty, I at length corrupted, it being too difficult for him in reſpect of his too raw yeares, to eſcape the being enſnared by me.</p>
                  <p>During all the time of my abode in <hi>Perſia,</hi> ambition had made me pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the Kings cold embracements, (he good man being of fifty yeares of age if not upwards, without thinking of others) but now freed of that affect, I returned to my ordinary and former contents: Now my loves were ever in their ingreſſe very vehement, and full of jealouſies and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſpirit, which made thoſe I loved beleeve, that I could not turne my affection to others; wherein they were much deceived, nay the ſelfe-ſame in the end beguiled me too. For, come to <hi>Memphi</hi> (rich with what I brought with me, but farre richer for what the Gentleman preſented me withall from the King in Iewels of an ineſtimable value) wee forgetting our journey, ſtaid thereto enjoy each other in that City in the hight of luxury and laſciviouſneſſe, without wanting any thing requiſite to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our contents; for ſatisfying whereof we every day ſought out for new devices and inventions. Here by the newes that flew from one Court to another underſtood wee my owne ſtory; and <hi>that</hi> my Phyſitian was found, and in the ground buried alive up to the throate, and <hi>that</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ſunne and flies with his face all-to-be ſmeared over with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he in that manner miſerably died. That the King having by my own ſervants underſtood my paſſed life, (aſhamed for having ſuffered himſelfe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7474:82"/>
to bee ſo groſſely beguiled, but much more of having ſo lov'd mee) had commanded <hi>Farnabazzo</hi> to take from me the Iland; and in caſe he found me not to be hang'd, to take and hang up my Father for mee; which (with other newes wee a little after heard) was executed: whereupon I ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that diſloyalty in others which I knew to be in my ſelfe, bethought my ſelfe how to ridde me of <hi>Ariobarzane</hi> (for ſuch was the Gentlemans name) fore-thinking, that upon my rejecting him (as I was already taken with a new love) it was likely he would requite me with the like or as great a diſcourteſie; eſpecially conſidering he had loſt his Prince's favour, and forſaken his Countrey, fortunes, meanes, and all for love of me.</p>
                  <p>This Gentleman having beene borne and brought up in Court, knew not how to leade any other than a Courtly life and converſation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in often-frequenting it hee got acquaintance enough to draw on him by my meanes his utter ruine. Hee gave himſelfe out to be of <hi>Suſiana,</hi> leſt his profeſſing to be (as hee was) a <hi>Perſian,</hi> and my being with him might make us knowne for what we were, for better concealing whereof, hee alwayes call'd me wife, and I him husband. Wee gave out, that we were come to paſſe to the Oracle of <hi>Iupiter Ammon,</hi> and that the reaſon of our ſojourne there, was but to ſtay for the ſeaſon of the yeare. Hee often brought along to dine with him a valiant and proper young Gentleman call'd <hi>Erſemeo,</hi> one favoured of the King, and highly eſteemed of all that knew him; his qualities conforming with thoſe of my now ſuppoſed huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, eſpecially in ſuffering himſelfe to be corrupted by me, as the other had beene before. <hi>Ariobarzane</hi> was no whit jealous, but loving both his friend and his company, favoured him with ſuch liberty, as he would many times, when he found him not at home, entertaine himſelfe with mee, to ſtay for his comming. I that lived by (or at leaſt lov'd beſt) often change, grew ſoone to bee amorouſly enflamed of him, and found wayes to let him ſee it too: But he, though he well enough conceived it, being honeſt though, and loyall to his friend, either did not, or would not underſtand me in the right conſtruction of my intent. Strange ſeemed it unto me, that he being a young Gentleman, an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and a Courtier too, ſhould (or could) be ſo continent; and therefore becauſe I durſt not in plaine termes unboſome my ſelfe unto him, for doubt of either his not conſenting, or bewraying me, I bethought of a way of making him entrap himſelfe thus.</p>
                  <p>I would take on me (if it were in the fore-noone that he came) to begin to goe dreſſe my ſelfe, and would, at the inſtant of his comming in, be ſure to be unſmockt, letting him ſee my breſt and paps in their lively colours and true proportions, able to change both proportion and colour in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi> himſelfe. If in the after-noone, I then would be putting on my ſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings or ſhoes, the border of my coates and ſmock-hem being the while lifted up ſo high, that though I with making a ſhew of being ſurprized, would with a counterfeite baſhfulneſſe clap them downe, yet did I not ſo before he had ſeene and conceiv'd enough to make him languiſh with an amorous deſire. In the ſweltry hot noone-tides, I would be little better than naked, bare-foote and bare-legg'd, naked-breaſted, with an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fine and ſight-penetrable Camrick ſmocke, laſciviouſly diſcovering what it not hid but vailed. From the waſte downewards, I wore a Kirtle of ſlight cob-web laune, from under which appeared two relevated flanks,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7474:82"/>
accompanied with thoſe parts which had (as they ſhould) their proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable riſings. Nature having given mee a body that needed not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon helpes of rectifying its proportion, by bombace or the like: And for my haire I wore it diſhevelled in a careleſſe faſhion, without either haire lace or criſping-wyre.</p>
                  <p>At theſe taking-objects the poore <hi>Erſemeo</hi> freez'd and burnt at one and the ſame time; whilſt <hi>Ariobarzane</hi> glorying in my beauty, thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe happy meerely out of the conceite hee had that other men did for it eſteeme him ſuch: young mens felicity being thought to conſiſt more in other mens opinions than in its proper ſubſtance. Such as ſay that naughty women bewitch men, are not otherwiſe miſtaken than in the manner, for the bodies are waſted away by ſuch things as can naturally weare away or conſume them, but the Will onely feares the Magick of an advantageous beauty, endowed with craft, and enriched with taking qualities.</p>
                  <p>After that the poore Gentleman had layen a long time tormented with the flames of an intollerable paſſion, and that friendſhip was forced to give place to concupiſcence, he ventured to proclaime himſelfe (in a ſilent way) my to-death-enamoured ſervant, but yet with ſuch faire termes, as I could not without proving too-too diſcourteous make any ſhew of being in the leaſt manner therewith diſpleaſed. So as at our next meeting we conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the time and place, where we were to enjoy each other; I being for my owne part in ſuch affaires a mortall enemy of irreſolutions. <hi>Ariobar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zane</hi> ſoone ſpies out our falſe play, and ſo indeed deſired I he ſhould. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there ſnake or ſerpent wrythen up ſo ſuddenly as hee; hee grew pale, leane, and hoarſe, and all in an inſtant, there was not a member of his that waſted and pined not away, onely his bigge-ſwollen eyes flowed with the ſtreames of a perpetuall river of briniſh teares. I could have found in my heart to have pittied him, but that cruelty is the firſt oath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by an infamous woman; the worſt for him was, that he (unfortunate Gentleman) knew not with what lookes to eye me, or what words to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moane himſelfe, ſithence to get him gone lay no more now within the power of his free-will, deſpaire and injury not having as yet looſed him from my fetters: Which admit I had, alas! where or whither could hee have gone? To <hi>Perſia</hi> he durſt not, his conſcience accuſing him, and his long ſojourne convicting him before his Prince to have beene entangled in my love. And againe, elſe-where he had not wherwithall to live, for not having carried with him more than was neceſſary to defray the charge of his returne: Yet could I not (for all that) hold from asking him the cauſe of his melancholy; whereupon he re-aſſuming an hearty courage, ſpake to me in paſſionate angry tearmes, thinking thereby to terrifie me; I (that deſired nothing more) omitted not the opportunity of ſuch an occaſion, but told him, that his ſuſpitions were maligne &amp; falſe, <hi>that</hi> I had done him too much favour and honour, in daigning to love him, and <hi>that</hi> I was now right ſorry I had not knowne him ſooner; <hi>that</hi> if I could recall what was paſt I would moſt willingly doe ſo; ſince inſteed of acknowledging mee the obligations he owed me, he was become ſo ingratefully inſolent, as to threaten me; and that but for the regard of my honour, I would make his ſuſpitions prove true, were it but meerely to ſpite him: Not forgetting to ſtand up on my points of being a Princeſſe, and therefore priviledged to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7474:83"/>
walke in the faire field of my content, without being countermanded by any man: replying a thouſand times the ſelfe-ſame words, to vex him the more. Whereupon he, being of a generous ſpirit, and of as noble a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny as moſt in <hi>Perſia,</hi> having firſt craved mee humble pardon, kneeled downe before me, begging of me with teares and conjurations to grant it him; but ſeeing all nothing availe him, he ſuddenly ſtarts up all-enflamed with choller, and reviles me with the baſeſt injurious tearmes that could be given the arranteſt common ſtrumpet of the Vniverſe, concluding them with ſpitting in my face, and fretting, that he could not in reſpect of my being a woman take a more ample revenge on me.</p>
                  <p>I know not whether by then my diſdaine were not greater than his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie at firſt, which if it were not, yet ſure it could not be leſſe: In the end away hee went, without making any outward ſhew of being any whit grieved, to the end that deſpite and madneſſe might touch me neerer the quick. No ſooner was his backe turn'd, than in came <hi>Erſemeo.</hi> I will not ſtand a particularizing on this buſineſſe any longer, ſeeing that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready but too much encroached upon your noble patience. Briefly then; I, having informed him of thoſe paſſages, and how that <hi>Ariobarzane</hi> was not my husband; and withall that he now was gone a-reviling and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of him (which, God wot, was nothing ſo) he parted from me for the laſt time, and found the other at Court whither he was gone expreſſely to ſeeke him out, thence with a joint conſent they went where they had pointed field, which was a litle without the City walls, where with ſingle ſword-fight they ended their quarrell, by dying both of them in the place; which aſſoone as I heard of, I in this hight of my cruelty clothed my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance with a griefe-expreſſing compaſſion, in a ſolemne mourning weed, celebrating the funerall of <hi>Artobarzane</hi> my reputed husband. Where I both allured and entrapped a thouſand ſilly young Gentlemen, not ſparing to favour the deſires of ſuch of them as beſt liked my fancie; finding change more pleaſing to mee, than diverſity of choyce cates to an <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> pallate: But ſuch was my luck, that growne to bee at length enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in good earneſt, I was miſuſed and impoveriſhed by a young ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift of two and twenty yeares of age. From whom as I thought to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw mee (his prodigality laviſhing my goods, menacing my utter undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:) I was by him (under colour of walking to ſolace us) conducted all alone to ſee the <hi>Pyramides,</hi> where hee left mee in the manner I was found by your Lord and you <hi>Caraſio;</hi> with an intention (I beleeve) to rifle my houſe, and ſeize on the few Iewels hee had left mee unlaviſhed. And this was the reaſon that made mee ſlip away from you, for doubt of comming too late to prevent him. But I by the way fell into the hands of thoſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians,</hi> whence yee of your noble goodneſſe have freed mee, humbly beſeeching you, that as yee had that compaſſion of mee that I deſerve not, ſo you would be benignely pleaſed to permit mee to goe on conſtantly in my determination; which is to goe and end the remnant of my dayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe who retired from the world, are devoted to the ſervice of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Temple.</p>
                  <p>Such was the womans ſtorie, diverſly affected by thoſe that heard her. When upon <hi>Lindaaori's</hi> returning her no word of anſwer, (ſhee having liſtned unto her all the while, ſhee was relating it with a more than paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7474:83"/>
diſdaine, that for not diſcovering her ſex, ſhee muſt have heard her out) <hi>Coralbo</hi> told her, that the Gods called ſinners divers wayes; and that therefore repentance (ſo it were unfained) abſolved the delinquent, and aſſured him of his calling. But come by this time to their Inne, they reſolved to reſt there that night, and to follow the trace of their company the enſuing morning.</p>

By that time ſhee was got within a mile of them, they might perceive her ſtow up her Oares, (the force of her late ſtiffe rowing maintaining yet her courſe) and then might they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſeated in her rich Poope adorned with waving ſtreamers, a Lady and two Knights, all of them of a gentile aſpect, neere about the ſame age, but of different complexions. The one was extraordinarily comely, with ſuch a complexion, as the Sunne is ſometime wont (out of envy) to dye browne with its ſcortching beames; the other went pompouſly triumphant with ſuch beauties as <hi>Aurora</hi> takes oft-times pleaſure, in firſt froſting over with her canded dewes, and then painting with her more lively colours the Rheineberry or full-ripe Cherry; the third not ceding to the other two in blithſome livelihood and feature of body, came (for all that) ſhort of them in the reſt, Nature ſeeming to be deſirous by ſuch variety to put the diverſity of her gifts in conſideration.</p>
                  <p>By this time the two Knights might well perceive, that the Galley
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7474:85"/>
fetch'd them up either to know or haile them; and obſerving the reverence wherewith a number of gallant Gentlemen ſtood before the three, they gheſſed them to be perſonages worthy of their reſpective obſervance; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting them therefore with tearmes reſerved for great ones, they were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded (though in a majeſtick grave manner) with equall courteſie. The browne Knight was the firſt that in a courteous language asked them whence they came; to whom the Count anſwering, from <hi>Sardinia,</hi> hee praid him to tell him, whether he had (as he touched <hi>Parthenope)</hi> heard any thing of the Princeſſe <hi>Corianna;</hi> but being told by the other that he ſtroke not in there; hee then enquired of him touching <hi>Polimero</hi> and <hi>Eromena,</hi> whereunto the Count ſo fram'd his anſwer, that relating him the truth, and ſatisfying him in all the particulars of his demand, hee made no mention either of himſelfe or of the occaſion of his voyage, ſave only telling him, that they were bound for <hi>Athens.</hi> But the three deſirous to entertaine them yet longer, and to be inſtructed in the affaires of the Weſt, (with offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them the towing of their frigat) beſought them to come a-boord their Galley, ſince they were to runne the ſame courſe till they came to the mouth of the <hi>Egean</hi> Sea: Whereunto they (not knowing well how to ſay nay) agreed to get up a-boord her, underſtanding of thoſe that on the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der received them, that one of the three was the Prince of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and the other that of <hi>Cyprus</hi> with his Wife.</p>
                  <p>The two Knights therefore humbled themſelves before them, and then after fell to ſuch diſcourſe as beſt liked them; till ſuch time as come a pretty diſtance from the <hi>Meltacan</hi> Promontory, and about to take leave of them, they might deſcrie on the Iland of <hi>Cithera</hi> a great ſmoake, and ſoone afterwards ſix Galleyes, which launching from out the <hi>Promontory,</hi> came with maine force of Oares a ſcouring towards them. Which ſeene by the Princes, they ſuddenly armed themſelves, commanding (the meane while) their Top-armings and Battlements to be pitched, and their Standart of warre to be <hi>marborated;</hi> faine would they have licenſed the two Knights; but they on the contrary, having cauſed the Frigat to bee looſed off the Galley, and commanded their Marriners to retire her apart, proteſted they would by no meanes abandon the Galley in ſuch an ayde-requiring occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Princeſſe no whit diſmaide (having firſt gathered up her coates) armed her ſelfe with Guiraſſe and Helmet, and then girding her with her Sword, ſhee having commanded a Bow to be made ready for her, made choyce of the Caſtle of the Poope for her place of ſtanding, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to defend it her ſelfe alone; till the <hi>Count</hi> and <hi>Don Elermos</hi> begg'd of her the favour of being received as Guardians of her perſon, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her accepting of, ſhee told them, that ſuch a favour was not worthy the being required with ſo great an hazard, and that ſhee was very ſorry for having taken them out of their <hi>Shallop,</hi> wherein they were not like to light on ſo dangerous an encounter: Vpon theſe complements, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (who had been giving order for the defence) returned with an undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted reſolution rather to dye than yeeld; and ſeeing the valorous Princeſſe ſo clad in glittering Armour, they earneſtly be ſought her to retire her ſelf, which ſhee would not by any meanes condiſcend unto; though ſome from the Maine-top ſhreeked out, that the Galleyes were of <hi>Thrace.</hi> The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had betweene Souldiers and Knights litle leſſe than foure hundred
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7474:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fighting-men, the Galley of three and thirty <hi>banks,</hi> being capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them all; beſides, the Galley-ſlaves being well provided with ſtones and ſlings, the Croſſebow-men with all kinde of ſhafts and ſhot, and the Poope and Prow well furniſhed with Bowes and Pikes.</p>
                  <p>All things requiſite for their defence being in judicious order diſpoſed of, they might ſee the enemies ſeparate one ſingle Galley ſteering directly towards that of the <hi>Princes,</hi> the others reduced into two wings, that ſo ſhe might bee at one and the ſame time aſſayl'd at her Poope, and both her ſides. At their firſt diſuniting they formed the figure of a halfe moone, a litle Frigat appearing in its <hi>concave</hi> rowing before the reſt of the Fleete, they holding water to give her time to paſſe before them. Come neere that ſhee was, there appeares in her an <hi>Herald,</hi> who with his head cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over with a vaile, accoaſting the ſterne of the Galley with a loude and fearefull voyce cries out:</p>
                  <p>Give eare to mee thou great God of Warre, hearken to me thou <hi>Ionian Cretan,</hi> and <hi>Egean</hi> Neptune: Beare me witneſſe yee <hi>Cithera</hi> and <hi>Epla,</hi> yee Stronds of <hi>Laconta</hi> and <hi>Eurota,</hi> and liſten to mee thou <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> I am publick Herald of Prince <hi>Erpandro</hi> of <hi>Phrace,</hi> and come ſent both piouſly and juſtly. <hi>Melianto</hi> Prince of <hi>Cyprus</hi> hath againſt all reaſon taken, ſtolne away, and in <hi>Himeneus</hi> owne preſence raviſhed the great Princeſſe <hi>Deodora</hi> of <hi>Illirio</hi> deſtinated Spouſe to the moſt noble Prince <hi>Erpandro</hi> my Lord and Maſter. By which act of his, he hath violated the bonds of hoſpitality, extinguiſhed anothers funerall-tapers, and diſhonoured a Virgin in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all both divine and humane Lawes. Of thee therefore, I ſay of thee <hi>Melianto</hi> is required that thee not-befitting prey, over thee is immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a thee-befitting puniſhment, and againſt thee is denounced blood, warre, and death. <hi>Melianto</hi> was about to anſwer him, when <hi>Deadora</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to bee pleaſed to leave that office to her, with a bold voyce and firme reſolution returned him this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herald,</hi> goe and tell <hi>Erpandro;</hi> that <hi>Deodora</hi> of <hi>Illirio</hi> was never any Spouſe of his, that the agreement of Fathers forme not marriages, without the conſent of children, <hi>that</hi> by the priviledge therefore both of Law and Nature ſhe is wife to no other than <hi>Melianto,</hi> with whom ſhee volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily parted not for doing, but for not receiving injury: <hi>that</hi> the Gods will prove favourers of his juſt actions, and not puniſhers of thoſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded faults which <hi>Erpandro</hi> falſely layes to his charge. And as for his threats, tell him that <hi>Melianto</hi> hath a ſword ſo keene and well tempered, that it will neither turne edge nor wax blunt, though hee made uſe of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſix times as many: <hi>that</hi> that other daſtardly <hi>Prince</hi> durſt not have in any other manner affronted him, knowing his inferiority to him in Armes, which hee unknightlike endeavours to ſupply no leſſe injuriouſly than baſely with the oddes of men and Armes; yet let him aſſure himſelfe (ſpake ſhee on) that he hath yet one enemy more than hee ever yet made account of; and that's I, who ere he ſhall be his death (as he threatneth to be) will kill him my ſelfe with my owne hands; which if (through fortunes disfavouring) it ſucceede mee not, yet ſhall I not faile howſoever either to take him priſoner, or dye in the attempt. And you (ſaid then the Herald, not knowing the Princeſſe in that habit) that make ſuch an anſwer for <hi>Melianto,</hi> who are you to have authority ſo to ſpeake? I am (anſwered
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7474:86"/>
him ſhee) <hi>Deadora,</hi> which ſithence thou now know'ſt, and haſt heard and ſpoken enough, returne whence thou cameſt, and that quickly too.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Herald</hi> throwing towards the Galley a bloodied Dart, bidding his Oare-men ſtrike amaine, returned crying, oh <hi>Iupiter,</hi> oh <hi>Mars,</hi> oh <hi>Bellona,</hi> yee Gods all of Heaven, Earth, and Hell liſten and heare: Let <hi>Melianto,</hi> an unjuſt Prince, unreaſonable, a raviſher, a violator of quiet and the Law, be this day chaſtiſed and corrected by you. Come to his Lord, he relates unto him both the Princeſſe's anſwer, and the habit he ſaw her in; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he was like to ſwound for griefe, conceiving, that if ſhee were (as ſhee profeſſed to be) married, he had then no reaſon to pretend right in her any more; but examining that ſuch conſiderations were ſecret, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not ſatisfie the world; whereas the rape was a publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared injury, he thought he could not (without prejudice to his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) abſtaine from revenge. Therefore hee boorded the enemy a-prow, cauſing him to be at the ſelfe-ſame time boorded on both the Starbur and Larbur-ſides, and laſt of all a-poope by other five with a mighty force. The aſſaulted ſhip bravely received the ſhock of the foure that ran at her ſides, the poope being aſſured from being endangered by the beake of that Galley which came to offend it, with many ſtraw-mats that were hung downe round about it, which alſo ſerved for a parapet to ſuch as defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it.</p>
                  <p>The quantity of ſlaine-men almoſt equalized the number of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes ſhot in the firſt aſſault; for the <hi>Thracians</hi> (having parted from out their Countrey in Veſſels fitter for pompous ſhew than for fight) had not wherewithall to ſhelter them from the ſhowre of ſhotte, imagining that in reſpect of their number, they ſhould not (in caſe they were neceſſitated to fight) encounter other difficulty than boording their Enemies Galley; ſo as there flew not an arrow from out the aſſayled Galley that either ſlew or wounded not; whereas her men on the contrary were ſo well covered, as they could hardly be any way offended: The eaſieſt places of mounting a-boord her was her prow and poope, her ſides being defended aſwell by her owne as her Enemies Battlements, and <hi>cloſe-fights:</hi> Beſides, if any one endeavoured to clime up that way, 'tweare of the two more likely hee ſhould fall lower than get higher; the Prince of <hi>Pontus</hi> having taken on him the care and charge of keeping the Enemy at diſtance off that part.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Cyprus</hi> ſtanding arm'd on the prow, received the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhock with a greater counterſhock, charging him with the full force of all his Oares; The ſtemmes burſt both alike, but with an unlike effect, that alone being all the prejudice he received; whereas <hi>Erpandro</hi> deprived of the plankes (that being laide athwart the prow ſuſtained his comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants) loſt by that wrack forty of his company betweene Knights and Galley-ſlaves, whereof the greater part were by the weight of the timber, and ſuddaine falling of them one a-top of another either maymed or wounded, he being thereat runne thither himſelfe to defend the entrance, or to ſpeake more properly, to iſſue out through it, thinking that he had by reaſon of his great advantages the victory cock ſure in his owne hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deadora</hi> hearing the terrible craſh of their encounter, and knowing the Enemies could not without great difficulty mount up the poope, (for its being bravely defended by the Count and <hi>Don Eleimos,</hi> ſeconded by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7474:86"/>
of their owne company) haſtily ſhifted off her gowne, and then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming her ſelfe at all peics, ranne to the prore, where forcing <hi>Melianto</hi> to cede her the place, ſhee put herſelfe before him; up ſhee gets on the beake head with an halfe pike in her hand, the Archers playing (the meane while) their parts from above, thence ſhee leapes over into the Enemies Galley, followed by <hi>Melianto,</hi> who was vexed at the heart for this her over-raſh boldneſſe. 'Twas her good luck, that the diſorderly falling downe of the plankes and timber-workes diſordered the Defendants, ſo as they could neither re-unite themſelves, nor ſtand to their ground without treading on ſuch as had beene beaten downe, who lying ſenſeleſſe along and athwart the Decks and Hatches, became a ruinous impediment, otherwiſe ſhee had done enough, if (after making a proffer of her courage) ſhee could have but fairely retired without being wet, conſidering how the Enemies Galley was mann'd with the hardieſt and choyſeſt Knights of all <hi>Thrace.</hi> But <hi>fortune over furthers a bold reſolution;</hi> for, forcing her paſſage onwards, ſhee was followed by fifty reſolute Gentlemen, the greater part whereof abandoning their pikes, conformable to the neceſſity of their enterpriſe, laide about them with their ſwords, with ſuch an undaunted reſolution for gaining the Veſſell, as amazed the <hi>Thracians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deadora</hi> knowing <hi>Erpandro</hi> firſt among the foremoſt, furiouſly flew at him, and after many maine active blowes received and given, ſeeing him yet unwounded, ſhee granſh'd her teeth for meere rage of anger; Now ſhe had one of the beſt mettled and tempered blades that ever was forged or wrought, <hi>Vulcan</hi> himſelfe never made the like; it was formed hooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, of an edge ſomewhat thick, and neere three fingers broad; it would cut an arm'd arme in two, but with a blow fetch'd by ſuch an arme as hers, which made her wonder, that neither her blade nor arme wrought now their wonted effects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Erpandro</hi> was a ſtout Knight, tutered in a good Schoole of Armes, and armed as advantagiouſly as could be; ſince there was not a juyce-affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding herbe, whoſe vertue the Artificer made not uſe of in tempering the Armour he was clad in, onely he was ill-provided of a Sword; for in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a blow, the one halfe thereof burſt off and dropp'd at his feete, whereby his ſword-arme lay open and wounded. Vpon this the Princeſſe was aſſaulted by ſuch as were neereſt her, but by wounding three of them in an inſtant, ſhee freed her ſelfe from out that ſtreight. And now ſeeing the valiant <hi>Melianto</hi> fiercely lay about him to guard her, ſhee goes to ſingle out <hi>Erpandro,</hi> who with a new ſword made towards her to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of her; They aymed both of them at the ſelfe-ſame time at each others head, their blades fortuning to meete edge to edge with the ſelfe-ſame ſucceſſe, onely that of <hi>Deadora</hi> lighted more dangerouſly on the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies helmet, without any apparantly wide gaſh, but yet with ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly-ſmart a ſtroake, that piercing his skull, made him fall at her feete, ſhee therewithall defending her ſelfe from ſuch as endeavoured to recover him with ſuch a furious dexterity, that even thoſe of her owne ſide ſtood in feare of her blowes: here after <hi>Erpandro</hi>'s being ſuddenly put over priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſhee with <hi>Melianto</hi> retired themſelves, giving order to the reſt of her traine to doe the ſame, which accordingly was without any diſorder per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with the pikes in the reare-ward, and the Archers continuing their
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7474:87"/>
ſhot, it ſufficing them to keepe their owne, ſince the acquiring of what was other mens in ſuch a diſparity could not but redound to their prejudice, in reſpect it could not be done without their diſmembring themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The conflict laſted well nigh two houres, their Galley not being fought now withall a-poope and at her ſides, ſave a-farre off, the example of one Galley ſet on fire by a pot-full of an infernall unquenſhable compoſition, deterring the reſt from attempting the boording the enemy, inſomuch as they were forced to retire them, to ſave ſuch as threw themſelves into the ſea to eſcape the devouring fury of the inextinguiſhable wilde-fire; and had indeede retired themſelves for good and all, if the Admiralls fighting men reſolved now to dye, had not for the loſſe of their Prince obſtinately continued the fight; whereupon the reſt of the Fleete, having recovered as many as they could, returned to fight, mounting up the Admirall a-ſterne, to re-man her, whoſe men to the two third parts and more lay ſlain; and taken too ſhee had beene, if <hi>Melianto</hi> had but ſo reſolved; who thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it victory enough to have (without loſing many of his men) gotten the Enemy into his hands, cauſed to be throwne out a certaine fired liquor, which was no ſooner ſhed abroad, than that with a whizzing murmure it fired whatſoever it lighted on; ſuddenly ſpreading it ſelfe, and furiouſly enflaming the matter it fed on, unquenchable either by water or heapes of wet rugges; ſo as it ſoone ſet all the Galley a-fire maugre all that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſave her, the others having enough to doe to ſave the men, whom they tranſported with all the ſpeed they could; But <hi>Melianto</hi> not caring for them, held on his way, the fight being ended by the Princeſſe's valour, and fires violence. Of all his men there were ſlaine but three Knights, and thoſe too in boording the Enemies Galley, in attempting whereof one of them was tumbled downe into the ſea, and there drowned. The wounded were many, among whom were the <hi>Count</hi> and <hi>Don Eleimos</hi> both of them with arrowes, whoſe wounds were more troubleſome though than dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; they had fought ſometimes ſo neere as that they came to puſh of pike, and had burnt this third Galley too, had ſhee not after the example of the others timely retired her ſelfe, ſo as the maligne liquor falling, ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not burning in the water till it was quite conſumed.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſſe that had obſerved the valour of the two Knights, rendred them infinite thankes; the Prince loath to cede to her in gratitude, was carefull to ſee their wounds ſpeedily dreſt, with an intention to take them along with him; but they being bound for elſe-where, praid him to hold them excuſed; and with that making ſignes to the Barke, which then rode neere the Strond of <hi>Peloponeſus</hi> would needs part much againſt the will of the three, who could not perſwade them to accept (at their parting) two Iewels as a ſlender token of their affection: Onely they promiſed to come and ſee them as they paſſed by <hi>Cyprus.</hi> Faine would <hi>Melianto</hi> have enjoy'd their company at his going to viſit <hi>Erpander;</hi> but the Count fearing leſt his voyage (being much hindered already by reaſon of the fight) ſhould be yet more delayed by occaſion of this other buſineſſe excuſed himſelfe (aſſoone as they were come where they were to ſteere a different courſe) by aſſuring him, that the urgencie of his occaſion would by no meanes permit him to make any longer ſtay.</p>
                  <p>Gotten aboord their Frigat they coaſted <hi>Laconia,</hi> where becauſe of a

feaver that ſeized on the Count, and afterwards on <hi>Den Eleimos,</hi> by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their wounds they were forced to ſtop their journey; their diſeaſe ſo augmenting its violence and enfeebling their forces, as they could not part thence for a whole moneths time; their Frigat alſo being already for that reſpect licenced and return'd backe; ſo as when they arrived at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> they found to have beene there the Princeſſe <hi>Eromena</hi> with her daughter, who were gone for <hi>Egypt</hi> foure or five dayes before, to the Count's ſuch exceeding ſorrow and trouble of minde as his tormented thoughts could take no reſt, conceiving that hee juſtly now incurr'd the cenſure of a negligent meſſenger, for having ſo lingred in his voyage ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to an affaire ſo important; now therefore he ſtaid not an houre, but boording a good Veſſell parted with his companion, forced by the windes violence to coaſt <hi>Creete,</hi> and then paſſing from the <hi>Capartian</hi> ſea to that of <hi>Cyprus</hi> they were conſtrained to goe a-ſhore in that Ile, where they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the arrivall of <hi>Melianto</hi> with <hi>Deadora,</hi> and how <hi>Erpandro</hi> affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately honoured of all, was to be the hand-joyner of the wedding couple, without knowing any other particular in that behalfe.</p>
                  <p>Come to <hi>Egypt,</hi> they went to <hi>Memphi</hi> with intention, in caſe they found not <hi>Polimero,</hi> to ſtay for him there, being directed to a Merchant, whom he was of neceſſity to have recourſe unto; but hearing no newes there of him, much leſſe of the Princeſſe, he remain'd thereat exceedingly confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in minde; ſince being parted from <hi>Athens</hi> ſo long before him, they ſhould (by all probable conjecture) have beene there before his comming, and addreſſed themſelves (for further intelligence) to the very ſame place: But this his anxiety of minde laſted but a little, for he no ſooner went to Court, than hee there found them come the day before, though without <hi>Lindadori;</hi> whereat the good old man was ſo exceedingly joyed, that (but for their preventing him) hee had kneeled to kiſſe their hands, with ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly asking for <hi>Donzella Desterrada</hi> his Lady and Princeſſe, whom (as they ſtood relating the accidendall cauſe of their ſeparation) they might ſee enter accompanied with <hi>Coralbo;</hi> her Mother preſently taking her by the hand, and receiving <hi>Coralbo</hi> with the affects of a reſpective eſteeme, (having already underſtood by her husband the ſtory of his diſaſters) and then (for being left to themſelves) they retired them altogether thence to their lodging, with a longing deſire to be enformed reciprocally of each others adventures, where the Count was for his neceſſitated tardance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and <hi>Don Eleimos</hi> affectionately reſpected of all of them, but more eſpecially of <hi>Eromena,</hi> for her extraordinary affection to <hi>Eleina,</hi> of whom he had well deſerved. They reſolved to entertaine themſelves there three or foure dayes, to ſee that great Court, and then to part ſuddenly out of the impatient longing they had to returne into <hi>Sardinia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Court of <hi>Egypt</hi> was (at that time) one of the moſt flouriſhing of the Vniverſe, frequented by brave and doughty Knights, drawne thither formerly by the laſting and victorious enterprizes of King <hi>Ptſemitide,</hi> and at the preſent by his liberality, and by the free carriage and beauty of the Ladies of that Court. Never was there Prince that joyned greatneſſe with familiarity, or familiarity with gravity better than hee; the meere ordinary Guard of his body formed a ſufficient Army; he had five ſeverall orders of Souldiers, and among them three of Nobility and Gentry: the

firſt compoſed of foure <hi>fallanges</hi> of Knights and Gentlemens younger ſonnes, the firſt-borne in <hi>Egypt</hi> as in many other kingdomes, bearing away the whole faculty. Heere, as in <hi>Academy,</hi> in the moſt tranquill and calme peace, was exerciſed <hi>Martiall diſcipline</hi> with as ſtrict order and rigorous obſervance, as others uſe in the ardor of the moſt dangerous warre. They were conſtantly remov'd and changed every three moneths; the novices of them being uſually ſpread over the neighbouring Garriſons, and the other three Regiments in <hi>Memphi</hi> warding the City and Pallace royall: From this Seminary ſprung Captaines, Camp-maſters, and ſometimes even <hi>Generalls</hi> themſelves. Of the other foure, two were Knights, the one of the new and the other of the old Band, who gloried to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to their loyaltie in peace, &amp; valour in warre, the ſacred perſon of their Royall Soveraigne. The fourth of Halberdiers clad with the Royall device, and ſo many in number as reached divided into two files on either hand along the ſtaires, and all the way from the <hi>grand portall</hi> to the great Hall.

The Queenes ſide (on the other part) being no leſſe numerous and frequented, her Chamber of preſence never empty, to <hi>Cavaliers</hi> and Ladies never ſhut, ſo as the whiſpering noyſe of ſo many ſoftly-ſpeaking tongues might bee aptly reſembled to that humming the Bees make in their Hives at ſuch time as they are moſt buſied in working of their Honey.</p>

That Court then was (in reſpect both of it ſelfe and the nature of its Prince) the moſt joyfull and amorous of as many as ever were; many ſonnes had hee, but by wedlock onely the Prince then a babe, and one daughter, whoſe towardly nature and ſweete diſpoſition was not equalled by any in that great Monarchie. Shee paſſed not much fifteene years of age, yet had ſhee an aged-ſeeming (becauſe well experimented) ſpirit in the more worthy perfections, ſucked almoſt with her breſt-milke by perpetuall converſation of refined wits, and her onely delight of various reading, wherein ſhe conſumed her houres with a guſt that exceeded her age &amp; ſex.</p>

nor <hi>Coralbo,</hi> who comming likewiſe to ſee him, were met by the others, and ſo left the Court to be private together, as was told you. There dwelt neere to their lodging an ancient Knight, who obſerving the two couple, (that though unknowne, manifeſted yet their greatneſſe by their exterior qualities) would needs (courteous as he was) goe viſit them; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that their being ſtrangers obliged him thereunto; for his quality, he was a great Souldier, favoured by the King for his valour, and therefore highly eſteemed of all the Court; and underſtanding that they knew no body, he would needs preſent them before the King, who received them without any diſtinction, taking them all for Knights, obſervantly eying (though) their youth and beauty, whereof hee ſaw no paragon in all the Court: Hee ſtood diſcourſing with them in Greeke for a good while, and (as one quick-ſighted in diſcerning of perſons) ſuddenly judged the foure younger to be of no ordinary quality; which made him very deſirous that the <hi>Queene</hi> might ſee them; nay more, he would needs bring them in himſelfe, an unwonted favour done to none ſave <hi>Princes;</hi> and ſo taking <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limero</hi> by the hand, hee drew all the reſt after him, thoſe Lodgings being ſo full, that two could hardly paſſe a-breſt through them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queene</hi> was ſeated at her beds-feete with her daughter by her ſide, accompanied with foure Princeſſes of the Blood-royall, encircled with many Lords ſtanding about them; when <hi>Eromena</hi> preſented her ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, <hi>Polimero</hi> dexterouſly drawing back to give her the honour of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedencie. They were by her received all of them with royall courteſie, <hi>Elitrea</hi> the Princeſſe following her example in honouring them, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding it with <hi>Lindadori.</hi> Shee liked well thoſe like-her-owne tender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent beauties, and a well-becomming careleſſe carriage of hers, which made her ſo heede her, that ſuperficially paſſing over the reſt, ſhee taking her for a Knight, deſired to entertaine her alone, whileſt the Queene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanged complementall courteſies with <hi>Eromena,</hi> with the very ſame both beliefe and affection.</p>
                  <p>The King (after having jeaſted a ſhort while with ſome of the Ladies) retir'd him thence, and the two indeede Knights, (obſerving the Queene and Princeſſe their prodigious inclination towards the two maskers) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew themſelves apart, as it were, for good manners ſake with the foure Princeſſes of the blood, who received them with exceeding great courteſie.</p>

                     <hi>Eromena</hi> upon diſcovering of the Queenes minde, knew not well what countenance to frame; ſhee anſwered to the demands ſhee made her with that extraodinary grace, which the Heavens had with extraordinary pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge granted her above all other women. <hi>Lindadori</hi> being ſimple, and in ſuch affaires a <hi>novice,</hi> (not building on others fancies, but altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent about the well-repreſenting of a mans perſon) marveiled at the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes and carriage of the young Princeſſe; in whom beſides a more than ordinary courteſie, ſhee obſerved a more than uſuall freeneſſe and elſe-where-unknowne liberty, gravity in that Countrey being reputed an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection or defect, or at leaſt taken for a dependant if not a ſiſter of ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenneſſe, pride, and ſubjection. The preſence of ſo great a Queene, which elſe-where would have clos'd up all lips with ſilence, and engraven in all hearts a modeſt mellancholy, was here a motive to apparant joy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.

There is no choyce without ſome kinde of equality, how then can I make choyce of any other in your preſence, without notable ſtupidity and weakneſſe of judgement? Or admitting you were not preſent, doe you hold me to bee ſo freed from the obligation of your love, as that any other canallure me? I know it ſtands us upon to wend us hence aſſoone as we conveniently can, ſo as I ſtand indeede upon thornes (as it were) all the while I ſtay heere; but alas! how can we yet goe for ſhame? ſhall wee ſneake away like fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, ingratefull to our courteous entertainers, and not without being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected that ſuch our reſolution ſprung from cowardiſe and feare of trying our ſelves in Armes with theſe Knights? For <hi>Lindadori</hi> your reaſons were indeede conſiderable, if the nature whereof ſhee is compoſed were like that of other Girles, for you know, that ſhee is an inexorable Enemy, not onely to ſuch a Schoole, but even to all man-kinde; ſo as I pray God that we may ever perſwade her to like of any husband; all which <hi>Eromena</hi> knew to be moſt true: Wherefore it was betweene them agreed, (aſſoone as the next <hi>Tourney</hi> was ended, which the Knights of that Court uſed to exerciſe twice a moneth) to goe on their intended journey.</p>
                  <p>But among all the actors on this amorous ſcene, <hi>Coralbo</hi> (good Prince) was that onely one, who in appearance free, was yet more than any other muzled and puzled with the occult love that he bare the fierce <hi>Deſterrada.</hi> Paſſe there did many an amorous complement and pleaſing diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and the Princeſſe of <hi>Cirene,</hi> whom he well perceived to bee well enclined towards him; nor would he have ſlighted ſuch a fortune, but that the finding himſelfe under the lee of thoſe three, with whom, for his pretenſions ſake, it behooved him to comply, made him abhorre that congreſſe, for doubt of irrecoverably falling. Now <hi>Coralbo</hi> never loved but in one ſole place at once; and being oncetyed, he could never more looſe himſelfe; yet was he never (for all that) ſo overſhot, as to offer his

body to pine away, or ſympathize with the conſumption of a captivated ſpirit, as being no whit ambitious of loyaltie in love, a vertue (in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit) mellancholike, and beſeeming ſuch whyning fellows as take a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſighing; or ſuch Poets whoſe blunt fancies muſt bee whetted with griefe, ere they can pitch on a well-reliſhing conceit.

                     <hi>Bramac</hi> had corrupted a ſervant of <hi>Coralbo</hi>'s Mothers, by whom hee came to be advertized of all that ever ſhee did, delivering his letters unto a poſte that came clad in ragges and patches a-begging to her doore for Gods ſake. This man diſcovering him to be <hi>Coralbo</hi> (though ſomewhat too late by reaſon of the <hi>Queene</hi>'s concealing him as long as poſſibly ſhe could) avertized thereof <hi>Bramac,</hi> in a time that hee could no way harme him: who now hearing that hee was to part ſuddenly, ſpeeded away inſtantly certaine choyce men to murther him, and with them a Knight, with order to goe (in caſe they lighted not on him) to <hi>Memphi,</hi> and there demand him in his name of <hi>Piſemitide.</hi> They accordingly came, but yet a day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Coralbo</hi>'s parting, ſo as making yet ſure account to ſurprize him by the way, they followed him with all poſſible diligence. But his meeting with the two Princeſſes, the fight, and his purſuing the runne-away theeves that led him out of his way, was the occaſion that they both miſſed and came to <hi>Memphi</hi> before him.</p>
                  <p>The Knight that had the letters and charge of Embaſſie, thought the delivery thereof bootleſſe before he were aſcertained of his being there; but not finding him (whom he was perſwaded hee ſhould know both by counter-ſignes, and by his likeneſſe in favour to his Mother of him very well knowne he imagined that his loſing of the way was the cauſe of his ſo long tarrying, which put him in a conceit of remounting on horſe-back to goe meete him, aſſured hee ſhould doe his Maſter a more acceptable piece of ſervice in ſo murthering him, than in requiring him of <hi>Ptſemitide;</hi> yet this his determination was hindered by two obſtacles, which were the diſſerviceableneſſe of his owne horſes (that lay diſtended in the ſtable ſo tired, as they were not able to ſtand on their legges) and the doubt of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by the way: Whilſt then he thus ſtood irreſolved whether courſe to take, ſending in the meane while to enquire after him over all the Innes of <hi>Memphi,</hi> (a bootleſſe diligence for a private man in a City peopled with five millions of men) he might two dayes after ſee him with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions kiſſe the Kings hand, knowing among them <hi>Polimero</hi> by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſignes given him, though none of the reſt, wherefore at the inſtant of <hi>Ptſemitides</hi> returne from the Queene's to his owne lodgings, he with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting his letter, opens him his Embaſſage; whereupon he (the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Prince of his time) enflamed with anger, thus beſpeakes him.</p>
                  <p>I will (my friend) excuſe thee for being but an Embaſſadour, in diſcharge of whoſe office thou maiſt not but obey him that ſends thee, but for which I would inflict on thee ſuch a chaſtiſement, as might ſerve for a deterring example to all ſuch as dare require of a Prince of my quality, things not

onely unjuſt, but alſo unworthy. Tell <hi>Bramac</hi> that I was borne King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and if I acquired other Crownes, the world knowes I uſurped them not, but both wonne and hold them by the imperiall Law of my victorious blade, ever an enemy to guile and treachery; which I never elſe-where read of than in the legend of his life and actions. And that therefore <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralbo</hi> (naturall and true Prince of <hi>Arabia)</hi> ſhall be by me not only denied him, but alſo ſo protected, as that I will for his ſake declare my ſelfe his enemy, both to chaſtiſe him for his raſh judgement made of me, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to the true and rightfull <hi>Queene</hi> and to her ſonne apparant heire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the kingdome which he ſo injuriouſly and contrary to all Lawes uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Now for thee, get thee from out our preſence and that quickly too, nor allow I thee any longer time to abide in <hi>Memphi,</hi> than the unexpired piece of this day. This ſaid, hee turnes his back and goes towards the Queene's lodgings thinking to finde there <hi>Coralbo</hi> with his company; but finding them gone ere he came, he cauſed to be made ready two ſumptuous Chariots, commanding the Lord of <hi>Peluſio</hi> to goe fetch them to Court, without making any ſpeech of the Embaſſadour, but telling them from him, that in reſpect of their being ſtrangers and of Countries thence farre remote, and reſiding now in a Countrey where the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue was not elſe-where ſpoken than in Court, he would be their hoſte himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The foure Princes were even a-going to ſit them down to ſupper, when the Embaſſie arrived; which they conſtrued to proceede from the Queene and two Princeſſes of <hi>Bernice</hi> and <hi>Cirene,</hi> rather than from the King; which notwithſtanding <hi>Polimero</hi> yeelded ſuch humble thankes, and uſed ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent language, as befitted ſo great a Monarch and courteous a Prince, with beſeeching the Lord of <hi>Peluſio</hi> to tell him, if the command were diſpenſeable till the following morning; but hee proteſting hee was ſent thither with expreſſe order to come and conduct them to Court preſently, they willingly obeyed.</p>
                  <p>The Noble man thought to give <hi>Coralbo</hi> the firſt place, as knowing who he was; but ſeeing the reſpect which he in his demeanour bare to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three, he imagined that either they were alſo great Princes, or elſe that they knew him not; this conjecture of his being confirmed by his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſame all the way, and withall in the two women-ſignes that bred in him a doubt whether they were men or not. Come that they were to the Pallace and aſcended the ſtaires, they marveyled at the glorious ſight of the number of Nobility they there ſaw, the King having ſent to meete them the greateſt Lords of the Court, and comming himſelfe from out his withdrawing Chamber in perſon to receive them: To whom <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limero</hi> was about in a reſpectively-complementall way to expreſſe their gratefull engagement for ſo high a favour and great honour done them; when hee taking by the hand <hi>Coralbo,</hi> whom by the counter-ſignes given him he knew, thus ſmilingly beſpake him.</p>
                  <p>And is it thus indeede, that you without any ſafe conduct come into my Territories my Lord Prince of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and thinke to be here unknowne? At theſe words <hi>Coralbo</hi> (good Prince) remained aſtoniſhed, for not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what ſenſe to interpret them, and had (but for his mothers having that authenticke protection which ſhee had) made the worſt conſtruction thereof; although the fame of the Kings generous diſpoſition and noble-mindedneſſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7474:91"/>
made him conceive them ſomewhat neerer their right ſenſe; yet ſtood hee a good while muſing what anſwer to make, irreſolved whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee were beſt confeſſe himſelfe to be ſuch or not: which <hi>Ptſemitide</hi> obſerving; You need not Prince (ſpake he then on) conceale your ſelfe from mee, who will be to you not onely a friend, but a father too, which you ſhall ſee by reall effects. <hi>Coralbo</hi> at theſe words kneeling before him, would needs have therefore kiſſed his hand; but he not ſuffering him to abide in that ſubmiſſive poſture ſuddenly rais'd him up, who having by this time regain'd his breath and courage, return'd him this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Royall Sir, I deny me not to be <hi>Coralbo,</hi> but well affirme, that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty hath in two words ſo obliged me, that I am ſo far from denying you my name, as I'le not deny you my life, ſo fortune made me ſo happy as to ſpend it in your Majeſties ſervice. The King upon this (after having againe embraced him) reaccounted unto him openly <hi>Bramac</hi>'s embaſſie with his anſwer, and then proceeded. I will endeavour to re-acquiſt you the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or dye in the attempt; the deferring whereof ſhall bee no longer than till the getting together the forces neceſſary for ſuch an enterprize. <hi>Coralbo</hi> was ſo confuſed in minde (or rather ſo tranſported beyond him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) at this ſo unthought of good fortune, as he could not hit on language ſuitable to his beholdingneſſe. When the King obſerving that his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions comprehended with no ſymptome of ſtrangenes this title of Prince, withdrawing him aſide, asked him who they were. <hi>Coralbo</hi> (to whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the truth ſeemed a tearme of ingratitude, and againe the diſcovering it (he knew) could not but diſguſt them his highly-honoured friends) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: I cannot ſay (Sir) that I know them not, but I well know that they would not bee knowne; therefore I referre it to your Majeſties diſcreete conſideration to command me what your royall pleaſure is I ſhould doe; I pray you (replied he againe ſmiling) tell it me howſoever, and I promiſe you it ſhall be from all elſe kept as ſecret as if you had never told me of it. But then at hearing it, his aſtoniſhment was ſuch, as it almoſt made him breake his word: Willingly would hee have knowne then preſently the ſtory and occaſion of their comming thither, but that doubting of their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice thereof, he remitted it till after ſupper. And now whileſt the Courtiers ran to kiſſe <hi>Coralbo</hi>'s hand, he thence retiring himſelfe with the two Princeſſes and <hi>Polimero,</hi> thus greetes them.</p>
                  <p>I doubt me (worthy Sir) yee have judged me diſcourteous, for having (by being ſo long in preſenting my honoured reſpects to the Prince of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia)</hi> neglected my obſervance to you, for which I beſeech you to excuſe me, and withall to command in this houſe ſuch entertainment and ſervice as beſt likes you. <hi>Polimero</hi> who at firſt upon <hi>Coralbo</hi>'s being diſcovered was exceedingly confuſed in minde, but afterwards at his hope-ſurpaſſing good fortune beyond expreſſion joyfull, anſwered him: Mighty Sir, your Majeſty cannot be moved to ſay thus to us otherwiſe than by your royall courteſie, whereby you have obliged all that knew you; the favours and honours we receive ſo exceedingly beyond all degrees of exceedingneſſe ſurpaſſe the meanneſſe of our merits, as they argue that your Majeſties benignity after a long conteſtation with your greatneſſe, is become in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very reſpect its equall: Beſides, that the favours you doe the Prince of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia</hi> is ſo well employed, as your Majeſtie could never conferre them
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7474:91"/>
on a more deſerving perſonage. The King ſtedfaſtly beheld the two ſhee-warriers with great delight, affecting naturally both beauty and valour; nor was it now difficult for him by the inkling before given him to diſcern their ſex, which taking on him he did not though againſt his will: Your aſpects (anſwered hee) are ſuch as ſpeake you worthy of my more reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive obſervance, I ſhould be loath to one paſt errour to adde many grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and therefore I pray you tell me who yee are, that I may the better know how to ſuite your entertainment to your quality; your endeered friendſhip and intimate familiarity with the Prince of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and your having knowne him for ſuch before (as I am induced to beleeve by your not marveyling at my naming him by his title) perſwade me, that you are his equalls if not ſuperiours. At this <hi>Eromena</hi> bluſh'd, and doubting leſt her husband ſhould by importunity bee wrought to tell him what they were, ſhee anſwered:</p>
                  <p>Be your Majeſty (we beſeech you) pleaſed to lay apart ſo high an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſuch meane Gentlemen as wee be; we are ('tis true) Knights er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and that is the greateſt quality we can aſſume or ever aſpire unto: If upon underſtanding what till then we knew not of the Prince of <hi>Arabia,</hi> we made no preſent demonſtration of our joy and duty, it was not becauſe we knew him before, but to afford others the more ample commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of doing him congratulating offices, which (wee preſum'd) wee could not miſſe of at his more privacie and leiſure, our travelling together and long converſation having (we thanke his benigne goodneſſe) made us ſomewhat familiar.</p>
                  <p>The King well knew the Princeſſe's minde, and as one that never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed Lady, would not diſpleaſe her; but turned his diſcourſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubject. And then aſſoone as <hi>Coralbo</hi> was ridde of his complementall cumber, he led them all to the <hi>Queene;</hi> who already informed of <hi>Coralbo</hi>'s beeing, expreſſed much joy thereat, all the other Princeſſes doing the ſame, but that of <hi>Cirene</hi> more than all the reſt. And then after ſupper (where their bodies were not ſo much refreſh'd with foode, as their mindes ſollaced with mirth &amp; pleaſing diſcourſes) they were accommodated with Lodgings conformable to the quality of the hoaſt, and greatneſſe of the Inne. And in the night-time their Chambers being neere adjoyning (as they deſired they ſhould be) <hi>Eromena</hi> perſwaded her husband to a ſuddain departure, ſhewing him, that to ſtay for jouſts was but a reaſon vaine, and capable of entangling them in endleſſe affaires.</p>
                  <p>The day being come, <hi>Polimero</hi> renewes his congratulating joyes with <hi>Coralbo,</hi> that fortune had declared her ſelfe ſo favourable unto him for the recovery of his ſtate, with expreſſing how ſorry he was that he could not be in his owne perſon a partaker in that ſervice, the affaires of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and his father-in-lawes infirmity neceſſarily requiring his ſpeedy returne home. <hi>Coralbo</hi> (that had before-hand beene fully enformed of all) anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him. That on the contrary he was right ſorry, that he could not ſerve him in <hi>Sardinia</hi> according as he had once purpoſed; howbeit hee hoped (upon fortune's favouring him, with a little vacancie from his affaires, to which he was for the preſent neceſſitated to attend, more for honours ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction than for any great liſt he had thereunto) to finde a time to come in perſon to make a reall expreſſion of his mindfulneſſe of the obligations
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7474:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he ſtood bound to him in. The courteſies were of both ſides reciprocall, entertwyned by thoſe of <hi>Eromena,</hi> who earneſtly beſought <hi>Coralbo</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them ſpeedy leave to depart, which conformably followed to the amazement of all the Court, and paſſing ſorrow of the Queene, her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and <hi>Berenice.</hi> The King privately enformed by <hi>Coralbo</hi> of the urgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of their occaſions, without making ſhew that he knew any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, was content to let them goe on their way. Onely <hi>Coralbo</hi> above all others felt extreame griefe at this ſeparation; I make no mention of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affections, of the words and offers of the three pretended-ſhe-lovers, of the promiſes of returne and well-carried diſſimulations of the two ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warriers, accompanied a good part of their way by <hi>Coralbo,</hi> who had paſt on further too, if they had permitted him. Stammer out then hee did ſome ſervice-intimating complements to <hi>Lindadori,</hi> by her rather heard than conceived. From <hi>Polimero</hi> and the reſt the period of his parting-farewell was rather ſilence than any complement. Come to the Sea-ſhore, they imbarked themſelves for <hi>Cyprus,</hi> a Courſe though ſomewhat more giring, yet more ſecure than the ſhorter cut; whereof the Count of <hi>Bona</hi> was very glad, making an account of informing himſelfe there, of the particular ſucceſſes of Prince <hi>Melianto.</hi> But there was thereof no neede, there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning to bee aboord the ſhip they were in, a Gentleman of that Court, bound thither, who being asked what newes ſtirr'd in thoſe parts, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; that <hi>Cyprus</hi> was now the joyfulleſt kingdome in the world, ſithence that alliance which was thought to prove the occaſion of bloody warre, was now growne to bee an indiſſoluble knot of unexpected friendſhip. Whereupon <hi>Eromena</hi> ſeeming to be deſirous to underſtand the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, the Gentleman courteouſly correſponds her deſire in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Illirium</hi> a moſt warlike kingdome hath for King one call'd <hi>Ormando,</hi> a Prince many degrees above his predeceſſors both vertuous and excellent. The feates of Armes he performed whileſt he was a young man, afforded rich matter both to poeſie and ſtory; And now that he is become old, his prudence and juſtice give yet a greater light to States-men; who gathering from out this one <hi>Prince</hi>'s life, ſo many caſes to judge by, and ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to governe by, apparantly ſaw, that the world had now no more neede of any other exquiſite patterne for the well-governing of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, and Idealty of Princes; his kingdome being ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and his perſon ſuch a really-formed Prince, as others endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to forme imaginarily. Acquired he had (before his comming to the Crowne) an infinite number of Countries, which (for being farre remote from our parts) have names that never came to our knowledge, excepting ſome of the leſſe diſtant and more famous of them, as thoſe of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> the <hi>Dardans,</hi> the <hi>Triballs,</hi> the <hi>Sarmats,</hi> the <hi>Bohemenians, Ruſsians,</hi> and others in the large-extending Territories of vaſte <hi>Germany,</hi> to whom he gave both Princes and liberty; content (in memory of his Victories) onely to tye them to ſpeake for ever the <hi>Illirian</hi> tongue. Hee fortuned (whilſt hee was a Knight-errant) to become enamoured of <hi>Arnelinda</hi> Princeſſe of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who (though already promiſed in marriage to <hi>Arbon</hi> King of <hi>Pontus</hi> (a fierce young Prince) could not yet chooſe but love him, whoſe geſtures, diſpoſition, and preſence were meanes but too potent to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7474:92"/>
force her will. But ſhee (being among all the Virgins that ever <hi>Minerva</hi> nurſt the moſt conſtant in good actions) one day that hee made bold to ſpeake to her of love, thus wrothfully checked him.</p>
                  <p>Your words <hi>(Prince Ormondo)</hi> make me now perceive, you are not that good Prince you are taken for; ſeeing you, that of mine (as being a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins) honour ſhould be a defender, are that only he that attempts its bane, and that (by undermining it) goes about to deſtroy and ruine it: Alas! I have not any Knights to defend me: Defend you mee then againſt your ſelfe. I am already a married wife, and that you well know too: Seeing then you ſinne not through ignorance, 'tis certaine you doe it out of malice. What is it (I would faine know) that you pretend of mee? Seeme (I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) either my behaviour or fame ſuch in your prejudicating eyes, as might ſuggeſt in your undermining heart ſo outragious a preſumption? Or though it ſo were, that you loved me unfainedly, and that (through my ill fortune) I lov'd you too; yet what comfort, nay what hopes of comfort could out deſires have, that can prove otherwiſe than treaſon and ſhame unto me, and treachery and ſhame unto you? It will then be the leſſer evill, that (for not tormenting me) you retire your ſelfe. Fortune, you ſee, hath beſtow'd me upon another; ſithence then be yours I cannot, you muſt bee content that you cannot be mine neither. At theſe words <hi>Ormondo</hi> remain'd aſtoniſhed; perceiving himſelfe in an inſtant to be (ere he was aware thereof) beloved; and yet againe in the very ſame moment of time (contrary to loves nature) refuted. But the property of generous hearts being inclinable rather to hope than feare, he returned her this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Right excellent Madame, as my words aymed no way at your preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, ſo ſhall my actions tend ever to your ſervice: And though I bee not for the preſent a crown'd King as is that of <hi>Pontus,</hi> yet am I to be one day ſuch by the order of nature, and of ſuch a kingdome too, that (as I may without any vaunting ſay) <hi>Pontus</hi> and tenne ſuch cannot equall it. Of the perſons I meane not to make compariſons: But if there be no other worth or good that makes for me, than the courteous inclination to me-wards, which to my good hap I diſcover in you; yet ſhall that alone ſufficiently ſerve my turne to merit you in your owne judgement, and yet much more in the judgement of others for its depriving them of all merit: I want, and ſeeke for a wife my ſelfe too, and marriages are written in heaven, the prime Article of whoſe Law is, that the married couple be thereunto vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily conſenting. Therefore although I ſay not that the King of <hi>Pontus</hi> is not worthy of you, conſidering his noble conditions; yet will I boldly affirme, that he cannot be juſtly your husband, in caſe you thereof are not contented otherwiſe than in obeyſance of others. I (Madame) never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a thought of motioning love unto you, otherwiſe than in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and honourable way. And ſo to doe both your fame and conditions emboldened me, yea that fame, which (to your paſſing glory) ſounds a ſingular note of excellency in the eares of all men, and theſe conditions which ſerve for a norme and patterne for all the Princeſſes and women of the earth to forme their lives and actions by; for but for your being ſuch, I had ne're fixt on you an affectionate eye. Moreover, although (I grant) that your beauty and outward feature have force to violent hearts, yet may there be, for all that, a heart arm'd againſt them, &amp; penetrable only by the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7474:93"/>
Armes of innocence and internall purity. Againe, for me to get me gone without you is altogether impoſſible: You ſay you are married, and yet (I know) you are not; the Embaſſadours of <hi>Pontus</hi> and your father had no authority to binde you; you onely are ſhee that makes up the Matrimony, and ſhee that may chooſe and refuſe to make it; The parts thereof are yet both in their entire, and both free: The bonds of the two Lawes, Humane and Divine, though they be made ready to binde you, have not bound you yet though, ſo as they cannot be thereby any way infringed. A true and lawfull Matrimony indeede it would be, that you accepting mee for your ſervant and husband, would vouchſafe to bleſſe mee by pronouncing one ſingle voluntary <hi>Yea;</hi> that then I might aſcertaine you, that the hopes you pleaſe to build on me are neither vaine nor ruinous.</p>
                  <p>Humane inclinations were ever ſubject to perſwaſions. The Princeſſe who meerely for <hi>Ormondo</hi>'s fame was in ſome ſort enamoured of him ere ever ſhee ſaw him, now after ſeeing him accompanied with ſo many ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues (ſo excellently-excelling, as onely one of them was able to dignifie and make worthy any <hi>Cavalier</hi> whatſoever) became ſo enflamed with love of him, that the Matrimony contracted ſeemed a hell to her, wherefore doubting whether ſhee ſhould ever more light on the like occaſion, her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection being already unvail'd, ſhee deem'd it beſt to unvaile alſo her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; fetching then a deepe ſigh that intimated the as yet doubtfulneſſe of her hopes, ſhee thus beſpeakes him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Illirio;</hi> I render you not thankes for your love, as according to the cuſtome of the times I ſhould doe, becauſe I like not the being an affectate follower of the common ſtile; I follow mine owne, and have (as I conceive) my reaſon for it; knowing that who ſo loves, loves for his owne affections ſake, ſo as the obligations and reciprocall duties ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementally profeſſed amongſt friends, are words meerely ſuperfluous, and tearmes and names unfit to bee uſed. Touching now what you offer me, I am perſwaded you doe it not, without having firſt examined the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of the enterprize with your dangers and their conſequences: Let me now then ſee in caſe I pronounced your deſired <hi>Yea,</hi> what (for the leſſe dangerous) courſe would you take to have me? Whereto <hi>Ormondo</hi> all-joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full anſwered; The uſuall courſe (Madame) in ſuch caſes throughout all the world. The Prince of <hi>Thrace</hi> my Couzen will lend mee his Galley, which is one of the ſwifteſt that ever furrowed the Ocean. Come once but to ſet footing in <hi>Illirico,</hi> I then feare not all the powers of the world; for your Father and Brother, they will (I perſwade my ſelfe) be glad upon comprehending the exchange you have made of a litle King for a great kingdome: And for <hi>Arbone</hi> I conceive no occaſion you have to feare him. <hi>Arnelinda</hi> would not reſolve of any thing for that preſent, but tooke time to thinke thereon, which ſerved for an <hi>item</hi> for the now halfe-promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bride-groome to prepare himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ormondo</hi> was then come from the Eaſterne parts with an intent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne homewards; but paſſing from <hi>Phenicia</hi> to <hi>Cyprus</hi> hee there chanced to finde <hi>Serpidoro</hi> Prince of <hi>Thrace</hi> his Cozen german, with whom hee being bred up from a childe, and both of them having learnt the exerciſes of Chivalry together, there ſprung from this their converſation a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which tranſcended the love of blood, the ſtrongeſt tye of the moſt
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7474:93"/>
part of kinſmen, which gave to as many as knew them an example of an illimited love without paragon. Now <hi>Serpidoro</hi> had (after having given the chaſe to ſome veſſels of pirates which he afterwards tooke in the <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Sea) heard of the neighbouring nuptialls in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> whither he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon retired with one ſole Galley, (having ſent the reſt home) with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to trie himſelfe in Armes at the Tourney; where finding (beyond his expectation) his endeer'd Cozen <hi>Ormondo,</hi> they both reſolved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the liſts againſt all the adventurers of the jouſts. But this new amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous congreſſe ſet their braines a working on new deliberations, <hi>Serpidoro</hi> cauſing (upon <hi>Ormondo</hi>'s ſcarce opening of his mouth) his Galley to bee new-calk'd and rigg'd, with giving ſpeciall order, that nothing ſhould bee wanting her, that might any way make her more uſefull and ſerviceable to ſteed his friend. <hi>Senesteo</hi> King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and more than hee the Prince <hi>Ortomano</hi> his ſonne, enamoured of the qualities and faire diſpoſition of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondo</hi> did him all imaginable honour, not without repining though too late, that it had not fallen to their lot to have had him inſteede of <hi>Arbone,</hi> now that they perceived him ſomewhat affectionately enclined to <hi>Arne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda:</hi> Love [the fire of the minde] being hardly ſmothered, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not unlike the elementall fire, which if it flame not muſt needs ſmoake.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſſe aſſoone as <hi>Ormondo</hi> was parted from her, ſummoned all her thoughts before the tribunall of her judgement, the maine ſubject of her conſideration in her caſe was the ſole point of honour, the arguments about which were great, but all ſolved by the title of Matrimony: For her father, ſhe imagined that he being diſcreete, would not be diſpleaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at; not becauſe children ſtolne away eaſe their fathers of their duty of caring or doing for them (ſuch being onely a ſhake-off excuſe and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of baſe and ſervile-minded people) but becauſe the affinity with ſo great a King might ſteed him very much; beſides, the having of ſo valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Prince for his ſonne-in-law, of whom hee might promiſe himſelfe more than of the King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> whoſe foole-hardy raſhneſſe could not but ſtirre up ſuſpicion in him and in her feare and terrour: A diſcourſe wholly tending to the ſubſtance, ſince ſhee could not light on any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition touching any outward apparance, feature or, demeanour; ſhee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiting, that no other man than <hi>Ormondo</hi> could ever make her happy; that no other than he deſerved the <hi>Epithet</hi> of handſome, proper, and well-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riaged; that no face, ſpeech, or behaviour could be eſteeme-worthy or gracefull, that either in aſpect, accent, or manners any thing differed from his. In briefe, ſhee conceived, that in him alone was comprehended all humane good, wherein though ſhee indeed was not much deceived, yet concludes, that not (for all that) ſhee could not bee beguiled, as for the moſt part are deceivable all ſuch Matrimonies whoſe ends are venery and luſt, ſuch not eiyng but where they like: For, pleaſure being an enemy to the privation of it ſelfe, abhorres the ſight of the unlovely parts, for not being conſtrain'd to loathe them; and hath for feeding that its humour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually fixed on the lovely parts more eyes than <hi>Argos,</hi> but is to the lothſome ones ſtarke blinde; Or if he hood-wink'd ſee any of them, hee may then chafe and fret, and perhaps perſwade himſelfe to bee miſtaken, but not have the power to diſolve any part of his beloved object; ſo as the thought there of either flies away like a bird, or vaniſheth like a ſpirit: For
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7474:94"/>
her brother ſhee ſaw no probability of his diſliking her choyce, whom ſhe knew hee tendred deerely, as being to <hi>Arbone</hi> no whit, but to <hi>Ormondo</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inclined. After all which conſiderations, her reſolution was, to get her thence, ſo ſhe might but doe it without danger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ormondo</hi> (that thought that no time to loſe time) fail'd not to come the day following to viſit her; and having obtain'd his deſired <hi>Yea,</hi> calling unto him the Prince of <hi>Thrace,</hi> who ſtood apart entertaining the Ladies, hee unnoted of any other, eſpouſed her in his preſence, and then inſtantly propoſeth the plot of taking her away that very night, which accordingly ſo happily ſucceeded, that no living ſoule either perceived or ſuſpected it.</p>
                  <p>The carefull <hi>Serpidoro,</hi> having lodg'd the bride-couple a-bed, ſail'd on with all diligence all the night long, ſo as the following morning hee was got ſo farre, as that they could now no more deſcrie the beloved <hi>Cyprus.</hi> The faire <hi>Arnelinda,</hi> though exceedingly content with her Bridegroome, was yet a litle diſcontent, or at leaſt penſive for what ſhe had done, a kinde of repentance, (if ſo it may bee call'd) counterfeite and fained. The conſideration of the likelihood of her being talked of and cenſured, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left her father, and unmarried and remarried againe at her pleaſure, vext her to the very heart. For ought elſe ſhee was ſo farre from repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that if ſhee had beene yet to doe it, ſhee would have done it againe &amp; againe, although in doing it ſhee had hazarded much more than ſhee did. <hi>Ormondo</hi> joyes her, and <hi>Serpidoro</hi> cheeres her up, and does her all loving offices as tenderly-carefull as if ſhee had beene his owne ſiſter, failing all the while with a proſperous gale till they came within kenning of the coaſts of <hi>Licia,</hi> where their being becalmed rowſed up the ghing, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the boatſonne, made the Veſſell ſtir on with maine force of Oares. But now that they were got within tenne miles of the <hi>Chelidonian</hi> Ilands, they might ſee launch out from among the rocks a Fleete of tenne Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes, which (as the Pilote judged) had beene kept in by contrary windes, and were now in that calme ſet out. At the ſight where of the ſweete <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelinda</hi> grew pale, imagining (nor was ſhee indeede miſtaken) that they were of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and that aboord them was the <hi>King,</hi> bound for <hi>Cyprus</hi> to marry her; which beleeved ſo to be by <hi>Scrpidoro</hi> too, he cauſed (for ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the incountring them) the Marriners to take about towards <hi>Libecchio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fleete obſerving the Galley (that before ſteerd directly towards them) begin now to alter her courſe, grew thereupon ſuſpicious of her, and taking her to be ſome pirate, gave her ſpeedily a ſterne-chaſe, with three of the fleeteſt, the others following them. <hi>Serpidoro</hi> looking <hi>Ormon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> in the face without ſpeaking a word, ſeemed to expect hee ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him either to abide the fight or flie; whereupon the other turning toward him in a ſmiling manner ſaid: And what elſe ſhall wee doe (noble Cozen) but ſhunne the fight? ſince that if we chance to have the worſt of it, the vanquiſher will then gaine my prize; and againe, in caſe wee have the beſt on't, then ſhall I bee much blamed for firſt taking away the wife, and then killing the husband too; let us therefore (a Gods name) hold on our way, wee ſhall have good ſport in ſeeing our ſelves vainely purſued, ſeeing we have (I thanke you) a Galley able to contend with the <hi>Dolphins</hi> for fleetneſſe. This Counſell pleaſed well <hi>Serpidoro,</hi> ſo did not the paſtime <hi>Arnelinda,</hi> who enlarging her ſelfe on the reaſon produced by her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7474:94"/>
told them, that for her part ſhee held it not fitting to jeare any offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perſon, for not accumulating (againſt all reaſon) ſcorne upon injury; which ſhee more efficaciouſly expreſt upon diſcerning ſoone after the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall (who being a very ſwift one had left the others a poope of her) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſigne (as the cuſtome is) with a bunch of feathers, in token of her commanding obeyſance. The Princes all this while could not betake themſelves to a reſolute (as they had done to a determinate) flight; but now ſince that it ſtood them upon, they (not deſpiſing their enemies fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) ſcowred on with all the force and ſpeed they could, after being vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued full twenty miles.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Pontus</hi> ſeeing the impoſſibility of overtaking her, return'd to ſteere his intended courſe, meeting with (towards the evening) the whole ſquadron of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> that came tracing the fugitive Galley. Hail'd that they had each other, the Admirall hies to the Kings Galley, whom he acquaints with the rape of the Princeſſe, ſtolne away by the two Princes of <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Illirium;</hi> I know not whether he thereat became ſtone or no, ſo aſtoniſhed was he at this unexpected accident; which if he did, 'twas then ſurely a fiery ſtone, for there flaſh'd from out of it ſuch flames of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and diſdaine, as ſeemed to be able to conſume the world: He now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that the Galley he had given chaſe to, was the thiefe; and therefore repented he had not purſued her to the utmoſt. But ſeeing it could now be no otherwiſe remedied, cauſing his to tack about, and the Galley-ſlaves to be refreſhed, he made them plie Iuſtily their Oares, ſteering all the night long, the ſlaves rowing in their quarters, and the Knights, Souldiers, and himſelfe too putting their helping hands to the Oares to releeve them, that there might be no minute of time loſt.</p>
                  <p>The two Princes ſeeing that the King was (for being weary of chaſing them) retired, and that the Princeſſe (now ridde of the feare ſhee ſtood in) deſired to ſee land, went and anchored in <hi>Rhodes,</hi> their ghing being tired, and no breath of winde ſtirring on Sea. They tooke port in the Iland, ſhunning the City for their more freedome. But ſcarce was it day, when the Scowt from off the Maine-top cried out, that there made after them a Fleete of ſixteene Galleyes, not above twenty miles a ſterne of them: Vpon this <hi>Ormondo</hi> ſtarting from out his bed, found the vigilant <hi>Serpidoro,</hi> that having already wayed anchor, was now launching out of the Bay. By when they might ſee the ſixteene Galleyes, who before rowing but quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly with a fourth part of their Oares, tugg'd (now that they deſcried her) with the utmoſt and united might all their Oare-men had, whileſt others abbaſſed the Decks, and put all things in readineſſe for the fight. Never was there ſeene a fairer chaſe, nor a fairer triall of good Galleyes. Moſt of the Fleete came lagging on by one and two's, for not being able to maintaine ſo ſwift a courſe as the foremoſt foure, of which alſo three in leſſe then fifteene miles courſe came halting after the Admirall, ſome five, ſome ſix miles ſhort of her, ſhee alone continuing her maine ſpeed as at firſt, the King doing himſelfe the office of Boatſonne, ghing-captaine, and unjuſt inflicter of more unjuſt cruelties on the lives of ſuch, whom being litle priviledged in bodily force he would have (to Natures ſhame) to have more ſtrength than they had. Thus laſted the flight and chaſe from the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Lucifer</hi> to the riſing of <hi>Heſperus;</hi> of ſixteene Galleyes there now

                  <p>Good paſtime had <hi>Serpidoro</hi> all that day, in obſerving <hi>Arbon</hi>'s folly, marveiling that the triall hee had two dayes before made of his Galleyes ſwiftneſſe had not by now taught him more wit, ſince the very Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds ceaſe their courſe, when they ſee their prey ſo farre out-ſtrippe them, as they ſee no poſſibility of overtaking it. And his ghing though they ſeemed to row but for their pleaſure, got notwithſtanding ever more and more ground of their purſuers, and then upon the breathing of a gentle North-eaſt winde, entring into the Channell betweene <hi>Creete</hi> and <hi>Caria</hi> in the <hi>Ciclads</hi> Laborinth, leaving on the right hand <hi>Stefalea,</hi> and on the left <hi>Teraſia;</hi> they ſayled with ſome danger, till they ſtruck into <hi>Ecatea,</hi> where they caſt anchor, having got out of <hi>Arbon</hi>'s ſight the firſt evening, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing any more ſigne of him: For all which <hi>Arnelinda</hi> could not yet thinke her ſelfe ſafe enough: All this way ſteer'd they in a ſhort time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Ormondo</hi> all this while fretted exceedingly at the neceſſity of their flight, whileſt the enemy being ſevered from his company might bee well fought withall and vanquiſhed, his ghing being even dead with over-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, his Souldiers quite tired in releeving them, and <hi>Arbon</hi> himſelfe, over and beſides his native raſhneſſe, being now long of the torture of his owne chafing fury more than ever voyd of judgement and diſcretion: By alleadging which reaſons he (changed from his former determination) ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly importuned and oft entreated his wives aſſent, who as earneſtly of the other ſide diſſwaded and begg'd of him to forbeare. Repoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they had one night, they (waying anchor) ſteered away aloofe of the <hi>Helleſpont, (Arbon</hi>'s right way for <hi>Pontus,</hi> and theirs for <hi>Biſantium)</hi> and thence towards <hi>Maronea</hi> the firſt place of <hi>Thrace,</hi> where they abode till <hi>Serpidoro</hi> by advertizing the King <hi>Ciriandro</hi> his Father of their arrivall, received commodious meanes for conducting them to Court as beſeemed ſuch Princes. Faine would <hi>Ormondo</hi> have (under one) brought his Bride ſtraight to <hi>Illirio,</hi> for not incommodating his friend, which the other would by no meanes ſuffer him to doe, but tooke hold of this occaſion of entertaining and honouring his friend at his home as hee had often wiſh'd for; which courteſie it behov'd the other to accept, as well for <hi>Arnelinda</hi>'s ſake, who was now weary of the ſea, as alſo for the hope he had, that his ſojourne there would not prove unneceſſary, conſidering the probability of <hi>Arbon</hi>'s hoſtile incurſions into <hi>Ciriandros</hi> dominions, the two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes being not otherwiſe ſeparated than by the <hi>Bosforum,</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence neere enough to moleſt each other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ciriandro</hi> underſtanding how the caſe ſtood, was nothing pleaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as foreſeeing what muſt in its reſpect befall him; yet omitted he not (for all that) the ſending of Litters, Horſes, Ladies and Knights to ſerve the Princes; taking there with hall ſuch order as was requiſite for his States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence.

of ſtaying for aſmuch as the neceſſary proviſions requiſite for ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.</p>
                  <p>In the meane ſpace King <hi>Chronno</hi> Prince <hi>Ormondo</hi>'s Father, a Prince ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly-juſt (advertized of the caſe by the Queene of <hi>Thrace</hi> his ſiſter, by ſpeedy meſſengers) baniſheth from his State his ſonne, for being married without his conſent, for the ſtealing away of anothers Bride, and the injury done to two Kings his friends; yet forbare he not (for all that) to furniſh him abundantly with all things needfull, by ſending him (as from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) monies for him, and Iewels for <hi>Arnelinda,</hi> and for the warres, a ſilent aſſent to the Nobility, and expreſſe Commiſſions to the <hi>Milice</hi> to paſſe in ſmall diſordered ſquadrons over into <hi>Thrace.</hi> So as the number of <hi>Cavaliers</hi> was ſufficient not onely to finiſh that warre, but even afterwards to conquer the greateſt part of the knowne world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arbon</hi>'s firſt enterprize was to ravage and runne over with his Army all betweene the <hi>Bosforum</hi> and the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> ſacking and then (to <hi>Ciri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andro</hi>'s more dammage) burning whatſoever hee lighted on, and thence croſt over the ſea to beſiege <hi>Byſantium.</hi> Permitted hee was to land, but to his fatall ruine, for that war was ended by that one battell, his forces being almoſt all of them there cut in pieces, and himſelfe taken priſoner by <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondo;</hi> who paſſing afterwards with his <hi>Illirians</hi> over into <hi>Pontus,</hi> tooke all that kingdome, and with it <hi>Bonarea</hi> and <hi>Arſelia</hi> King <hi>Arbon</hi>'s ſiſters, whom together with their brother he delivered over to the hands of <hi>Ciri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andro.</hi> Mette in his returne was <hi>Ormondo</hi> with great triumphs by his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deer'd Cozen <hi>Serpidoro,</hi> who eying <hi>Bonarea,</hi> became ſuddenly enamoured of her, an affect neceſſitating his cheering her up with tearmes and offers betweene courteous and amorous, which was the occaſion that made her ſoone lay aſide all womaniſh deſperations; and ſo account her impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the meanes and occaſioner rather of her joy than diſcontent. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed as well as ſhee could the raving fury of her more than furious bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe liberty ſhee might (as ſhee preſumed) have begg'd ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, but that his precipitous nature could not abide the motioning of ſuch a reſolution; his priſon was nevertheleſſe large enough, for he might goe where he liſted over all the Caſtle. So was he like wiſe in all other reſpects honoured and ſerved more like a King than a priſoner. <hi>Serpidoro</hi> this meane while communicating his love to his friend, beſought him to bethinke himſelfe of ſome way of ſatisfying his deſire; for that hee doubted that his Father, deſpiſing the condition of a priſoner-princeſſe, would hardly aſſent to his choyce. Vpon this <hi>Ormondo</hi> (after having conſidered with himſelfe the importancie of the buſineſſe) goes to <hi>Bonarea,</hi> whom hee findes gladſomely enjoying the ſweete company of <hi>Eliante</hi> and <hi>Arnelinda.</hi> Taking her therefore apart, he thus beſpeakes her.</p>
                  <p>If I pretended (ſweete Madame) to implore of your goodneſſe any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for my ſelfe, I were then ill adviſed to come in my owne perſon, with any hope to obtaine it; for knowing, that my having done you ſo many injuries cannot chooſe but give you juſt occaſion to hate me. But (ſo the Gods love me) all paſſed faults of mine in that behalfe are mecrely inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent errours; whereof the firſt was of love ere ever I knew your brother; the ſecond of naturall defence, wherein he through his ill fortune loſt his liberty; the third of warre, by which I tooke from him his State, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7474:96"/>
your noble perſonage more eſteeme-worthy than either kingdome, Crown or any thing elſe; and this thought I fitte to acquaint you with (Madame) before I paſſe any farther, to the end my actions might in ſome excuſable way be conſtrued by you, whoſe good opinion I eſteeme more than all my acquiſts, as I now meane to let you ſee. <hi>Bonarea</hi> marveiling at ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, and longing to underſtand its ſequell, return'd him this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Moſt valorous and redoubted Prince, Fortune hath by your victorious hands ſo abaſed me, that neither you have occaſion to begge ought of me, nor I wherewithall to favour, you, which if I had, I would then let you ſee, even in the preſent eſtate I yet am in, that a mayden of my condition regards more the intention than the effects; and though I know that you are the totall ruine of our State, and the ſole occaſion of our diſaſters; yet know I likewiſe as well, that what you tell me is not farre from the truth. So as though I ſeeme to have cauſe, yet neither ought I juſtly, nor can I with reaſon hate you. Next for your perſon, it (right noble Prince) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth with it ſo many and ſo great priviledges, that to beleeve your ſelfe to be in its reſpect diſadvantagious with me, were rather to accuſe me of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt judgement in your merits, than juſt paſſion for your faults; but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent being of both of us, will ſoone ridde us of any ſuch doubt, ſince that I being your vanquiſhed priſoner, am by the practiſed Law of Armes to receive Lawes from you my vanquiſher. The generous hearted <hi>Ormondo</hi> remain'd aſtoniſhed at ſo noble a ſpirit, ſo as eſtabliſhed firmer now than ever in his good intention, he in this ſort replied.</p>
                  <p>Princely Madame, ſuch generous hearts as yours neither know what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters meane, nor are any way ſubject to vanquiſhers; nay they loſing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore gaine; well may fortune have power over what's theirs, but yet never over them, and (by her favour) ſhee is now like to diſclaime her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in either. But here, becauſe they were ſtanding, he courteouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting her a ſtoole, and then ſeating himſelfe on another cloſe by her, thus proceeded. I have ſeriouſly bethought my ſelfe (Madame) of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding after ſo many evils a remedy for ſuch as are yet revokeable, as is the Realme, and liberty on ſuch conditions as may aſſure a true and durable peace betweene the kingdome of <hi>Thrace</hi> and that of <hi>Pontus.</hi> The enmity (you know) is ſprung from an intended marriage, broke off by mee; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of which one, I would now make up three; the King your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can now have no more pretenſions, ſince hee hath loſt Bride, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, liberty, ſiſters, and all; which not with ſtanding, my intention is to reſtore him all, excepting your perſon (Madame) not to detaine you pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, but that being a free woman you may oblige me in beſtowing your ſelfe in an honourable way on my Cozen <hi>Scrpidoro,</hi> who entirely loves and highly honours you: The Princeſſe <hi>Arſelia</hi> I meane (ſo ſhe be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with pleaſed) to match with <hi>Ortomano</hi> Prince of <hi>Cyprus</hi> my brother-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law. And to your brother for <hi>Arnelinda</hi> that I tooke from him, I'le give my Cozen <hi>Eliante,</hi> and with her for dowry both the kingdome of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and his liberty. Now although I know that ſuch conditions make for his advantage, yet held I it not fit to propoſe them to other than you, that you might treate thereof with him, conſidering that he'le not eaſily bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by other, than ſuch whom he is well acquainted with.</p>
                  <p>Vnexpreſſible was the conſolation that the noble-minded <hi>Bonarea</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7474:96"/>
from ſo beyond-all-hope-generous a propoſition; whereunto ſhe (after having humbly thanked him in the moſt gratefull and courteous language ſhee could deviſe) told him; that touching <hi>Arbano</hi>'s buſineſſe, ſhee would treate with him of it; but for the other that concern <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> her ſelfe, ſhee meant not to will other than that which to him, to her-ſo-great obligation ſeemed good for her to determine of, ſtiling her diſaſters hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and her loſſes invaluable acquiſitions, ſince they had beene the meanes to bring her to ſuch noble acquaintance, and ſuch happy friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Shee uſually went to viſit her brother almoſt every day, and had by commending the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> of that Court, and their courteſies (ſeconded with adverſe fortune which makes men become wiſe) ſomewhat mollified the hardneſſe of his fierce humour, and now as a diſcreete woman falling to diſcourſe firſt at large of the buſineſſe, ſhee by degrees fell to propoſe, how advantagious it were for him if ſuch things could be effected, which indeed were already granted. But he thinking they would never be drawne to ſuch conditions, which hee for his part would but too willingly aſſent unto; ſhee (with that) opens unto him all that <hi>Ormondo</hi> had treated of with her; whereupon expreſſing with ſhouts of joy the infinitneſſe of his obligations to him; and being after ſet free out of the Caſtle, there was ſoone in liberty concluded on, what in liberty was to be enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ciriandro</hi> firſt ſends a noble Embaſſie into <hi>Cyprus</hi> to <hi>Senasteo</hi> with the ſix Galleyes that had beene taken from him; acquaints him alſo with all that had happened, and offers him with the marriage a perpetuall amity; ſhewes him, to how good an end the ill beginning came to, and how there was fallen to his lot the moſt noble and valorous ſonne-in-law that the world could boaſt of. Conformable to this writes alſo <hi>Arnelinda,</hi> and withall craves her Father pardon, invites her brother, and prayes both of them to accept of both the peace and alliance. <hi>Arbone</hi> too by his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular embaſſadours aſſures him of the memory that he would perpetually conſerve of his love, no otherwiſe than if he had indeede beene his ſonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law; and that ſince he could not have <hi>Arnclinda,</hi> he yet could not chuſe but commend her for having ſo happily tranſgreſſed; he proffers him <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelia</hi> for <hi>Ortomano,</hi> and thankes him for his Galleyes, which though by him loſt, were yet out of the vanquiſhers noble courteſie reſent him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Senesteo</hi> comprehending ſuch a ſtinging buſineſſe of difference to be ſo compoſed and determined to his honour, gave his free aſſent and leave to <hi>Ortomano,</hi> who (conveyed by fifteene Galleyes) went flying to <hi>Thrace,</hi> where hee was courteouſly received, and nobly welcomed by his ſiſter, brother-in-law, and Bride with infinite joy: And then with all conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpeede were the treble nuptialls ſolemnly celebrated, <hi>Pontus</hi> reſtored, and <hi>Ormondo</hi> with the good leave of his Vncle and Cozen (leaving <hi>Arne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi> quick with childe) iſſued out with his <hi>Illirians</hi> to the field, not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of one <hi>Thracian</hi> in all his troupes. And taking occaſion to remember how his men were ill treated in paſſing through the Countries of the <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans</hi> and <hi>Triballs,</hi> he aſſayles, ſubdues, and then incorporates the later to the Crowne of <hi>Thrace</hi> in recompence of the kingdome of <hi>Pontus,</hi> by him reſtored to <hi>Arbone;</hi> the ſame did he alſo to the <hi>Dardans,</hi> ſubjecting them to his Father. Return'd to <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> he found <hi>Arnelinda</hi> freed of her burthen, having brought to the world two goodly twins, a boy and a girle, the firſt
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7474:97"/>
named <hi>Ladomonte,</hi> and the other <hi>Deadora;</hi> yet would he not (for all that) part from <hi>Thrace</hi> ere he ſaw budde forth the fruite of the other three. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narea</hi> bare <hi>Serpidoro</hi> a male childe call'd <hi>Erpandro, Eliante</hi> brought forth <hi>Arbone,</hi> another named <hi>Vincireo,</hi> and <hi>Arſilea</hi> to <hi>Ortomano</hi> a third hight <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoro.</hi> But then ſent for home by frequent Embaſſadors from his father, longing to ſee with his ſonne his daughter-in-law with her litle babes, he parted (leaving many a fare-well weeping eye behinde him) though not without firſt agreeing on a marriage betweene <hi>Erpandro</hi> and <hi>Deadora,</hi> as then but few moneths of age. The love of the two friends ever ſtudying how, and yet never finding meanes ſufficient to conjoyne, and in varied wayes re-conjoyne thoſe affects in them, which could not poſſibly be ever either disjoyned or worne away by any malicious ſuggeſtion of time or fortune.</p>
                  <p>The valorous <hi>Ormondo</hi> having thus by his returne ſatisfied his Fathers deſire, goes out againſt the <hi>Dacians,</hi> and ſubjugates them; and then having conquered both <hi>Panonians,</hi> wheeles his victorious front towards the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macians,</hi> next whom he vanquiſheth the <hi>Ruſsians;</hi> combated had hee alſo with the frozen <hi>Neptune</hi> of thoſe ſeas, but that the froſt of the <hi>Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rcans</hi> retreated him. And being daily abundantly ſupplied with freſh men, that from <hi>Illirio</hi> ſwarm'd to him like Bees rather to the victory than booty, he thought beſt to make a modeſtly-diſcreete uſe of his fortune by reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the bounds of his Empire within a governable diſtance; ſelecting therefore the beſt deſerving among the moſt valiant, he beſtowes on them his acquiſted Crownes; for conſerving which, he left with each of them an Army, which ſerved both for a <hi>Colony,</hi> and Seminary of his language; <hi>Ormondo</hi> having by his victories impoſed no other yoake on the tributary Kings, than the obligation of leaving the <hi>Illirian</hi> tongue hereditary to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. And thence paſſing into <hi>Germany,</hi> he there with other Provinces ſubjected the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> ſubjugating likewiſe the <hi>Is<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trians</hi> in returning homewards; where come, he found his father decrepit, his wife (as it were) halfe a widow, and his children well growne up. The firſt hee now therefore eaſed of the burthen of governement, who a litle after died hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie in his ſonnes glorious acquiſts: the ſecond he comforted with new off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring: The third he tooke care for, placing <hi>Ladomonte</hi> in the career of an heroike education; and ſeeing that <hi>Deadora,</hi> diſdaining the needle and ſpindle, with generous affects emulated his victories, he would not force nor thwart her naturall inclinations, which though not beſt beſeeming her ſex, were yet no whit misbeſeeming a royall Lady, a great Princeſſe, and an <hi>Ormondo</hi>'s Daughter. A liberty which although ſhee aſſumed, yet made ſhee ſuch delicate uſe of it, that Nature repenting the having made her a woman, beſtowed on her a manly deportment, limbes, and force, though yet no point farther than <hi>love</hi> permitted her; for obſerving her to be faire among the faireſt, and in both geſture and aſpect gracefull and lovely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the prime that way endowed; hee would not with thoſe his graces have enriched her in vaine, but would thereof in ſome ſort parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate, ſo as though ſhee were a Maſculine to others, yet was ſhee a <hi>ſoſter ſex'd creature</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ormondo</hi>'s Court was ſo frequented, (his fame ſummoning all honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emulating <hi>Cavaliers</hi> to come from all parts to ſee him) as that it had not its
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7474:97"/>
paragon in all <hi>Europe.</hi> Among the younger ſort whereof were his three Nephewes, ſprung from the three marriages made by him, (who were) <hi>Erpandro</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> whom as ſoone as borne he had made his ſonne-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law; <hi>Vincireo</hi> of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Gradamoro Arnelinda</hi>'s owne Nephew, all which liv'd in the company of Prince <hi>Ladomonte,</hi> who by his actions ſhewed himſelfe to bee a true branch of <hi>Ormondo</hi>'s ſtock. In quality hee ſeemed to be their King, in maturity, if not a father, then ſomething of a name leſſe ſevere; for title of contemporary (or peere in yeares) became him not: Now there was ever among the other three Cozens an unfained emulation, the two of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Pontus</hi> holding ſtill together againſt that other of <hi>Thrace,</hi> ſo as being ever of accord and friends either with other, they ever diſcorded and were at jurre with him: Againe, <hi>Deadora</hi> (for her part) alwayes frequented her Brother and Cozen's exerciſes, as hunting, barriers, jouſts, and the like, in all which ſhee behaved her ſelfe ſo dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, as no man could judge what ſex ſhee was of, her ability in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming no way diſcovering her for a woman; ſo as her brother ever chus'd and nam'd her above and rather than all the moſt experimented in Armes. Onely <hi>Gradamoro</hi> beheld her, and ſhee him in either of their pure beeing, <hi>Erpandro</hi> by her neither obſerved nor regarded, but ſleighted and in heart deſpiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ormondo</hi> had in ſo long warres in thoſe cold climes attracted no few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions; but above all the Goute moſt tormented him, which made him ever ſeeke for ſome diverſion, and of them to have recourſe to the leſſe incommodious, ſo to be the leſſe ſenſible of his paine. Hee therefore retired to <hi>Faria</hi> the principall Iland of his kingdome, where the conſtant perfection of the ayre, the pleaſing ſolitarineſſe of the Rocks thereabouts, the ſingular proſpect of it ſelfe, and neighbourhood of <hi>Iſſa</hi> (the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of all Ilands) afforded him meanes of no leſſe commodious than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ſome entertainment; for, being now become unable to ride, hee had chang'd that exerciſe to roving from Port to Port in that ſinuous Region, which in deſpite of both tempeſt and bluſtring windes is ever conſtantly calme; thankes to the rampire-like ſheltring rocks and cragges, among which (as in a Fiſh-pond or Weare) are conſerved an infinite number of the moſt delicious and choyceſt fiſh of the Sea. The City hath its proſpect fully Southward, with a Haven warmly ſheltred from the oppoſite winds, Nature having providently planted neere it a rock that ſteeds it for both Rampire and Parapet; behinde the Sea-banke ſtand built the houſes, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending higher and higher by degrees even almoſt to the top of an eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mountaine, on whoſe cime ſtands erected a litle, but well built Caſtle; which beſides its ſtrength, ſhewes delightfull to the eye, in reſpect of its being ſo advantaged by Nature, and embelliſhed by Arts curioſities. The Dwellings ſpreading from the top to the bottome, and well neere from one point of the Heaven to the other in a lunar forme, ſeeme to repreſent a faire and well-proportioned ſcene.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſſa</hi> thence eighteene miles, enjoyes betweene its exquiſite ſites, large vineyards, and with game-abounding forreſts ſuch choyce and variety of contentſome pleaſures and delightſome objects, as it is both a ſufficient and indeed moſt fitte place of entertainement for a Prince, who after long toyle and acquired glories, aſpires to repoſe. Beſides, her vaſt <hi>Bay</hi> capable
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7474:98"/>
of receiving exceeding great <hi>Armado</hi>'s, ſerved for a pleaſing gulfe, hee there doing for preſervation of his health in his Barge that exerciſe, which others of a more wholſome diſpoſition doe either on foote or horſe-back; and the Court being retired hither, their delights increaſed with the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and variety of ſites.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gradamoro</hi> was (beſides his paſſing well-proportioned bodily feature) by nature endowed with moſt amiable conditions, ſo as there was no man that knowing him, lov'd him not. <hi>Erpandro</hi> on the contrary (with his face all blemiſhed over with pock-holes, of a nature rigid and dogged, and a vaunter withall) was much given to ſcorne and mock others, and the toy taking him ſometimes in the pate to counterfeite <hi>Gradamoro</hi> in his gentle garbe and quaint demeanour, he did it ſo misbecommingly, and with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures ſo unſeemely, as made him loathſome to ſuch as ſaw him act it. If therefore <hi>ormondo</hi> lov'd him, 'twas for his being a ſon to ſo deere a friend of his, for having deſtinated him for his ſonne-in-law, and for not fully nor throughly knowing him; whereas <hi>Ladomonte</hi> and <hi>Deadora</hi> who had him ever in their eye, could not endure the ſight of him; and therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him alwayes with reſpect, for keeping him at a diſtance off their familiarity; but ſhee above all others could not brooke the ſight of him, eſpecially when with ſighes and ſobbes he would (as pittifully and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely as he could) repreſent the perſon of an heart-ſick paſſionate lover; whereas teares though reall, and ſighes though unfained, full ill (God wot) became his mouth and cheekes. No one had this poore Prince that ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him a naturall glaſſe, to ſee therein his misbecomming carriage; Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers he had enough that followed him, puft up with an ambition of being truſty to him; but knowing the good opinion he had of himſelfe, they ſtill ſeconded him in his humours, which made him become ever more and more peeviſh and impertinent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gradamoro</hi> on the other ſide, to whom the Graces were Midwives, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion mother, and the Muſes Nurſes, had wonne him the hearts of all that knew him, <hi>Ormondo</hi> lov'd him for his merits, <hi>Arnclinda</hi> for neereneſſe in blood, <hi>Ladomonte</hi> for friendſhip, and <hi>Deadora</hi> for love, ſhee being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved rather to dye than marry <hi>Erpandro;</hi> at whoſe appearance ſhe would freeze, and ſweate if ſhee but heard him ſpeake; and indeede to her it ſeemed whereſoever he was that mirth and diſcourſe gave place to ſilence and mellancholy: and againe, where <hi>Gradamoro</hi> but entred, there was no kinde of thing that in her eyes ſeemed not to rejoyce, the very ſtatues had then tongues, and the walls voyces. How many times (alas) would ſhee all alone drop from her faire eyes ſucceſſive ſhowres of briniſh teares, in bethinking how to withdraw her ſelfe from ſuch a husband? How often alſo made ſhee her moane there of unto her mother, who whileſt ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted her with her tongue, lamented her with her heart? <hi>Ladomonte</hi> much pittied her, and wiſh'd in his heart to ſee her freed from him, but yet durſt not ſpeake of it, well knowing, that any ſuch propoſition, though juſt, would not be well taken of <hi>Ormondo;</hi> the match having beene made when as they were as yet in their cradles, and with a friend whom it was not fit he ſhould diſpleaſe, ſince neither of them had ever given the other any cauſe of either diſtaſte or diſcontent.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner was the gentle <hi>Gradamoro</hi> arrived in <hi>Illirio,</hi> and ſeene the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7474:98"/>
ſweetly-majeſtick <hi>Deadora,</hi> than that hee rent off the habit of a Cozen: Her beauty accompanied with ſuch ſingular vertues apparelling him in the fineſt love that ever lover was cloth'd in; but having heard the ſtory (or perhaps read in the Chronicles) of the ſtealing away of his Aunt, the warre that thereupon followed, the friendſhip betweene <hi>Ormondo</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidoro,</hi> the marriages and children ſprung from them, among whom him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was one, and how that <hi>Deadora</hi> was firmely promiſed to <hi>Erpandro,</hi> he durſt no more lift up his eyes, for doubt leſt the object of an hopeleſſe and hapleſſe love ſhould bring him to a deſpairing end; during a great courſe of time endured hee this tormenting paine, without communicating the ſame to as much as <hi>Vnicireo,</hi> to whom hee communicated even his very heart, wearying his feeble forces in endeavouring to disburthen himſelfe of it; but more potent forces forced him to undergoe its loade, ſo as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards being uſed to it, he began to delight in it; or elſe that being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly eaſed by <hi>Deadora</hi>'s love, it was conſequently eaſie for him to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine a weight of it ſelfe ſweete, with her much ſweeter aſſiſtance. Love hath in all times beene a cunning warrier, hee durſt not aſſault the generous and chaſte heart of <hi>Dcadora,</hi> ere he had firſt battered it on both ſides, that towards <hi>Erpandro</hi> with the Ramme-engine of hatred, and that to <hi>Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moro-</hi>wards with hope and affection; hee led on the aſſault through the ruines of anxious thoughts; and though the fight was no leſſe dubious than dangerous, and the Captaine aſſaylant uſed to vanquiſh the ſtouteſt Gods, yet thought he it not the leaſt of his atchievements to conquer ſuch a mayden. And then too ſhee penſively lamented for ſuch loſſes that many another would have beene glad of, whereof what judgement to make, I know not; nor can I tell you, whether or no it were, that ſhee hated her ſelfe for ſuffering her reſolution to bee overcome, or for loving another with dead and almoſt impoſſible hopes.</p>
                  <p>One morning had the Princes and ſhee with them runne at the Ring, where after ſundry layes, it came by order of carreere to her turne to lay with <hi>Gradamoro,</hi> and 'twas that the loſer ſhould ſubmit himſelfe to the diſcretion of the vanquiſher, in whatſoever it ſhould pleaſe the ſame to command the other; ſhee perhaps would not winne, that ſo her true loſſe might be ſhadowed by this falſe one at play; or howſoever it was, loſe ſhee did. <hi>Gradamoro</hi> encouraged by the victory, taking off the Ring, thus accoaſts her.</p>
                  <p>Deere Lady and Cozen, it hath pleaſed fortune to ſhew me in this game how exceedingly ſhee can hate me; ſhee will that I beare you this Ring, for an other guiſe one, which to my ineffable content I would more than gladly have given you, had ſhee beene but pleaſed to have bleſſed mee in my ſwathing-bands as ſhee hath done others. What by this wager I can pretend (ſo it ſtand with your good liking) is, that you would be pleaſed, that I ever burne for you, and that in ſuch a fire all the remnant of my lives time may blaze out, being reſolved, ſince the Deſtinies deny me you, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have other woman. That golden ſhaft which is fained to ſtrike through hearts, and impoyſon them with love, is no more than an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous word ſteep'd in the affection of a paſſionate lover, the one ſtabbes, the other envenoms; ſo much teacheth us <hi>Deadora,</hi> who thereof is both the teſtimony and example. Vnpoſſible is it to repreſent the trouble of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7474:99"/>
minde ſhee conceived thereat, and the internall commotion of her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſpirits, and heart. Anger it was not, for love had expelled that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: 'twas ſure one of thoſe things which cannot be knowne; or (as I by its operation ſhould judge it) an effect of poyſon. Anſwer him ſhee could not deviſe how, ſhee was dumbe to him now, and though ſhee had known how, yet now wanted ſhee time for it, the Princes being runne thither to ſee what <hi>Gradamoro</hi> meant to command her; who though they came neere of taking them both napping, yet he without loſing any whit of his innate vivacity, complaines to them, that the Princeſſe making uſe of a maydens priviledge, pretended her-ſelfe exempt from paying him any thing, invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (with that) juſtice, the Gods, and their aſſiſtance, which he expreſſed with tearmes ſo pleaſing, that <hi>Deadora</hi> her ſelfe could not chuſe but laugh thereat as well as the others. But come that evening to entertaine her with his company as he was wont to doe, the others being then by chance with the King, ſhee thus beſpeakes him.</p>
                  <p>Cozen, you were telling me this morning ſomething that I well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not, pleaſe you therefore to bee plaine with mee, that I may know whether you be in jeſt or good earneſt? Madame (anſwered hee) with a Princeſſe of your condition and merit, and by a perſon of my quality, and one having withall ſuch a relation to you as I have, full ill becomes jeſting in ſuch a ſubject. I was indeede borne very neere you in blood, but your vertues tyed me yet neerer you in ſervitude, and your beauty, graces, and merits with an indiſſoluble knot faſt-bound me neereſt you of all in love, if loving you bee an offence, then muſt the being your ſervant and Cozen be no leſſe; and if you judge me worthy of puniſhment, then muſt you likewiſe judge, that your vertues, beauty, and excelling parts deſerve to be the firſt puniſhed: But I beſeech you to beleeve (peereleſſe Madame) that theſe (though great) occaſions had not (for all that) made mee this day ſo bold as I was, but that I knew that your nuptialls drew neere, and that <hi>Erpandro</hi> now expects Ambaſſadours from his Father for effecting the Matrimony, which if it ſtand with your good liking, behold me then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſerve you therein, as I ſhall in all things elſe whileſt I breathe. If not, then ſhould I thinke my audacity to have beene neceſſary, and, as ſuch, worthy of both excuſe and pardon. <hi>Deadora,</hi> who at firſt had determined with her ſelfe to act the diſdainefull coy one, pierced now through the heart with the very mention of that marriage, replied.</p>
                  <p>Cozen, your boldneſſe is every way unexcuſeable; for, I being long ſithence married, it is not for you to judge whether it be with my liking or not, it behoving mee to ſubordinate my fancie to my Fathers liking, who commands me. And had you any ſuch thought out of any charity to me-wards, you ſhould then have ſtripped your ſelfe of the intereſſe of your love to your ſelfe, which adviſeth mee not for my good, but for his owne behoofe, and ſuch as (perhaps too) cannot well pleaſe mee. My Brother and <hi>Vincireo</hi> who have not your ends, have not that pity of mee, a ſigne that your having it is more for your owne ſake than mine; therefore know I not, whether or no I ought either to beleeve a perſon intereſſed as you are, or make any account of your <hi>counſels.</hi> But granting they were true, and that I brook'd not ſuch a husband; me-thinkes then you, that expoſed the inconvenience, ſhould likewiſe propoſe me its remedy. Well knew
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7474:99"/>
the warily-obſervant <hi>Gradamoro,</hi> that the Princeſſe's words were not ſuch as they ſounded for, and that for well underſtanding them, it behoved him to make as though he underſtood them not; wherefore, as one p<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>tent for his preſumption, I will not (Madame) anſwered her he, defend or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my over-boldneſſe, whileſt I pretend both to confeſſe and crave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for it; onely I beſeech you, that weighing the occaſions that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned it, you admit it to bee excuſe-worthy. Of your obedience to your Father, I neither have, nor meane to ſpeake any diſſwaſive word; well affirme I, that <hi>Fathers ſhould be well-adviſed in their commands, if they will not be diſobeyed.</hi> For ſometimes out of their fatherly priviledge and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they (without thinking that they doe otherwiſe than well) pitch upon ſuch reſolutions touching their children, which they would not have done, if they had but conſidered or foreſeene their enſueable incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences. Now for the ſelfe-good-tending ends or intereſſes that you accuſe me of, I am ſo farre from denying it, that I openly confeſſe, nay (as it were) proclaime it. Why! beleeve you (ſweet Madame) that loves are other than intereſſes? ſurely no, love is even an intereſt or ſelfe-tending end of ſatisfying thoſe affects in us, but for whoſe being there, wee ſhould never be troubled with love; ſo as when we love, we in loving ever love firſt our owne affect, and then that which it loves for its owne pleaſure. Therefore if you condemne mee for that, then you can doe no leſſe than condemne with mee both the World and Nature, the later whereof ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not the power to bee otherwiſe than ſuch, makes mee that I cannot chuſe but love you, whilſt I cannot chuſe but love mine owne inclination and affect, which entirely loves you.</p>
                  <p>This ſaid, <hi>Gradamoro</hi> held his peace; but ſeeing her make no anſwer, hee thus proceeded: Next for the counſell which you command mee to give you, I ſhould thinke any advice needleſſe to ſuch as meane not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it. In which regard I ſhould hold it expedient, that you firſt reſolve, whether you will, or will not have the Prince of <hi>Thrace,</hi> whom if you pleaſe to like and accept for your husband, it would be then but ſuperſtuous to diſcourſe of what ſhould be done: But in caſe you will not have him—Scarce had hee pronounced the laſt accent, when they eſpyed comming running towards them the three Princes, rejoycing that the King had told them, that within foure moneths ſpace he would have celebrated the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls of his Daughter with <hi>Erpandro,</hi> and had by letter ſignified ſo much to the King of <hi>Thrace</hi> to ſend Embaſſadours to that end; and withall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the order he would have obſerved in the ſolemnities &amp; jouſts, and commanded <hi>Ladomonte</hi> to acquaint his ſiſter with as much. But hee was ſo diſcreete, that taking on him to be glad, whereas indeede hee was ſorry for it, he would not ſpeake unto her a word thereof before their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens: But taking occaſion to conduct her to their Mothers Lodgings, hee then perform'd his Embaſſie; where with the Princeſſe ſtung with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venom'd griefe, thus beſpeakes him.</p>
                  <p>My Lord and Brother, you deliver me a meſſage ſo croſſe to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as it drawes on me the greateſt anguiſh and hearts-griefe that fortunes utmoſt ſpite can inflict on me. I ought to obey my father, (tis true) yet ought my father then give me ſuch a husband as I abhorre not: you are my brother, and as being my onely one, my onely hope in all adverſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7474:100"/>
I therefore conjure you to be my protector, and a meanes for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off of this Marriage, which ere ever I conſent to, I am reſolved (I here vow to you) to dye a thouſand deaths. The <hi>Prince</hi> that tenderly loved her, all-confuſed in minde thus anſwered her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deere</hi> Lady, and deereſt ſiſter, I never have nor meane to deny you any thing you aske of mee, which any way tends to your behoofe or content. And in this preſent occaſion, I had (to tell you the truth) rather doe than promiſe. For (to bee plaine with you) this match never liked mee. My Cozen <hi>Erpandro</hi> is (indeed) a good Prince, but yet no fit husband for you; I am ſorry wee have ſuffered the diſeaſe to have his courſe for ſo many yeares without curing or ſtopping it, ſince its remedies can at this preſent prove but ſlow in operation, if not almoſt bootleſſe. I will worke with my father as much as poſſibly I can; but wonne he muſt be by degres, for the affaire is delicate, and yet to handle it gently we are diſadvantaged by the brevity of time that precipitates it. I (many times) thought to goe and conferre with my Mother about it; but yet refrain'd, out of the beliefe I had, that ſhee would never openly declare her ſelfe oppoſite to that match, were it but for her love to the King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> to whom ſhee ſtood ſo highly obliged, when he with my Father conveyed her away from <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> but would (I am perſwaded) beleeve, ſhee did an act unworthy of the friendſhip and gratitude ſhee owed him. More for the preſent I cannot promiſe you, but that I am reſolved (ſithence no other expedient courſe can be therein taken) to waite for an opportunity to ſpeake of it to the King, who is ſo diſcreete and juſt, as I preſume hee will not force you to match againſt your liking. Theſe conſiderately-ſtayed reaſons of her brother (whom in all other things ſhee knew to be moſt reſolute) made <hi>Deadora</hi> perceive that ſhee might not relie upon any prevailing offices to her ends in this buſineſſe, conſidering that to content her, there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of offending <hi>Serpidoro;</hi> wherefore having ſent for to come to her the Prince of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> ſhee thus beſpeakes him.</p>
                  <p>Behold mee now (Cozen) reſolved to have none of <hi>Erpandro,</hi> what therefore (I pray you) is now to bee done? I have thereof ſpoken to my Brother, and finde him (contrary to his ordinary temper) cold, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſpaire of furthering me rather than otherwiſe; he indeed accuſeth mee for not having thereof acquainted him ſooner, by occaſion of which neglect, the remedy (ſaith he) is growne to be more difficult, a difficulty which conjoyned to ſome other conſiderations may be interpreted an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility: Which being ſo, it ſtands me upon to prevent it, for not being conſtrained to what I am moſt unwilling to doe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gradamoro</hi> ſeeing her now come to the point he wiſht for, returnes her this anſwer. Its remedy (divine Dadame) is eaſie enough, ſo you but give way to it: Be pleaſed to reade over the Annals of the King your Father, whom you know to be ſo vertuous and valorous, and by that Rule ſquare your deliberations; looke if you can there light on ſuch another caſe, and then (I am perſwaded) that by that time you have conſidered the modeſty and other vertues of my Aunt the Queene your Mother, you will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that neceſſity ſometimes tramples upon reaſon. <hi>Inextricable knots</hi> (Madame) <hi>are not undone but by either cutting or bursting.</hi> A Matrimony contracted from the very ſwathing-bands betweene two Fathers ſo deere
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7474:100"/>
friends, without having beene in ſo many yeares time any way diſavowed by the leaſt oppoſition of either ſide (as hath beene diſcreetely conſidered by the Prince your Brother) cannot poſſibly bee broken off without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; which becauſe it cannot be expected from the King, muſt needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from you. Your onely way therefore is to ſteale away, for which you want not a preſident to imitate. Nay more, the very accident will be adjudged to bee a premeditated plot; revenge done by a blow given, in quittance for a blow received. But this might perhaps rather withdraw you than otherwiſe, if the ſo patly-counterhappening of the ſelfe-ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents to the very ſame perſons, made not the world beleeve it to bee an effect of divine providence: A document for Fathers to be indulgent to their Children for ſuch faults as themſelves are preſidents for; which in caſe you would doe, you ſhould have the advantage of not being followed after, eſpecially if you would reſolve to lift mee into heaven, by bleſſing mee with the title deſtinated to <hi>Erpandro.</hi> I (Madame) am of that ſtocke whence your Mother was ſtolne away, you the Daughter of him that ſtole her, the King of <hi>Thrace</hi> (complice of the delict) his ſonne will I rob you of; <hi>Vincireo</hi> ſprung from him whom your Mother was promiſed to, will accompany me in conducting you to <hi>Cyprus</hi> not without divine diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to the end there might bee by our ſo rendring like for like confirmed betweene us all an indiſſoluble bond of perpetuall friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>No whit pleaſed was <hi>Deadora</hi> with ſuch diſcourſe as this, there ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her firſt a ſuſpition, that <hi>Gradamoro</hi>'s love was (as wee ſay) but from the teeth outwards; and too withall, although ſhee knew all this before, yet gladly would ſhee have ſeemed to have beene ignorant of it, for that ſhee conceived thoſe hiſtoricall conſiderations of rapes, complicites, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts, revenges, diſobligements received and requited, rather aggravated than extenuated her fault: Rather could ſhee have wiſh'd to have erred in ſimplicity, without penetrating ſo maine conſiderations. But <hi>Gradamoro</hi> for being of a free nature, ſuffering himſelfe to be wholly guided by affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, quite forgot all circumſpection, a quality moſt neceſſary in ſuch an affaire, which miniſtred her an occaſion to vent out her paſſion in theſe tearmes.</p>
                  <p>I thought ſo, that it was nothing but meerely your owne ends that mov'd you, <hi>Gradamoro:</hi> And though with ſophiſticall reaſons you have endeavoured to make me beleeve the contrary, yet doe you now (againſt your will) diſcover it by an affect of meere revenge, taking me to bee ſo ſimple as not to conceive you; but aſſure your ſelfe that I will neither beleeve you, nor bee ruled by you. But content my ſelfe to have beene deceived in the good opinion I once conceived of your love, rather than in the falſe effects of it in a time when my repentance will come too late. Now the Gods keepe mee from being an inſtrument of ſuch revenge. I will neither marry <hi>Erpandro</hi> nor follow you, but will rather than do either languiſh and dye. Whether <hi>Gradamoro</hi>'s griefe were great or no, may bee well conjectured by the unexpectedneſſe of any ſuch language, nothing avail'd him either arguments, oathes, or teares, all was but vaine, the Mayden-princeſſe rejecting his reaſons in reſpect of her being fully fraught with jealouſie, diffidence, and fury; no remedy then but part needs he muſt and leave her in that extreamely-paſſionate moode: And left he

had the City too, but for his being in his returne to his lodgings ſeiſed on by an exceſſive coole ſhivering, accompanied with vomiting and ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; no fire was there that could warme him; the Phyſitians ranne to him, the like did the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Queene,</hi> yea the <hi>King</hi> himſelfe would be carried to him. A long time lay hee motionleſſe, with lither artirs, dead clouded eyes, grinched teeth, and grappled hands; in ſo much, as there was none, thatby ſight thought him not dead, and bemoaned him not. The <hi>Queene</hi> (who as a childe of her owne deerely tendred him) was even heart-broken with griefe for him. The <hi>King</hi> ſollicited the Phyſitians for freſh <hi>Pittims</hi> and new Cordialls, but nothing avail'd him, ſince they pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated not into the nature of the diſeaſe, nor its true occaſion; Ridden hee had and danced too that morning, but without exceſſe, exerciſes to him ordinary: Dined he had too, but yet ſparingly, repletion and diſorder had no place in him. <hi>Deadora</hi> ſeeing him in ſuch a plight, too late now repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her being the cauſer of it, taking him by the hand warm'd it betweene hers, calling to him with ſo many throbs and teares, that happy he, had he but ſeene them: Nor did ſuch demonſtrations any way impeach the reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved modeſty of her ſex, their neerneſſe in blood, education, and domeſtick amity ſufficiently priviledging her ſo to doe. At length hee came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, juſt in that time when litle better than abandoning him for dead, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ones thoughts were buſied more about his funerall than life; for now the King, Queene, Princeſſe, and Princes were all of them parted ſave onely <hi>Vincirco,</hi> who ſtaid behinde with the Phyſicians, and was now ſet a weeping over him as dead. The King having notice thereof, returned with the reſt, and finding him laid in warme cloathes in a feaveriſh fit, ſhaking every joynt of him, he began to hope the beſt of him: And becauſe the throng of Courtiers that came in with him might not diſturbe his cure, he tooke them all againe out with him, leaving there onely the Queene with <hi>Deadora:</hi> The former where of being told by the Phyſicians, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident proceeded from ſome great oppreſſion of the heart, much marvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereat, for that ſhee had obſerved him to be ever merry; yet beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſome internall humour falling on that part, had cauſed that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſhee ranne to her lodgings for a moſt delicate paſte made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, leaving with him her daughter and <hi>Vincireo.</hi> Shee ſeeing the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians retired, and her ſelfe all alone with <hi>Vincireo,</hi> whom ſhee cared not for concealing her ſelfe from, accoaſting his bed-ſide, cures the wound given by the weapons of her former ſharpe, by the balme of theſe her milder words.</p>
                  <p>My Princely Lord and deereſt Cozen (ſaid ſhee) I confeſſe my ſelfe faulty, and pronounce my ſelfe moſt worthy of chaſtiſement, for having beene (againſt all reaſon) the cauſe of endangering your life, by bringing you thus to deaths doore. I confeſſe, yea I now from my ſoule confeſſe your intereſſes to be full of love, and moſt worthy of being really corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponded with an equall affection; Behold mee here now (my endeer'd Lord) moſt ready to make you plenary amends; Cheere then up your ſelfe (I beſeech you) for loe I am diſpoſed and immutably reſolved to goe whitherſoever you pleaſe. Baniſh then from you all melancholy, ſince I am ever yours, and never will be any others; which that you might be the more aſſured of, I have not (you ſee) abhorr'd the teſtimony of the Prince
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7474:101"/>
of <hi>Pontus</hi> your Cozen and mine here preſent; which ſhee expreſſed with an affection ſo ſincerely-ardent, as both amazed <hi>Vinciero,</hi> and reſtor'd <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoro</hi> to life. It is naturall for an oppreſſed heart to diſgorge in teares (in the very inſtant of its being eaſed) that maligne humour that ſuffocated it; a token of health, and a ſigne that Melancholy departing leaves roome and way for joy to enter. Right ſo befell it now the Prince of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> hee ſtood a good while, taking firſt the Princeſſe's hands betweene his, and diſtilling rivulets of teares out of the fountaines of his eyes, and then affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately kiſſing them, return'd her this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>I know not (incomparable Madame) when I ſhall be ever able to ſerve you, conformable to the great obligation to your more than excelling courteſie. You (Madame) cannot be faulty where you have ſoveraigne power, nor bee ſubject to puniſhment, whereas you ſway the ſcepter over all the lawes of my affections. Your nobly vouchſafing to comprehend in the better ſenſe my intereſſes, and out of your goodneſſe to accept them in good worth, is to me a ſupreame favour; but your benignely daigning to correſpond them ſurpaſſeth even all expectation of mine, much more the ſlenderneſſe of my merits: ſo as I am ſo farre unable from really requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your nobly-obliging favours by deeds, as I cannot finde apt words to expreſſe or acknowledge them. For the reſt, could I but have thought, nay hoped, that the King your Father, upon any earneſtly-ſollicitous Embaſſie of mine, could have beene wrought to beſtow you on mee, I then would (I proteſt unto you) never have preſumed to have prepoſed you your flight: but being promiſed as you are, alas! what likelihood is there for you to have (by his conſent) other husband than <hi>Erpandro?</hi> And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of your mother that I propoſed you, with the revenge that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon enſued, were never by mee intended for arguments to perſwade you (ſince I knew them farre from being availeable in that behalfe) but to ſhew you, how by them you might aſſure your ſelfe, that your reſolution ſhould be leſſe blamed and cenſured. Beſides, that I pretend not to robbe what's any other mans; for ſo you (Madame) be but pleaſed to make me (by your noble aſſent) but worthy, I will marry you ere wee part, to the end our faults (if ſuch they be) may ſeeme by ſo much the leſſe in the eyes of both heaven and the world. The Princeſſe reſolved both to felicitate and cure him, here thus interrupts him. Well, my Lord, to the end you may ſee, that there is no neede of juſtifications, behold me here at your diſpoſure, therefore (ſo you be therewith pleaſed) marry me (a-Gods-name right now in the preſence of your Cozen here; who aſtoniſhed to ſee them at that point without imparting any inckling thereof to him till then, taking off his finger a rich Diamond, <hi>(Gradamoro</hi> having then no Ring ready) reached it him to marry her therewith, as inſtantly he did; remitting the reſt to another time.</p>
                  <p>The Phyſicians being called, found his pulſe at a good <hi>paſſe,</hi> and the Queene come, he would needs take what ſhee brought him, to make her the Authreſſe of his health, and then got out of his bed the day following ſo healthſome and blithſome, as if he had not beene ſick at all. But then <hi>Vincireo</hi> could not forbeare from taxing him with diſcourteſie for the ſmall ſigne of love he ſhewed him in this occaſion of making uſe of him; When he craving him pardon, told him, that at firſt he had concealed it with out
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7474:102"/>
knowing himſelfe the reaſon why, (having entred into this buſineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expectation) and that afterwards doubting that hee would have diſſwaded him, he was confirmed in his ſilence, judging it a leſſer evill to offend by concealing his affection, than after communicating it, not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his counſell, or be in ſome way ruled by him. And being thereupon demanded, how he meant to carry the buſineſſe, now that his reſolution had excluded all other either deliberation or counſell? He anſwered, <hi>that</hi> on the very day wherein the King had ſpoken of the Marriage and ſolemn feaſts, to be kept in honour of its ſolemnization, he had diſpatched (as he alſo knew) a fleete pinnace for <hi>Cyprus,</hi> under pretext of fetching him all neceſſaries requiſite for his appearing at the jouſts, giving a-part ſecret command to the Admirall to ſend him a Galley re-enforced with all thoſe advantages that ſuch a Veſſell might have: And <hi>that</hi> having therewithall written unto his Father, to ſend him a good number of the beſt Knights of the kingdome to appeare with him in the Tourney, the Galley would come ſtrongly furniſh'd with men of warre, without giving either here or there the leaſt occaſion of ſuſpect: <hi>That</hi> aſſoone as that Galley were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he went to embarke the Princeſſe and him, and ſo paſſe all three of them over into <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Erpandro</hi> likewiſe in the ſelfe-ſame time had by land diſpatch'd a Poſte into <hi>Thrace,</hi> with newes to his Father of what was concluded on, praying him to ſend with all poſſible conveniencie, Embaſſadours for the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, proviſions for him, and Iewells for his Bride, whom he thought to conduct home through <hi>Macedon,</hi> upon conſidering with himſelfe, or being adviſed by his Councell, that being accuſtomed to ride and curious to ſee, ſhee would receive more guſt from ſuch a ſight by land, and that proſpect of the Iland by Sea, than from the ſavage-growne, or rather devaſted Countrey of the <hi>Dardans</hi> and <hi>Triballs,</hi> nor yet recovered or well re-civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized ſince the laſt warre. Requeſting therefore his Father to bee pleaſed to ſend him halfe a dozen of well-furniſht Galleyes, to expect him the far ſide of the <hi>Istmus,</hi> in which might be alſo embarked a troupe of Ladies to come meete the Princeſſe, and wayte on her in her voyage. Requiring alſo ſafe-conduct of ſuch of his confederate Princes and Kings, whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries he was to paſſe through.</p>
                  <p>The two Cozens received ſpeedily from their ſeverall Fathers the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of their particular requeſts, there arriving unto the one his Galley, and to the other his Embaſſadours hard about the ſelfe-ſame time. Meane time <hi>Deadora</hi> begins now to ſhew her-ſelfe openly diſguſted, that her Father had never ſpoken word to her touching this buſineſſe, as though the ſame no way concern'd her. Whereas indeede the good King ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there was no neede thereof, conceiving that ſhee could not but bee therewith well pleaſed, ſince the firſt thing that ſhee knew after her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the world was her being a married wife, and yet never ſhew'd her-ſelfe thereto diſaſſenting: beſides, his preſuming, that ſhee was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently told thereof by her Mother and Brother. The day of the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours arrivall, having ſent for her to him, he in <hi>Erpandro</hi>'s preſence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her them as their Princeſſe. But ſhee received them coldly, and without as much as once looking towards <hi>Erpandro:</hi> Retired ſoone after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that they were from out of the Preſence Chamber, he asked her
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7474:102"/>
why ſhee ſhewed her ſelfe ſo ſtrange. Becauſe I was ſurpriz'd at unawares (anſwered ſhee) without knowing either whoſe the Embaſſadours were, or wherefore come. Well underſtood <hi>Ormondo</hi> that this anſwer aymed at him, yet not conceiving that it contained any ſenſe more important, but well liking that her ſmart generoſity, and ſmiling thereat, (kiſſed her that he had in the forehead) he diſmiſſed her to her lodgings. Already was it murmured over the Court, that ſuch a marriage pleaſed her not, upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that (the Embaſſadours being come, and the ſolemnization of the marriage publiſhed to bee within eight dayes ſpace) ſhee made no anſwer to ſuch as wiſh'd it might prove much joyfull unto her, and that her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-ſelfe could not draw one word out of her that concluded her aſſent; but yet her making (of the other ſide) no ſhew of being mellancholy, gave no ſuſpition that ſhee meant to reject him with a flat deniall. Towards her pretended husband ſhee carried her ſelfe as ſhee was wont to doe before, in the tearmes of a kinſwoman, calling him cozen, ſmiling on him if he but ſpake of love without giving him any anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Mane times had the Queene obſerved the reciprocall inclinations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene her Nephew <hi>Gradamoro</hi> and her Daughter, and hartily would wiſh to her ſelfe, they could have beene match'd together, yet diſcovered ſhee not ſo much (for all that) as to come to know ſuch an affection in its true eſſence. For, being Cozens and bred up together in the very ſame exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and withall like in conditions, and therefore deerely-eſteeming each other, there might to their familiarity and love be well afforded other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged pretexts than a downe-right reciprocall affection. Onely Prince <hi>Ladomonte,</hi> who for being by nature of a deepe penetrating judgement, obſerved more than the reſt, might beſt of any other light on the right, ſorrowing that the effect confirmed not his ſuſpition, from his ſoule could he have wiſht that the Galley of <hi>Cyprus</hi> had beene a new <hi>Taurus,</hi> and his ſiſter another <hi>Europa;</hi> for hee loving her hartily, was ſorry to ſee her match'd againſt her will, affect he did <hi>Gradamoro</hi> exceedingly, <hi>Gradamoro</hi> tendring him no leſſe deerely, ſo as the great love betweene them ſeemed to require a greater tye of alliance, were it but to have a leſſer with <hi>Erpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro.</hi> Meane while the eight dayes began to runne the courſe of their expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the City being all over buſied in working, and more than halfe of it meerely <hi>employed</hi> for the Prince of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who ſending for all the choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt ſilkes of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and all the rareſt inventions of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> made all beleeve that he thought of nothing elſe, than to appeare with more ſumptuous curioſity, and curious pompe than all the reſt. Retired hee was into the ſhady valley betweene the Cittadell and the oppoſite Mountaine behinde the City, where having erected his Pavilions, hee did day after other nothing elſe than try himſelfe with <hi>Ladomonte</hi> in the liſts, at barriers, on foote, and on horſeback; ſometimes hand to hand, otherwhiles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, being both of them by <hi>Ormondo</hi> aſſigned to be maintainers of the liſts. Seldome was he ſeene in <hi>Deadora</hi>'s company for continuing his abode without; and chancing to meete her, hee diſcourſed with her of nothing elſe ſave horſes and liures, giving thereby all men occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that hee dream't of nothing elſe, leaving wholly to <hi>Vincireo</hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete care the ordering and appointing of both the time and manner of their flight.</p>

Foure of the eight dayes terme being expired, the Galley launch'd out of the Port, under pretext of going to take in fewell, yet at night returned without making any noyſe, and rode without the point at randome. The Princeſſe gotten out at the garden doore well arm'd, found there the two Princes that ſtood expecting her, whence taking the outmoſt way through difficult paſſages full of grubs and cragges, they got to the ſea-ſide, and there found a long-boate wherewith they embarked themſelves; and then ſuddenly the Galley ſteered a maine ſpeede towards the <hi>East,</hi> as it ſtood her indeede upon, it being but two houres before day, the night then of the ſhorteſt, and the lightſome Planet ſigning its circle a litle wide from the line of our <hi>Tropick. Gradamoro</hi> had remov'd well neere all his family to his pavilions in the valley, where they alſo were often wont to lodge, ſo as it was eaſie for him to get them embarked unperceived of any, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for his wardrope and ſtable their Officers whom he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly provide for in the valley.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deadora</hi>'s Bed-chamber-woman uſed conſtantly to enter very earely into her Chamber, and ſoftly opening the windowes for ingreſſe of the freſh morning ayre, to returne to bed againe without awaking her. That morning on the breake of day going to doe the ſame, ſhee eſpyed the bed empty, but then not beleeving her eyes, ſhee (for more aſſuring her of the truth) felt with her hand, but found her not, for ſhee was not there; yet gave ſhee not her ſelfe over (for all that) to ſcritches and cries, becauſe ſhee knew not what the matter might be. Entred into the Cloſet (whereof her Miſtreſſe ſelfe was wont to keepe the key) then wide open, ſhee might there ſee wanting her Armes and ſword. Yet could ſhee not imagine how ſhee could clothe her ſelfe, all her apparell being (aſſoone as ſhee was ſtript of them) uſually carried into a back-withdrawing Chamber, and not thence brought back againe till ſhee liſted to cloathe her ſelfe; which as ſhee ſtood muſing on, there came to her minde <hi>Vincireo</hi>'s twice comming thither, and carrying with him (by a Page) a Fardle involv'd in <hi>Taffata Sarcenet,</hi> and that come to the Chamber, he had taken it out of his hand to give it himſelfe to the Princeſſe, ſo as no body elſe knew what it was; ſhe now imagines they were mans cloathes, but fixing a more obſervant eye on all the corners about her, ſhee might eſpie on a litle by-table many letters ſealed, <hi>To the King, the Queene, and the Prince,</hi> with the three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Seales of <hi>Illirium, Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Pontus.</hi> By this certaine of the fact, and terrified with the likelihood of her being ſuſpected for a Complice, ſhee would have fled, if ſhee had knowne whither or how. Till aſſured by her conſcience, and the improbability of her ſtaying behinde them, had ſhee beene ſuch, ſhee held it her beſt courſe to bring the Queene the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The Maydes of honour marvayling that ſhee deſired to ſpeake with her at ſuch an houre, could not reſolve to goe to diſturbe her reſt, till upon her importuning them with ſolemne proteſtations, they at length ventured to awake her. Shee without ſpeaking ever a word to her, preſented her the letters, which the Queene knowing by the Seales all-amazed opened, reading in that of her Daughter (which was the firſt) the reſolution taken for which ſhee craved her humble pardon, ſhewing her punctually the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that induced her to doe it. Reading afterwards that of her Nephew, and the other, ſhee compreſſing her teares, hies her to her husbands lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7474:103"/>
who intending to aske her what ſhee made there at ſo rathe an houre, forbare his ſpeech upon receit of the letters. He firſt began to reade <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>'s, but had not the patience to reade the reaſons, having read the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; ſpeake he would in all haſte with the Gentlewoman of her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but was never a whit more ſatisfied by her; and what more could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by the ſtricteſt examinations or more diligent inquiry be learnt in it, ſince their being fled and gone was the firſt and laſt newes of it?</p>
                  <p>A good while ſtood <hi>Ormondo</hi> in a muze, as not uſed to bee tranſported with the ſudden fury of any paſſion; and then diſcreetly weighing the caſe, with calling to minde how himſelfe had done as much, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring withall, that his Daughter had made a better choyce for her ſelfe with the time, than he could have aſſigned her before the time, he both pacified himſelfe and conſolated the Queene, ſo as nothing elſe now trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, ſave the injury done <hi>Serpidoro,</hi> which he knew not how to make him amends for. But calling to minde, that hee alone was with him at ſtealing the Queene away, he thereupon ſaid; Our Daughter and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes (wife) have erred, but yet we muſt beare with them, ſince 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that they have not looked into our lives, and that our example hath not emboldened them. Here ſending for <hi>Ladomonte,</hi> he gave him his letters: By this time amazement being paſt, and reaſon return'd to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeate of reſidence, the King was no whit diſpleaſed at the change of his ſonne-in-law. The Queene (likewiſe) was glad thereof, and the Prince exceeding joyfull, was by his Father commanded to acquaint therewith <hi>Erpandro,</hi> who was like to grow wilde at it. Hee ranne to the King and Queen, and then finding no Galleyes ready in the Haven, would have leapt into the Maine, and ſwome to overtake the fled-away Veſſell. But that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring-himſelfe of the Galleyes that rode expecting him at <hi>Peloponc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> &amp; that riding-poaſte he might get thither before <hi>Gradamoro;</hi> be moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on horſe-back and ranne poaſte thitherward night and day. Arrived he ſent one of them to <hi>Zacinthus</hi> to eſpie if the other were paſſed, and was joyed at the heart when (at her returne) he underſtood, that ſhee was with a long proſpective-glaſſe deſcried to be ſo farre diſcoaſted, as a good ſight not interpoſed by the curvity of the Globe might diſcerne, and that ſhee would be more than a day a comming, calculating the ſlow courſe ſhee had ſteer'd ſithence the time of her ſetting out. And that there was placed on the Iland of <hi>Cithera</hi> a Centry, who upon her comming by night (which for certaine would not be, ſhee ſayling not by night by the proportion of their account) ſhould give notice by fire, and by day with ſmoake: So as it behoved him to tranſport himſelfe preſently to <hi>Capo Melio</hi> for being there ready to aſſayle her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Erpandro</hi> approv'd of that counſell, and launching from out the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory, at the ſmoake hee deſcried from <hi>Cithera,</hi> met and fought with her with very bad ſucceſſe: For, notwithſtanding his advantage of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Galleyes, he was (in his very owne) by the Princeſſe her ſelfe fought withall, beaten downe, and taken priſoner, whilſt two of his Galleyes were burnt, and the reſt retired. But dreſt and cured with all poſſible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, viſited, conſolated, and opportunely perſwaded to reaſon and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience by <hi>Vincirco,</hi> he not onely grew to be pacified, but alſo upon calling to minde the paſſages betweene their fathers no leſſe conſiderately than

diſcreetly conceiv'd, he had no occaſion to find himſelfe agreev'd: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon licenſing the Galleyes that made after to recover him, hee wrote to his Father, praying him not to be diſpleaſed for what had happened, ſince he (for his part) would conſerve himſelfe in the ancient love and favour of his Cozens, and be preſent at the ſolemnizing of the nuptialls, judging himſelfe fortunate, to have miſſed the marrying a woman that lov'd him not; eſpecially conſidering his being withall confident, that at his returne, King <hi>Ormondo</hi> would not faile to give him inſteed of this <hi>Cecromma</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Daughter. Arrived in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> they were received by the King with great joy and triumph; who would needs prolong the ſolemnities already commenced, and ſend Embaſſadours into <hi>Illirium, Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Pontus,</hi> who ſucceſſefully obtained ſo much of the offended as not to pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch, and conformable to his expectation, <hi>Cecronima</hi> inſteed of <hi>Deadora.

Nor waite they for now towards the celebration of the feſtivalls for ought elſe ſave the things embarked, ſo as we ſhall come time enough to ſee them, being they are to bee kept at <hi>Pafo</hi> neere the famous Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> whither they are all of them reduced to thanke the Goddeſſe for ſo proſperous an iſſue of theſe affaires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Polimero</hi> had heard talke of <hi>Ormondo</hi> and his great exploits long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which made him now very glad to heare his diſguſts thus terminated by ſo pleaſing an alliance, the old paſſage taking from him all occaſion of revenge. And right joyfull was <hi>Lindadori,</hi> to light on by the way ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne jouſts; hope alſo ſhee did, that her Father would diſpence with his haſte to be acquainted with thoſe Princes, ſhee being more eſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſee <hi>Deadora,</hi> and to try her ſelfe at Armes with her. But ſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell them, that neither <hi>Polimero</hi> had occaſion to diſpleaſe her, nor ſhee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of working her owne content; for the ſea ſwelled into ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary billowes, for being over-blowne with the rage of a tearing winde, that the Pilot was forced with haling the tack a-boord to ſtrike a hull, and laſh ſure the helme a-lee, till gaining the winde a-ſterne, he was faine to eaſe the Veſſell with a ſmall Trinket ſaile faſtned to her Maine-yard, ſo as ſhee now carried on with an exceſſive violence outranne the courſe, and leaving on the right hand <hi>Cyprus,</hi> could not poſſibly chooſe but paſſe to <hi>Creete,</hi> where with much adoe they made a ſhift to get a-ſhore.</p>
                  <p>Greatly ſteeded this Tempeſt <hi>Polimero</hi> by advancing him much on his way, beſides the pleaſure he tooke at his Daughters anger, and her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing at the ſea and windes; yet that accident afforded her another way, that which fortune had denied her for contenting her martiall humour. For that time the kingdome of <hi>Creete</hi> ſtood afflicted by a warre litle otherwiſe than civill, divided into factions, every one attempting to effect his owne peculiar ends under pretext of the publicke good, an ordinary maske wherewith the moſt ſeditious are wont to cover the true face of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

Diſpoſed then for conveniencie's cauſe to marry, and hearing famed for beauty the Princeſſe of <hi>Caria</hi> being a neighbouring kingdome, he ſends thither <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtargo,</hi> beleeving, that <hi>Carito</hi>'s King would willingly grant her him, for being demanded by ſo great an Embaſſadour as his brother, whom he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a great traine of followers, and ſtore of monies; to the end he might carry himſelfe both like a perſonage of his ranke and quality, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the greatneſſe of him that ſent him; an ordinary cuſtome in thoſe Countries not to concede men wives, till they bee firſt for ſome while wooed and ſerved by the pretenders, and (if they be Princes) by Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours in their ſteede.</p>
                  <p>This Princeſſe was (over and beſides her beauty and comely feature) an onely childe, and by conſequence heire apparant to the <hi>Caritan</hi> Crowne; In which regard <hi>Restargo</hi> allured by the occaſion of gaining himſelfe a Crowne, forgetting both his allegeance and truſt repoſed in him, did that office for himſelfe, which hee ſhould have done for his brother; whom whilſt with falſe letters he held in hand with more falſe hopes, 'twas eaſie for him (malignely procuring to be brought to the King of <hi>Caria</hi>'s eares paſſing bad relations of <hi>Cretanco)</hi> to get his daughter for himſelfe: Having wonne all the Courtiers with the prodigall effuſion of his brothers trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Cretanco</hi> thus injur'd, without making ſhew of being angry thereat, excuſed it with his wonted facility, judging it (in reſpect of its occaſions) pardonable, upon diſcourſing within himſelfe, that <hi>intereſſes of preferment make men</hi> (if they be not profeſt in the habit of vertue) <hi>from very good to become exceeding bad;</hi> yet knew he how to be ſo much angry (for all that) as to forbid him for comming ever more in his ſight, and that become now ſucceſſor of a kingdome, he ſhould keepe him within its limits, without venturing to returne into <hi>Creete:</hi> For the reſt, he neither medled with his patrimoniall Dominions, nor came to thoſe termes, whereto juſtly incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Kings are wont to come to.</p>

his colour for ſo long a time, thinking that juſtice became now cruelty, and that the revenge exceeded the injury, eſpecially in a brother; not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering (as he ſhould have done) that his brother had his affects corrupted, and that ſuch a man as had beene once wicked, ſhould be ever preſuppoſed to be ſuch. <hi>Restargo</hi> inſteede of repenting (waxen now more wicked than before) provides in a few dayes from <hi>Caria</hi> in ſmall diſordered companies a good band of men, beſides thoſe of his owne State, and knew ſo well how to doe ill, that depoſing his brother from his Royall Throne, he put him in the very ſame priſon that he had kept him ſeven yeares in, and then ſending for (together with his wife) new forces, he aſſumed the title of Governour with his other brother, affirming the King to be unable to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, ſpeculations having brought him to be now dotiſh and good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>The ſeven yeares being paſt, <hi>Riverargo</hi> thinking to obtaine of <hi>Restargo</hi> for <hi>Cretaneo</hi> ſuch liberty, as <hi>Cretaneo</hi> had before granted him for <hi>Restargo,</hi> mov'd him earneſtly for it; but <hi>where two natures are different, 'tis certaine that their effects cannot but be unlike;</hi> Which we may heare confirmed by the example of <hi>Restargo,</hi> who judging <hi>Riverargo</hi>'s pitty to be too-too-ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhewed him; That in ſetting him at liberty, he ſhould commit a fourth errour, whilſt the three former (one his, and <hi>Cretanco</hi>'s two) pointed at it ſo apparantly. His, when building on his brothers over-good nature, hee came and put himſelfe like a ſheepe into his hands. <hi>Cretaneo</hi>'s firſt, when depriving him of his liberty, he bereav'd him not alſo of his life; and the other, that he reſtored him to the one without taking away the other: yet that having then err'd both of them without a precedent example, they were in ſome ſort excuſe-worthy; but that now a fourth errour would be altogether inexcuſable, and yet more eſpecially this of his, for offending ſo groſſely againſt the rule of the former three. Offend he ſhould againſt the firſt, in relying againe on that good nature, which he had already found paſſionate in a caſe of a leſſe offence; and alſo expoſe himſelfe againſt the ſecond and third with danger of life, having at both their coſts learnt, That <hi>fierce beaſts will not endure the goade's pricking, but must be either pierced quite through, or not touch'd at all.</hi> Nay though it ſo were not, yet even common ſenſe taught him, that <hi>a perſon injured never pardons, unleſſe he be either extraordinarily good, or irrevocably fooliſh.</hi> Now he but too well knew, that <hi>Cretaneo</hi> was no foole though they indeed made of him ſuch; nor yet that good natured man they tooke him for, having beene ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly wedded to his anger for ſeven yeares ſpace. And 'though yet he were as good-natur'd as man can be yet were it bad relying on it, ſince a man is chang'd in an inſtant, eſpecially where the Clock of good nature hath for counterpoyſes paſſions and injuries. Beſides, that he ſhould not loſe the quality of good, Revenge in Kings writing it ſelfe in great Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters <hi>IVSTICE.</hi> With ſuch reaſons, he not onely ſatisfied, but terrified <hi>Riverargo,</hi> but more eſpecially by making him comprehend himſelfe to be a complice in the fault, for having (of his owne proper authority) enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled himſelfe Governour, perſwading him therefore to governe thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwards with the title no more of Governours, but of Kings. Agreed on't, they conſecrated in Mount <hi>Ida</hi> Prieſt to <hi>Iove, Laſcaro</hi> onely ſonne to <hi>Cretaneo,</hi> and cauſing him to renounce his pretences both to the Crowne

and all worldly things elſe, they neceſſitated him to flie; For, being (for his puſillanimity) hated of his fathers friends, he not onely wanted the things neceſſary for his lives ſuſtenance, but had alſo his feares increaſed in ſuch a manner, that ſuſpecting to be one day ill intreated, he went his way whither no newes was ever ſithence heard of him.</p>
                  <p>Meane while the two Kings commanded equally, and cauſed money to be coyned under their ſtampes, images, and names, writing themſelves Kings over all; till ſuch time as <hi>Restargo</hi> deſirous to reigne alone, told the other, <hi>That</hi> the people could not brooke two Kings, a novelty (to ſpeake the truth) monſtrous and exampleleſſe: <hi>That</hi> he therefore had deſigned to take for his part the Dukedomes of <hi>Cidone</hi> and <hi>Ritinna</hi> united, and leave to his brother ſolely both the Kingdome and Royall Title, ſo to prevent with the diſguſt the inſurrection of the people. But <hi>Riverargo</hi> (a lover of eaſe) thinking the both States equalled both the title and kingdome, advantaged with the being freed from the weight of government, anſwered him; that it was no reaſon, that he being the youngeſt ſhould remaine ſolely King, the eldeſt excluded: In which reſpect, ſince an unity was ſo neceſſary, he was content to accept of the two States, and cede him the kingdome. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtargo</hi> then being proclaimed King, there was no more tidings heard of <hi>Cretaneo,</hi> followed a litle after by the new King, who left both his life and kingdome: Him ſucceeded <hi>Caricreto</hi> his onely ſonne, but being cockred up by his Mother in paſſing bad cuſtomes, odious to the Subjects, together with the domination of the <hi>Carians</hi> to them inſupportable, they baniſh'd him, and choſe for their King <hi>Riverargo,</hi> taking the occaſion of his then abſence, as being conducted by his Mother to <hi>Caria,</hi> to be thereof crowned King, his Grandfather by then being dead: And now he pretends as his patrimony the kingdome of <hi>Riverargo,</hi> and with the favour of his Fathers ſervants moves warre againſt him, publickely complaining to all of the wrong he did him, by him not denied, in caſe <hi>Caricreto</hi> had beene ſonne to <hi>Cretaneo</hi> and not to <hi>Restargo;</hi> alleadging, that <hi>Restargo</hi> was no King buta Tyrant, for depriving <hi>Cretaneo</hi> of the priviledge firſt of Nature, in taking from him his wife; next of the Law in uſurping his Crowne, and laſtly of humanity in cauſing him to dye in the miſerable lothſomneſſe of a cloſe &amp; naſtie priſon. And that he (for his part) was freely elected King by the States of the Realm without any ſiniſter practice or corruption. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that if he were to lay downe the Crowne, it ſhould then be to reſtore it to <hi>Cretaneo</hi>'s, but not to <hi>Restargo</hi>'s ſonne. In theſe confuſions ſtood then that goodly kingdome, battered by the armes of the <hi>Carians,</hi> ſupported by many Barons, with an intention, when they had depoſed <hi>Riverargo</hi> to chaſe away afterwards the Mother and Sonne, and ſo to carry away from the publick calamities private emoluments, making themſelves Maſters of both the money and Royall authority in thoſe Provinces, wherein obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was denied <hi>Riverargo,</hi> whereas <hi>Caricreto</hi> was but in a ſhew obeyed neither.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Polimero</hi> with his companions ſetting foote on ground, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing from theſe confuſions, (leaving the Knight of <hi>Cyprus</hi> ſicke a-boord the ſhip) tooke their way to a hill-wards, to ſee if they might thence deſcry any habitation. Come thither that they were, they found on the other ſide of it an ambuſh of fifty horſe, who asking them (after the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7474:106"/>
military wont) <hi>who liv'd?</hi> and receiving no anſwer, ſuddenly aſſail'd them. <hi>Lindadori</hi> that had with impatience long'd for tourneyes, jouſts, and barriers, was (miſſing of theſe) beyond all expreſſion joyfull to light ſo unexpectedly on a battell; ſo as without ſtaying for any other to give her example by leading the way, ſhee furiouſly forced her paſſage into the mid'ſt of that Troupe, neither conſidering nor caring for the advantages of the ſite, but neceſſitating the others to follow, either to free her, or dye with her: But the valorous effects correſponded to the mayden's undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heart.</p>
                  <p>Theſe folkes had ſcowr'd the field all that night, got good ſtore of bootyn, ruined houſes, and burnt Villages; yet of all their ſpoyles the nobleſt was <hi>Ermestea</hi> daughter to the Baron of <hi>Manetuſa,</hi> among the faire ones of <hi>Creete</hi> the faireſt, and among the nobleſt the flowre of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The Souldiers ſtood now a watching her; for though ſhee was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly afflicted, yet had now the extreame wearineſſe of her body in ſo long and incommodious a journey given truce to the affliction of her ſpirit, and procur'd her ſleepe, though interrupted by her waking griefe, and hardneſſe of the bed, eaſie onely in that part that her teares had ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And now at the ſound of <hi>Lindadori</hi>'s thundering blowes ſhe awooke, ſtarted up, broke the truce with griefe, and confederated with hope, who placing himſelfe as her guard in the bulwarke of her breſt, boldly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her (though with much adoe) againſt the aſſaults of her cruell enemy [Feare]; yet was ſhee hurried againe neere the gaſtly precipice of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, when ſhe ſaw her ſelfe remounted on horſe-back by the Souldiers, to convey her farther on, under the conduct of ſome fifteene of them, but that ſuſpenſion tormented her not long. For <hi>Lindadori</hi> imagining her by her teares to be a prey of thoſe people, ranne thither alone forcing to fight them, who in reſpect of their being ſo many, made an account to exempt themſelves from the neceſſity of ſharing of the battell. Off cuts ſhee at firſt blow the hand of him that held her by the bridle, and him that at lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her into the ſaddle, was ſuddenly ſo taken with her, as hee could not forgoe his hold of the skirt of her coate, ſhee paſſed with a thruſt through the heart, ſo as one wound was cured by the other. A certaine experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that <hi>the weapon's ſtabbes cure thoſe of love. Eromena</hi> ſeeing her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inconſiderate in all dangers, as reſolutely followed her, and ſlaying ſome of them, both ſhee and her daughter were conſtrained to retire to the hillock, cloſely purſued by above twenty of the Enemies; the whole company (leaving the priſoners and baggadge) now facing towards the aſſailers, thinking they did no ſmall act, if they but defended themſelves united together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Polimero</hi> ſeeing his wife and daughter in ſuch a plight, was raging-mad that he could not come to releeve them for the wall of ſo many men that ſtood in his way, whilſt <hi>Don Elcimos</hi> had the fortune to open it of his ſide (where was leſſe throng) with the death of one of them, whence he ranne and laid at their backs, himſelfe being no otherwiſe ſtrucken at by ſuch as purſued him at the heeles. <hi>Polimero</hi> by this time leſſe charged, and by the good old Count of <hi>Bona</hi> valiantly aſſiſted, made ſuch havock of the reſt, as that he gained the paſſage; and running to reſcue his company, made a ſhift betweene him and the Count to eaſe them of foure, by them ſlaine
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7474:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ere they were aware of their comming; yet too much would they have had to doe though, if fortune had not by another meanes favoured them; for the ſouldiers being hardy, well armed, and reſolved either to ſave their prey or dye, never thought of running away, their horſes being all laden with pillage; and although they had loſt many of their company, yet had they ſo many left as they hoped to get the beſt of their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by worrying if not vanquiſhing them. And ſo had it by all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility befallen them, if the faire <hi>Ermestea</hi> (gotten looſe and flying backe the way whence ſhee was led) had not met a Knight, who hearing ſhe was taken away, was comming with a good troupe of horſe to reſcue her. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding how ſhee was fled away, and that too, rather to goe finde out ſome to ayde the five Knights, than to ſave her ſelfe, ſhe haſtily return'd to ſhew him the place, whence they might heare the cries and blowes ere they deſcried the Combatants; this aſſault quite ruined the ſouldiers firſt hopes, now that they were aſſail'd by two parties; the reſcuing Knight having the edge of his valour ſharpned with revenge and anger againſt thoſe men, inſomuch, as he was loath to receive into his mercie ſuch of them as yeelded themſelves unto him, judging that ſuch deſerv'd no faire quarter, which warred againſt women, beauty, and their merits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ermestea</hi> alighting off her Steede, ranne to the Knights, whom ſhee could not finde ſufficient conceits to expreſſe her beholdingneſſe unto, a thing ordinary for a gratefull minde to ſuffocate it ſelfe in words, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make them ſerve for erres of the effects it thinkes it ſelfe tied to performe. But to <hi>Lindadori</hi> above all the reſt ſtrove ſhe to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a greater obligation, to whoſe lot befell the being the more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious (if not the prime) cauſe of her deliverance: Wounded they were all five, ſo as <hi>Caraſio</hi>'s hands had wherewithall to employ them, but with ſuch felicity, that as no one of them had any dangerous wound, ſo was there as few of them that any way bemoaned their paine. But <hi>Lindadori</hi> more ſhrewdly wounded than the reſt, and being in reſpect of both her age and ſex more tender and delicate, wrought amazement in all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, how ſhee, being in all things elſe over-ſenſitive and impatient, was yet in her ſufferings even inſenſible, and farre from bemoaning her ſelfe or troubling any body. Very importunate was <hi>Ermestea</hi> to have them home with her: But <hi>Polimero</hi> (conſidering that the courteſies of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages had no limits of time, and how much it ſtood him upon to hold on his way, his affaires admitting of no delay) fairely excus'd himſelfe, yet with aſſuring her, that to doe her ſervice he would have omitted all buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his owne. But ſithence this was but meerely in conſideration of themſelves, they were neceſſitated (without loſſe of time) to paſſe further. But the owner of the ſhip not yeelding to any perſwaſions of paſſing them any farther, his Veſſell being fraighted for <hi>Cyprus,</hi> they were forced to accept of the invitation, for being conſtrained to furniſh themſelves of a new Veſſell. Satisfying then the Marriners, and taking their leave of the ſick Knight, (by whom the Count fail'd not to excuſe himſelfe by letter to <hi>Gradamoro</hi> and <hi>Deadora)</hi> they mounted on horſe-back, <hi>Ermeſtea</hi> cauſing the booty to be brought back to be reſtored to its owners. And then after having releaſed the priſoners, ſetting on a round pace homewards, whom might ſhee meete a litle onwards but the Baron her Father, that with two
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7474:107"/>
hundred horſe came running after the track of thoſe that had ſtolne her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, whoſe joyes were now by ſo much the greater, by how much they were leſſe expected.</p>
                  <p>The wounded Knights were accommodated at their eaſe with Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers neere one another, as they had deſired; and ſerved with ſuch reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive diligence, as if they had beene knowne for what they were. <hi>Polimero</hi> not neglecting to ſollicite for a new paſſage, wherein for doubt of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him <hi>Ermestea</hi> fail'd him not. Newes came (the meane while) that the nuptialls were celebrated in <hi>Cyprus</hi> with great ſolemnity, the flawes in friendſhip occaſioned by new injuries being ſodred up by the old affronts, and both reduced to a confirm'd friendſhip by a new realliance. And for domeſtick affaires; <hi>That</hi> King <hi>Riverargo</hi> by a great defeate given the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> had totally chaſed them from <hi>Creete; that Caricreto</hi> was thence fled, his men ſlaine, the field ſack'd, foure Barons beheaded, the Rebels hung up on trees in ſuch places as they chanced to be taken in; All newes, that to the houſe of <hi>Ermeſtea</hi> brought incredible conſolation, it having ever ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken part with the royall ſide, whereof who-ſo knowes not how to bee, knowes how to periſh. <hi>Cromeno</hi> (the Knight that had releev'd them) was he that brought them theſe newes, having (when he had conducted them to the houſe) taken leave of them to goe and make one in the battell which he knew was to be preſented the Enemies. The Count of <hi>Bona</hi> had ſome while before related to the Princes the ſtory of <hi>Corianna,</hi> and praid them to touch at <hi>Ericuſa,</hi> and thereupon had that ſuite of his without any great difficulty granted him; for which end there was provided them a Veſſell for that part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ermestea</hi> in the meane time had obſerved and perceived the counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſex of the two Princeſſes, whereupon ſhee en quired thereof further of <hi>Lindadori,</hi> who could not conceale from her her condition, obtaining in recompence thereof her promiſe to come to <hi>Sardinia</hi> to ſee her, of whoſe company ſhee was already ſo enamoured, as ſhe could never be from her: Which obſerved by her lover <hi>Cromeno,</hi> occaſioned him to aſſay the ſharpe ſtings of poyſoned jealouſie. Return'd he was from the Campe, and for enjoying <hi>Ermeſtea</hi>'s company frequented the houſe, entertaining the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne Princes with reſpective obſervance for finding in them conditions ſurpaſſing any contrary affect, jealouſie not depriving him of his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their merits. But the two young Ladies taking notice of his paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſufferings made it their paſtime. And although <hi>Ermeſtea,</hi> that truly loved him, had indeed compaſſion of him; yet could ſhe not (for all that) forbeare from heart-vexing him for the nonce, with the favours which boldly without ſhewing him any reſpect, ſhee did every day more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Lindadori.</hi> A paſſe that put him (poore Gentleman) to ruminate on ſtrange thoughts; ſince although himſelfe was now favoured as he was wont to be, yet ſaw he a rivall before his face as good as courted, and that in ſuch a manner too, that ſhe ſeem'd to hold it lawfull for her ſo to doe. Sometime it would come to his minde to ſpeake to her of it, but then ſeeing her with a pleaſing and ſmiling countenance ſlip away from him, he knew not what to judge of it, eſpecially when ſhee would (which was yet worſe) as ſhee thus fled from him, runne directly to <hi>Lindadort,</hi> who diſcovering the buſineſſe to her Mother, made her a third <hi>participant</hi> of their paſtime.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7474:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Yet this ſport laſted but a few dayes, for the ſhip being furniſhed of its neceſſaries and the horſes embarked, they tooke their leave. <hi>Ermeſtea</hi> ſeeming to be diſſolved into teares for ſo hard a ſeparation, and confirming her promiſe of going to ſee them aſſoone as ſhee were married, which ſhee was ſhortly to be with her ſo pleaſingly-made-jealous <hi>Cromeno.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Baron and all the reſt were not a litle offended at her for not better concealing her affection to <hi>Lindadori;</hi> but underſtanding afterwards who ſhee and the others were, he was as much then diſpleaſed on the other ſide, that ſhee revealed them not to him or her Mother: Onely <hi>Cromeno</hi> was joyed at the heart, to heare they were ſuch, being never a whit aſhamed of ſuffering himſelfe to be ſo deluded by two Girles; the remaining whereof being by her Mother chidden for it, thus excuſed her ſelfe: You blame me (Madame) for what you ſhould (under favour) rather commend mee for; you know how wee are by men held to be blabs, which induced me by ſilence to ſhew, that we can (if need be) lock up ſecrets in the cabinets of our breſts better than they can.</p>
                  <p>Favoured with a gentle gale, proſperouſly ſayles on the valorous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany without lighting (for a good ſpace of time) on any adventure, for giving me time and leaſure to get me elſe-where.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Olmiro Lucano</hi>'s ſervant (that was ſent to <hi>Parthenope</hi> by the Princeſſe <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianna</hi> in pilgrims weede) came thither in a few dayes, without lighting on any remarkeable encounter by the way; and having got him a lodging in a Lane behinde <hi>Lucano</hi>'s houſe, he tooke on him to bee a paſſenger bound for <hi>Sicily,</hi> to accompliſh a vow he had made to the Goddeſſe <hi>Ceres:</hi> His Hoſte told him, that to goe thither was at that preſent very dangerous; it being not as yet knowne how that King was inclined; who although hee had indeede no cauſe to thinke himſelfe injured, was nevertheleſſe much ſuſpected for his extravagant whimſees and exceſſive pride. <hi>Olmiro</hi> asking the reaſon why, was by the other told of the loſſe of the Princeſſe gone away no man knew how or whither; onely it was probably conjectured, that one of the two Dukes that were found ſlaine in the Caſtle had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed her away. But becauſe it could not be learnt out which of them it was, the King who went to wrack his ſpite on their corpes, was with much adoe perſwaded to grant them to their friends, ſuch a revenge being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly taken on the innocent of them, and prejudiciall to his honour and Royall dignity; ſince it could not but ſuggeſt to the world diſguſtfull matter of diſpleaſing diſcourſes: <hi>That</hi> being (upon this) retired to his royall <hi>Poggio</hi> (whither hee admitted no man) he was ſundry times like to dye for griefe: <hi>That</hi> the Queene too ſickned ſo dangerouſly, as her life was much doubted of: <hi>That</hi> all the Nobility and prime Gentry were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired home to their owne manſions and eſtates, except the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Lucania;</hi> who having ſent home to her territories her ſonnes corps, would not follow it thither, out of a conceit that ſhee had of having him preſent with her; never ſithence ſtirring out of her Chamber, but keeping its windowes cloſe ſhut, ſo as it is doubted, that in a few dayes ſhee is like to follow him, by breaking her heart with griefe: <hi>That</hi> Embaſſadours and forreine agents were faine to have recourſe to the Lords of the Councell, who diſpatched ſuch affaires as they could: <hi>That</hi> the City (thus deprived of the Court and Nobility, lived in great miſery, the houſes being tennant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7474:108"/>
the wares unvented, and no money ſtirring; a loſſe that <hi>Parthenope</hi> is like for a long time to feele the ſmart of: And as for <hi>Sicily,</hi> that its Prince comming to fetch his Bridegroome, had (even at his launching out) met the Galley that was ſpeeded him with that dolorous newes, whereat hee burſt out into tearmes that exceeded the bounds of all gravity, modeſty, and civility: His Father worſe yet than he, a doting, turbulent, wavering, and ſpitefull old man, aggravating the conceived affront done them.</p>
                  <p>Much was <hi>Olmiro</hi> troubled in minde at theſe newes, not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it grieved him to heare them, as for that humane hopes, though foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on dreames, do yet ſo dilate themſelves in deſpairing conſolations, as if they chance to be croſt or fruſtrated by confirmed certainties of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, then the griefe for them increaſes an hundred fold. But whileſt hee ſtood muzing what to doe, he might from out the window ſee paſſing by his old Camerade <hi>Erinnio,</hi> his ſomtimes fellow-waiter in <hi>Lucano</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; upon this he hems and ſpits to make him caſt up his eye: The other not knowing him with a cloſe-ſhaven beard in ſuch an habit, (ſeeing him make ſignes to him to come up and make no words of him) beheld him more obſervantly, till by a peculiar geſture of <hi>Olmiro</hi> he came to know him. Glad then that it was he, he likewiſe made ſignes that hee was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up to him: Now ſome of <hi>Lucano</hi>'s meaner ſervants were ſometimes wont to goe drinke in that houſe, ſo as it was an eaſie matter for <hi>Erinnio</hi> to finde an excuſe to goe thither to aske for a horſe-keeper: But being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the Hoaſt, that none of their houſhold had beene there ſince their Lords death, he affirmed that he had ſeene him at the window: The Hoaſt aſſured him that hee was miſtaken, praying him withall (in caſe he beleeved him not) to goe himſelfe up and ſee, telling him, that all the roomes above-ſtaires were open, without any other living ſoule in them ſave a poore pilgrim. <hi>Erinnio</hi> gotten up the ſtaires, in great haſte told him at a breath, that he could not ſpeake with him there, but wiſh'd him to come at two a clock at night to the ſecret doore that lead to their Maſters Lodgings, where he ſhould finde him ready to let him in. And then retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning downe, he told the Hoaſt that he was indeede in the right; howbeit that the pilgrim from a farre off reſembled much the horſe-keeper who wore his beard cloſe ſhaven as this man had his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Olmiro</hi> miſſed not the houre appointed; the firſt thing he ask'd <hi>Erinnio</hi> was, How he got to ſtay in the houſe after the death of their Lord? My Lord (anſwered him <hi>Erinnio)</hi> is (God be thanked) yet alive, 'though hee can leade but a dying life, till ſuch time as he recover the Princeſſe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate their affaires. <hi>Olmiro,</hi> rapt with unexpected joy, with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of one tranſported beyond himſelfe, gladſomely replies: Is it poſſible (my deere <hi>Erinnio)</hi> that my Lord is yet alive; oh let mee bleſſe mine eyes with the deere ſight of him; bring me, oh bring mee quickly unto him! and I'le bring him newes of the Princeſſe; for ſhee it was that ſent me hither. <hi>Erinnio</hi> embracing him anew, lead him the way in, having already made the Duke acquainted with his comming. Aſcended that they had the ſtaires, they found him with a viſſage pale and wanne, laid all along on a low velvet couch. <hi>Olmiro</hi> knew not whether hee were awake or no; or if he were, yet did <hi>Lucano, Erinnio,</hi> the Chirurgeon (that ſtood apart) and the very houſe it ſelfe ſeeme in his extaſied eyes to bee viſions
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7474:108"/>
and ghoſts; howſoever, his joy was ſuch, as hee falling flat to the ground lay melting himſelfe for meere over-joy into briniſh teares, deprived of the power of ſtirring from thence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucano</hi> more yet tranſported than hee, had not freed his ſpeech for a long time from the priſon of a more than extazied paſſion, if his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient deſire of knowing how the Princeſſe did, had not burſt open the gates of his ſilence. <hi>Olmiro</hi> acquainted him with all that had befallen her, the place ſhee dwelt in, the griefe that tyrannized over her, the daily ſelfe-waſting life ſhee lead, her dreames of him, and imaginations that the wind was his ſpirit come to ſee her; of his beloved name's being call'd upon, invoked, and cried out unto, both in light and darkeneſſe, with the orders given him to goe learne what had happened ſince her departure: That, in caſe <hi>Lucano</hi> were (according to the relation of ſignes) alive, hee might then come to finde her out; and if dead, that ſhee might begge of death the favour of being joyned with him. In ſumme, <hi>Olmiro</hi> forgot no one particular to make even cruelty it ſelfe become compaſſionate, and the direct hatred well-affecting. But all was (God wot) but ſuperfluous for <hi>Lucano,</hi> to whom the ſufferings of <hi>Corianna</hi> were aggravations of hearts griefe; he could not endure to heare the end of her ſtory, ſo rent was his affectionate heart with what hee had already heard of it, though by fits eaſed by the hope hee conceived of correſponding her obligements with equivalent gratitude.</p>
                  <p>The relation being ended, <hi>Olmiro</hi> (ſaid hee) I will not thanke thee for thy fidelity, becauſe honeſt men (as thou art) pretend not ſuch a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their merits; nor yet for the toyle thou haſt endured, ſince I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelfe, that the love thou haſt ever borne me, not onely takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the irkſomneſſe of it, but withall makes it pleaſing and delightſome unto thee. I only thanke thee for having endeavoured to keepe me (whom thou thought'ſt to be dead) alive in the life of her, for whom alone I deſire to live or dye: I thanke thee for the good newes thou brought'ſt me; and for having taken me out of the jawes of a more-than cruell death, which was the not knowing where ſhe was. But firſt of all I render hearty thankes unto the immortall powers, that have raiſed mee up ſo benignely from ſo low a fall. But tell me <hi>Olmiro,</hi> ſhall we goe now preſently? And with that ſtarting off his bed, hee haſtily walkes the round of the Chamber, love cauſing him to make that way in an inſtant, which lay ſubject to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of time. But <hi>Olmiro</hi> (that ſaw him ſo heart-ſick of an heart-burning feaver of affection, that hee raved with deſire) thus anſwered him. Our parting ſhall be when it ſhall pleaſe you, my Lord. Wee cannot ſollicite it ſo much, as for the Princeſſe ſake we ſhould; an houre to her is an eternity. Time (as your ſelfe have found by proofe) is in conſolations and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures moſt ſwift, in afflictions and hopes ſlow if not immoveable: Yet ſhould I (for all that) be ſorry to ſee harme done by ſeeking to doe good, which cannot but happen, in caſe you being not (I doubt me) as yet well recovered, ſhould hazard your life, in too ſoone undergoing this voyage; the ſame <hi>Erinnio</hi> alſo told him: But hee ſtill ſtanding conſtant to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of parting ſuddenly, was at length diſſwaded by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the want of a fit habit to goe diſguiz'd in, and the neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the reſolution thereof to the will of his Mother, for not cauſing her
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7474:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to fall from one griefe into another. Here ſeeing how impatiently-deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Olmiro</hi> was to know how hee was brought to life againe: I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count unto thee my ſelfe (ſaid he) the things ſucceeded ſince <hi>Carildo</hi> and thou parted'ſt, leaving me (to your thinking) dead.</p>
                  <p>The claſhing noyſe of the ſwords awoke the Captaine of the Caſtle, who thereupon came downe; and finding us both ſlaine, could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how wee came by our deaths, much leſſe how wee entred into the Caſtle; ſo as he being thereat no leſſe amaz'd than afrighted, grew to bee yet more afraid, when he found the gate to the ſea-ward wide open, which becauſe none ſave the Princeſſe had any key of, hee went inſtantly to her lodgings, where cauſing her Ladies to ariſe to goe and awake her, there was no Princeſſe to be found. Thou maiſt eaſily gheſſe what a caſe he was in, who was oft-times minded to caſt himſelfe into the ſea, and had, but for the inward comfort of his aſſured innocencie, undoubtedly drown'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Behoove him it did to acquaint the King with it inſtantly, buſineſſe of ſuch importance enduring no delayes: But yet to abandon the Caſtle in ſuch a time might bring him to merit through juſtice that puniſhment, which he feared would be inflicted on him meerely out of a furious anger; and againe, to truſt another in ſuch an affaire was dangerous, one word miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived being able to occaſion his utter ruine, much more if ſpoken to his diſadvantage.</p>
                  <p>There was the chiefe Chamberlaine (as thou know'ſt) to the Princeſſe the Count of <hi>Cana</hi> a noble and honoured <hi>Cavalier,</hi> he, becauſe there was no other fit for ſuch an employment, reſolved to be the meſſenger of theſe diſmall tidings. And underſtanding by that dayes watch, that neither of us was come in, hee imagined that wee got in (and ſo indeed wee did) by night under the priviledged names of the Princeſſe's ſervants. On he went, and turned the Pallace topſie-turvy, ſaying he muſt needs ſpeake with the King inſtantly: Brought in, he related him the caſe. The King riſing up in a fury ſent to call the Admirall, whom he gave ſudden order to ſearch every creeke of the ſea (knitting with that his threatning browes, and framing his mouth in a wrying poſture in ſaying) to find out his Daughter. Wee the meane while lay diſtended on the cold ſurface of our Mother Earth, litle regarding ought that was a doing againſt us, the Conſtable and his being dead indeed, and I in ſuch a plight, as no man imagined that I had any life in me. The King was once minded to have us both hang'd up by the feete by the beames of the Draw-bridge; but his conſideration laying before the eyes of his judgement, that one of us two was innocent, though he could not come to know which of us both it was, wrought him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how unfitting it was for imagination to uſurpe the place of certainty, in a caſe ſo doubtfull, with perſons of ſo eminent a quality, ſo as he came at laſt though with much adoe to be entreated to give way that our corps ſhould be reſtored to our friends, forbidding us though funerall Rites, and all ceremoniall pompe: All which ſucceeded to my great advantage, ſince there was no man in all the Court that thought me not guilty, now that the ſucceſſe of the caſe opened the generall eye to take notice of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe's favours, which before were ſufficiently obſerved, but yet of all men taken and conſtrued as ceremonious reſpects due to my birth, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my Mother, and parity of our yeares.</p>

                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:7474:109"/>
My Mother being made acquainted with the caſe, was by ſome one or other counſelled to ſend ſpeedily for my body, which having all the night long laine expoſed to the benumming coldneſſe of the piercing ayre, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out (for ought I beleeve) one drop of blood left in it, was thereupon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently brought home in a cloſe Horſe-litter: But whilſt <hi>Erinnio</hi> inconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably ſtood weeping over me, doing me (as he thought) the laſt ſervices I ſhould ever ſtand in neede of; having ſtript mee to waſh off the blood, and embalme me, hee found that part of my body that lay next my heart warme and panting: which hee diſcreetly concealing to himſelfe, found meanes to ridde him of all the company-ſtanders by, ſave onely <hi>Tideno</hi> and the Chirurgion thou there ſeeſt; who upon his making it knowne, that I had yet life in me, throwing haſtily aſide his inſtruments, prepared for opening and imbowelling me, fell to dreſſing me with applications ſo cordiall, that I in a ſhort time recovered my ſpirits, but yet ſo weake and benumm'd, by reaſon of the great quantity of blood I had loſt, and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the raw nocturnall ayre that had poyſoned the wound, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd two dayes ſpeechleſſe.</p>
                  <p>Having thus dreſt me, they knew not how to make my Mother acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, without incurring the danger of diſcovering all with their own ſudden gladſomneſſe; till <hi>Erinnio</hi> takes on him the charge of managing the buſineſſe; who leaving with mee the other two, went to the place, where ſhee (wofull woman) with her haire all diſheveled, ſate weeping among a great company of Ladies, that ſtood buſied in comforting her the beſt they could: He then whiſpering the ſecret in the eare of her woman <hi>Antea,</hi> ſoone deviſed a way to get them all out. Left thus alone, <hi>Erinnio</hi> acquainted her, how they had found and left me in ſo hopefull a plight, as the Chirurgion doubted not of my life, upon the aſſurance hee had of the wounds not being mortall: Yet with putting her in minde, that if then ſhe ſhewed not her prudence in diſcreetly-depreſſing her joy, the ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience would much exceed the firſt.</p>
                  <p>At theſe unexpected newes my poore Mother was ſo over-joyed, as ſhee fell in a ſwound; and that was indeed even it that <hi>Erinnio</hi> deſired; who thereupon ranne out of the Chamber, calling no leſſe haſtily than lowdly for water, and crying out that the Dutcheſſe was ſtone dead. The Ladies return'd all in againe; and having laid her abed unlaced her, whilſt others were buſied in ſpirting and ſprinkling water in her face, to bring her againe to her ſpeech which ſhee had loſt, for an occaſion quite contrary to what was by outward likelihood by the ſpectators conjectured. Come then againe to her ſelfe, ſhee ſaid.</p>
                  <p>I kindely thanke you (my Ladies all) for the charitable offices you doe me, I pray the Gods reward you for mee, ſithence to mee being in their hands, and under their afflicting rod, there reſts no other ſpirit, than to crave them mercy, and to yeeld them thankes for having given me a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to conforme and ſubject my will to theirs. I beſeech you to aſſiſt my prayers with yours, that they thruſt me not out of their ſight; and that we may the better doe it, be pleaſed (I pray you) to retire you all, to the end that the meditation of my faults, and my ſorrow for having offended them may ſo increaſe in mee, as may either rid me of the extreame hearts-griefe which I am overcharged with at this preſent, or make me apt and able to

ſupport it rather according to the law of Grace, than to that of Nature. Theſe pitty-moving words drew freſh teares from the eyes of all there preſent, inſomuch as many of them would not avoyde the roome: Till ſome of the diſcreeteſt (perceiving that the inſtance was not ceremonious, and that great griefes have their exhalations from themſelves rather than from any other ground, and are withall ſooneſt ſtopped by being ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) perſwaded the reſt to avoyde the roome, leaving with her onely her domeſtick ſervants, from whom alſo ſhe quickly found meanes to free her ſelfe, to come and ſee me. By this time they had convaid mee into that Chamber there that's next hers; and in this roome wherein lay my (to their then thinking) dead corps, <hi>Erinnio</hi> had placed my Coffin full of heavy things with another leſſer one for my bowels, ſo as ſhee needed not to goe further than from her Chamber to mine: Vpon this ſhee told them, that ſhee deſired to be left all alone, and then bid <hi>Antca</hi> lock the doore, and ſo leaving her in truſt to keepe it, with <hi>Erinnio</hi>'s helpe roſe up on her feete trembling for feare of being obſerved or diſcovered: Aſſoone as ſhe ſaw mee alive, ſhee had much adoe to keepe herſelfe from ſwounding: Faine would ſhee have embraced me, but that my wound (that paſſed from my throate quite through the neck-joynt into the head, not touching (by good fortune) the Weaſon-pipe) was ſo ſore, as that I could not endure to bee touched; yet could not the extremity of my agony ſo ſtupifie my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as not both to know her, and with beteared eyes to expreſſe the ſorrow that I conceived for the affliction and greife that I had drawne on her, in gratefull expreſſion whereof I with a reverent affection touch'd her hand, and uſed (becauſe I could not ſpeake) all the outward expreſſions I could poſſibly imagine to comfort her: Heere underſtanding by the Chirurgion anew that he warranted my life, ſhee conſidered with her ſelfe, how ſhee might beſt keepe the buſineſſe concealed. The maine heads whereto her reſolutions were reduced to, were; <hi>That</hi> leaving her bed-chamber for being too neere to that where my corps had beene, ſhee ſhould remove into the other on the farre ſide of it (ſhee her ſelfe or <hi>Antea</hi> keeping the key of it) to the end that her Gentlewomen might neither heare me, nor the trampling of thoſe that came to ſerve mee: <hi>That</hi> there ſhould bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Erinnio</hi> and <hi>Siledo</hi> a good table, under pretext of obſerving a Faſt in the Chamber where they had laid mee for dead, and the leaving of their table to be reſerved for the poore, who were to be ſerved with their owne hands through the gate you came in at, to the end thoſe of the houſe might not ſuſpect, that there were any more than two mouthes to conſume it: <hi>That</hi> the Chirurgion ſhould (as he might with a good colour doe) give out, that he was, for ſome dangerous cure, gone afarre off, for not giving any ground of ſuſpition to his family or others, by abſenting himſelfe from home, having before hand carefully provided all things neceſſary that could in any occaſion happen to be requiſite for me: <hi>That Antea</hi> ſhould ſerve me for Cooke, till I were able to chew, under colour of doing it for my Mother: And <hi>that</hi> my Mother ſhould not ſtirre abroad, to the end the preſence of her perſon in thoſe Lodgings might keepe off others from comming thither. In ſumme, matters were ſo well diſpoſed of, that there is not to this day any one that beleeves I am not dead. The Coffin ſent to <hi>Lucania</hi> was placed in my Anceſtours vault, my Mother leading ever ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7474:110"/>
ſo retired a life, as the world beleeves it to be, from a good one that it is, rais'd to the pitch of a Saint-like and holy one; the fame whereof was in ſuch ſort divulged abroad by her women, and ſo increaſed by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from one mouth to another, as it miniſtred ſubject to many a ſtrange ſtory.</p>
                  <p>I afterwards pretty well cured as thou ſeeſt me, was yet ſo troubled in minde, for not knowing what was become of the Princeſſe, that I was like both to undoe my ſelfe, and ſpoyle all: For, walking one evening in my chamber all alone, whilſt <hi>Erinnio</hi> was with my Mother in her chamber, I became to be tranſported with an affect ſo ſtrange, that I fell a-talking to my ſelfe, over-heard by two Gentlewomen, by ill fortune, and through <hi>Antea</hi>'s fault for leaving the doore of that chamber open. Then burſt I out a complaining, that fortune after ſo many felicities, had made mee the moſt unfortunate Gentleman breathing, ſeeing, ſhee not content with cauſing mee to be ſlaine, had for tormenting me with a double death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd mee of the knowledge of my <hi>Corianna</hi>'s ſtate and beeing. More I would have ſaid, but that upon ſuddaine conſideration of my indiſcretion I held my peace, and the words beleev'd to be uttered by a dead man oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the ſpreading abroad a rumor, that my ſpirit was heard ſtirring all over the houſe, but eſpecially in the roome where my Coarſe had bin laid; and that <hi>Erinnio</hi> had ſeene it, but was afraid to confeſſe it, for doubt that ſome harme would betide him for it: And indeede upon the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women's queſtioning him about it, hee was forced (for concealing the truth) to induce them to beleeve the falſe rumour by ambiguities, and a kinde of affirming-ſilence, charging them to make no words of it' though it were true, leſt the King ſhould be taken with a humour of interring my body deeper, and for not joyning of greater feares to the Dutcheſſe's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready more than too-too grievous afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Lucano</hi> ſtood thus relating his owne diſaſterous adventures, they heard the noyſe of a key unlocking a doore, &amp; then beheld come in thereat the Dutcheſſe, to ſee her ſonne ere her going to bed; who (good Lady) though that <hi>Olmiro</hi>'s habit and beard had much disfigured him, yet fail'd not (for all that) to know him ſuddenly. And having beene formerly told that he was gone along with the Princeſſe, ſhee joy'd not a litle to ſee him, out of the hope ſhee conceiv'd of hearing ſome newes from her, and ſo to ſee (by ſome means or other) end with ſome more happy concluſion <hi>Luca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>'s till then over-tragicall diſadventures. <hi>Olmiro</hi> having kiſs'd her hands, told her of the Princeſſe, all that he had formerly related to <hi>Lucano,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching her to give him leave to goe finde her out as ſoone as his weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe permitted him; with ſhewing her, how that (over and beſides the obligation interceding for her) meere pitty ſhould win her aſſent thereto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Olmiro</hi> (ſaid ſhee) <hi>Corianna</hi> is both my Princeſſe and Miſtreſſe, which ſubjection I will never forget for all the priviledges that ſhee hath or may give <hi>Lucano.</hi> Howbeit I ingeniouſly confeſſe to thee, that I know not how the harme ſhee hath done me can any way oblige me unto her, whereof if ſhee hath endured much too, yet is not the fault mine, ſithence the Gods know, that I was never ſo ambitious as to have a Kings daughter to my daughter-in-law at ſo deere a priſe. But <hi>what's once done and paſt cannot bee undone againe.</hi> And I am (for what depends on me) moſt heartily willing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7474:111"/>
that <hi>Lucano</hi> make knowne unto her, that as he hath ſpent one, ſo he is moſt ready to ſpend a thouſand lives in her ſervice. Nor can he (indeede) ever declare himſelfe to her to bee ſuch and ſo deſerving, that the love ſhewed by her, and the vertue that ſhould bee in him, require not that hee ſhould ſtrive to expreſſe himſelfe in an-yet-more-ample meaſure. I meane not then to hinder him, but rather to command him to goe, and that too as ſoone as may be: Nevertheleſſe to ſtay yet a weeke (or ſuch a matter) cannot but be his beſt courſe; for being by that time throughly well, hee will bee able to performe his voyage without falling into any relapſes or new indiſpoſitions, which would prove to him dangerous, and to <hi>Corianna</hi> and me a ſubject of augmenting and prolonging our griefes. Concluded it was, that goe he ſhould as ſoone as he were fully recovered. The Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe thinking every houre an yeare till ſhee ſaw him out of the Realme, conceiting it impoſſible, that his long ſojourne diſcovered him not; being withall very deſirous of <hi>Corianna</hi>'s returne, for the ending of her ſo heavy ſufferings. Litle ambitious (God wot) in the reſt, (when ſhee had conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately examined all things that made for her diſadvantage) for by reaſon of the Realme's having a Prince (though a babe) <hi>Lucano</hi> could not aſpire to the Crowne: Alſo <hi>that</hi> the Princeſſe ſhould bee there but ſlenderly eſteemed; it being not likely that ſhee ſhould ever get a good looke of her Father; and her not elected but forced affinity likely to prove odious and diſpleaſing to both King and kingdome. To theſe were added womaniſh emulations, for reſpect whereof ſhee would rather have had a daughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law of a midling condition that were obedient unto her, than a royall Princeſſe, whom it behooved her to bee obſervant of. Full litle ſlept the Duke that night, thinking himſelfe to be already gone, nay arriv'd in <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſa,</hi> in the cave, and betweene the armes of his more beloved than deere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bought <hi>Corianna:</hi> ſo as not yet throughly well and abandoned of ſleepe, the humours ſtirr'd up with unexpected joy, brought on him a new feaver, which laſted him many dayes; inſomuch as it was unpoſſible for him to part till a moneth after. But then cloathed in a courſe habit, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with no other than <hi>Erinnio</hi> and <hi>Olmiro,</hi> taking the way of <hi>Taranto,</hi> he embarked himſelfe for <hi>Feacia,</hi> and thence to <hi>Ericuſa.</hi> But here content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſſing Fortune thinking ſhee had not yet afflicted him enough, would needs (to make it perhaps knowne that ſhe made no reckoning of Princes) take her paſtime on him by wayes unlawfull, with an intention happily (according to her cuſtome) cruell, to kill him with griefe, ſince ſhee could not kill him with the ſword.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Corianna</hi> was by this time up-riſen from childe-bed, and <hi>Carildo</hi> being (according to his wonted manner) ſent to ſee if he could ſee arrive any ſhip, and in her <hi>Olmiro,</hi> beheld (under the houſe of <hi>Feredo,</hi> inhabited then by <hi>Almadero</hi> as hath beene told you) the then owner of the houſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who upon a hunting-nag was then riding to viſit the Princeſſe of <hi>Feacia.</hi> Now he was in all things ſo like <hi>Lucano,</hi> that <hi>Carildo</hi> beleeved it was he, yet could not imagine how that could poſſibly be, being hee had left him (to his thinking) dead: Beſides, that being now (to his ſeeming) living, he had not in his retinew any one of his wonted ſervants, to him very well knowne. But that which chiefly induced him to beleeve it, was his language and accent, when he heard him ſpeake to his ſervants in the pure
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7474:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
language of <hi>Parthenope.</hi> Accoaſting therefore one of them hee praid him to tell him, who that Knight was? and underſtanding that hee was the Knight of the teares; he was not halfe-ſatisfied with that new by-ſurname of his, though hee were thereby the more confirm'd in his opinion, by conceiving that hee had ta'en on him that name for the loſſe of <hi>Corianna;</hi> but praying the ſame man againe to informe him of his proper name and countrey, he was anſwered, that hee could therein be ſatisfied by no man ſave onely his Squire, (who was now gone before to ſee if the Princeſſe of <hi>Feacia</hi> were at home) ſithence all of them had beene the <hi>Druid</hi>'s ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and were now his, without knowing of him any more than that hee was ſetled there, upon ſome not-openly-knowne diſcontent or croſſe-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune befallen him in his owne countrey, but that hee (for certaine) came from <hi>parthenope,</hi> where of his language accuſed him to bee a native: yet howſoever it were, hee could be no leſſe than a great Prince by his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, carriage, and expence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carildo</hi> having thanked this ſervant of his, remain'd aſtoniſh'd, when he obſerved how the Knight himſelfe, upon his ſaluting him, had ey'd him as a man he had never ſeene before, thinking it impoſſible, that <hi>Lucano</hi> could bee ſo forgetfull, as not to have retain'd in his memory ſome gheſſe of having ſeene or knowne him before: Hee therefore would willingly have followed him, but that he thought it his better courſe to goe ſee if he could eſpie in the houſe any thing that might ridde him of his doubt; but yet could not diſcover there any more: Led he was through every roome, and ſhewed all his Armes and Armour, but yet could not gather any thing from them neither; ſeene that hee had that noble Steed, which by his markes and making, he well knew to be of <hi>Lucano</hi>'s breed, (the prime race in all that kingdome) he remain'd ſo confuſed in minde, as hee knew not what to thinke on't. Return'd to the cave with his wonted anſwers, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed to the unfortunate Princeſſe's wonted afflictions, which made her accuſe <hi>Olmiro</hi> of negligence, and the Fates of cruelty for hindering his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. <hi>Carildo</hi> would not acquaint her any whit of his ſuſpitions, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an excuſe to returne about ſome buſineſſe he had to doe abroad, hee went out the morning following, with an intent to ſpeake himſelfe unto the ſuppoſed <hi>Lucano,</hi> whom upon his entrance into the wood, he might ſee cloſe by the Princeſſe of <hi>Feacia</hi> in amorous practizes.</p>

                     <hi>Lucano</hi> was the night before arrived, and by <hi>Olmiro</hi> conducted towards the cave through the wood, when unſeene they ſaw the ſame that <hi>Carildo</hi> did; there was not any one of them that tooke her not for <hi>Corianna,</hi> and by peering one in anothers face, they expreſt their amazement at her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit misbeſeeming an afflicted perſon; at her countenance that argued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but moſt of all at her gadding ſo alone to finde out ſome one to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her; for, paſſing-by without ſeeing them, ſhee jetted on with a pace ſo indecent, as pierced <hi>Lucano</hi> to the heart, a wound (for all that) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, till ſuch time, as ſeeing <hi>Almadero</hi> meet, kiſſe, and cloſe with her in amorous embraces: His doubt ceded to certaine realty to the eye and ſenſe, which (as iſſuing out of ſome violent machine) ſtruck through his heart with the ſharpeſt griefe that ever cold jealouſie tempered with its envenomed juyces in the infernall forge, aſſiſted by the Furies and ſpiteful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſpirits of the worſt of hells. Kill him outright it did not, the force of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7474:112"/>
his animall ſpirits ſupplying the place of his abated courage by conſpiring againſt it, increaſing for the increaſing of his torment, and to make him mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable above all thoſe that ever grieved either for perverſity of ſtarres or malignity of Deſtiny; and withall to the end nothing might bee wanting him towards the making full of his heart-racking tortures, there appear'd for next object to his ſight <hi>Carildo,</hi> that (whilome) honeſt, faithfull, and obliging <hi>Carildo,</hi> become now trayterous, diſloyall, a pander of diſhone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and inſtrument of his Miſtreſſe's ſhame, whom he imagined to bee ſo retired aſide of purpoſe to wayte for to reconduct her from the polluted grove to the wicked cave, th'abominable receptacle of infamy.</p>
                  <p>The with-love-re-inveigled <hi>Almadero</hi> had ever ſithence <hi>Feredo</hi>'s depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, employed all his ſtudie to gaine the love of the Princeſſe of <hi>Feacia,</hi> which ſucceeded him ſo well, that the litle love ſhe bare to her old huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſo accelerated her reſolution, that ſhee from a love became to bee a lover, inſomuch as upon his many times forbearing out of the reſpect due to the husband, ſhee (whom another ſort of intelligence ruled over, not caring for any ſuch obſervances) would oftentimes come to finde him out juſt as ſhee had done that day; becauſe, that though he had beene the day before a-ſeeing of her, yet had ſhee not (for all that) the opportunity of being with him as ſhee deſired. Taking now therefore an excuſe to goe to her wonted devotions in the wood, ſhee left to wayte for her returne at the entrance there of her ſervants and horſes, for having no ſpie over her actions; the ſame had ſhee done whilſt <hi>Feredo</hi> was there; for having beene enamoured of him, without being (for all that) able with all her devices ever to winne him to pitch neerer the lure of her deſires than in the farre diſtant grove of rigid lovers, &amp; that but through the ſuggeſtion of an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary birth of her conceit neither. And now becauſe ſhee had the day before made a match with <hi>Almadero</hi> to come thither at that houre, they therefore (in reſpect of his being there before to waite her comming) met jumpe together, retiring themſelves (after their firſt reciprocally-halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloying each other with burning kiſſes) into the thickeſt of the wood, in a place there made commodious for their loves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carildo</hi> upon the appearing of the true <hi>Lucano</hi> knew <hi>Olmiro</hi> and <hi>Erin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> but not him, ſo disfigured by his habit and long ſickneſſe, which in caſe they had not the force to alter him, yet had his new-come griefe power enough both to transforme and deforme him. Hee therefore now doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no more of <hi>Almadero</hi>'s being <hi>Lucano;</hi> ſeeing theſe three infallible witneſſes, inſtruments (to his thinking) of the moſt deteſtable and baſeſt treachery that ever was heard of; imagining that upon their landing in <hi>Ericuſa,</hi> hee fell to be enamoured of that woman, and that forgetting his lawfull love, he was now given over to unlawfull adulterous luſt, without caring any more for her, to whoſe affection he was ſo highly obliged: But that which the more argued the baſeneſſe of his foule fault, was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie wherewith he carried it, in taking on him that he knew him not, for thinking to keepe by ſuch baſe ſhifts his villanouſly-diſloyall fact un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered: Whereupon reſolved to unmaske his knavery, (though hee died for it) he bent his pace towards the three, to ſee what they would ſay to him. But by then <hi>Lucano</hi> unable longer to reſiſt the violent agony of his griefe, ſeized upon by an extreamely-ſhivering cold, caus'd himſelfe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7474:112"/>
to be conveyed out of the wood, ſo as the trees tooke him and his out of <hi>Carildo</hi>'s ſight, who finding them gone from the place he had ſeene them, wandered all over the wood to ſeeke them out, imagining then that upon their eſpying him, they were ſlipt away for feare of being diſcovered by him, which made him ſo mad with anger, as he would willingly have ſlain <hi>Olmiro, Erinnio</hi> that third man, and himſelfe too: Till finding that hee could not wreck his ſpite that way, hee thought it his next beſt courſe to expect for the comming forth of the ſuppoſed <hi>Lucano,</hi> and to affront him in the preſence of his new Miſtreſſe: Yet conſidering his Lady and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe her being and dwelling in her countrey a friendleſſe and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantleſſe ſtranger, ſubject to wrong, without any defender, he reſolved to returne home, acquaint her with the fact, perſwade her to hate him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, and to get her thence to ſome other place leſſe griefeſome and leſſe odious.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly then <hi>Carildo</hi> returnes home all-enraged, and appeares before the Princeſſe a quite-altered man from what he was wont to bee: Hee now obſerves neither meaſure nor reaſon in his actions; hee ſpeakes never a word, nor makes any anſwer to any queſtion asked him; hee lets fall out of his hand whatſoever hee handleth, ſtumbles and trips where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he puts his foot: His eyes are heavy and ſunke in's head, his browes lowring, his countenance grim, ſowre, and pale. The Princeſſe takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him, and imagining this change could not ſpring but from ſome great and extraordinary occaſion, thus beſpake him.</p>
                  <p>What's the matter <hi>(Carildo)</hi> that thou art ſo changed? haſt thou any ill newes for me, that thou canſt not find in thy heart to impart me? if thou haſt, I pray thee tell it me boldly, for I am now become a ſoyle fitte for ſuch ſeede. Haſt thou (tell mee) met with <hi>Olmiro;</hi> yea ſure thou haſt, ſince thou mak'ſt me no anſwer; and with that fetching a deepe ſigh ſhee ſpake on: yea, yea, I well knew that it was not ordinary to raiſe up the dead againe otherwiſe than in a dreame: But yet (I pray thee) <hi>Olmiro,</hi> wherefore comes hee not neere me? Becauſe he's a wicked villaine (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her <hi>Carildo.)</hi> Shee ſtricken to the heart with ſo harſh an epithete, by her thought blaſphemy, held her peace, whileſt hee thus proceeded.</p>
                  <p>Madame, your Highneſſe muſt both know how the caſe ſtands, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve couragiouſly to accompliſh and doe what I dare adviſe you. <hi>Corian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who was even dead to underſtand his meaning, anſwered him. Tell me it then a Gods name, if thou wilt not that thy faint-heartedneſſe in diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it, ſhould teach mee how unable I muſt bee to ſupport it. Madame (ſaid he then) I beſeech you to pardon me if I proceede prepoſterouſly in this buſineſſe. For, before I acquaint you with what is done, I muſt firſt tell you what is to be done. Well, doe as thou wilt (ſo thou but tell mee) anſwered ſhee. Madame (replied he) be not (I beſeech you) then offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if I make bold to tell you, that what you ought to doe, is, never to love <hi>Lucano</hi> more. Thou ſhallow-pated foole (anſwered him ſhee then) thou ſure either doteſt or art madde; what? muſt I love him no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is dead? yet if thou beeſt not ſtarke madde, then ſhew mee the reaſon for't, ſince thou well know'ſt how impoſſible a thing it is for mee to reſolve of a thing ſo unjuſt; explaine me therefore (if thou canſt) any poſſibility or reaſon for me to doe ſo: Mary ſo I ſoone will (ſaid hee) ſo
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7474:113"/>
you but vouchſafe me the patience to heare it, which I briefly thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. If <hi>Lucano</hi> were alive and lov'd not you, but (ſeeing the preſent ſtate of life you leade, and either deteſting or ſlighting it) were become ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of another woman, and paſt his time with her, would you then thinke and grant that impoſſibility merited the becomming poſſibility, and unreaſonableneſſe reaſon to love him no more? This ſaid, hee ſtopt his ſpeech, which upon her not anſwering, he thus continued. I beſeech your Highneſſe to tell me, if rather than to have <hi>Lucano</hi> dead, you would bee contented to have him alive (miſtake me not) not yours, but a woman's whom he keepes and enjoyes before your face here in this Iland, whileſt you live like a ſerpent under ground for love and long of him; and where (becauſe you could not dye with griefe) you ſtrive to kill your ſelfe with the rotting humidity and maligne exhalations of the dankiſh earth. But be pleaſed (I beſeech you) my Lady and Princeſſe, (whom I know to be diſcreet) to tell me, Is it not a ſtrange thing, that the Duke of <hi>Lucania,</hi> who before was dead, ſhould be now riſen againe to life; who before a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhould be now a loather of his deſervedly-beloved object, and who formerly was a noble and loyall Gentleman, ſhould (as for certaine hee now is) become moſt perfidious and ungratefull. <hi>Corianna</hi> become clay cold thereat, had not the power to anſwer him; the Dutcheſſe alſo with the Gentlewoman aſtoniſhed at theſe ſtrange newes, ſtood mute like ſo many ſtatues; till ſhee her ſelfe at length, having firſt dried her beteared cheekes, thus ſaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucano</hi> then is not dead but lives, and yet is no more mine? And is it poſſible that <hi>Lucania</hi> could bring forth and foſter ſuch cruelty and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? No, no, the world will not beleeve it, no more doe not I. Thou dream'ſt, (alack) thou dream'ſt <hi>Carildo;</hi> the conſtantly-good-gentle-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Lucano</hi> is a cloth died in graine, incapable of either ſpot or ſtaine. But hereupon <hi>Carildo</hi>'s diſtinct relation of all he had ſeene, (taking for the right <hi>Lucano</hi> the true <hi>Almadero)</hi> ſhee flung her ſelfe on the ground tearing her haire, clothes, and face, and had doubtleſſe kill'd her ſelfe in that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate fury, had not the diſcretion of her attendants hindered and croſt that her ſo deſperate intention.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucano</hi> on the otherſide (being by his loyally-loving ſervants condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the place where he landed, and whither <hi>Carildo</hi> was wont to come to buy proviſion, and to eſpie for the landing of any ſhipping, was in a poore lodging, provided of a poorer bed with ſmall hope of life, his griefe augmenting his feaver whilſt his ſpirits hourely waſted. Reſolved then to dye, he yet reſolved firſt to be the death of the Knight that was the cauſe of his death. <hi>Olmiro</hi> and <hi>Erinnio</hi> did by turnes the beſt they could to bring him out of the imminent deſperation hee was in, from which they could not thinke of a better or more powerfull diverſion, than the loathing of <hi>Corianna;</hi> ſhewing him withall, that in reſpect of loves being engendred by love, the one ſhould ſurceaſe to be, upon the ceaſing of the others beeing. A correſpondence (in their judgement) every way juſt, for that if the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding ones life for any ones love, was an effect not onely of affection, but alſo of duty; wherefore then (ſince we have all of us reaſon to reſpect ever chiefly our owne good, and to love our ſelves beſt) ſhould any man ſo love any one that loves him not, as to hate himſelfe to death? with fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7474:113"/>
telling him, that amorous conſtancies were poeticall fables; and if not, that yet they could not be vertues, their effects being vitious and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon. That that which was conſtantly to be liked and lov'd in a woman was conſtancie, honeſty, modeſty, ſhamefaſtneſſe, and the like, and not their oppoſites and unlike. But <hi>Lucano</hi> arguing the caſe according to his paſſion, returned them this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>My well-meaning friends, the priviledge of men in health is to judge of ſickneſſes as they conceive of them, and not according to the ſicke mans paine. Would not yee hold me for a madde man, if I (being well and you ſick) went about to perſwade you, that it is ill done to be ſick, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the reaſons of loving a mans owne good, and content; with adding, that your being ſick makes your friends ſorry, diſquiets your family, and leades you the high-way to death; and that therefore your beſt courſe were to bee well againe, which if you pleaſe you may be? Yet yee now perſwade your ſelves that I can doe what I cannot, thinkign that paſſions ſhould bee ranked among things indifferent; whereas indeede true love hath ever beene a ſupreame Commander, and to this day exerciſeth his Soveraignety, not onely over reaſonable men, but alſo over reaſon itſelfe; how much more powerfully then muſt I needs bee tyrannized over by mine, that hath beene already poſſeſſed of its ſweetes, and ſince (in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampleleſſe manner) ſuſpended from them by time and ſufferings? Thinke you that a thing ſo precious, acquir'd with the hazard of my life, and loſſe of my ſtate and fortunes, can be by me given over and reſigned to another; onely becauſe my will and reſolution (you ſay) ſhould be to doe ſo? You would perſwade me to it, out of charity to my ſelfe for ſooth; but (I pray you) tell me how can I expreſſe my ſelfe more charitable to my ſelfe, than (ſeeing a neceſſity of my death) to dye quickly and willingly? To love no more <hi>Corianna</hi> is unpoſſible for me; nay more, the meere inſtincts of love yet perſwade mee ſhee is innocent, and the Law wee live under enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces me to beleeve her ſuch: Againe, that ſhee hates me I cannot beleeve, nor yet dared yee tell me ſo. Is ſhee (having heard of my death) obliged to languiſh perpetually? Or doe the Lawes deny marriage to faire, young, orphan-widowes, and in a plight ſo miſerable as ſhee was in? <hi>Corianna</hi> was borne to love me out of her voluntary nobleneſſe, to cauſe mee to be ſlaine, yea and ſlay mee too, but innocently; <hi>Corianna</hi> hath for my ſake forſaken both Father and Countrey, nay lived too like a worme under ground through my doings; till occaſion was offered her, that a gentle <hi>Cavalier</hi> moved to compaſſion at her ſufferings, freed her thence, and ſhee (poore Lady) was faine to accept of his courteous offer, now that ſhee liv'd (for loving me) excluded and deprived both of Realme and honour: Nor can I but acknowledge my ſelfe (in ſome reſpect) obliged to her Knight her new ſervant, and am ſorry that I cannot requite him, ſince that <hi>Corianna</hi> being mine cannot be his too, nor have two husbands at the ſame time living; I therefore am neceſſitated to ſlay him with my owne hands; or if he chance to kill me, I ſhall then (Heaven be my witneſſe) dye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly, and dying, wiſh him that felicity, which my owne heart deſired I ſhould enjoy with my deere <hi>Corianna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The diſconſolated Princeſſe ſlept not all that night, but ſpent it in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning <hi>Lucano</hi> living, as ſhee had before lamented him dead, reſolved
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7474:114"/>
the next morning to goe finde him out her ſelfe; which becauſe <hi>Carildo</hi> diſſwaded her from, as both a thing unworthy of her, and a ſubject of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>Lucano,</hi> and of triumph to the Princeſſe of <hi>Feacia;</hi> ſhee bade him ſpare his ſpeech, and get her a few new-laid egges, ſhee having not eaten any thing all the day before. In this he obeyed her with all readineſſe, and by ſo much the more willingly, that the innocent babe (which ſhee nurſt her ſelfe) ſuffered exceedingly through the want of milke, and abounding of ill humours which his Mothers paſſions engendred in him: and then accompanied with no other than the Dutcheſſe, ſhee leaving her woman to looke to the babe tooke her way to <hi>Almadero</hi>'s houſe-wards, going rather a <hi>Bacchan</hi>'s or bedlam's than a royall or ſick-womans pace, and ſo ſpeedily as the Dutcheſſe had much adoe to follow her. They well knew the next way without going any compaſſe, having beene uſed to walke it often, when ſometimes they went out to enjoy the benefit of the freſh ayre. The ſunne began to ſend out his hotter beames by that time they were come to the foote of the hill, which made them irreſolute, whether it were their better courſe to goe up, or expect his comming downe into the wood. But ſuch was their good fortune, that <hi>Almadero</hi> chancing to eſpie them, came running downe towards them, taking one of them to be his <hi>Lidomia,</hi> for ſuch was the Princeſſe of <hi>Feacia</hi>'s name. The Ladies, on the other ſide, diſcovering him a farre off, and not doubting that hee was <hi>Lucano,</hi> retired themſelves to along bench, ſeated at the mouth of the wood, to attend there his comming</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Almadero</hi> having firſt commanded his Attendants to ſtay behind, came running downe the deſcent of the hillock all alone, with as great ſpeed as could be imagined. Being come neere them, and ſeeing <hi>Corianna</hi> (whom he beleeved to be <hi>Lidomia)</hi> ſo altered and pale, hee with a compaſſionate accent cryed out, Alack for woe! what face is that deere Miſtreſſe of my life? how came it ſo to loſe its colour and freſh beauty in one ſhort day? With this, offering to take her gently by the hand, and ſhee diſdainefully but faintly withdrawing it, her ſpirits failed her, her head hung drooping down, &amp; her breathles body had alſo ſunke to the earth, but that the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe and he ſupported it; <hi>Almadero</hi> not knowing the Dutcheſſe, ask'd her, what diſaſterous fortune had ſo diſcourteouſly uſed the Princeſſe his Lady and Miſtreſſe, as to alter her ſo exceedingly in ſo ſhort a time? In ſo ſhort a time (anſwered him then the Counteſſe) 'tis indeede but a ſhort time ſince thy diſloyalties were knowne, but not ſince ſhee began to ſuffer for thee, thou falſe unworthy Knight; whereas if ſhee had liſtened unto my words, we had not beene at the paſſe we now are reduced to. But <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano?</hi> thou the moſt abominableſt of men, haſt thou ſo flinty a heart and brazen a face, as forgetting the miſeries which are and have been endured for thee, to falſifie even before the face of ſo high-borne a Princeſſe (to whom thou art ſo much bound) that plighted troth, which was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her becomming unfaithfull, and a promiſe-breaker to the King her Father, the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and her ſelfe? Ah thou ungratefull, unworthy Traytor.</p>
                  <p>Strange ſeemed this language to <hi>Almadero,</hi> for being unacquainted with the actions hee was taxed withall, nor could he imagine the reaſon why this woman (whom he never knew nor ſaw before) ſo ſpake unto him,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7474:114"/>
as if ſhee had beene before of his acquaintance, till the naming of <hi>Lucano</hi> made him ſomewhat conceive the errour, but the naming of the Kings much more; yet could neither of theſe ſtop the violent current of his firſt conceit; for the ſeeing of (to his thinking) <hi>Lidomia</hi> in ſuch a plight, made him beleeve, that the Lady might be miſtaken in the names but not in the fact, wherewith hee imagined ſome falſe report might have miſinformed her conceit: But ſeeing her not yet come to her ſelfe, he thought it a more beſeeming office to runne to fetch water to revive her, than to take any heed to the bitter words of a miſinformed woman: But no ſooner was he parted from her, than upon hearing her fetch a profound ſigh, he returned, contemplating in her with an eye of ſorrow-diſplaying pitty a mortall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bluiſh paleneſſe; heere offering to take her by the hand anew, and againe repulſed with open diſdaine.</p>
                  <p>Madame (ſaid he thereupon) I now well ſee, that this place is againſt all reaſon the Iland of Adventures, whereas its name ſhould rather bee the Iland of Miſadventures, ſeeing its adventures grow from good to evill; conſidering how you are from a healthy woman become ſo ſick and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as I ſcarce know you, and I from an honeſt man growne to be diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, unworthy, and a Traytor. This Lady (whom I know not what ſhee is) both contrary to the modeſty of her ſex, and beyond the limits of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon takes on her too much authority to injure me: I am verily perſwaded ſhee knowes me not, but miſtakes me for ſome other, ſince her being with you, and her noble aſpect ſhould not (me thinkes) permit her to give ſuch unmannerly language to any man, much leſſe to me. Vpon this the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe leaving <hi>Corianna</hi> halfe unlaced, turning angrily towards him: Would to Heaven (anſwered ſhee) that I had indeed never knowne thee, for then had'ſt thou never beene the ruine of our Houſe, and ſhame of our blood. Woe is me, I know thee but too well, though I indeed never till now knew thee to bee ſo ſhameleſſe and impudently-audacious, as to dare to deny with the acts the perſons; telleſt thou me, thou knoweſt me not? wilt thou ſay thou know'ſt not the Lady Princeſſe neither? To this <hi>Almadero</hi> halfe-angry replied: I never have nor will deny what I knew, and for my Lady the Princeſſe, I ſhall much ſooner forget the knowledge of my ſelfe than of her; ſithence for retaining the knowledge of her everlaſtingly, my ſpirit hath ſo ſtampt her ſhape in my memory, that appeare ſhee well in health, courteous and favourable as ſhee did yeſterday; or angry, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainefull, and ſicke, as ſhee ſeemes to be to day, yet ſhall I never forget either her noble perſon or obliging favours. All reaſons making for the contrary touch not me, which if they did, then were I indeede that diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, unworthy miſcreant that you make me. For the reſt, I underſtand you not, you call mee <hi>Lucano,</hi> a name that I never heard of before, and you talke (I know not what) of our houſe and blood; But truly I beleeve, that if ſuch intereſſes were betweene us, I ſhould then know you as well as you imagine you know me. For which if I had no other argument, the very falſeneſſe of the calumny which you brand me with, is ſo manifeſt, that I knowing that I have never ſhamed my blood; know by conſequence, that none of my kinred can upbraid me of any ſuch crime.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſſe that had the while with a ſterne-lowring eye oft-times beheld him, perceived ſhee was miſtaken, now that ſhee had obſerved in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7474:115"/>
him the <hi>favour</hi> and making, but neither the geſture nor true accents of <hi>Lucano,</hi> imprinted in her memory with an indelible ſtampe; and therefore now growne deſperate, upon the becomming dead againe of her a litle ſithence reſuſcitated lover, ſhee began to grieve with a new kinde of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and had willingly ſpent her deereſt blood, to bee (without being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) the beguiled and betrayed one, ſo he but lived: Whence we may gather, that <hi>there is not any affect either more inconstant in its operations, or more contrary in its ſelfe, than that of amorous jealouſie:</hi> Hatred and love are ever conſtantly the ſame, the one neverthinkes of loving, the other never deſcends as low as hating; but when once jealouſie enters, then they confound themſelves. The lover knowes not which of them he were beſt pitch upon, if he enjoyes the one, he covets the other, which gotten hee abhorres, and returnes to the firſt againe; hence proceeds that viciſſitude or perpetuall motion of warre and peace in amorous affections. The Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe obſerving the language of the (to her thinking) <hi>Lucano,</hi> though ſhe imagined not that ſhee was miſtaken, yet diſcreetly conceiving, ſhee had too much offended him, ſhe with a milder countenance thus beſpake him.</p>
                  <p>Nephew, if with my fortunes and the reſt I had loſt my wits and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, I might then doubt of knowing you, though I have no reaſon to wonder that you know not me; but ſhould indeede marveile more, that in all the time that wee lamented you dead, our hiewes and faces were not altered, and more yet that we are not over-growne with graſſe inſteed of skin and haire. But for all this alteration, is it poſſible that I am ſo disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as you know not the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Magna Grecia</hi> your own Aunt? That you could know the Princeſſe my Miſtreſſe ſooner than mee, is to mee a double wonder, her griefes and ſufferings having beene greater than mine, and her beauty and youth more ſubject to change, than my wrinkles and withered agedneſſe: But ſince you ſay you know her, I pray you then how came you to know her, if you be not <hi>Lucano?</hi> The Knight at theſe words peering in her face, ſtood as immoveable as a ſtone, upon his comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this miſtake: Glad then of being disburthened of the great paine, that the alteration of his beleeved Lady and beloved Miſtreſſe had drawn on him, he with a ſmiling countenance thus anſwered her.</p>
                  <p>For certaine Lady I may well be your ſervant (and ſo I now offer you to be) the being ſuch depending on my choyce: but bee your nephew for truth I cannot, that being an office reſerved to Nature; I am ſorry that the reſemblance which I might have to that nephew of yours <hi>Lucano,</hi> hath deceived you, as the likeneſſe in favour of this noble Lady to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of <hi>Feacia</hi> hath beguiled me; but now that miſtake deludes mee no longer, ſeeing that it is impoſſible that ſhee whom I ſo lately ſaw ſo well and in ſuch perfect health could in ſo few houres loſe both fleſh and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and now if there be any thing in me, that may better ſatisfie you for the further cleering of your miſtake, behold me moſt ready and willing to obey you.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſſe who till then had her pale lips ſealed up with ſilence (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come now but too certaine of the truth) ſaid unto him: Worthy Sir, there needs no other proofe; the acting of ſuch a deceitfull part cannot be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from a perſon of your quality: and for this Ladie's uſing you diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, ſhee was indeede perſwaded ſhee might doe it, out of the conceit
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7474:115"/>
ſhee had, that ſhee ſpake to her Nephew, and upon the ſuppoſed ground of a fault, whereof he (unfortunate Gentleman) is ſo much the more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, by how much his being reduced to earth and duſt deprives him of the power of ſinning; with that word, ſhee ſinking downe her head ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againe, and became as cold as yce. <hi>Almadero</hi> (the ſweeteſt diſpoſitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Knight living) had much adoe to refraine weeping for meere pitty; and ſeeing ſome of his ſervants not very farre off him, hee call'd for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which came (but too late) with the accourſe of all that were above to helpe her. Faine would hee then have knowne who ſhee was, but held it no good manners to aske it yet of the Dutcheſſe, who was both confuſed in minde for him, and buſied about the Princeſſe; but having already un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the ſtory of <hi>Corianna,</hi> he ranne with his imagination to the truth: Vſe therefore he did all the meanes he could imagine by entreaty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, to have her carried up, whereunto the Dutcheſſe aſſented, yet ſhe could by no meanes be perſwaded to it, but ſuddenly parted to avoide his importunity. Whereupon <hi>Almadero</hi> would at leaſt have her carried to her Barge, (for they had made him beleeve, they had a Barge that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them) but ſhee would by no meanes agree to that neither, being reſolved rather to dye by the way, than to let any one know where ſhee abode.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carildo</hi> gone out of the cave (as was told you) came where <hi>Lucano</hi> was lodged, where (as before he gheſſed he ſhould) he met with <hi>Olmiro.</hi> Both of them grew pale, and in vent of their ſpitefull ire each againſt other, <hi>Carildo</hi> firſt thus reviles the other. Is it thus that Princeſſes ought to bee ſerved? <hi>Olmiro:</hi> Is this the faith thou oweſt ſuch perſonages? Is this the gratitude to thy Soveraigne Miſtreſſe for ſo many favours? To know that ſhee pines and dyes for newes from <hi>Lucano,</hi> and yet both <hi>Lucano</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and thou living with him, leade a moſt diſſolute courſe of life, whilſt ſhee (unfortunate Lady) lyes a dying? Now fie for meere ſhame, if you have no charity, yet ſhould yee (me thinkes) have ſo much modeſty and reſpect (injuring her with ſo much ingratitude, and with ſo litle reaſon as yee have to doe ſo) as to doe it at leaſt ſo privately as ſhee know it not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Olmiro</hi> (who underſtood the matter otherwiſe) thought theſe the moſt diſſembling and counterfeit words that e're were uttered, and <hi>Carildo</hi> the unworthieſt man breathing; which made him thus retort. If thou had'ſt ſerved the Princeſſe as loyally as I have done, thou had'ſt not then brought herto that diſhoneſt paſſe ſhee now (through thy meanes) is brought unto: Wee have well ſeene that ſhee lyes not a-dying, but for her greater content, lives in thy preſence accompanied, with whom I know not ſave with whom ſhee liſteth or <hi>lusteth after.</hi> Wicked miſcreant? is this the care thou ſhould'ſt have of a Princeſſe? Is this the thankes thou giveſt <hi>Lucano</hi>'s bounty? Is this the duty due to his favour and merits? Muſt he (unfortunate Knight) who was ſlaine and halfe-buried, live again; and being come hither for life, finde here his death? Me thinkes yee ſhould at leaſt have had the patience to expect my returne; ſithence if hee were alive (as for his greater misfortune it is but too certaine that he is) he would then take from you the occaſion of falling into the errour you are in; if dead, then would there reſt to her (being ſo ridde of her husband) the field honorably free to other loves, whereas yee are now through your

frantick impatience become inexcuſable, by becomming your ſelves the murtherers of that unfortunate innocent Knight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carildo</hi> the nobleſt-minded Squire living, conceiting that <hi>Olmiro</hi> had for hiding his and <hi>Lucano</hi>'s faults, invented this diſhoneſt calumny; and that not content to injure him alone, hee had baſely let runne his lying tongue on the honour of his innocent Lady and Miſtreſſe; forgetting now all the rules of patience, clapt his hand on a skeane that hung at his neck, <hi>Olmiro</hi> doing as much with another ſuch weapon, and then either of them redoubling his blowes on the other, did his utmoſt endeavour not to wound, but (like cruell enemies) to ſpeed each other; ſo as one of them had ſoone beene ſlaine, but for the arrivall of five Knights: But I muſt now crave leave to get me elſe-where, undertaking to deliver them you in in a ſhort time woundleſſe and friends.</p>
                  <p>We left <hi>Polimero</hi> and his company parted from <hi>Greete</hi> with their prow to the Weſtward; who as they ſayled with a gentle Loome-gale, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered (the ſecond night of their voyage) a farre off in the Iland of <hi>Cithera,</hi> a great number of fires, which ſeemed to goe and meet one another; an effect not to be judged of, in reſpect of the motion of the Veſſell; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to ſatisfie their curioſity, they ſteer'd directly towards it; where drawne neere, they perceived them to be Torches, wherewith ſome dead man was accompanied to his laſt home. The pompe was conſiderable both for quantity and variety; the men were all hooded with <hi>Capuchios,</hi> and the more principall wore long traines; the horſes trapp'd with black velvet downe to the hoofe: the Funerall contrived into a curious forme of lights and banners; the military Muſick orderly devided into corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent ſpaces, whereof thoſe of voyces next about the Biere enforced with their ſweetely-mournefull conſort, the ſtonieſt affects to grieve and ſorrow. <hi>Polimero</hi> could by the great pompe he there obſerved judge no leſſe, than that the dead man was ſome great <hi>Prince;</hi> for which cauſe, and becauſe alſo the ſhee-warriers were deſirous to ſee him, he commanded to runne a ſhore there: yet could they not land ſo ſoone, but that the Biere was before entred into the Temple, whilſt they ſtood wondering, that there could be in ſo ſmall an Iland, ſo ſtately a ſhew, and ſuch a number of Nobility. There ſtood placed in the mid'ſt, a Piramide-wiſe-built Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, with ſtaires to get up on it, and ſo high, as it ſeemed to contend with the hight of a Cube; there ſuſtain'd it twelve great Pillars, and under it was laid the Biere with the corps, whoſe principall ornament were many Armes; the faireſt of them (which for being enriched with precious ſtones glittered at the flaming-light of the Torches) were on the nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the ſtaires, whoſe corners were adorned with ſtatues even to the uppermoſt of all; the firſt foure of the foure cardinall vertues, the others of the ſucceeding, wrought with ſuch exquiſite artifice, as they ſeemed to be of fineſt Marble; the Torches in great quantity orderly ranked from the top to the bottome in great ſilver Candleſticks, and the whole circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference lighted by an infinite number of <hi>wax-lights</hi> proportionably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and moulded.</p>
                  <p>The Princes paſſing by all other curioſities, haſtened to ſee the coarſe, which being a youth of about nineteene yeares of age, expoſed to the eye (though dead) a ſhew of ſuch lively beauties, that the privation of life
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7474:116"/>
ſeemed counterfeit, onely that he might be gazed on; hee lay arm'd all ſave the head. A Mantle of fine purple, within lin'd quite through, and without down to the waſte with white <hi>Ermins,</hi> &amp; a Crown (which for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet full of precious ſtones ſhone on his head) manifeſted him to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſome great Prince. There ſate at his feet two damozels cloath'd in blacke, whoſe habits, together with their nethermoſt border without, were lined with faire white vailes. They lamented him, ſinging in a tone ſo mournfull, that there was not an unbeteared eye among all the ſpectators: Another ſuch paire was placed one of each ſide of him, with two great rich winde-fannes in their hands; buſied they were in fanning him ayre, till the two firſt, having by then given over their ſong, ſucceſſively under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went their office. But the ſweltry heate (which for being encreaſed by the lights and peſtering throng of people, made them feele it ſtill more and more ſtifeling) enforced them to retire to the ayre into a Cloyſter hard by; where being by a Prieſt knowne for ſtrangers, they were by him courteouſly offered the commodity and ſight of the houſe; ſeeming deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous withall to relate unto them its beginning, and how there was there nurſed the faire Goddeſſe of <hi>Cyprus:</hi> But they mov'd with the curioſity of that lugubrous ſpectacle, beſought him (though they had underſtood the generality of it already) to tell them its particulars, how that Prince came to dye in that Iland of <hi>Cithera:</hi> the good man willing to obey them, (following a great Torch that hee cauſed to be carried before them, and walking right on to a long Gallery, that led to that part of the houſe that was called the ſtrangers Lodging) thus ſatisfies their curioſity.</p>
                  <p>Some two yeares ſithence may there bee (ſaith hee) expired, ſince the Queene of <hi>Macedon</hi> (a kingdome not hence farre diſtant) having ſent of three ſonnes that ſhee had the two eldeſt, to bee educated and taught elſe-where, holding native homes, eſpecially thoſe of Princes unfit and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall (in reſpect of the authority which they there poſſeſſe) to the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of their youth, was taken with a longing deſire to goe ſee him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, but yet in the habit of a noble pilgrim; and of them unexpected came to the marveilous City of the <hi>Meridian</hi> Lake, where taken with the rare delightſomneſſe of the ſite, and other excellencies there remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſhee made for ſome while her abode; the ſcope of her deſire was to goe ſee <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thence to returne to <hi>Macedon;</hi> but was not ſo ſoone launch'd forth into the ſea of <hi>Creta,</hi> than that <hi>Corideo</hi> the eldeſt of the two ſickned; whereupon being neceſſitated to come a-ſhore here; ſhe thereof advertized her husband, who haſtened (good Prince) with all poſſible ſpeede to the beloved ſight of his wife and ſonne, though the joyes of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her (part of himſelfe) were corrupted by the likelihood hee faw of loſing his ſon, part of them both: Wherefore when he had (in vaine) expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented all the remedies of Art to be booteleſſe, he then, as though his recovery lay in his ſonnes owne hands, thus beſpake him.</p>
                  <p>And wilt thou then leave me (my <hi>Corideo)</hi> now that I am runne hither unto thee, of purpoſe that thou might'ſt not aband on me? Cheere up thy ſpirits, (my ſonne) for behold mee here ready to accompliſh thy wiſhes; and if the wide world can raiſe up thy drooping courage, there is not (aſſure thy ſelfe) any one thing in it that I'le not procure to give thee content: We have here hard by, <hi>Macedon,</hi> where thou art wiſht for, and where thou ſhalt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7474:117"/>
be cured, ſo thou be but pleaſed to be merry: Wilt thou by dying deceive the expectation which the world hath of thee living, as if thou diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted'ſt to accompliſh with effects, what thou promiſed'ſt by the hopes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of thee? No doe not, oh doe it not (my deere <hi>Corrideo)</hi> death though timely will ſeize on thee but too ſoone, which (alas) he ſhould not in this the faire ſpring-time of thy youth, and in the budding forth of its flowres, before the taking of its fruite, and ere it be either gathered or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. Looke on thy deere Mother, her love towards thee is no new affect, and thinkeſt thou that thou canſt ſatisfie her by dying, the debts thou oweſt her living? For my ſelfe, I ſay nothing; for if I deſired that thou ſhould'ſt live for my ſake, I ſhould not then love thee but my ſelfe; but I loving both thee and her, ought to procure thy life for her ſake and thine. More he would have ſaid, but here ceaſed, for having his royall ſpirits o'rewhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a fatherly affection, ſeconding (as raine followes thunder) his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation with teares.</p>
                  <p>My Soveraigne Lord (anſwered him the Prince) if one that already feeles the raviſhing ſweetes of a better life would follow the affections of this, he were unworthy to enjoy them. I never (the Gods know) meant to abandon you; which if it bee conceived by any, that I by dying leave you, ſuch a conceit argues not wiſedome in the hatchers thereof; your Majeſtie (I am ſure) is not of that opinion. This life is a race unequall in all men; mine (whatſoever one it be) is ended; I finde my ſelfe at the marke in my beſt ſtrength, and therefore ſince I have wonne the prize, you have no reaſon to repine or be ſorry for my gaine. The young man and decrepit dotardare (when they are once parted hence) in an equall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, nor would my dying an old man doe me any more good in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of my preſent yeares, ſince eternity admits of neither number nor time: Indeede if I abandoned you for the intereſt of my owne ſole ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, you then had reaſon to grieve for it; but (alas) the arreſt that is laid upon mee comes from a higher power; your royall commandement extends not ſo farre, no more than my poſſibility in the effect of ſerving you. Therefore (my dread Soveraigne) the accuſing me with the argument of my duty towards you, and my Mothers love to me, corrupts to me the divine ſweets, which I already reliſh with the bitternes of unſavory terrene affects, which like ſharpe thornes prick me but too-too much already on this my death-bed? Now for thoſe things which you proffer mee, with putting me in minde of my Countrey and kingdome, they (alas) are not to be parallel'd with thoſe I aſpire unto; beſides, I were moſt unworthy if it lay in my power to live, to live for any other end, than to honour and ſerve you. That I (by dying) corrupt the hopes conceived of me, I (in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) in ſo dying dye an happy man, having in theſe few yeares of mine learn'd, that <hi>actions contend with opinions of volubility and inconstancie;</hi> ſo as, although who ſo doth well, digreſſeth not; yet eſcapes he not (for all that) the cenſure of opinions, which like meere ſhadowes and <hi>Chimera</hi>'s of ſpirits, runne along with our dayes and alter with our yeares. Therefore (my Royall Soveraigne) if your perſwading mee to live, be to command me, be then pleaſed (I beſeech you) that I tell you, that neither your autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity nor my obedience hath ſo large an extent, ſince the ſpirit, for being the better choyce, hath more prevailing arguments than the fleſh. For the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7474:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reſt, behold here my Brother <hi>Almondo,</hi> on whom my memory may to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the heritage be ſetled. If you but looke well into him, you ſhall have no occaſion to grieve for want of me: Be not (I beſeech you) <hi>blinded</hi> with my lovely livelihood, and prompt forwardneſſe now done and paſt, that nature which you ſee ſweetly-grave in him goes on (indeed a ſlower but) a ſurer pace. To you (Madame) it reſts that I make knowne, that in this my paſſing over into the other world, there lies no greater rub in my way, than my affection to you-wards as yet not tranſmuted, but halfe-terrene and mingled with your motherly affects; yet I hope that the Gods will hold me excuſed, for its being an effect of pitty to one, whom next them I owe moſt unto. Madame, my Liege, <hi>Almondo</hi> I now goe hence, let the memory of me be deere unto you, which to the end I may part hence contented, I pray you promiſe it me without grieving. With that word, hee offered to reach them his hand, which as he began to raiſe up, ſunke downe againe; he (with that) reſtoring his divinely-ſweet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to him that had ſent it him.</p>
                  <p>Such was the end of Prince <hi>Corideo,</hi> which may ſerve for an example, to who ſo aſpires to gaine that which ſhould be deſired farre before any earthly thing. The lamentation and moane made for him was exceeding great, the King alſo being no more capable of conſolation than the Queen, although to comfort her, he tooke on him to grieve leſſe than indeede he did. They are now retired into that Chappell there (pointing with that towards the place with his finger) whither our Father Guardian (a Prieſt of much holineſſe and profound learning) is gone a litle while ſince to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, and I was juſt now a going thither to ſee and heare them. If you therefore can diſpence with my ſervice, I ſhall crave leave of you to goe on, or if otherwiſe you be poſſeſt with the ſame curioſity as I am, I will then (ſo you be therewith pleaſed) ſee you ſeated in a darke window whence you may unſeene ſee all. Vpon acceptation of this laſt courteous proffer, they mount up; where (upon the opening of a doore leading from a privy chamber) they diſcovered a litle Temple, wherein upon large vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet cuſhions ſate the King and Queene, whoſe Royall aſpect ſo diſcovered their dignities, that their mourning-habit voyde of both pompe and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could not diſguiſe their native greatneſſe. Shee being endued with a beauty ſo majeſtically-grave as might ſtrike reverence into the ſtubborneſt ſpirits, and he bearing ſtamp't in his forehead the true caracters of a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous and generous heart. In the ſame inſtant entred the Prieſt, who being made ſit on a low ſtoole cloſe by the Queene thus fram'd his ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>Madame, the Gods ſend me hither to be both your Phyſician and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, with command to comfort you as an Embaſſadour, and to cure your griefe as a Phyſician; ſo you therefore bee but pleaſed to make a ſhort pawſe on your hitherto-juſt-teares; I will (the Gods willing) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh both the one and the other. The Queene (lifting up her eyes, and ſeeing ſtand before her a reverend old man, who cloathed in a ſnow-white rayment, made a ſhew of ſomething more than humane) dryed her beteared eyes, but return'd him no anſwer; for being at one and the ſame time to doe two (as it were) contrary offices, which was, to retaine her teares, and give free way to her ſpeech. Whereupon hee, as one long ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence acquainted with the nature of griefe, without expecting any anſwer, proceeded.</p>

Madame, I am glad that ſaving health begins already to have place in your Majeſty, ſince at the very name of God I ſee you ſhake off the ſhac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of that benumming droopingneſſe wherewith you were fettered. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane afflictions have (Royall Madame) two moſt potent arguments, or rather meanes of ſhunning extreames; the one practiſed through the helpe of Philoſophicall vertue, the other infuſed by celeſtiall grace; that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, this onely to thoſe whom God communicates it unto: From the firſt we may learne, <hi>that</hi> ordinary accidents ſhould not in any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meaſure afflict us; <hi>that</hi> the gifts of Nature are beſtow'd upon us for uſe, not poſſeſſion; <hi>that</hi> riches, children, and honours are more ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly loſt than gotten; <hi>that</hi> prudent and diſcreete perſons receive from reaſon that conſolation in an inſtant, which others are wrought unto by time and perſwaſion, and <hi>that</hi> ſuch comfort too depends on our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our imagination on us, ſo as the prefixing to our ſelves things either burthenſome or light, is to ſhut or open the gates of comfort. The ſecond teacheth us; <hi>that</hi> the death of the juſt is precious before God; <hi>that</hi> humane capacity conceives not the joyes of ſuch as have an eternall ſeate amongſt the bleſſed; <hi>that</hi> the life of ſuch is not taken away, but conſerved till that long expected day, which muſt bring us, being freed from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of time and fortune, to the enjoying of a truly-perfect life; <hi>that</hi> that death which terminates the courſe of an holy life, is not properly death, conſidering the ſweete quietneſſe that enſues it, the faire advantagious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change it makes, and the undoubted aſſurance it receives of it; <hi>that</hi> the good are called before their time, for ridding them out of the hands of the wicked, and from being by them either moleſted or corrupted; <hi>that</hi> God makes no difference betweene the rathneſſe and lateneſſe of time, but <hi>that</hi> man arrived to the terme preſcribed him, becomes old even in his very childehood; and <hi>that</hi> therefore we ſhould with a cheerefull mind accept what he ſends us, to offer him in gift what we owe him of duty.</p>
                  <p>The Queene liſtned unto the Prieſt with great attention; and ſeeing him now ſilent, with a countenance compoſed to conſtancie, whoſe milde ſerenity ſhewed ſhee had chaſed away the cloud of paſſion, ſhee return'd him this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Father, I yeeld the Gods hearty thankes for having voutchſafed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member mee through your meanes. I could not (I confeſſe) anſwer your arguments, if I had the power to practize them, but wanting it, it behoves me to ſearch for it in the ſecret of your precepts. And firſt, I beſeech you to teach mee, how I ſhall conceive to bee ordinary that which never was heretofore? I lament not (as I am a woman) the generall death of man; but bemoane (as a mother) the particular death of my ſonne; I know that it is an ordinary thing that every man dye, but to dye in youth, to breake the order of Nature, &amp; to have befall us in our more pleaſing yeares that which ſhould not happen us before our decrepit loathſome old age, is (I am ſure) no ordinary thing. For the gifts which wee receive, alas I grieve not for being debarrd the poſſeſſing them, which I pretend not, but for being deprived of the uſe of them, which was violently taken from me. If it were ordinary for mothers to bee deprived of their ſonnes, the world would then be ſoone ended, for in one ſole age there would not be either fathers or ſonnes to be found; <hi>that</hi> worldly things are tranſitory,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7474:118"/>
our very ſenſe ſhewes us, but ere ſenſe can renounce the griefe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the privation of them, Nature muſt firſt forbeare the forming it of paſſions. For the diſcreete I know not in what ſenſe to conceive them; conceive them perhaps I might, if the proprieties of affects were punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally knowne, but who can fit mee one pleaſure or one paine to two that be juſt equall to them, and reduce withall their conſtitutions to ſuch a parity, that tenſe make not a difference of them? which if it could be done too, yet could there be no great matter of prudence in it, ſince wee are tyed to worke with ſuch equality: And againe, if it cannot be done, I muſt then call it rigidneſſe of nature, declination of ſenſe, ſtupidity or defect of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion at the leaſt. The procuring <hi>in fine</hi> that meere imagination ſhould bring us to comfort, is beyond the reach of my underſtanding. And I would faine know, if ſuch an effect ſhall be conformable to its cauſe? which if it be, then muſt ſuch a conſolation needs be falſe, the imagination being formed of things not true. To your ſecond Arguments I make no anſwer, their authority being but too great, and their truth moſt manifeſt. But the ſupreame truth not being comprehenſible, otherwiſe than by the minde, it ſhould not (me thinkes) ſeeme ſtrange to you, if I (for being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned with the ſharpe ſenſe of my griefes) comprehend it not in its owne rayes; whereunto I (for all that) ſubmit both my ſelfe and my griefes ſo I be but permitted to evaporate them a litle, leſt the principall be exceeded by the intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Vpon the hearing of theſe words, the Aſſiſtants who till this time were all tongue-tyed by a drooping ſilence, made reſound the Cube of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed lamentation, the aged Prieſt weeping with the reſt: Till obſerving a litle after that the Queene dryed up her teares, and that return'd to her former quiet temper, ſhee ſtood expecting ſome further ſpeech of him; he thought to reply, when ſhee continued the file of her ſpeech, ſaying.</p>
                  <p>Father, there are ſome paſſions which have more need of ſword than ſhield, which a man muſt either quite defeate or ſtill live withall; which if it ſo bee, where then ſhall I (alas) for ſhunning ſuch deadly company, finde Armes to defeate mine, ere I be firſt by them quite ruin'd? Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicall reaſons are (God wot) but feeble wards, they are ſhields fram'd by wit, which many times either ſpeakes what it is not ſenſible of, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſeth not what it ſpeakes. 'Tis but too difficult a thing to put off the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of humanity, there is not any man that disburthens himſelfe of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſorrow at parting from it. In heaven (anſwered the Prieſt) where in the hight of bliſſe lives the glorious Prince <hi>Corideo,</hi> you (Madame) by that time I have aſſured you of your glory, ſhall finde this vitall ſword. And being asked how hee could know it, and if the places appointed for the happy were not the <hi>Elizean</hi> Fields? Theſe are myſteries (ſaid hee) which I ſhould indeede conceale, if the imparting them you were not the unguent wherewith I ſhould heale you. The ordinary place then appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the happy, is indeed the ſame you now mentioned, but yet there are of them others granted but to a few, for but few ſuch are there as was the Prince <hi>Corideo.</hi> The ſoule (Madame) is a fire, a ray or <hi>ſparkle</hi> taken from the divinity, infuſed by the Gods into bodies in different degrees, the cauſe of the differences that are ſeene betweene ſoule and ſoule. All the Gods infuſe not this fire, nor other ſave ſuch of them as have the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

power of influence, and by the quality of our working, is knowne by which of them we were inflamed. This fire ſo infuſed, worketh in us the ſame effect, as the reall fire doth in coales, <hi>anticipating</hi> in kindling accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the portion given it, if litle ſlowly, if much quickly: Hence comes it that the knowledge of old men ſurmounts that of younger, becauſe the coale in theſe ſcarce kindled, is in thoſe quite burnt out. This is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary operation according to the courſe which the Gods propoſed in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſuch as of this order dye juſt in this life, have their repoſe among the faire pleaſing ſhades of the <hi>Elizean</hi> Field: But the extraordinary one (imployed only on ſuch whom the Gods are, out of their benignity, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to favour extraordinarily) is not only to communicate the fire in a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied portion, but alſo to take it from <hi>Ioves</hi> owne rayes, which hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the conſent of the other Gods infuſeth, to forme thereof a <hi>heroe,</hi> a demy-god: And this multiplied portion is in ſome ſo ſwift in its working, that ſome, though babes, are in knowledge and diſcretion old men, and yet but children at their dying houre; becauſe the fire having done its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, both kindles and conſumes away even in an inſtant: Of this number (Madame) was the Prince <hi>Corideo</hi> your ſonne; for I obſerved in him whileſt he was ſicke, the ſpirit of <hi>Iove,</hi> the infuſion imparted from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods, <hi>obliquely</hi> regarded with grimme and maligne aſpects onely by <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturne:</hi> Yet ſuch like ſpirits are not infuſed by men and Earth, but by the Gods and Heaven; and have when they are ſeparated, three diſtinct places of bliſſe prepared for them, conformable to the diſtinct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the rayes they received upon their being united to bodies: The firſt which is the inferiour containes the ſpatious latitude of the ayre, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by ſuch, who deſpiſing vulgar opinions, lift up their mindes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there to conſider Nature, and (joying for enjoying now not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine and enigmaticall, but the reall and cleere ſight of this fabrick) compaſſionate ſuch, as with a ſterne philoſophicall brow teach lyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved for truth even to this day. Here it is, that they contemplate the true Spheares, the certaine motions of the heaven (I would ſay of the earth too, if it were credible) the reaſons of ebbing and flowing of the Sea, the perennity of fountaines, the generations of windes, with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other things, whoſe reaſons are thought to be knowne, but indeed are not: And ſuch ſpirits, becauſe they ever loved mankinde, enter into tearmes of naturall charity with them, not ceaſing at all occaſions to helpe them, either by freeing them from evills, (if it lye in their power) or at leaſt in foretelling them of ſuch ere they arrive; appearing in ſundry ſhapes, and formes of Rainebowes, Sunnes, armed Squadrons, fiery Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, and pleaſant domeſticall ſpirits inamoured of ſuch as have a ſpirit in a degree like them. The ſecond place is the extent of heaven, <hi>which is</hi> the ſuperficies of the firmament: Thither come ſuch, who not content to have with the ſpeculators of nature knowne God for the firſt cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve further his providence, and teach vertue and piety, which (for being a ſtrong weapon of the ſpirit) defeates, puts to flight and ſlayes vices, which are the true monſters of the earth; and being made ſtarres, ſparkle outwardly the light of their creation, in ſigne of their divine internall love, water'd by the water of their regeneration.

                  <p>Meane while <hi>Almadero</hi> being got away from <hi>Corianna,</hi> was no ſooner come to his houſe, than the repercuſſion of the Sunne on the weapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blades gave him occaſion to deſcry from above, the ſcuffling between theſe two at the next Port. Whereupon, thinking they were Gentlemen come of purpoſe to fight in that Iland, he bidding ſome of his ſervants to bring a horſe after him, deſcended the downe-hill, ever almoſt running till hee
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7474:120"/>
came to the place where the affray was; where ſeeing the Knights that had parted them, he courteouſly ſaluting them, was againe in the ſame manner re-ſaluted by them, when <hi>Carildo</hi> ſaid to <hi>Olmiro:</hi> God be praiſed that thy Maſter is now come to thee to participate of thy triumphs, ſince that by his owne teſtimony theſe Gentlemen may judge whether of us is the Traytor: <hi>Olmiro</hi> having ſeen <hi>Almadero</hi> before (though he had not in the wood well obſerved him) had now alſo taken him for <hi>Lucano,</hi> if his healthfull plight and habit had not aſſured him of the contrary. But <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rildo</hi> noting him yet more now than before, turning towards him, thus boldly beſpake him.</p>
                  <p>And is it poſſible (my Lord Duke) that croſſes and adverſity (which in others quell rebelling humours, and refine their mindes, by bringing them to a better temper) ſhould worke ſuch a contrary effect in you, as you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtrangely ungratefull doe not onely take pleaſure at the death of your noble Lady and Princeſſe, but that to trample the more on her cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, you (upon your reviving) muſt alſo come hither ſo contemptuouſly to wrong her without ſo much as once voutchſafing her the favour of comming to ſee how ſhee languiſheth for death? Nor yet herewithall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but that you uphold or (for ought I know) command your ſervants to accuſe me with thoſe treacheries which are meerely yours and theirs in particular? <hi>Olmiro</hi> (who growne to be confuſed in minde at the appearing of this new <hi>Lucano,</hi> and who for knowing what plight he had left the true one in, tooke not this for him, could not for all that upon more ſerious ſurveying him chooſe but beleeve him to be the very ſame, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that reaſon convinced his fancie) ſtood thereat ſo amazed, as he had not the power to utter a word. <hi>Almadero,</hi> on the other ſide, perceiving theſe new injuries to ſpring from the old equivocation of her whom hee before had met with <hi>Corianna,</hi> could not refraine from ſmiling thereat, and had made good ſport of it too, but that hee duely conſidered the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the caſe as it ſtood; whereupon he uſed this milde language.</p>
                  <p>Honeſt friend, if your adverſary hath no greater cauſe to be offended with you, than you have to be angry with him for my ſake; you will then (I am ſure) be both ſoone wrought to an accord; for (I tell you) I am not that Duke you ſay I am; neither is hee here my ſervant, as you take him for. I never ſaw him (I proteſt) to my knowledge till now; nor is it long ſithence I was taken for one <hi>Lucano</hi> whom I know not. What is he, I pray you? Is hee dead or alive? Here <hi>Carildo</hi> felt himſelfe ſtruck to the heart upon the conceiving of his miſtake; whereupon hee crying him mercy, would needs runne to embrace <hi>Olmiro;</hi> who more enraged now than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thruſt him off him, with threatning to be his death if hee but came neere him; doubting indeede of ſome new ſtratagem, for that hee could not beleeve that either <hi>Carildo</hi> tooke <hi>Almadero</hi> for <hi>Lucano,</hi> or that <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dero</hi> knew not <hi>Carildo,</hi> ſince he knew him for the very ſame that was in the wood with the Princeſſe of <hi>Feacia</hi> whom hee tooke for <hi>Corianna.</hi> But being entreated to bee either friends with him, or to tell them his reaſon why he would not be ſo; he anſwered, that a friend to him he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be; and that to tell his reaſon openly, he neither could nor needed; ſince the other knew it but too well. Every of theſe replies were ſo many deaths to <hi>Carildo,</hi> there was never a word of them, that pierced not the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7474:120"/>
very center of his heart. Beleeve mee <hi>Olmiro</hi> (ſaid hee at length) thou wrong'ſt me to accuſe me as thou doeſt; I have not (I vow to thee) offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded other than God, and that too by ſinnes that concerne no other than my ſelfe; and ſince thou wilt not talke with mee in the preſence of theſe noble Gentlemen, be but pleaſed (by their good permiſſion) to retire a-part with me: For, I aſſure thee, that as I would have ſworne that this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Knight was <hi>Lucano,</hi> and on that miſtake, without imagining that I lyed, would not have ſtucke to accuſe him of treachery as well as thee; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhalt thou finde thy ſelfe every way deceived in me; wherein if thou finde me any way faulty, or ſhort of my word, I now here deliver my ſelfe into thy hands to bee puniſhed at thy pleaſure. The Knights perſwaded him to content himſelfe with this his ſo reaſonable proffer, and ſo left them alone. Whereupon <hi>Olmiro</hi> ſaid to the other, Well now; how canſt thou excuſe thy ſelfe of having beene the inſtrument, that the Princeſſe is given for a prey (under what title I know not) to that Knight there, whom thou takeſt on thee to have miſtaken for <hi>Lucano?</hi> whereas <hi>Lucano</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſides my ſelfe have ſeene her with him in the wood. <hi>Carildo</hi>'s heart ſo leap'd for joy, to heare <hi>Lucano</hi> was alive indeed, whereof hee was till then uncertaine in reſpect of his miſtake, that <hi>Olmiro,</hi> who expected to ſee him amazed, marveiled at a contrary effect, when <hi>Carildo</hi> lifting up his eyes to heaven-wards, thus beſpake him.</p>
                  <p>Alas <hi>Olmiro!</hi> how ſtrangely and dangerouſly are we reciprocally mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken! 'tis but a litle while ſithence this Knight came hither, as thou ſhalt ſhortly know; neither ſaw I him ever, till the day that I tooke him for <hi>Lucano;</hi> and yeſterday in the wood, where he courted the Princeſſe of this Countrey, who (for reſembling <hi>Corianna</hi> as you ſhall ſee) deceived you; and he againe (favouring very much <hi>Lucano)</hi> beguiled me, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that, forgetting and ſlighting the Princeſſe, he had given himſelfe over to this new love. Therefore (deere brothere mine) if the Duke lives in ſuch torment, (as indeed he hath reaſon to doe) let us goe and free him of it, and that quickly too, ſithence I have left alſo the Princeſſe in a caſe ſo deſperate for the ſame miſtake, as it is an even lay whether ſhee be by this time alive or no: Vp<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>on this <hi>Olmiro</hi> beleeving now the caſe to ſtand as indeed it did, with lovingly embracing him, heartily cried him mercy: But becauſe the then-dangerous ſtate of the buſineſſe required ſomething elſe than words; they returning ſpeedily to the Knights told them, they were now accorded, with beſeeching them to diſpence with the relation thereof till another time; not without yeelding them infinite thankes for the courteous office done them, but for which they had undoubtedly kild one another.</p>
                  <p>By this time <hi>Almadero</hi> had invited the Princes to come lodge with him; wherefore he anſwered them, that he would expect them at his houſe, out of the curioſity he had to know the end of that buſineſſe, and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to underſtand how hee was taken for another; wherein the Squires promiſed not to faile him, and with that (taking their leave) return'd to <hi>Lucano</hi>'s lodging, where they held it beſt that <hi>Olmiro</hi> ſhould firſt enter, ſo to take from him the occaſion of venting his paſſion on <hi>Carildo:</hi> But ſcarce was he entred when (for miſſing to finde his Lord within) he came out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; upon this, enquiring of the man of the houſe for <hi>Erinnio,</hi> they were
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7474:121"/>
ſhewed him with heavy downe-caſt lookes comming droopingly towards them. Being asked for the Duke, he (with a deepe ſigh) anſwered, that hee was ſlipt away no man knew whither: But eſpying (with that) <hi>Carildo,</hi> he ſtoop'd downe for a ſtone; when <hi>Olmiro</hi> ſeizing on his hand, briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accounted unto him how the caſe ſtood: Whereupon, after friendly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing each other, they went ſo long enquiring after <hi>Lucano</hi> by counter-ſignes, that in the end they learnt he had taken the path of the wood, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward they were then a-going. <hi>Carildo</hi> by the way relates unto the others the life led by <hi>Corianna,</hi> with the manner of their miſtake; but now come to the wood they could not finde him out, although they with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite diligence ſought for him all over: what way therefore to take they knew not, when <hi>Olmiro</hi> thus beſpeakes the other two:</p>
                  <p>Here doe wee (being, as we are, all three together) but trifle out the time; it were therefore better, that thou <hi>Carildo</hi> went'ſt to the Princeſſe to comfort her; and (that done) to returne hither, or to our lodging, if thou haſt but time; then one of us may keepe hereabouts to hinder the Duke to come to fight with the Knight, whilſt the other goes to his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, leſt he chance to come thither; and the firſt of us that happens to finde him, may impart him the good newes, and ſend word to his fellowes. But how ſhall I (ſaid <hi>Erinnio)</hi> finde the way to the cave, in caſe it ſhould behoove me to come thither? Mary very well, as I ſhall now direct thee, (replied <hi>Carildo:)</hi> For, ere we walke an hundred paces farther, I will put thee on a path that leades directly thither, and will withall give thee ſuch counter-ſignes as thou canſt not miſſe of it though thou would'ſt. But ſcarce were they gone fifty ſteps on their way, when they might heare a faint voyce, whoſe pittifull lamentations were often parentheſed with ſighes and teares; whom, upon their paſſing further on, <hi>Carildo</hi> perceived to be the Dutcheſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Corianna</hi> was parted from <hi>Almadero</hi> in a bodily ſtate exceeding feeble (as I told you) having refuſed to accept his courteous proffer of cauſing her to be carried to the Barke, which (for keeping conceal'd the place of her abode) ſhee made him beleeve ſhee had waiting for her returne, but went not farre, ere her heart was ſo choaked with the extreame agony of her paſſionate griefe, that ſhee ſunke breathleſſe to the ground, a benumming cold that ſeized on her corps depriving it of all likelihood of her ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving any more, and the ſoule-afflicted Dutcheſſe having experimented on her all the remedies that place could afford her, and ſeeing them all bootleſſe, was now ſet a bemoaning her, and ſtood a crying over her with rending her cloathes and tearing her haire, when the three Squires arrived, who ſeeing a litle way off the Princeſſe in ſuch a plight, were ready to drop downe for griefe.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Lucano</hi> who remain'd in his lodging, accompanied with none ſave <hi>Erinnio,</hi> whom becauſe hee knew not how to bee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely ridde of, that ſo he might effect his intent, he bethought himſelfe of ſending him to learne out who that Knight might be, and accordingly ſtraightly charged him not to returne without a diſtinct relation thereof. But no ſooner was <hi>Frinnio</hi> gone, than that the Duke got him out of his bed, and then making the beſt ſhift he could to cloathe himſelfe, hee tooke the way of the wood, with an intention to ſtay there, till ſuch time as the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7474:121"/>
Knight (his reputed rivall) came forth, that then he might ſlay him or dye. Laying then himſelfe along under a tree that grew a-part, he might eſpy (a good way off) the three met together, who having ſought him in vaine, went to obſerve the way that led to the cave; he marveiled to ſee them ſo loving together, whereat conceiving an unthought-of hope, hee followed them a-farre off, to ſee what they meant to doe; till ſeeing them make a ſtand, he likewiſe reſted him behinde a tree, from whence he might heare the Dutcheſſe utter theſe deſpairing ſpeeches.</p>
                  <p>And is it poſſible (Madame) that you will burthen poore innocent mee with thoſe vengeances which you inflict on your as innocent ſelf; (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ſhould bee inflicted on no other than injuring Fortune) wounding thereby my very ſoule for not reſerving them for a time more deſperate? Open (deere Madame) alas! open (I beſeech you) thoſe faire eyes of yours; oh let that gentle ſoule of yours reſpire in you; or if you have ſuch power over the Heavens as to dye when you liſt, then befriend mee therewith too, by procuring that I may follow you; for, I truſt I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that favour at your hands; you know I aſſociated you voluntarily in your ſufferings and travels, therefore I hope you will not ſhake mee off from accompanying you in your ſweet repoſe: Beſides, ſithence I forſooke all to ſerve you, it befits not a magnanimous &amp; noble Princeſſe (as you are) to recompence me with this, to you, ſuddaine, to mee unexpected death, and ſo leave mee a miſerable-exild-ſtranger, depriv'd of you even in that place, where among the torments of your inexplicable ſufferings it was my hight of glory to be neere you, both to lament and participate of them. Thou <hi>Lucano,</hi> thou (woe is me) art he, who not content to have (while thou lived'ſt) robb'd her of her free-will, wilt yet (now that thou art dead) deprive her of her life too. But (ſweete Madame) alas will you leave your ſweete litle Prince <hi>Lucandro</hi> motherleſſe, as well as fatherleſſe? his quaint prettineſſe and taking graces muſt then dye too, ſince that when you (both his mother and nurſe) are once dead, there is none then to give him (poore infant) any more ſuck. The diſconſolated Dutcheſſe ſtood ſo attent to her griefes, that the three were come at her ere ſhee ſaw them; ſo as the firſt motive that drew her eyes on them, were theſe words of <hi>Carildo:</hi> Why! what meane theſe ſtrange alterations, Madame? am I come to bring you good newes, and pretend you to receive them with ſo dolorous a ſpectacle? my Lord <hi>Lucano</hi> lives, nobly-honeſt and loyall as ever, nay more! he is here too; and will then his (more than life beloved) Princeſſe dye becauſe ſhee will not ſee him? At that word the Princeſſe opened her eyes, and faintly ſighing peer'd <hi>Olmiro</hi> in the face; when hee proſtrating himſelfe on the ground thus beſpake her.</p>
                  <p>Right excellent Princeſſe, if any tardance of mine bee the occaſion of your Highneſſe ſufferings; I then pray Heavens that yours be my death: But know (my liege Lady) that more than is, could not poſſibly be done; I beſeech you ſtrive with your ſelfe to pluck up a good heart; for to your comfort know that the Duke my Lord is here, and by reaſon of a miſtake lyes in as bad a plight for you, as you doe for him: Bee pleas'd then (I beſeech you) to give us leave to carry you to the cave, that I may then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hye me ſpeedily to him to give him life, and bring him to you.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Lucano</hi> ſtood as a by-ſpectator of this part of a <hi>Tragecomedy,</hi> he
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7474:122"/>
might ſee diſplayed from out the wood another ſcene. The Princeſſe of <hi>Feacia</hi> (whom he before had taken for <hi>Corianna)</hi> not knowing that her <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madero</hi> was otherwiſe buſied, was met by him whom ſhee had eſpied from the hill top: And <hi>Polimero</hi> with his company ſeeing the three Squires comming out of the wood, went another way to finde them out: Whilſt <hi>Lidomia</hi> being told by <hi>Almadero</hi> that he had ſtrangers at home, goes her way. <hi>Lucano</hi> at firſt ſight was almoſt deceived againe; nay he had que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe ſo beene, if the lamentation of the foure had not pointed him out the true <hi>Corianna:</hi> And now ſeeing thoſe Knights goe that-a-way, he made a ſtand, though his heart drew him out of the ambuſh he lay in, as free by then from jealouſie as more than ever ſick of love and pitty. <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anna</hi> (now that ſhee was ſomewhat able) was about to ſpeake in anſwer to <hi>Olmiro,</hi> when ſhee ſaw ſtand over her the five Knights, and a litle after <hi>Almadero; Lindadori</hi> forgetting her deſigne of paſſing for a man, ſate cloſe by her like a young Girle, conforting her with the prettieſt words that could be: When <hi>Almadero</hi> (by this time come) greeted her with theſe ſpeeches.</p>
                  <p>Madame, it hath pleaſed (you ſee) the Gods to chaſtize you for the disfavour you (to your owne prejudice) did me, in refuſing to accept of a ſhort repoſe in my poore houſe: I hope you will now oblige me with that favour, ſithence theſe noble Gentlemen joyne with me to entreate you to ſuffer your ſelfe to be carried up, there to continue till ſuch time as you have recovered ſtrength enough to goe on your intended voyage: But ſhee, not being yet able to ſpeake much, with a low voyce thanking him, told him, that thoſe her three ſervants would carry her very well to her Barke; and with that, calling to her <hi>Olmiro,</hi> ſhee whiſpered him in the eare to goe for the Duke, and bring him preſently to the cave. <hi>Lucano</hi> who ſtanding aſide obſerved all, ſeeing him part, and imagining that hee went for him, ſtept out to <hi>Olmiro,</hi> (a joyfull man to ſee him, whom he was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bethinking with himſelfe whither to goe to finde out) who now told him in two words all the buſineſſe by him before hand ſufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended: That done, <hi>Lucano</hi> ſuddenly breaking through the circle of Knights, proſtrated himſelfe before her, and then taking her by the hand and bathing it with his teares, he affectionately kiſſed it: Shee preſently knew him, and at the very ſight of him inſtantly recovered her full ſtrength, her ſoule then returning to its proper manſion, and her ſpirits executing their ſeverall offices. Claſping then her armes about his neck, forgetting the nice <hi>decorum</hi> of her ſex, and the (at other times bluſh-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing) preſence of ſo many Knights, ſhee (parentheſing her words with greedy kiſſes) thus beſpake him.</p>
                  <p>And what God reſtores you to me now, my ſweete <hi>Lucano?</hi> what ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death (alas!) tooke you from me, deereſt life of my ſoule? Dye I, or live I now, I ſhall live or dye contented for ſeeing you alive, and too withall not anothers but mine. But tell me (I beſeech you) are you indeed <hi>Lucano,</hi> or the ſweete ſpirit that was in him? No, no! you are my true loyall <hi>Lucano.</hi> Spirits (I ſee) are not diſſolv'd by the blowes of Fortune. This your languiſhing paleneſſe is a marke infallible of your love, and a moſt glorious trophey of mine: But (my deere ſoule) you are in ſome ſort recompenced for it, ſince your tombe hath not any either more worthy

                     <hi>Epitaph,</hi> nor your Hearſe any <hi>Elegy</hi> that expreſſe your diſaſters more lively than doth this face of mine, whereon (ſo you but caſt your eye) you may there reade in ſad characters the depoſition of my affection. To this <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano</hi> after he had firſt (as a <hi>preludium</hi> to his ſpeech) vented a few profound ſighes thus anſwered.</p>
                  <p>The life (Madame) that at this preſent I receive, is the hight of ſo great a glory, that the death and now paſt calamities that I ſuffered, come ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſhort of meriting it: Happy therefore were I, if for better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing my loyaltie and to doe you further ſervice, I might often reiterate the ſufferings of my diſaſters. For, though that your favour to me-wards ever the ſame doth ever warrant my content from becomming ſubject to alteration; nevertheleſſe Fortune's ſo various accidents make me (now that I have prov'd and felt them adverſe) reliſh better my happineſſe than before, when I knew nothing of its ſpitefull effects. Onely I affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begge of you, to adde this one favour more to the ſumme of my obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, (which is) that you will preſently cheere up your ſpirits, and live; otherwiſe I proteſt unto you, that I may well reſolve to dye my ſelfe, but not to endure to ſee you leade me the way to either death or griefe: which ſaid, he embracing her affectionately, nouriſhed by the aſſiſtance of their cloſe-joyned lips, her weakely-panting with his freſh-vigorous ſpirits; and then (ſhee having firſt beſtowed ſuch time as was neceſſary for recovering her intercepted breath) bethought of getting her ſelfe up, and to be gone to her retiring-place, her cave: For furthering of which her deſire, the Dutcheſſe, to ſtrengthen her fainting ſpirits, preſented her with a morſell of reſtorative conſerve, which ſhee had brought with her purpoſely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive her, but could not perſwade her to take of it before, becauſe of her then reſolution to ſtarve her ſelfe, or otherwiſe ſet a finall period to her dayes. Now alſo afterwards ſhee was by importunity wonne to taſte of a litle conforting wine, which together with other dainties <hi>Almadero</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be brought downe for her, and now preſented her withall, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out letting her know how ſorry hee was, that her diffidence extended ſo farre as to <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> who were obliged to ſerve her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eromena</hi> lighting now on an occaſion conforming with a determination of hers, concluded on by her husband and the Count of <hi>Bona</hi> of taking her along with them, thus greetes her: Madame, I know you by your high birth, noble ſpirit, and diſaſters, ere e're I had the honour to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with your perſon; and now that I have the happineſſe to know you that <hi>occular</hi> way too, I thanke the Heavens for favouring me ſo much as to finde you out in ſuch a time or plight as I may any way ſteede you. And to the end you may be excuſeleſſe, for not commanding me, I am <hi>Eromena—.</hi> More ſhe would have ſaid, but that name ſcarce expreſt, bred ſuch joy in <hi>Corianna,</hi> that ſhe interrupted her with ſaying; And how happy a day is this for me (Madame) wherein Fortune hath beene ſo liberall as to reſtore me my <hi>Lucano,</hi> that ſo both he and I might perſonally tender our ſervice to you, whom we ſo much honour and deſire to ſerve? But <hi>Eromena</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her ſpeake with a great deale of paines, made her this ſudden reply; Sweete Madame, let us (I pray you) lay aſide all complements, and thinke of ſome meanes of conveying you hence, to take ſome conforting-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall-ſimples, for I conceive you have need of them: Beſides, you may
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7474:123"/>
honour me by voutchſafing to be acquainted with <hi>Polimero</hi> my Lord, and <hi>Lindadori</hi> my daughter, who are alſo come here to ſerve you together with theſe two Knights, the one of them which is this (ſhewing her the Count of <hi>Bona)</hi> having chanced to eſpie you out before, hathconducted us hither expreſſely to bring you along with us to <hi>Sardinia,</hi> where we ſhall with your greater advantage treate of your reconcilements. And then, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter complementall courteſies replied on all ſides <hi>Almadero</hi> would by all meanes have <hi>Corianna</hi> carried up, which favour ſhee accepted not of, but in excuſe thereof ſaid:</p>
                  <p>Courteous Sir, I may not accept of your much-obliging proffer, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I diſlike of it, but for that I cannot conforme the neceſſity of my oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to the deſire I have to obey you; in explanation whereof I muſt tell you, that I am (though I preſume you hitherto know not as much) your neere neighbour, and have at home a young ſucking babe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects me; and therefore I ſhall make bold to begge of you one undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble requeſt (which is) that you would bee courteouſly pleaſed to leave to my <hi>Lucano</hi> and me with our company the uſe of my cave; whereunto (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her reſolution ſo fixt) they all aſſented; ſo as ſhee was ſeated and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thitherward in a chaire accompanied (though againſt her will) with all of them; who when they came to ſee that ſubterranean habitation (though adorn'd with royall furniture) they could not refraine from weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But more than all the reſt <hi>Lucano,</hi> though he afterwards paſſed from a ſea of teares to an Ocean of joy upon ſight of the babe, whom <hi>Lindadori</hi> would needs feede, whilſt <hi>Eromena</hi> (having firſt excluded all the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde) helped <hi>Corianna</hi> to bed; and then ſoone after re-admitting them, ſhee with ſome ſoveraigne reſtoratives by then prepared her by the noble mayden, both conforted and reſtored her enfeebled forces.</p>
                  <p>Full fifteene dayes entertayned they themſelves all of them in <hi>Ericuſa:</hi> For the Prince of <hi>Feacia</hi> being informed of their qualities, went in perſon to conduct and lodge them in a delicious houſe of his pleaſingly-ſcituated on the ſea ſide, where upon <hi>Corianna</hi>'s recovering her former beauties, they were obſerved, although in apparance the ſame with <hi>Lidomia,</hi> to bee animated (though) with different ſpirits; onely ſo farre alike, as tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all marveile of their being taken the one for the other. <hi>Lucano</hi> rather was a greater ſubject of amazement, ſince betweene him and <hi>Almadero</hi> could not be diſcerned any ſenſible difference of favour or making, other than in certaine geſtures, and thoſe too rather habituall than naturall.</p>
                  <p>Many complementall ceremonies paſſed betweene <hi>Eromena</hi> and <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anna,</hi> touching their going together, till at length upon the later her accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the invitation the old Prince furniſhed them with a Galley:</p>
                  <p>Leaving then <hi>Almadero</hi> proteſted-unto of a perpetuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, they fetching about <hi>Sicily,</hi> proſperouſly arrived in <hi>SARDINIA.</hi>
