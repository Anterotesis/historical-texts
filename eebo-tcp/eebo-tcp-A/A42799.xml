            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A RELATION of an unfortunate Voyage To the KINGDOM OF <hi>Bengala.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE parted from <hi>Batavia,</hi> with the Veſſels named <hi>Weſop, Brouwers-haven,</hi> and <hi>Nieuwen-hove,</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. of <hi>September,</hi> in the year One thouſand ſix hundred ſixty one; and ſet Sail towards <hi>Ongueli,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Bengala.</hi> Our Veſſel (called <hi>Ter Schelling)</hi> carry'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 8 pieces of Cannon, and four ſcore and five men; our freight conſiſting chiefly of pieces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Coin,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109000:6"/>
and Copper-Plates.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>23d.</hi> our Maſters Mate, whoſe name was <hi>Hillebrant,</hi> going down into the Hold, to fetch thence ſome Ropes he needed; ſaw or thought he beheld, through the Port-holes, Perſons ſwimming, pale and ſpent, and ſome, that were dead, floating on the Sea. At his coming up he appear'd troubled; and when his heavineſs was ſomewhat alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated, he told us the cauſe of it. Whether his viſion were real, or a pure effect of his melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, yet ſeveral perſons lookt upon it as a bad Omen, and began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the worſt. As for his part, from that very moment he ſtill continued ſad and penſive, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before no man was of a more gay and jolly humour. Such was his ſeriouſneſs, that he could not endure to hear any idle diſcourſes, nor refrain from exhorting us to fervent prayer, for the averting the dangers threatning us. There wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109000:6"/>
not ſome who derided his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and made a ſport of them; wherefore he often beſought God to give theſe Libertins a ſight of what he had ſeen, or ſomething like it; as a means to check their licentiouſneſs and reduce them to ſobriety.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> we were in ſight of the Coaſt of <hi>Bengala,</hi> but knew it not. In this uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty we ſteer'd towards it, and caſt Anchor within two leagues off the ſhore, where our Maſter <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Janz-Stroom</hi> (born at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam)</hi> ſent out the Long-boat, and diſpatch'd the Pilot to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, with Seven or Eight Sea-men and the Steward, who had ſome skill in the Language of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to enquire into the Nature, and Name of that Coaſt we ſaw. We knew that of <hi>Bengala</hi> was full of rocks and dangerous ſhelves, whereon ſeveral Veſſels had been caſt away, but had not that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109000:7"/>
knowledge whereabouts they lay, without which we could not avoid them: Three days paſt ſince our men went on ſhoar, and we in continual expectation of their return. But at length ſuſpected, they were detained captive, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by ſome other misfortune; whereupon we weighed Anchor, and ſought a Port where we might inquire farther after them. After a long ſearch, we deſcryed 3 ſmall Barks that made towards us, from the Land ſide. At which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd, hoping by their means to hear news of thoſe we ſought, and that they would help us out of this perplexity. Theſe Barks ſtopt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a ſtones caſt from our Ship, (as it were,) to conſult, whether they had beſt come on board her, being a Man of War: After about a quarter of an hours deliberation, their Commander, whom they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Orangkai,</hi> drew near with his Bark, and made ſigns to us, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109000:7"/>
the other two were laden with Fowl, and Fiſh, and ſeveral fruits of their Country.</p>
            <p>We gave him to underſtand, in the beſt manner we could, that he had no reaſon to fear; and our ſigns encouraged him. As ſoon as he was on board our Ship, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the other Barks to come up, and unlade their proviſions, which came to us very ſeaſonably: Our Maſter led him into his Cabbin, where he entertained him with all imaginable kindneſs. As they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſcourſe about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, (having firſt made enquiries for our people) our Veſſel touched upon a ſhelf, which put all our Men in an Alarm. The courſe we took to clear our ſelves could not be without noiſe, whereat <hi>Orangkai</hi> was frighted, and believed 'twas a ſignal to betray him. In this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination he thought of nothing but how to eſcape, which he did, ſo dexterouſly, that none of us were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109000:8"/>
aware of it, till he had gotten a great diſtance from us. He ever and anon ſtopt his courſe, and we expected his return, but when we ſaw he forgot to take the money with him, which we paid him, we no longer doubted but his fear was exceſſive; in effect he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and when our Veſſel was on float, we found our ſelves as far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced as we were before. In this extremity, the greateſt part of our Ship were of opinion to expect here our Men, which we did for 8 days together, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; wherefore having cleared our ſelves off this place, we hoiſted Sail in ſearch of the Ships that ſet out with us.</p>
            <p>After a tedious ſearch, we ran upon a long ſhole, whence getting clear, we fell upon another, more dangerous than the former. This obliged us to let down our Boat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, as well to ſound the depth of the Water, as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109000:8"/>
the nature and quality of the place. We could find nothing far and near, but ſhallows and flats; and every where ſo little Water, that we knew not which way to paſs. Then we gave our ſelves for loſt, and were all in a maze, except the Seamen, who in the greateſt danger ran to their bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and drank one anothers healths. In the mean time, we caſt Anchor behind and before, and the Sea growing rough, and Wind high, we could not hinder our Veſſel from having a great breach made in it, and ſinking, had we not cut down our Boltſplit. As to the Boat it was ſwallow'd up in the Sand, and one Man that was in it ſaved, by the aſſiſtance we gave him.</p>
            <p>Thus were we without our Small-boat, or Shalope, out of ſight of Land, and in an unknown Sea. Theſe misfortunes were great, and ſufficient to o'rewhelm us, but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109000:9"/>
theſe were not all, for a while after we found our ſelves in a worſe condition. Whilſt we were Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying to remedy our preſent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, a fierce blaſt of Wind ſnapt both our Cables. We immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threw out two others, which could not hinder the Veſſel from ſtriking againſt a Sandy hill, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cut them with Hatchets, leaving our Anchors in the Sea. And as to the Sails, beſides that the Wind carry'd away our Foretop, we were forced to clear the Veſſel of Water, and let them all down. Moreover the Wind ſo ſwelled the Waves, that the Ship let in Water through the Port-holes, and we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected every moment when ſhe would daſh againſt a Rock. Great was our fear, but not general; for whilſt the greateſt part were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their ſins, and imploring God's pardon, before whom they were now going to appear; the Sea-men were making merry, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109000:9"/>
ſinging with their full Cups in their hands; that though the Sea were rough and terrible, yet would they hinder it from poſſeſſing that part, into which they pow'red down their liquor. Thus did theſe wretches defie all danger, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brave Death it ſelf, which they called the Scare-crow of vulgar Souls, and the ſcorn of thoſe that knew it in it ſelf. Whilſt they were drinking on one hand, and we praying on the other, a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den blaſt of Wind drove our Ship from between the ſholes, and ſet it on float again: We began to be in hopes, when, immediately, the Water ſprang in from all ſides: Whereupon we fell to work with our Pumps, but to little purpoſe, the Water coming in ſo faſt upon us; yet perhaps had all our Men (who were to the number of 70) uſed their utmoſt endeavours, they might have been ſucceſsful, but moſt of 'em were ſo weak, that they could ſcarcely ſtand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:109000:10"/>
This misfortune was attended by another, to compleat our miſery; for none of us knew what courſe to Steer; nor the Maſter, or Pilots what to determine. After ſeveral conteſts, they were found to be of contrary judgments; theſe were for going on one ſide, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter another, and his opinion was followed. We went not far before we found which was the beſt, for that of the Sea-men would have carry'd us far from the Coaſt. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we were well enough ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in that particular, yet had we ſeveral other perplexities to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with, for the Water ſtill gained upon us, and we had been a great while out of the ſight of Land, and in the want of proviſion. Moreover we were all ſo overcome with ſleep, and wearineſs, that we were not able to ſtand. In this condition were we, when he that was upon the Watch cryed out, <hi>Land, Land,</hi> and that 'twas near
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109000:10"/>
us. This good news put us all in heart again; and made us fall to work afreſh: But this hope did not laſt long, for 3 or 4 hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had the Tide againſt us, which hindred us from advancing, ſo that at night we were forced to caſt Anchor at 3 Leagues diſtance from Land, about 4 fathom deep. This laſt misfortune compleated our ſorrow, for we could Pump no longer; and the Water apparently ſtill gained upon us: Yet did the moſt able among us (ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready to periſh in ſight of Land) uſe their utmoſt endeavours, and encouraged one another, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to cut the Cable the next Morning, to advance with the Floud, as near as we could to Shore. But ſcarcely had we ſpent 6 hours, in this undertaking; when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that of one Bucket of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, half of it was Sand, with which we had ballaſted our Ship, which broke all our meaſures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:109000:11"/>
Since this unhappy accident, we thought of nothing, but yielding up our ſelves to the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and all means failing us, ſome gave way to ſleep, others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted it, being not able to reſolve upon ſhutting their eyes againſt that light, which they were now upon the point of ever loſing; and ſome again whom hunger more terrified than either ſleep or death, ſo earneſtly demanded meat; that the Maſter ordered, every Man his ſhare of ſtrong Waters, and ſmoakt Beef. The Steward obeyed with much difficulty; but ſeeing himſelf ſorced to it, diſtributed ſuch a ſmall quantity of both, that 'twould have made a Man apt to think, we had ſtill a long Voyage to make.</p>
            <p>In the mean time theſe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and fatigues had ſo exhauſted our Mens ſpirits, that ſeveral be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came frantick, and ſhewed ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, as would have forced laughter at another time. The
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109000:11"/>
Cook ran up the ſcuttles and came down again in a great heat, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the pains he had taken, in fiſhing for <hi>Duckers;</hi> with which he vaunted he would make a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goo, that ſhould quicken the dead. Others could not comprehend the danger we were in, and forgetting what had paſſed, were continually talking of the profits and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they would make of this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. As ſoon as we left Pumping, we ſaw our Main-yard, and that before, which we let down, were full of <hi>Duckers,</hi> which were eaſily taken.</p>
            <p>Several of thoſe that had the right uſe of their Sences, cauſed a parcel of Beans to be dreſſed (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Kitſeri)</hi> which were found ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the bottom of a Sea-man's Cheſt, that lay aſleep; we eat them with a great deal of pleaſure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though deem'd this would be our laſt Repaſt. A while after there entred ſo much Water through the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109000:12"/>
Port-hole of the Cooks Cabbin, where the violence of the Waves had made a breach, that we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make holes in the Deck, to let the Water run down into the Hold; which we ſtopt with much difficulty, with plates of Lead wrapt about with Tow. After this, the luſtieſt amongſt us were forced to repoſe themſelves, not being able to reſiſt the deſire of ſleeping: As for my own part (who had hitherto made a ſhift to bear up) I laid me down on a Cheſt, that was faſtened to the Deck, not giving my ſelf the liberty of an eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Couch, in a time, wherein I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved I was ſo near to Death.</p>
            <p>Scarcely had I reſted thereon an hour, but the ſcreeks of thoſe that firſt perceived the Veſſel to incline on one ſide, awakened us, and ſhewed us the danger we were in: Then it was that our confuſions encreaſed, and every Man endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to withdraw out of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109000:12"/>
preſs, to ſeek alone ſome means to ſave himſelf. It was obſerved that 3 of our Sea-men were wanting, whom we ſuppoſed to be drowned at the bottom of the Hold, where they had laid themſelves down to reſt.</p>
            <p>We were 2 hours in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, moſt of us half dead, and hopeleſs, when the Veſſel rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it ſelf up again. This change ſo ſurprized us, that we could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe it; but when we were well aſſured of it, our hearts retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſorrow gave place to joy. Several ran to their Cheſts putting on their beſt Cloaths, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Strong-water, which was not refuſed them, and had immediately a pleaſant effect upon 'em: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dealt out their melancholly thoughts, imagining themſelves great perſonages, and talkt only of Millions. Theſe whimſeys were tolerable, in compariſon of the Sea-mens exceſſes, who continued
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109000:13"/>
in their outbravings of Death, and its Conſequences. Some of them that had taken ſuch pains to dreſs themſelves, went along with the Saylers into the great Cabbin; whence ever and anon coming out with their Caps on one ſide their Heads, and their Glaſſes in their Hands, they invited the reſt to imitate them in Singing Bawdy Songs, and Dancing. There were ſome that ſeemed more ſolid, yet were clearly for drinking, to make themſelves (as they ſaid) leſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the fears Men feel in ſuch extremities. Theſe kept ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but others more bruitiſh, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves like Swine, till they loſt wholly their reaſon.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Death drew ſtill nearer us, and our only reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, was to make a Machine where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to ſave our ſelves, when the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſunk. The Carpenter offered to make one, and with the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſome others took down the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109000:13"/>
Sail-yards, Maſts, and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; with which he made imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately a kind of Veſſel, that might hold 40 Men: We were more in number, but the Libertins ſcoft at our pre-caution, and would not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt us, ſo that for want of help we could not make it larger nor ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: So great was the hard hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs of ſeveral of our Men that they would not ſo much as lend us the Knifes or Hatchets we need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Cooks Mate was one of 'em: This Man named <hi>William Ysbrants</hi> had good ſtore by him, and ſo far was he from parting with them, that he withheld others from doing it, by his perſwaſions, ſaying he knew a ſhorter and better way to ſave them that would be ruled by him. In fine, maugre this hard hearted Wretch, and the Sea-mens gang, who continued on their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, we finiſhed our Float-boat, which we faſtned to the Veſſel, till we made Oars to guide it. When
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109000:14"/>
every thing was ready, each Man that was willing to go in it had given him 10 pieces of currant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the Kingdom of <hi>Bengala,</hi> for his relief when at ſhore. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we went off we muſt drink a parting Cup, of which moſt drank ſo deep, that they made themſelves drunk. I deſigned to have been one of thoſe that left the Veſſel, but a friend hindred me, he told me I muſt not leave him, for he lookt upon that Machine to be extream dangerous, eſpecially conſidering the condition of thoſe Perſons that took upon 'em to guide it, being moſt of 'em drunk, and ready to quarrel; the Machine ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, moreover, level with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and over laden. So I ſtaid in the Veſſel with the Maſter, and ſome others, whoſe number was far inferiour to thoſe that left us. Scarcely were they gotten a ſtones caſt, but ſeveral of them repented they forſook us, and ſwam back
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109000:14"/>
again, ſo that upon their return we found we were 32 Men; according to which reckoning there muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome 40 in the Machine, where they endeavoured to uſe the Sail of the Shalope; but beſides that it was too heavy, the Wind cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about half an hour after, ſo that they advanced very little.</p>
            <p>When we loſt ſight of them, we beſought God to preſerve 'em; to the end, that according to their promiſe, the inhabitants might come out to help us. Then the Maſter of the Veſſel, cauſed a Sack of <hi>Dutch</hi> Biſcuit to be brought him, and a ſmall quantity of ſmoaked Beef, which we ſoon devoured. In the mean while we ſpyed our people again a great way off, but this was but for a moment, for we never could ſet ſight on 'em after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; which made us ſuſpect their Machine failed them, and was ſunk by ſome unexpected diſaſter, which was very probable, ſeeing we could
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109000:15"/>
not hear the leaſt news of them. The ſtrong conjectures we had of their loſs, diſpoſſeſſing us of our hope (for we laid great ſtreſs on the good offices they promiſed to render us, when at land) put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reſolves to make another Boat; which, when finiſhed, could not hold above 10 or 12 Men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were we forced to take other meaſures, and began to cut down the Scuttles of the Main-maſt, which had been already cut, and ſtript from its tackle. We after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wanted the Sail-yard, but it being far in the Water, entangled with its Ropes and Sail, we could not get it out thence, believing it to be a thing impoſſible; at length, my friend before mention'd, (whoſe name was <hi>William Baſtians)</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Rope to be faſt'ned about his middle, and ſo was let down into the Sea, to cut all theſe entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which hindred us from fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing our undertaking. In the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109000:15"/>
mean while, the Night and Waves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually incommodated us, the firſt by its obſcurity, and the others by their violence: Thus were we every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ready to periſh.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the greateſt part were buſied in cutting down the Fore-maſt, which was the only one that ſtood; ſix of our Men plotted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to ſlip away privately in our Machine, without caring what might become of their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they were juſt ready to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their treacherous deſign, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already cut the 2 Ropes by which it was faſtned, and began to put off from the Ship; when the Maſt, which we cut, fell down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea before it, and by its fall diſcovered, and forced 'em back. Had not this hapned, without doubt we had periſhed that Night, for the foul weather encreaſed, the Waves became boyſterous, and the Veſſel unable to reſiſt them. We haſtned then to accommodate to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109000:16"/>
our Boat, the Maſt we had fell'd, which rendred it fit to carry 20 Men, and we were in all 32. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight the Tide being half ſpent, we would willingly ſtaid its return, and embarkt our ſelves by Day light, but the danger was too preſſing to uſe delays.</p>
            <p>We then began to prepare for our departure out of the Veſſel, taking along with us but a ſmall quantity of Proviſion, 2 Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, 2 Cutlaſſes, a Sword, a Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ax, ſome Oars made in haſte, a Lanthorn, and Candles for the night.</p>
            <p>Thus ſorrily furniſhed, did we forſake the Veſſel, and put our ſelves into the Boat, where each of us, with his Oar in his hand, made towards the ſhore. 'Tis impoſſible to expreſs what we underwent; but it may be eaſily imagin'd, that being in the Water up to the middle, in a cold Seaſon, and dark Night, we could not be much at
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109000:16"/>
eaſe. As ſoon as the day appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we had the Tide againſt us, and being not able to reſiſt it, were carried by it ſo far, that we loſt ſight of Land. An hour after we deſcryed it, and uſed our utmoſt endeavours to reach it; but the Currants which were ſwift made all attempts fruitleſs. This miſhap was attended by another; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of us fell into <hi>deliriums,</hi> and in this condition became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding troubleſome to the reſt: Some of 'em would needs go to their Cheſts, to take thence the Linnen they wanted. Others were ſearching for the Kitchin, to warm themſelves. But he that gave us moſt trouble, was my friend <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Baſtians,</hi> who ſuppoſing, as well as the reſt, that he was ſtill on Board the Ship; demanded where we carried him; and rowing a quite contrary courſe to the reſt, cryed out; <hi>Pray let me alone, I'll carry you where we ſhould be, I ſee</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:109000:17"/>
Hellevoutſlus <hi>Caſtle; courage, we are at it. A coxcomb,</hi> cryed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>he ſees a Caſtle, ay, we are at it as much as I am at</hi> Rome. <hi>'Tis a Church,</hi> ſays the Carpenter, <hi>a ſtately Fabrick indeed, how it gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens againſt the Sun! What ails theſe Fools,</hi> cried another, <hi>to take the Maſt of a Ship for a Church, and a Caſtle? Theſe poor wretches have loſt their ſences.</hi> I laughed ſome time at their extravagancies, and within a while (as I was told) fell into the ſame condition. <hi>O griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>they are making merry at the Bear, yonder, and I may not be with 'em: I will make one amongſt 'em.</hi> The Maſter who ſat neareſt with-held me; but I fiercely flung away from him, and ran into the water. Whence I was quickly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, but neither the cold, nor apprehenſion of the danger I eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, could make me come to my ſelf: Yet I felt I was extream cold, and would had the Maſter pull off
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109000:17"/>
his Cloaths to accommodate me with 'em; thus continuing, I took a Barrel for the Kitchin, and ſat my ſelf down by it to dry and warm me. This imaginary fire did me, perhaps, as much good as if it had been real; for methoughts I felt it mighty comfortable, ſo that I fell aſleep, and at waking returned to my right ſences.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Tide car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us ſo far, that we loſt all hope; we earneſtly beſought God to put an end to our miſeries by death, or ſhew us how to avoid them. Some time after we thought we ſaw Land, and Cows feeding; believing it to be an effect of our Prayers, we continued them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one to another, that ſeeing what we had already done, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us the ſight of Land, without doubt the continuation of our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would bring us to it: It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to expreſs the joy this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion gave us, for 'twas no better;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109000:18"/>
being only a ſandy Bank caſt up by the violence of the Sea. This ſad miſtake ſtruck us all in amaze, eſpecially conſidering, moreover, that our Machine which began to ſink, could not carry us far. The moſt reſolute amongſt us, ſeeing the danger encreaſing, determined for the lightning of the Boat, to puſh in the Night, as many as they could of their Companions into the Sea. Heaven would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer 'em to execute their cruel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; for the Carpenter bethought himſelf we had to a conſiderable weight in Money, which might ſerve us inſtead of an Anchor, or Counter-poiſe; that would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in two reſpects. For beſides that, the Machine would not by this means be oppreſſed with it; this Counter-poiſe would ſtand us in good ſtead in a contrary Tide. His advice was taken, and every Man freely parted with his Mony, which was put into a pair of cloſe-kneed-breeches,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109000:18"/>
tied with a Cord; and then into another pair, which we tyed faſt; and ſo into a <hi>3d.</hi> which we let down to the bottom, faſtn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Rope, when minded to ſtop. We made another packet of this Money, which we uſed inſtead of a Plummet, to find on what ſide the Tides caſt us. Both one and the other of theſe were ſo uſeful to us, that in a ſhort time we found our ſelves ſo near Land, as not to fear any more the loſing it.</p>
            <p>About 2 in the After-noon, we took up our Anchor, to give eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man his own again, which they took without counting, ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were they poſſeſſed with joy to ſee themſelves out of danger: So that ſome who contributed moſt, were content with leaſt; and thoſe that gave leaſt, found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves greateſt ſharers. So greatly indifferent were we in this matter, that a conſiderable ſum remained without any Owner, which was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109000:19"/>
diſtributed to thoſe that had none, being certain that of all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Coyns we brought, there were not one but would paſs in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Bengala.</hi> After this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution there was found a Sack in a Barrel, full of Biſcuit, which no body regarded, and had been left behind, had not the Maſter ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken charge of it.</p>
            <p>We came at length ſo near the ſhoar, that we thought we ſaw Fiſher-men ſtretching out their Nets to dry 'em. Coming nearer, we ſpyed other perſons, that ſeem'd to wear the ſame habits as we, whom we ſuppoſed to be thoſe that left us. They had all the ſame Cloaths, Hats, and Caps, except ſome that wore Canvaſs, taken out of a Sail; and others that were only in their Drawers. Thus did they appear to us through our Spying-Glaſs, and every one that made uſe of it, believed they ſaw very diſtinctly with it, what they ſaw but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109000:19"/>
without it. The Tide car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us not to that ſide, neither brought us ſo ſoon to ſhoar, as we deſired. This ſlowneſs made us ſtill fear, and there was one ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient as to throw himſelf in the Water, to try whether he could not ſwim to Land, but his heart failed him, and he was glad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. In the mean time we called to mind, that the inhabitants of <hi>Bengala,</hi> had a deadly antipathy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Swines fleſh, ſome of which we kept ſtill by us; whereupon 'twas agreed to throw it into the Sea. But that which moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled us, was to ſee 'em raſhly caſt over-board a Barrel of Biſcuit which might ſtood us in good ſtead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtributed amongſt us, who were almoſt dead with hunger. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral oppoſed the doing it, but were anſwered, we ſhould have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter food at Land.</p>
            <p>So we came to ſhoar, and left our Machine at the diſpoſal of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109000:20"/>
Sea. As ſoon as ever we were Landed, our Maſter, and 10 or 12 more, that were the beſt able a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, ran immediately upon the diſcovery, the reſt ſlowly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after; intreating 'em to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, and find 'em a convenient place to dry themſelves, being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually preſſed with cold and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. In our march we entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another with Relations of our particular ſufferings, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in being thus delivered from them. We went on thus, diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with as much freedom and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, as if we had already ſeen the inhabitants, ſtriving to outvy one another in our kind reception: Some ſaid that thoſe we ſaw when on the Sea, whether <hi>Dutch-men</hi> or <hi>Moors,</hi> could not be far from us. Others alledged that thoſe <hi>Moors</hi> being out a Fiſhing for their Maſters, had met our people, and carried 'em to their Huts; and that we might find them in a thicket directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109000:20"/>
us. Talking thus, we went on jocundly to this Grove, where we doubted not but the Inhabitants would receive us, to our content: But our opinion was ill grounded, for being come to it, we found nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man nor Beaſt; nor any Path, or Track to guide us; or the leaſt ſign it were ever inhabited. Some that were moſt tired relying on the refreſhments they expected to meet here, could not believe what they ſaw; and calling out as loud as they were able, imagined they muſt be anſwer'd, but were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; ſo that we muſt continue on our march through a melancholly, thick Wood, and which was, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, full of wild Beaſts. This imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, together with the preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected diſappointment and paſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, compleated our ſorrows: As we went on, our hearts being ready to burſt with grief; and demanding of one another, what could befall'n our Maſter, and thoſe that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109000:21"/>
him, we found them lying in a profound ſleep; and the need we had to do the ſame, made us willingly imitate them.</p>
            <p>At our waking, all our diſcourſe was about the <hi>Moors,</hi> and <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> which we imagined we ſaw near the ſhoar; whom, not finding in that place, we no longer doubted, but this Viſion was an illuſion. The day being far ſpent, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to paſs over the night in the ſame place we lay; ſpending ſome time in providing Wood, of which we made 3 Piles in form of a Triangle, which we ſet on fire with the Candle we brought with us in the Lanthorn. We placed a Sentinel near each fire, to aſſure us againſt the ſurprizes of the wild Beaſts, and by this means warmed our ſelves in greater tranquility.</p>
            <p>The nights were ſo cold, and we ſo ill Cloathed, that we could not reſt; and when we could, our Chaplin was ſo full of ravings, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:109000:21"/>
he would have put us all into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; whatſoever we could do to pacifie him, he kept ſtill in a rage; furiouſly demanding what meant this change at <hi>Batavia,</hi> and how it came to paſs we were thus uſed; at ſome he threw his Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, at others his Hat, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to extirpate theſe Slaves from off the face of the Earth, that thus ſerved him.</p>
            <p>Thus did we ſorrowfully paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Night, and at break of Day began to think of diſcamping, to find a more commodious retreat. One of the laſt that waked was our Chirurgion, who ſtarting up in a maze, cryed out, we had robbed him, and that he would have us before a Juſtice of Peace. The noiſe he made, diſturbed our poor Chaplain; who ſuppoſing him to have been ſome Slave, that made reſiſtance, cried out, Murder, Help, Help, theſe Slaves have taken Arms. The Chirurgion that knew not he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109000:22"/>
was diſtracted (for he had ſlept very quietly) believed what he ſaid, and was for putting himſelf in a poſture of defence, till we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the others folly. Well, ſays he, though he be a fool, yet I am not one; for 'tis too true, that of 6 Bags of Money I had, I have been robbed of 3 this Night. We thought him at firſt in the ſame caſe as the other, but at length found him otherwiſe; and whether his loſs were real or imaginary, he ſtill continued to demand ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but had little notice taken of him, for we were for changing our ground, and moving forward, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the poor Chaplain, in a diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted condition behind us, for no body would take charge of him.</p>
            <p>We drew near then to the ſhoar, in hopes of finding either the Fiſher-men, or other People, for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. The firſt object we met, was a great Tortoiſe without a head; and immediately after a Buffle
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109000:22"/>
ſtretcht out on the ground, whoſe head was half rotten, and full of maggots. Several Animals, which the inhabitants called <hi>Leganes,</hi> were about this Creature, which ſmelt ſo ſtrong, that we could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to come near it. But ſome days after we had not the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, nor were ſo delicate, for hunger ſo ſorely preſt us, that the ſtink could not hinder us from gnawing it to the very bones.</p>
            <p>About a quarter of a League from that place, we found our ſelves near a River; on the other ſide of which, we ſpyed 8 <hi>Moors,</hi> whom we took for <hi>Bengaloiſes.</hi> We im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately endeavoured to paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, but found it too deep for us. An hour after, it appeared to us more Fordable, and we paſſed over it, in effect, with as much joy as if certain of a happy ſucceſs. When we had gotten on the other ſide, theſe <hi>Moors</hi> ran to meet us, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves down at our feet,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:109000:23"/>
and kiſſed them; and thus remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a long time, lifting up their eyes to Heaven, and pronouncing ſome words, whereby we ſuppoſed they deſigned to declare their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the injuſtice done 'em. Theſe People being 8 in number; to wit 4 Men, 2 Women, and 2 Children, ſeemed to us much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, but we could not underſtand them; and all that we could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, in feeing a certain kind of Boat on float which had brought them thither, was that they were ſome poor Slaves, whom their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters cruelty had obliged to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>Theſe people then being not the perſons we wanted, we paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again the River; where having made a good fire, we went in ſearch of the Tortoiſe we ſaw, whom we roaſted in his ſhell: Each of us took our part of him (which could not be great, for we were Thirty of us) and greedily devoured it. And
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109000:23"/>
being ſtill preſt with hunger, we regretted the Proviſions that were thrown over Board, ſaying one to another, we were juſtly puniſhed for our fooliſh prodigality. Theſe lamentations were followed by a penſive ſilence, and in fine, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which ended, we betook our ſelves (as well as we could) to reſt.</p>
            <p>The next Morning before we took our march, our Maſter gave each of us a ſlice of Cheeſe, from one that weighed about 3 pound, which he brought from the Ship; and by the Chirurgions order, who was alſo our Phyſician, we drank thereupon a Cup of Water half ſalt, and found our ſelves in good plight.</p>
            <p>After about 5 or 6 hours march, we came at the Lands end, which gave us to underſtand that this place was an Iſland, and diſtant from main Land about 8 or 9 Leagues. Theſe conjectures extreamly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109000:24"/>
us; and we began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves for the worſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to dye with hunger in that barren and deſert place. We could ſee nothing but Trees, ſome of which were dry and withered, and others green, laden only with leaves; a ſad and bitter nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet with which we were forced to be contented.</p>
            <p>We ſtood upon this point, till we came to a determination, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that 'twas our ſureſt courſe to return to the place where we paſt over the firſt Night. And in our way came to the place where we had eaten the Tortoiſe, in hopes to find thoſe aforementioned <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes.</hi> For fear of making 'em wild, 2 of our Men, armed with a Hatchet and Cutlaſs, marched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and we followed 'em at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. They returned ſoon after with one of theſe Animals, which we carried to the place we intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Having left our Chaplain
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:109000:24"/>
here, we ſearcht about, and called him, but could neither ſee nor hear him.</p>
            <p>We ſought afterwards a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious place wherein to fix, during our ſtay in this Iſland, and judged it were better to ſettle near the Shoar, than the Wood, where we could not expect any ſuccour from the Sea; our only hope of getting out of this doleſom place, conſiſting in our expectation of ſome Veſſels paſſing by.</p>
            <p>We gathered Wood, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lighted, we cut the <hi>Legane</hi> with his skin, into as many pieces as we were Men. Every one took his ſhare, and dreſt it as beſt liked him; thoſe that were moſt hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, ſcarcely at all, leaſt the fire ſhould diminiſh it, and the others very little, for the ſame reaſon, it being ſmall enough already; this Animal not exceeding the bigneſs of a Cat. The fleſh of it is very unſavory and unpleaſant, but our
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109000:25"/>
extream hunger gave it a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and likewiſe the Water, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding its brinyneſs. Half an hour after we took our Bibles (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 2 with us) and the Pilot read Prayers, which ended, we repoſed our ſelves round the fire by turns, for we could not all of us be at it together.</p>
            <p>The next Morning we began the day, with our requeſts to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, to compaſſionate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from our miſeries, which ſeemed already greater then we could bear; then every one went his way. The Chirurgion bethought himſelf, as he walkt along to taſte the Leaves of the Trees: Which having done, and finding 'em good, all the reſt followed his example. We chewed 'em, at firſt, a great while, before we ſwallowed 'em; but at length found 'em ſo delicate, that we never taſted bread in our lives, that reliſht half ſo well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:109000:25"/>
Although thefe Leaves ſeem'd moſt delicious meats, yet were we not ſo much in love with 'em, but could willingly left them for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and had the Boars, Staggs, and Buffles, that haunted the Woods, and came down and bathed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Marſhes, been willing to be taken, (for we had no Guns to ſhoot 'em) I do not doubt but we could have well diſpenſed with them, but theſe Animals had good leggs, and ran too faſt for us. One day marching along the ſhoar, we ſpied 2 great Serpents, that put us in amaze. We moved from 'em, but being extream hungry, and judging a good repaſt might be made of them, we gathered round about 'em, with each of us a ſtick in our hands, and ſoon conquer'd 'em: We cut off their Heads and Tails, and having flead, and waſht them, gave each Man his ſhare, which we greedily devoured; and yet none of us were thereby incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:109000:26"/>
At the end of each repaſt, we were as much troubled for more; and went in ſmall companies, ſome on one ſide, and ſome on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whence for the moſt part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning empty, we fell upon the Leaves, which we could eat well enough, but they contain'd little nouriſhment. We went, my friend and I, ſeveral times to the Sea ſide, to ſee whether the Sea had not caſt up ſomething on the ſhoar, that might ſtand us in ſome ſtead, but all in vain: And one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, being more than ordinary hungry, we all met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, bemoaning our ſelves in a more piteous manner, then can be expreſſed. We were a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted at the fight of ſome Beans, which certain of our Company found. Never was any thing ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a better appetite, nor found to be of a better taſte: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our hearts returned again, and having ſmoakt a Pipe or 2 of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109000:26"/>
Leaves of Trees, inſtead of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, we exhorted one another to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves under the Divine Providence. The joy, for having made ſo good a meal, endured not long, for an hour after we had eaten them, we felt ſuch pangs, as made us believe they were mortal. Our greateſt pain was to fetch breath, for we ſeemed every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the point of death. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lain in this condition near 3 hours, we breathed more freely, and began to get up, but were ſo weak, that we could ſcarcely ſtand. From that time our ſtrength whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fail'd us, and whether 'twas an effect of thoſe Beans, or the little nouriſhment we received ſince ſo long a time, we were not able to carry ſticks to make a fire. This miſhap was attended by a diſguſt to the Leaves which we hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore found ſo good, but now could eat no longer of 'em, ſo great was our averſation to 'em, becauſe when
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109000:27"/>
we had eaten them, we felt in our mouths a ſtrong ſtink, like unto that of Buggs, which became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable to us. Inſtead of theſe Leaves, I tried often to eat Graſs, but found that worſe, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to ſwallow it.</p>
            <p>Our ſtrength every day decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſeeing no likelihood of getting out of this doleſom place, we conſulted together touching the making of ſome kind of Boat, wherein to tranſport our ſelves elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; whereupon we cut down ſeveral ſmall Trees that grew along the Water ſide, from which we took off the Peel, which ſerved to faſten the ſeveral parts of it. This Boat could not contain above 5 Men, and every perſon pretended to be of that number, for although the order ran, that they ſhould return with all poſſible haſte, to help the reſt with what proviſion they could find, yet this was an advantage to them, who before
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109000:27"/>
they returned would be ſure to refreſh themſelves firſt. To adjuſt this difference, we all agreed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelves to the Maſter, who choſe whom he thought beſt, and counſelled them to Coaſt along the Iſle, till they came to the point where we were; and then ſuffering themſelves to be guided by the Tide, it would carry them towards 2 Iſlands, above which they might find firm Land, which he judged to be not above 8 or 9 Leagues diſtant from the point we ſtood upon. Beſides theſe inſtructions, he gave them a Compaſs to Steer by: And having taken ſome Leaves along with them for their ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they parted the <hi>13th.</hi> day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our arrival in this Iſland, with ſolemn proteſtations, that if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven proſpered their deſign, they would not fail to return with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for the delivering us out of this Deſart. They had each of 'em an Oar, but neither Anchor,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109000:28"/>
or any thing elſe to ſtop their Boat in a contrary Tide; Yet they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bigg with hope of an happy ſucceſs, which we wiſhed 'em in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching 'em to make a ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they left us, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took our ſelves to the Woods, where ſearching for food in vain, we were conſtrained to content our ſelves with the Leaves of Trees, which we could ſcarcely ſwallow without ſomething elſe to allay their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs. Thus were we pinched with hunger, when we believed we could not do better, than to ſeek the Corps of our Chaplain, whom we infallibly ſuſpected to be dead, and were troubled we could not find it; for having ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten 2 Serpents without hurt, we ſuppoſed humane fleſh could not much harm us.</p>
            <p>The deſire of eating ſomething more ſolid than the Leaves of Trees, continuing to preſs us, 'twas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109000:28"/>
to kill one of the Boys that were with us; but Heavens ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, that this was not long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, which hapned well for all the reſt, for had once a beginning been made, 'tis certain 'twould been continued, and we ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſecret fraud, or open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence fall'n upon one another. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the deſign was rejected by the moſt part, yet did we miſtruſt one another, and from that time ſlept in fear, every Man dreading the reſt conſpired againſt him, and appointed the time of his reſt for that of cutting his Throat.</p>
            <p>About Evening we underſtood, that 2 of our Company, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Land, thoſe that parted in the Morning by Water, had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken 'em at Night, at the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands point, where they begged ſo earneſtly to be taken along with 'em, that they could not deny them, having firſt faſt'ned to their Boat ſome Trees.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:109000:29"/>
In the mean time one of our companions came and inform'd us, that he ſaw a Serpent of a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſize; that he dar'd not attack him alone, but 'twere no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for all of us to conquer him. Each of us immediately then haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned joyfully to the place with his ſtick in his hand. Where by the way we killed a <hi>Legane,</hi> that fell off a Tree at our feet, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed we had wherewithal to mix with our Leaves, we kept on our courſe. But by miſhap the Serpent was gone; and we had the vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſearching him a great while in vain, This being a ſore diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, we needed ſome happy adventure to make us amends, and deſired no better, than to meet with the Corps of our Chaplain. We ſought it with the ſame ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs as we did the Serpent, but all our endeavours proving fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; we divided the <hi>Legane</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, the portions of which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109000:29"/>
were ſo ſmall that had it not been for the Leaves we eat with it, 'twere impoſſible for us to ſleep that Night. A long time were we, after this repaſt without finding any thing; being exceeding faint and weak, when the Carpenter brought to us his Cap full of Snails. Theſe little inſects had neither Horns nor Shels, and we took 'em for Snails, for want of a more proper name to give 'em. But without troubling our ſelves much about their name, or quality, we cauſed the Carpenter to bring us to the place where he found 'em, and took all that remained. At our return, laying 'em down upon the ground, they appeared to us to be of a Blewiſh colour; which made us believe they were veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Creatures, and that 'twas dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous eating them. This was the opinion of ſome; but the greateſt part, argued on the contrary, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that ſeveral Beaſts paſt for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109000:30"/>
venomous, that were ſo only in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion: Witneſs, the Serpents we had eaten, whoſe venom is ſaid to be ſharp and dangerous, and yet did them no harm. That, having made this experiment with ſucceſs, they might with as much reaſon try another; and ſuppoſing 'em to be venomous, yet the fire would clarifie them.</p>
            <p>This reaſoning prevailed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we agreed, all of us to eat of 'em, and made a great fire to roaſt them, putting 'em under the Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars; and when they were ready, eat 'em, and found 'em good; and to compleat our Banquet, drank Salt-water, and then began to think of repoſing our ſelves. An hour or two after, the Carpenter found himſelf ill, and fell immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Fits. As ſoon as we ſaw him in this condition, we imagined 'twould not be long before we fell into the ſame extremity, and in the mean time conſulted together,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109000:30"/>
touching the ſeveral ſorts of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-poiſons we ever heard mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But all to no purpoſe, ſeeing we wanted them, as well as other neceſſaries, wherefore we prepared our ſelves for the patient ſuffering whatſoever might befall us.</p>
            <p>Half an hour after, we became affected in the ſame manner as the Carpenter. For two hours we felt moſt ſharp pains in our Bowels, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſhortneſs of breath, with which we were ſo oppreſſed, that all hope of recovery forſook us. Yet by degrees our pangs ceaſed, but our weakneſs continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and as ſoon as we were able to go, hunger pinching us, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we were forced to glut our ſelves with Leaves. Ever ſince we uſed them, we were never free from the gripes in our Bowels; ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch dolorous pangs, that there are no torments, we would not willingly choſen before them. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done all we could to comfort
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109000:31"/>
us, we committed our ſelves to the Divine Providence, to which we recommended our ſelves without ceaſing.</p>
            <p>Our miſery every day encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and ſtrength diminiſhing, we conſulted together touching the means of our deliverance. After every Man had communicated his thoughts, it plainly appeared to us all, that unleſs we made a Machine, wherein to tranſport our ſelves to the other ſide, we muſt undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly periſh. All were agreed, that this was the only remedy left us; eſpecially ſince we no longer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the return of our compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thoſe that obſerved them, aſſured us, they were carried off from the Coaſt by the force of the Tide, and ſo periſhed with hunger before they could come to Land. And upon this opinion was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the deſign of making another Boat; but the undertaking was difficult, and upon conſultation of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109000:31"/>
our ſtrength, we found our ſelves unable to do it. Therefore we were forced to yield to neceſſity, and be ſtill patient for a time, ſeeing the remedy propoſed was none of the ſafeſt.</p>
            <p>Every Man having given his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, our Maſter ſhew'd us, that Fires in the Night were ſeen a great way off, and therefore judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not amiſs to make ſuch a one on the ſhoar, as may be beheld 10 or 12 Leagues diſtance. We choſe for this purpoſe a convenient place, ſurrounded with dry Trees, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we heapt others, and ſet them on fire; which according to our computation might be ſeen at the forementioned diſtance. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued 'em for about 4 days, at the end of which, our hopes in that matter failed us; or rather ſtrength, to carry on ſo laborious a work. The Maſter of our Ship, who was of a very ſtrong and ſound conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, heard our complaints, but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109000:32"/>
took no notice of them; for mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring our ſtrength by his, he made us ſtill continue to bring Wood, with extream toyl and pain. To encourage us, he alledged ſeveral examples of thoſe, whoſe endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours proved ſucceſsful in the like accidents, exhorting us to perſiſt in our undertakings; foraſmuch as there was no other remedy left us. We took courage then afreſh, continually ſupplying the Fire with Wood; but at length became tired, and ceaſed our work, ſeeing it had not the effect we expected.</p>
            <p>From that time, nothing was heard but wailings and lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt us; our faintneſs was general, ſeveral of us being not able to walk without help. My friend was of this number, being ſo weak and dejected, that he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeak nor hold up his Head. So ſtrict was our friendſhip, that I endured at the ſame time, both my own, and his afflictions, in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109000:32"/>
a true friend thus languiſhing for want of relief. In thoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of the abatement of his Fits, I ſat by him, and although could not do any thing to eaſe him, yet told him all I knew to comfort him, and he acknowledged to me afterwards, that my diſcourſes ſtrengthened him.</p>
            <p>Entertaining one another, one day for ſome hours, touching the miſerable condition we laboured under, ſince ſo long a time; he briskly roſe up, telling me, he would go upon the ſearch, whence he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped not to return empty. His hope was not in vain, for he brought along with him a Toad, of an Immenſe ſize, which we boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Pot, which the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Negroes gave us. When 'twas dreſſed, he invited me to it, I thankt him, but told him, that what we ſuffered by eating the Beans, diſcouraged me from ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing upon this; yet when I ſaw
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109000:33"/>
theſe reflexions would not prevail with him to abſtain, I determined to bear him company; ſo we eat it together with Leaves. We paſt over One hour in fear; but in fine, found no more hu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t by the Toad, than the Serpents we eat, which extreamly pleaſed us, conſidering we might find more of 'em.</p>
            <p>The next morning it came in the Carpenter's head to go in queſt of our Chaplain's Corſe; and ſought ſo narrowly, that he found in a buſh one of the defunct's ſhoes, which he ſtruck down with his Hat; and ſhewing us it, cried out, <hi>Courage my Lads,</hi> I am much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken if he be far hence, by what I have already found. At this news we all ran like ſo many Bloud hounds, prying in every corner for half a mile round; but to as little purpoſe as heretofore; after near two or three hours ſearch, we returned ſo full of melancholly, and ſorrow, that we were ready to burſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:109000:33"/>
The miſeries and vexations we ſuffered, made us ſo waſpiſh, and fretful, that we could ſcarcely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a minute from quarreling with one another; the reſt earneſtly wiſhing our jarrs might proceed to blows, and death it ſelf, that they might feed on him that was ſlain. But by good hap, it never came to that. Being one day very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, at one of theſe kind of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, the Chirurgion came and told us, he found the Leaves of Trees, of far better taſte than thoſe we had hitherto eaten. They were good raw; but being roaſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the aſhes, wrapt up in little Balls, became far better. When we taſted them, we deſired him to ſhew us the Tree whereon they grew: To which he replied God forbid, ſaying, ſhould I ſhew it you (there being no more of that kind as I know of) you would not leave one Leaf on it. We were not very importunate with him, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109000:34"/>
to watch him ſo narrowly, that we would find out his treaſure in ſpight of his Teeth. But we were deceived, for he was too cunning for us, and notwithſtanding all our diligence, kept his Tree to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>We betook our ſelves then to our common remedy, which was patience. My friend, and I, were exhorting one another to it, in walking on the ſhoar; which we held out ſo long, that we came to the place where the Buffle lay; which we found dead the firſt day after our arrival in the Iſland. The ſtink of that Carcaſs was ſo ſtrong, that we ſtept a little back to get from it, but our hunger being ſtronger, we askt one another where we ran, and whether 'twere not fooliſhly done of Men in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Let us return, ſaid I, to my friend, and make up to this Carrion, and learn to vanquiſh our ſelves in all things. I pretended
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109000:34"/>
to have no averſion for it, when in truth, 'twas quite otherwiſe. Hunger drew me toward this Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle, being willing to try whether in ſeeing it, I dared venture on it. Whereupon we returned, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Carcaſs; what think you of it, ſaid I, ſmiling? the ſcent is very ſtrong, but do you believe the taſte to be ſo bad? As for my part, continued I, I am apt to think that had it paſſed over the Fire, 'twould do us no hurt. At firſt, he thought I was not in earneſt, but diſcourſing further of it, he uſed ſo many arguments to diſſwade me from it, that I became obliged to talk no more of it. We left then this place, and in ſeeking more wholeſom Food, came up to the Iſles point. Our pains were fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, for we could find nothing to ſatisfie us; and for want of more ſollid meat, we entertained one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother with conſolatory diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:109000:35"/>
Having ſpent all our arguments, we felt our ſelves as feeble, and ill diſpoſed to ſuffer hunger, as before. So that we gave over this cold exerciſe, and betook our ſelves to the ſearch afreſh, but being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the Night, we returned faſting to our Company, who were buſied in making one of thoſe great Fires we ſpake of. It was in this project the Maſter of our Ship placed all his hopes, this being the only ſign that could give notice we were there. Therefore did he beſtow indefatigable pains in it, he alone carrying more Wood at a time than four others. He was ſo ſtrong, and kept up ſo well his fleſh, that it could ſcarcely be perceived he had faſted as well as we. When the Fire was as big as we would have it, each Man made his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per on the Leaves of Trees he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered; and having ſaid our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, endeavoured to ſleep better than we had eaten.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:109000:35"/>
The next Morning 2 of our Company brought us a ſmall <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane,</hi> which they found half dead. Without informing our ſelves whence proceeded its diſtemper, 'twas delivered to the Maſter, for they that took it, durſt do no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: Having made an order, that whatſoever was found ſhould be equally divided. Hitherto this rule had been well enough obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but in this occaſion 'twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be broken: Thoſe that took the Animal, alledging the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, ought to be conſidered, which being divided into twenty four portions, each of 'em would be no bigger than a Nut: That ſo ſmall a matter could only ſharpen the Appetite, which was already but too violent, and therefore 'twere bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to divide it into ſive or ſix parts, for ſo many particular perſons, whom they then named, to whom they were diſtributed. Amongſt theſe 6 Favourits the Chirurgion
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109000:36"/>
was one, who being afraid of the ill conſequences of this injuſtice, gave half of his portion to thoſe that moſt needed it. Who being exceſſively hungry, and vexed at the wrong done 'em, firſt calmly complained, and afterwards fell all to reproaching the Maſter; who, provided he was well dealt with himſelf, matter'd not what became of the reſt: That having been the firſt promoter of that Law; he ought to bluſh in being one of the firſt that broke it. To quiet 'em, he cauſed the skin to be thrown amongſt 'em, which they earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begged. Yet was this done contrary to their minds that had eaten the fleſh. He, who had the charge of dividing it, was going fairly about it, when thoſe that were moſt ſharp fell upon him, and took it away by force. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that no leſs needed it, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this violence fell upon theſe laſt, and being the ſtrongeſt, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:109000:36"/>
away the greateſt pieces. For the better preſerving of their boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they ruſht into the midſt of the Wood, where they eat it in quiet. Thoſe that took leaſt heed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed moſt on their own ſtrength, ſaw themſelves ſoon aſſaulted by others, who ſnatcht from them what they had. They began to grow hot, and their quarrelſom words had been attended with blows, had not thoſe that ſnatcht a ſmall piece of this skin ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured it.</p>
            <p>When we ſaw nothing could be more expected hence, every Man betook himſelf elſewhere; and one of the beſt amongſt us at the ſearch, found the remains of two Serpents, whom we eat ſoon after our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in this place. The entrails of thoſe Animals were become blew, and clammy, and ſo corrupted, that a Man could not look upon them without horrour. The leaſt of theſe circumſtances diſguſted at
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109000:37"/>
firſt the moſt hunger ſtarved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us: But this diſguſt did not hold long; for beholding one of the company eating thereof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurt, or uſing any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, than the laying them a while on the coals; we ran to ſee whether he that came from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo good a repaſt, had taken all; and found an infinite number of Maggots that covered what we ſought for. We diſperſed theſe Squadrons, and found their paſture was blew like Azure. Some ſaid this colour was a mark of deadly poyſon, and therefore would chooſe rather to dye with hunger than to eat of it. Another replied they argued like Fools, that knew not, that Poiſon has no particular co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. That that which they ſaw was an impreſſion of the Air, which wrought different effects, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Nature of thoſe ſubjects it met with. But to ſay no more, continued he, how can Poyſon
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:109000:37"/>
which is mortal in it felf, give life to ſo many Animals, who have no other nouriſhment than what you ſee. Be ruled by me, ſays he, eat of it, and I'le anſwer for what ſhall happen. Whereupon he falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe wretched relicks with ſuch eagerneſs, as made us fear he would leave none behind him. We found his reaſons ſo good, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hunger made us think 'em ſuch, that we ſhared with him this heap of Ordure, and carried it to the place where we lay. Some of thoſe that had ſeen with horrour, what the firſt had eaten; ſeeing us return laden with the ſame provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, demanded whether we left none behind us, and without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting our anſwer, ran to the place to aſcertain themſelves. In the mean time we broyled this filth, which we found excellent, and eat it with ſuch an Appetite, that thoſe who before could not behold it, but with an extream
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109000:38"/>
averſion, were exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled they had not a ſhare with us.</p>
            <p>There was one amongſt thoſe on whom our good hap made impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; who forgetting that he was broyling on the Coals, a ſmall piece of the skin of a <hi>Legane,</hi> ran to ſearch for ſome of our Ragoo. He went not far before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf, and returned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating one of the Company to take charge of it; then betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again in haſte, to ſearch whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he might not find ſtill ſome remains; but returned empty han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe thoſe that came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after us, took all with 'em. This diſappointment was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by another, that rendred him fully diſconſolate: For the Friend with whom he entruſted his morſel, gave way to the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and devoured it. He to whom it belonged, demanded it at his return; and when 'twas an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:109000:38"/>
him, the Coals had conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, he became ſo enraged, that it lackt little, but he had beat out the others Brains.</p>
            <p>This diſturbance being over, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man went his way upon the ſearch, to find ſomething to eat with his Leaves of Trees, which could hardly be digeſted of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As for my own part, when I ſaw my ſelf alone, I got down into the Marſhes, where by good hap, I found little Snails, with which I fill'd my Cap, Pockets, and Shirt-ſleeves. My Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſpying me laden with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious booty, demanded, where I got it: I ſatisfied them, and they flew to the place; whilſt my Friend, and I, roaſted under the Cindars, part of theſe little Animals, which we eat, and found extraordinary good. We ſought nothing elſe, whilſt they laſted; but we were ſo hungry, that theſe laſted us not above a day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:109000:39"/>
The next Morning my Friend, and I, went in ſearch of more, and found ſome in another place. We took only our Pockets full, becauſe not only the night approached, but we were ſo Faint, that it required a conſiderable time before we could joyn our Company: To whom we no ſooner came, but our Maſter enquired what we brought. Which ſhewing him, he demanded what we intended to do with that traſh? We were ſo ſurprized to hear him ſpeak thus, that we imagined he had loſt his Sences. But he taking no notice of our aſtoniſhment; come, come, ſaid he, my Lads, I have that which is better for you. Whereupon he ſhew'd us certain Fiſh, which he gave us, bidding us eat 'em without enquiring whence they came. That's not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, replied I, whenceſoever they come, they are welcome; and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make as good a Meal of them, as ever I made in my life.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109000:39"/>
We ran at the ſame time to the Trees, and gathered Leaves, which ſerved us for Bread; and choſe the biggeſt to wrap our Fiſh in, which we roaſted under the Cindars. 'Tis needleſs to ſay how excellent they thus were; and that without any other Sauce, than that of a good Stomach, which we never wanted, we found this Repaſt the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious in all our lives. In the mean time, my Companion, and I, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to find out, whence we came by this Fiſh; and thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Maſter to ſhew us how he caught them: Which he did not refuſe, telling us he made a hole on the Sea-ſide, which being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Water, at the return of the Tide he drew out theſe Fiſh thence. 'Tis impoſſible to expreſs the joy this news gave us; ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, becauſe this Invention once ſucceeded, the ſame means would always be attended with the ſame ſucceſs: Thus did we flatter our
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109000:40"/>
ſelves, hoping the future would make amends for what had paſt. In effect, we did all we could, but in twenty holes we made, there was not taken ſo much as one Fiſh. This misfortune reduced us again, to our firſt diſtreſs, for having pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced our deſires on a more ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Meat than Leaves, we could not return unto 'em, but with a moſt extream regret.</p>
            <p>The ſmall ſuſtenance theſe yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, made us ſeek ſomething elſe, and that with ſuch care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that we found (my Friend, and I) a great Toad, the ſight of which rejoyced us. Hunger is a ſtrange thing; it makes pleaſant, and agreeable, the moſt horrid Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: As ſoon as we ſaw it, we ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on't, without the leaſt ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and better Husbands now than heretofore, laid it on the Coals whole, and immediately after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured it.</p>
            <p>This was excellent Meat with
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:109000:40"/>
us, nor was the eating it attended by any ill accident, but 'twas ſo little in quantity, that it tarried but a ſmall time in our Stomachs. Within a quarter of an hour after, hunger again overtook us; and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no other remedy, but that of getting out of this doleful place, we reſolved to gather as many dry Trees as we could, and with them make a Boat, that might carry us to firm Land. The Maſter hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our deſign, was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty brought to conſent to it. He ſet before us the danger we expoſed our ſelves to; ſeeing our Comrades, who tryed the ſame fortune, miſcarried: That we could not expect any better ſucceſs, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſet out with the ſame, or greater advantages; whereas, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in a ſhort time, we might ſee ſome Fiſher-boats paſs by, that would take us in. Theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made us pauſe a while, yet at length reſolved to quit this wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:109000:41"/>
place; and the Maſter left us at our liberty.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as we had his conſent, we cut down ſeveral Trees, and made of their Rind ſmall Ropes, which ſerved to tye them together. We had not wrought above three or four hours on this deſign, when we began to find the Work to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the ſtrength of four or five Sceletons, (ſuch as we were) who were ready to ſink under the weight of it every Moment; and the reſt would not help us, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their weakneſs to be no leſs than ours; and that they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their ſervice already in vain to others, and being void of all hope, they would trouble themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nothing.</p>
            <p>Their refuſal did not ſo greatly diſcourage us, as to hinder us from continuing our deſign, and the more our ſtrength diminiſhed, the more we haſtned in our Work. Yet do I verily believe, we ſhould
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:109000:41"/>
never been able to finiſh it, had not the two youngeſt, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Company joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to us. Their aſſiſtance ſo greatly forwarded us, that we had almoſt ended it, when the Tide came, and made us deſiſt.</p>
            <p>In expecting the ebbing of the Sea, we ſat all of us ſmoaking Leaves of Trees about a ſmall fire; and in the interim I called to mind, that our Men often ſaw <hi>Leganes,</hi> hankering after the Buffle, and that if there were any there ſtill, I might poſſibly take one of 'em. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I immediately went and hid my ſelf behind a Tree, where I long waited in vain; and in the mean time, conſidered, that if the Buffle were ſuch a dainty to thoſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, its fleſh muſt not certainly be ſo bad for us as we imagined. From theſe reflexions I came to their effects, and cut out a great piece, in a place which I judged the leaſt corrupted, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:109000:42"/>
to my Companions.</p>
            <p>They wondred to ſee my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and haſtily demanded what fleſh it was; whence I had it; and whether there was no more left? And ſeemed a little ſurprized, when I told 'em 'twas the fleſh of the Buffle; for notwithſtanding our extremity, no Body had as yet ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured upon it, but when they ſaw this fleſh, which ſcented ſo ill, did not much offend the ſight; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ran (after my example) and took as much as they could. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they returned, I laid my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Coals, whence intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take it up with a ſtick, I made for that purpoſe; I found it all waſted, except a little Glewy matter of no ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>This experience made me leave all, to run to our People, whom I adviſed to leave the Fat, and cut only the Lean. And at the ſame time fell all to work, and cut at leaſt fourty pound of it, which was
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109000:42"/>
put under dry Trees, being proper (as we imagined) to make it loſe part of its ill ſcent. We roaſted a piece, and equally diſtributed it: Which ſmelt ſo ſtrong, that ſome were ſick with the ſcent of it, yet eat it, and found 'twas not ſo bad as it ſmelt.</p>
            <p>Our whole Company being not at the Feaſt, we carried a good part to the place of Rendevouz, (and kept the reſt concealed;) which we preſented to the Maſter, being about to tell him what it was: You may ſpare your pains, ſays he, the ſcent ſhews what 'tis; pray carry your preſent elſewhere. As ſoon as he had ended theſe words, I would came near, to tell him, 'twas not ſo bad as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined; but he told me my Breath ſtunk ſo, that he could not ſuffer me to approach him, infecting the very Air he breathed, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſick with it. In ſaying this, he left me, and ſought another place for his abode.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:109000:43"/>
Others that were leſs nice, came and prayed us to give them part. Which we did, and they eat it; theſe firſt Morſels ſo ſharpening their Appetites, that they were ſtill craving for more. When thoſe that were moſt eager after it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured their portion, they would have th'others: Which they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, this denyal raiſed ſuch a quarrel, as ſet us all in an uproar. To appeaſe 'em, we gave them part of that we kept for our ſelves, but this ſerved only to inflame their deſires; ſo that although 'twas Night, they would needs go to the place where the Carcaſs lay, to eat their Bellies full. We deſired 'em to conſider the Night was dark, and, moreover, 'twas about this time, the Crocodils, and Kaimans, lay ſculking on the ſhoar. They yielded to this reaſon, but could not ſleep, and we felt the effects of their greedy deſires, being forced to purchaſe our quiet at the coſt of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109000:43"/>
what remained. Having eaten all that was left, ſome of 'em betook themſelves to reſt; whilſt others affirm'd, hunger tormented 'em more now than before; there was one eſpecially, cryed out, the Night ſeemed to him a year; that 'twas impoſſible for him to reſt, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as he ſaid) there was no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comparable to that of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: Yet had he eaten above three pound of this Carrion; and ſome hours before Night, half of a great Fiſh, which he found lying (knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) on the ſhoar. The Fiſh was ſo big, that he firſt intended to make it ſerve him two Days, but when once begun upon it, he could not leave, till he made an end of it, and aſſured us he could eaten four times as much. With this diſcourſe did this fellow diſturb the reſt of the whole company; ſo that at break of Day we all roſe; thoſe that were moſt hungry, ran again to the Buffle, and we betook
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109000:44"/>
our ſelves to work on our Boat.</p>
            <p>How bad and corrupt ſoever the Food was, we eat the day before, yet did it yield us that ſtrength, we never received from the Leaves. And therefore an hour after we had been at our work, we left it to broyl ſome more, which much added to our ſtrength. We fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed our Boat ſome hours before Night, and having fetcht a walk or two, return'd to our Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whom we found buſied, ſome in laying their pieces of Meat in the Air, others in turning it, and ſome again in roaſting, and eating it with ſuch an Appetite, as would made a Man that knew no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, believe 'twas ſome rare dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>When the Maſter underſtood our Veſſel was ready, he ſhew'd us (as before) the greatneſs of the danger, to which we were expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſelves, ſeeing we could not get to Land without Sails, nor
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109000:44"/>
reſiſt the Tides without an Anchor. We anſwered, there could not be any thing more dangerous to us, than this Iſland, wherein 'twas too probable we muſt dye with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when our buffle was ſpent; that although we had neither An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, nor Sail, yet did we find our ſelves ſtrong enough to bear up againſt the Tides, and hoped to meet with ſome <hi>Bengaloiſes,</hi> that would receive us on Board them.</p>
            <p>After ſome further diſcourſe, he wiſhed us a good Voyage, and gave leave to take with us a young Man of the Company, that ſpoke <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugaiſe.</hi> This Language being much uſed in the Kingdoms of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala</hi> and <hi>Aracan;</hi> we promiſed our ſelves hence a great advantage, and thought only of parting. In the mean time, one of our Men offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make a Wooden Anchor, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging he wanted only for this deſign, four crooked pieces of Wood, which he would ſo faſten together
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109000:45"/>
with the Rinds of young Trees, as ſhould anſwer our occaſions. This, replyed I, may be done, provided we had wherewithal to make it ſink to the bottom, but you know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, there's not one ſtone in this Iſland. 'Tis no matter, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, for we will fill two or three of our Shirt-ſleeves with Sand, and faſten them to the Anchor; and you'l ſee 'twill do us the ſame ſervice as one of Iron. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo probable, that we went immediately, ſome to peel Trees, and the reſt to ſeek crooked boughs, by which means, in leſs than two hours our Anchor was finiſhed to our content.</p>
            <p>Having proceeded thus far, we wanted twenty fathom of ground tackle, and knew not where to get ten. Whilſt we were ſtudying what to do in this matter, we ſaw two of our Crue coming towards us, laden with Ivy, and the Rind of young Trees. They twiſted one
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:109000:45"/>
with the other, and made thereof ſuch a Rope as we wanted.</p>
            <p>The next Morning we took our leave of thoſe that were deſigned to ſtay behind, with an intent to return ſpeedily to 'em, if we met with ſucceſs. They wiſht us good luck, and attended us to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; where, after mutual embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we Embarkt eight of us, and gained the Iſles point, which lies directly over againſt the Main Land.</p>
            <p>There we ſtood ſtill, and pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a while, having kindled a Fire, and taken our Repaſt. We then weighed Anchor, and with much rowing, found our ſelves far enough from the Iſland. The Weather hapned to be calm, which gave us opportunity to make uſe of a Bagg of Sand, inſtead of a Plummet. By which means, having found the Tide againſt us, we caſt Anchor on a Bank, where our Boat could take no harm. In the mean time, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:109000:46"/>
pinching us, we agreed to eat; but 'twas Decreed before hand, the proviſions ſhould be equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to the end every Man might Husband his ſhare, leſt the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſhould prove longer than we expected. We began then our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, with intentions of being mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; but being once entred, 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to diſſwade moſt of us from making an end of all: Wherefore being reduced to feed upon Leaves alone, they heartily beſought God the Rope might break, and by this means return to the Iſland, from whence we were not as yet above a Leagues diſtance.</p>
            <p>Their prayers were heard, for there aroſe a Storm which broke our poor Cable, and the Waves wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed away our proviſion, which conſiſted in ſome few Leaves, and forced us back to the ſame place, whence we parted in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>We committed our Boat to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109000:46"/>
care of the two youngeſt in our Company, whilſt the reſt went on Shoar. We immediately ran to the Fire we left at parting, and found one of the Negroes Wives (we ſpake of) by it. As ſoon as this Woman ſaw us, ſhe threw her ſelf at our Feet; her Body was grievouſly bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, and wounded, and we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by her Signs, that 'twas her own people that had thus uſed her. This wretched Creature was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Skin and Bone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we judged her condition to be the ſame as ours. We made ſigns to her to ſit down, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving warmed our ſelves, with an intention to repoſe; within an hour, hunger tormented us in ſuch a manner, that 'twas impoſſible to reſt. To compleat our miſery, one of our Company (maugre the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt) had ſaved part of his meat, which he eat in our ſight, without imparting the leaſt morſel of it, though never ſo much intreated.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109000:47"/>
We went then in queſt of Leaves, but none of us could ſwallow 'em, whatſoever Sauce we put them in. The Buffles fleſh made us too dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſince we eat of it, the Leaves of Trees became inſipid meat.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, hunger ſo extreamly prevailed on us, that we became all of us like Men deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſtaring one upon another, like perſons that intended to devour each other. Others ran to and fro like Mad-men, crying out, ever and anon, they felt the pains of the Damned. Whilſt they thus ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, one of the moſt diſtempered amongſt us told the reſt, he had an inſpiration. But before, ſays he, I tell you the contents thereof, you muſt acknowledge it to be one: And without waiting our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; admire, continued he, the ſtrange effects of Providence; God, ſays he, who pitties our miſeries, does ſo apparently provide a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:109000:47"/>
againſt 'em, that we can no longer doubt of it; our Sins have all this while blinded our eyes, and hindred us from finding the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy he has ſent us. This Mans diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, whom we reſpected as Senceleſs, did ſo weary us, that we could not forbear interrupting, and telling him, that he was a Fool, to take his Whimſeys for Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations. Suppoſing, replyed he, I were ſo, what reaſon have you to believe your ſelves in a better condition? My Diſtemper would be the effect of overmuch faſting, which you have ſuffered as well as I, how comes you Brains, then, to be better ſettled than mine? But to uſe no more words, do you ſee yonder poor Woman? Think you chance has brought her hither? <hi>Jonas</hi> his Whale, young <hi>Toby</hi>'s Fiſh.—Pray, cryed out one, more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient than the reſt, what have we to do with <hi>Jonas</hi> and <hi>Toby?</hi> theſe are digreſſions that are not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:109000:48"/>
to our purpoſe; we are an hungry, can you tell us, how we ſhall be ſatisfied? Have I not told you, replyed the other: Do you believe this Woman to be here only to warm her ſelf? This indeed is her intention, but God has uſed this as a means to deliver her into our hands. In good truth, replyed one (called <hi>Charles Dobbel;)</hi> the more I examine the circumſtances of this Rencounter, the leſs I doubt this to be an effect of the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, for I believe this Woman came not here of her ſelf; come on, continued he, (in riſing up,) I will be the Fates Executioner; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eaten all manner of filthineſs, let's try whether Human Fleſh be not good, and make no ſcruple, ſeeing 'tis the intention of Heaven, whoſe Decrees muſt be obeyed. When I perceived he was in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, I deſired him to ſit down a while, intreating him to think a little on the conſequences of his
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109000:48"/>
enterprize; that theſe kind of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, were rather the ſuggeſtion of the Devil, than Divine Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that this Woman was of the ſame make as we, and if 'twas from a Revelation, they undertook to eat her, 'twas one of the moſt wretched, and leaneſt Revelations I ever heard of. Pray obſerve, ſaid I, this Woman is a meer Sceleton, covered only with skin, which, as you may perceive, has not the <hi>Mine</hi> of any delicacy; but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing 'twere otherwiſe, think you to ſtop here? No, without doubt you'l deſire ſtill the ſame meat; and God knows what little ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty every Man may promiſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after this rate. Whereunto I added, that in two hours time we may come to the Buffle, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps find enough left, to ſatisfie us, if not, bad 'em uſe their pleaſure, either in ſparing, or maſſacring this wretched Woman.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, partly for ſhame,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:109000:49"/>
and ſome remains of deteſtation for this action, they told me, they would think no more of it, and endeavour to ſleep. At break of Day they roſe, and charged me with my promiſe. I was ſo weak, that I could ſcarcely ſtir, it being above three Miles to the place where the Buffle lay. I prayed 'em then to excuſe me, for this once, and go without me, but they would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no denyal, wherefore I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to go along with 'em. The four weakeſt lay behind, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed us, in the mean time, to work a new Cord, for the Anchor we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make in the Room of that we loſt.</p>
            <p>We had not went a quarter of a Mile, before <hi>Charles Dobbel</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and charged the four that ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed behind to take care of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, being reſolved at his return to kill her, in caſe the Buffle were all eaten.</p>
            <p>We then haſtned to the place
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109000:49"/>
where the Buffle lay, and found a great deal of Fleſh ſtill remaining, but ſo greatly corrupted, that we were ſcarce able to come near it. Having ſought out the beſt place, and ſeen 'twas all alike, we cut two or three pieces of it, which we laid on the Coals, and devoured half dreſt.</p>
            <p>During our repaſt, came two of our Maſters Company; who ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed immediately by their counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, what was their Errand. This exceedingly troubled us, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid they would take away all with them. Having obſerved 'em about an hour, we drew near, and ſaw nothing remaining but bones; whereupon our eyes ran down with Tears, ſaying to one another, we deſerved to dye with hunger, for having ſtaid ſo long time without hindring them. 'Tis too late, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Charles Dobbel,</hi> to expect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fleſh, ſeeing they have left none, yet ſtill there remains part
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:109000:50"/>
of the hide, let's try to get that, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſair means or foul. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he made up to 'em and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired 'em to be contented with what they had, and leave us the reſt. Hah! cryed one amongſt them (in a deriding tone) theſe Gentlemen are very civil in their demands; we have taken the rotten fleſh, and they would have the skin, that is ſound, and conſequently the beſt part. Do you imagine, ſaid he to us, we have taken all this pains for you? 'Tis true, I do not deſire you ſhould want, but we will ſerve our ſelves firſt, and if we muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh here in this doleſom confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I freely declare, I'le uſe my utmoſt endeavours to dye the laſt.</p>
            <p>This prating fellow's diſcourſe enraged us, eſpecially <hi>Charles Dob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> who would needs come to blows, but I ſhew'd him, paſſion ought ever to be eſtemed a bad Counſellor, and that 'twere better
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109000:50"/>
to be angry as late as we could. I told them, then, that our requeſt was neither unjuſt, nor ridiculous; that we were all Companions in the ſame fortune; and that they ought to conſider, we were going to hazard our lives, as well upon their account, as our own. Theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments were ſlighted, and <hi>Charles Dobbel,</hi> vexed at this proceeding, cryed out to us, come on Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, let us fall to work, as well as they, we need not their leave: Whereupon each of us drew out his Knife, and took away their prey.</p>
            <p>They being inferiour to us in number, lookt upon one another the while, to encourage (as it were) one another. Demanding of us, whether 'twere juſt they ſhould labour all this while for us, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, one of 'em lifted up an Hatchet, and another a Knife, to ſtrike at us. We, on our parts, put our ſelves in a poſture of defence;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:109000:51"/>
and he that had the Hatchet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vowed he'd cleave the Scul of them that dared come near him; I told him, if he were wiſe, he'd hearken to reaſon, and not be thus tranſported with paſſion. What reaſon, reply'd he, can a Man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from perſons that have none? you would have us give away our right, can we do leſs than defend our own? But in fine, we came to an agreement, which was, they ſhould carry away what they had already, and leave us the reſt.</p>
            <p>When we had taken out almoſt all of it without a Knife, (ſo great was its corruption) we waſhed it in ſeveral waters, and dreſt a great part of it, keeping the reſt for our Companions. Then we began to think of making another Anchor, to ſerve inſtead of that we loſt, and for this purpoſe diſpatched two of our Men, to borrow of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter his Hatchet. Which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent us. And having by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109000:51"/>
the help of it finiſhed our Anchor, we reſolved to go all four to thank him. About half way, one of thoſe that borrowed the Hatchet, told us, he had ſeen in going, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Linnen, lying a drying under the Trees, and that both himſelf, and his Companion (who were half naked) were tempted to take each of 'em a Shirt, and Waſt-coat, but dared not do it without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting us. We ſcrupled at firſt the ſuffering it, but the great need they had, made us ſhut our Eyes againſt all conſideration. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this thieviſh exploit could not be carried on in the Day, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tarried till Night, and found them, by good hap, aſleep, when we came at their quarters. Thoſe that needed Linnen, having taken what they wanted, came and told us, there lay near the ſame place, a conſiderable quantity of the fleſh, and skin of the Buffle, which we ſhould do alſo well to ſeize on.

We were a great while determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the point, becauſe, that had they taken us in the Fact, we knew not how to excuſe our ſelves, and they were better Armed, and more in number than we. But hunger maſtering theſe conſiderations, we took away part of their proviſion, and ſpeedily withdrew. I went not far, before it repented me of this Theft, and was ready to carry back again that which I had taken, when <hi>Charles Dobbel</hi> repreſented to me, that ſhould they awake, notwithſtanding whatſoever we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to juſtifie our ſelves, they will never believe (ſeeing us out at ſo late an hour,) but that we came with ſome ill deſign. I took, then, his advice, and ſo much the rather, being inclined thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by hunger. Having reſted our ſelves ſome time, we continued on our march to our Companions, whom we found on the other ſide of the River, where we left them.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109000:53"/>
The Water was, then, ſo high, that we were forced to paſs over it in ſwimming with our booty at our backs.</p>
            <p>Three of thoſe that expected our coming, had eaten nothing ſince we left them, and were ſo faint, that they were not able to ſtand. The fourth, who made a reſerve, feaſted in their preſence, and was ſo hard hearted to refuſe them any part with him. We could not without a juſt reſentment, hear the complaint of theſe hunger-ſtarved wretches; and ſharply rebuked him they complained againſt, telling him he deſerved the ſame meaſure, but we were more tender-hearted.</p>
            <p>Having equally divided to each one his portion, we judged it meet, to watch by turns againſt the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes of our Enemies, reckoning them to be of that number, whom we robbed; and for a ſtronger tye, made a ſolemn Oath, to aſſiſt one another, in caſe of Invaſion, to the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:109000:54"/>
laſt breath. We demanded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, what became of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man we left in their keeping, and were inform'd, that ſoon after our departure, ſhe ſlipt away ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, that we could never after ſet ſight on her. We would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have found her, fully inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then to eat her, altho ſo little toothſom.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as 'twas night, we ſet one upon the watch, whilſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeven ſlept. Scarce had we reſted two hours, but our Sentinel ſpyed a <hi>Negro</hi> ſtealing ſoftly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, with a thick Cudgel. As ſoon as he came within the reach of his Oar, he broke it on his Head, and the wretch fell down as dead. The diſturbance awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us; and inform'd of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we purſued the other <hi>Negroes,</hi> who ſeeing their Companion fall, fled into the thickeſt of the Wood. As ſoon as they perceived we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd 'em, they ſet out ſuch a cry
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109000:54"/>
in flying, as would have made a Man judge it to be of twenty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, although they were but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight. After a fruitleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of them, we return'd to the place where their Companion fell, whom we ſuppoſed to lye dead on the place; but our conjectures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us, for this wretch made ſhift to eſcape, and that with ſuch haſte, that he left his ſtick behind him.</p>
            <p>We conferred together touching this adventure, and doubted not but the Woman that warmed her ſelf at our fire, had given them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what paſſed among us. She had obſerved that at our parting, we left only four behind, who might be eaſily worſted, if ſet upon in the Night. And without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'twas upon this intent they came, but by good hap, inſtead of four Men, they found eight, one of which watched for the ſecurity of the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:109000:55"/>
As ſoon as 'twas Day, we made a Rope for our Anchor, like unto the firſt, and when ready to depart, we found our Boat was not in caſe to carry above ſix Men. We were forced then to ſend away two, and the Lot fell upon the youngeſt, to whom we promiſed, for their comfort, to return, as ſoon as we came to main Land.</p>
            <p>In expectation of the Tides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, we placed our ſelves round a little fire; where, an hour after, we heard ſuch reiterated Screeks, and Cries, as made our hearts tremble.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding our fear, yet would we anſwer, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpied the two young Men retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, we lately diſmiſt. They were ſo diſmayed, that they quaked ſtill, in telling us they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> found neither the Maſter, nor any of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: That they not only ſought 'em, where they were wont to paſs over the Night; but, moreover, in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:109000:55"/>
ſeveral other places, and that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs, ſome Veſſel, in paſſing by, had received them on Board. Their unwillingneſs to tarry in the Iſland, made us ſuſpect this to be a device; we queſtion'd 'em, therefore, apart, and found their anſwer to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame. Which made us reſolve to tarry till next Morning, and go our ſelves to the place, and not leave the Iſland, till we were further ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>About midnight the floud fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring our deſign, we weighed Anchor, to go to the dry Trees, ſome of which we wanted, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair our Boat. And within half an hour perceived the Tide fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried us towards a great Tree, with extent Branches; which, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all our endeavours, 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to avoid; ſo that the Boat ran againſt it with ſuch violence, that ſome of us fell into the Water, others were left hanging on the Branches, and I the only perſon,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:109000:56"/>
that remain'd untoucht. This ſhock was ſo fierce, that each of us belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the reſt were drowned, and I for my part, did not doubt of it; when <hi>Charles Dobbel</hi> appeared, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the reſt, and was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with joy, to ſee me again upon the Boat: At laſt we all found out one another. 'Twas extream cold, and they were very wet; and therefore endeavoured to make a fire to dry themſelves.</p>
            <p>In this ill accident, we loſt our Anchor, and half of the Rope, and wanted wherewithal to repair this double loſs. Neither did we know whether we could make to the ſhoar, the force of the Streams car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying uf off with ſuch violence. After tryal, we found our conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures true. Whereupon two of our Men, took the reſt of the Rope, and ſwam to ſhoar, where they drew the Boat after 'em, without any trouble.</p>
            <p>'Twas Night, and we were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:109000:56"/>
to ſtarve, both with hunger and cold, and had neither Food nor Fire. And beſides, 'twas near half a League off the place where we warmed our ſelves the day before. Yet ſo far muſt we go, if we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have Fire, and none of us were willing to go ſo far. Whilſt we were grieving under this vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Charles Dobbel,</hi> (who was one of the moſt lively and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of us all) took with him the two youngeſt of our Company, and went in ſearch of what we wanted. In tarrying for them, we entertained one another with the misfortunes that oppreſſed us, and the little likelihood of a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from them, all things conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually croſſing, and forcing us to tarry in a Deſolate and Barbarous Iſland, where it ſeem'd Heaven had caſt us, to make us underto the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments due for our offences.</p>
            <p>From theſe diſcourſes we fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a melancholly Fit of ſilence, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109000:57"/>
verily believe we had pined away, had not our Companions returned ſoon after. The fire they brought did us as much good, in diſperſing the darkneſs, whoſe horrour alſo contributed to afflict us, as in dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving away the cold, that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſharp upon us. Theſe poor people told us at their return, that they trod all along upon Bryars, and Thorns; that they loſt their way, and having at length found the Fire we left, they fell with it into Boggs, and Ditches, full of Water, which put it out, and forced 'em to fetch more; how that in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a better way back, they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a worſe, whence they were a long time getting out. Their Feet ran down with blood, and their Bodies were bruiſed and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd; which, together with their other ſad circumſtances, rendered them ſo diſconſolate, as 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to expreſs. We comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 'em the beſt we could, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109000:57"/>
then endeavoured to reſt.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, we ſent two of our Company, to the Maſter's Quarters, and places thereabouts, to know whether they were certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gone; and in the mean time ſought wherewithal to make us another Anchor and Cord. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Evening, our people brought us word, they were not to be found in the Iſland, and that they could meet only with a piece of ſtinking Fiſh; a ſmall piece of the Buffles skin, and four heads of Garlick in a Pot.</p>
            <p>By theſe Tokens we knew they were gone, and began to hope they would remember us. In the mean time, our two Deputies told us, they found in their way a Grave, which one of 'em, moved only by curioſity (as he ſaid) had uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the ſequel ſhew'd he had another deſign, for as ſoon as he ſaw a Corps which the Worms were gnawing, he cried out, the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109000:58"/>
condition of theſe Inſects was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his; he being ready to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with hunger, whilſt they were Feaſting. Having ſtood a while conſidering this object, at laſt, he ſays, he had a great mind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive theſe Animals of their prey, and wanting other means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to avoid Death, he thought no Man could juſtly blame him for uſing this. Which ſaid, he gave way to the temptation, laying hold on the Carcaſs, and had cut, and eaten of it, had not his Companion ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the enormity of this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He had much difficulty to diſſwade him from it, but at length prevailed, and both of 'em let down together the Corps into the Grave, and haſtned from the place, leſt hunger ſhould get the better of 'em, and make 'em cloſe with the temptation.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as we had the Pot, we boyled that which was left of the Fiſh we mentioned, together with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109000:58"/>
ſtore of minced Leaves. After the repaſt, we fell to conſidering, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'twere beſt tarry in the Iſland, or venture out again. The firſt opinion was grounded on the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty we found in reſiſting the Tide, which was very high; on the loſs of our two Anchors, and the impoſſibility of making a fourth, in caſe we ſhould loſe this. 'Twas added, That our Companions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſafely arrived, would take care of us; and queſtionleſs, omit no opportunity, to deliver us out of this place. Thoſe that were for parting, alledged, that the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which the others ſpake of, was uncertain; that on this groundleſs hope, we ſhould eat that little which remained; and that having ſtaid in vain, we ſhould be at length, forced to expoſe our ſelves to the danger, which we thought to ſhun. After a diſpute, which laſted near an hour, 'twas agreed to refer our ſelves to the eldeſt of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109000:59"/>
the Company; who declared, that a longer ſtay in this fatal place, would certainly deſtroy us, there needing only three or four Days to make us incapable of mannaging our Boat; whereupon, he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we muſt uſe no longer delays. His opinion was followed, and the reſt of the Day ſpent in fitting out our Boat; and the next Morning, (having broken our Faſt, on the remains of the skin of the Buffle, and provided good ſtore of Leaves) we embarkt our ſelves.</p>
            <p>We had made a little Sail of a Shirt, with the help of which, and a gentle Wind, we got paſt the falſe Tides, in leſs than half an hour. A while after the Wind ceaſed, and our Sail becoming uſeleſs, we ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Oars. We had not went far, before we needed meat; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we caſt our Anchor, which ſtood us in as much ſtead as one of Iron. When we judged the Tide could not incommodate us, we
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:109000:59"/>
weighed it, and ſet Sail, and thus were carried from the Iſland, till we loſt ſight of it.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, we diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the two Iſlands, of which the Maſter ſpake to us; and profiting by the inſtructions he gave us, got ſo far, that we paſſed by 'em. Six or ſeven hours after, we believed we ſaw main Land, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, not miſtaken, but were at a great diſtance from it; and as ſoon as we diſcovered it, the Tide tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt us. We caſt Anchor, then, with exceeding great fear, leſt its Rope ſhould break, for 'twas on it lay all our hopes; and during this time, one of the moſt hungry amongſt us, propoſed the augmenting our allowance, ſeeing we were ſo near Land. Although the others were as weak as he, yet were they not of his mind, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there needed only one blaſt of Wind, to ſnap the Rope, that held the Anchor, and we were gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109000:60"/>
it being better to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a ſmall allowance, and patiently expect the ſucceſs of our enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>Having no compaſs; The Sun, and Stars, ſerved us for guide, and by their means, diſtinguiſhed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts we lay. The next Morning, the Wind and Tide being for us, from Morning to Night, we drew very near the ſhoar, but could not Land. We were forced, then, to caſt Anchor, and paſs over another Night, in great diſtreſs, and fear; the currents running very ſwift.</p>
            <p>The next Day we gained early the ſhoar. We left the Boat at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, with intent to return to it, in caſe the Country we were in, were not that we lookt ſor. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving marcht a while, we found two ways, one along the ſhoar, and the other along the River of <hi>Sondiep;</hi> which two were oppoſite. We were ſo little acquainted with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, that we knew not
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:109000:60"/>
which to take; and after much ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing to little purpoſe, we ſtruck out at all adventure towards the River, and found our ſelves in a good way. Hunger, cold, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſſures, ſo greatly weakned us, that we could ſcarcely go ſix ſteps, without reſting, ſo that we advanced but ſlowly, and in three hours time, met no living Soul. A while after we ſaw Trees, whoſe Branches ſeem'd to have been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lopt. About twenty paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from thence, we beheld a Bark, towards which we drew near; and as ſoon as thoſe that were in it perceived us, they came towards us. This facility troubled us, for we could not imagine, beholding 'em coming without being called, but that they meant us harm.</p>
            <p>Our fear encreaſed, when we perceived 'em to be ſix in number, armed each of 'em with a long knife in his hand. When they were near enough to behold we were not in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:109000:61"/>
a condition or humour to hurt them, we ſhewed 'em our fleſhleſs and waſted Arms, and ſome ſmall remains of the skin of the Buffle: Which, though ſmall in quantity, yet were enough to poiſon the leaſt delicate amongſt them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe people (howſoever groſs and bruitiſh) drew back ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven paces, ſtopping their Noſes, and threatning us with their knives. Whereupon we comprehended, they ſuſpected us to be treacherous and faithleſs perſons. And therefore haſtned to ſhew them our Leaves of Trees, endeavouring, to make 'em comprehend by ſigns, that theſe had been our Food. They at length underſtood us; and mov'd with compaſſion, ſmote their Breaſts, with Eyes lift up to Heaven. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied of our ſincerity, we ſignified to 'em (as well as we could) the need we had of them, to bring us to the next Village. They readily offer'd us their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109000:61"/>
provided we payed them. I could not but ruminate in my mind, upon this occaſion; how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and ſelfiſh, moſt Men are; and how little like their Creatour, the Giver of all things. Theſe Barbarians ſaw, that we were in a manner naked, being only tyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with ſome tatter'd Raggs; mere Anatomys, and Shadows. And, moreover, pittied by 'em, as being ſtrangers, in a Forlorn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and deſtitute of all ſuccour. Yet without Money, we plainly perceived, this main Land would be no better to us than the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iſland, wherein we ſo long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd. We agreed, then, to give them ſomething, and Deputed the Eldeſt amongſt us to make the bargain. He offer'd them a piece, to the value of a Crown, in our Money. The <hi>Bengaloiſes</hi> gave us to underſtand, they muſt have ten of 'em; for leſs than which, they would not leave their work. We
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:109000:62"/>
thereupon gave them another, and afterwards a third piece; all which not prevailing with them, our old Man, ſhew'd them his empty poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, thereby inſinuating, they had all. This pretence effected our buſineſs, but in a miſerable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>When we were on board their Bark, we made ſigns to 'em to give us ſomething to eat; they anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they could not, without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; we gave them another Crown; and for this, they gave us, in a cloth, about an handful of Rice, and a <hi>Piſang,</hi> as big as a Man's fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Every one of us ſtretcht forth his hand with ſuch earneſtneſs, as made our diſtributer fear his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Rice, would occaſion ſome diſorder. He withdrew himſelf, then, and made eight equal porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He did the ſame with the <hi>Piſang,</hi> (which is an indifferent good fruit;) and although this was but a ſmall repaſt, yet ineſtimably to be
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:109000:62"/>
preferred before that filth we had eaten for a Month together; ſo that we wiſhed the Bark were full of this proviſion; although we could hardly imagine ſuch a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity would ſatisfie us. The <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,</hi> perceiving we had ſtill Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, took advantage thereby; and ceaſing to row, made ſigns we had not yet given them enough; and that if we expected to go forward, they muſt have more pieces. We gave them, then, another; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they rowed about ſome twelve ſtroaks, and then gave over. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we gave them a third piece, and they did as before, ſo that this was ſtill to begin again; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſtill to demand, and we to give, ſo great a deſire had we to come to Land.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we ſaw two other Barks, which came and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themſelves with us. Their geſtures plainly ſhewed, their whole diſcourſe was of us, which laſted a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:109000:63"/>
great ſpace. Within a while they Landed, to conſult (as it were, more conveniently) what to do with us. They counted the Money they received, looking upon us in ſuch a manner, as made us fear the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of their conference.</p>
            <p>Having tarried about an hour in the Bark, two of our Company went out to pray 'em to ſhew them ſome freſh Water. As ſoon as the <hi>Negroes</hi> perceived 'em, one of them took 'em by the Arms, and made them enter the Bark again. This hard uſage fully perſwaded us, they were there only to determine the means, to cut our Throats, and get our Money; and in this imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, began to prepare our ſelves for Death. Yet not without repinings againſt Providence, which ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately perſecuted us. From the time we believed they formed the deſign of Murthering us, we were impatient till they Executed it; for hunger had rendred the pains
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109000:63"/>
of death leſs affrightful. In fine, having ſuffered during the ſpace of two or three hours, what they ſuffer that expect Men to come and cut their Throats; the three Barks parted, and our Maſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, purſued their courſe, and for a Crown more gave us a Pot full of freſh Water. Which we drank with the greater delight, it being a Month ſince we had taſted any other than Salt Water. As ſoon as we had filled our Bellies with Water, our hunger in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure abated, and our Stomachs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to let us reſt.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Negroes</hi> inform'd us, that twenty of our Companions were in the next Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; and for this good news, we gave 'em another Crown. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they haſtened to bring us where they were, and in entering the Village, two of them came with us to the Goverour, at whoſe Feet they laid down the three Crowns
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109000:64"/>
we agreed to give 'em for our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, having thrice touched the Earth with their Heads, and Hands, in ſaying, <hi>Salamabéta,</hi> (that is to ſay) <hi>Peace be with you.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour gave us a kind reception, making Signs to take the Money again, that lay at his Feet. But we gave him to underſtand (as well as we could) his Men had well earned it, and that we would not deprive them of their Sallery. In fine, he ordered two or three of his Servants to conduct us to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; who perceiving us at a diſtance, came and met us, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their joy to ſee us. Thoſe we left in the Iſland, arrived five days before us, in this Village; and the five that went off firſt, in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, came ſome days before them; under the guidance of certain Fiſher-men.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they ſaw us, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to out-vy one another in welcoming us; and perhaps
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:109000:64"/>
would have done better in not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perſons that faſted ſo long, ſo many ſorts, and ſuch great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Meat; for without the Piſang and Honey, which ſerved us for a Medicine, and Digeſture, I believe we ſhould have burſted. Their operation was ſo happy, that all theſe meats did us no hurt, and that which was moſt ſtrange, was, that although we eat much, and often, yet were ſtill as hungry as before.</p>
            <p>Two Days after we were here, the Governour thought fitting, to ſend thoſe that came firſt, to the Factory; that ſo the Company might be informed of the loſs of their Veſſel. Adviſing them, by his Interpreter, to ſtock themſelves well with proviſions; being to Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age above two hundred Leagues; and, moreover, travel five Days in a barren Countrey; and that which they were to come into af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, being not much more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:109000:65"/>
and inhabited. This bad news allarm'd our poor people, who had not, as yet, well refreſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor ſatisfied their deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meat; for the more they eat, the more they coveted. Yet part they muſt, for the reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. As to our ſelves, who were thoſe that came laſt, having reſted four or five Days; I inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf, by what adventure our Companions left the unfortunate Iſland, and was told as follows. After they had taken their leaves of us, they wilthdrew to their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary place of abode; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing late, endeavoured to reſt. The next Morning, perceiving their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was ſtol'n, they became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly troubled. In the midſt of their Affliction, they inſtantly beſought God to deliver them from their miſery. Each one, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, betaking himſelf to Leaves, but with-extream ſorrow, to find themſelves reduced to ſuch inſipid Food.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:109000:65"/>
Towards the Evening, there were two, who diſcourſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, touching their ſad condition, found themſelves, inſenſibly, at the point of the Iſle, whence they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Fiſher-men. As ſoon as they imagined they were ſeen, one of 'em broke off a bough from a Tree, faſtening to it a piece of Linnen; which he wavered, to give notice there were perſons in the Iſland. The Fiſher-men drew near within a ſtones caſt off the ſhoar. After a quarter of an hours conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they came nearer, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in <hi>Portugaiſe</hi> what we were. We anſwered 'em in the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and being fully ſatisfied, they came on ſhoar. They were all Armed, ſome with Darts, and Javelins, and others with Bows, and Arrows; and although they ſaw well enough, our people were not in a capacity to moleſt them, yet they anxiouſly demanded their Arms. Our Men having only
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:109000:66"/>
their Knives, immediately threw them down on the ground, and one of the <hi>Negroes</hi> gathered them up. Whereupon they drew nearer us, and required to ſee the reſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding how many we were in all? Leſt our number ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright them, 'twas anſwered, we were not above ſeven, whom they ſhould now ſee. Thoſe that gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, raviſhed with joy to ſee themſelves upon the point of their deliverance, could not forbear ſhou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and hollowing, at the entrance of the Wood. Which being heard by their Companions, they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined ſome Beaſt was wounded, and their aſſiſtance required. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon every Man, at this noiſe, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelf with a good Cudgel, and ran with all ſpeed, towards the place where the noiſe was heard. When the <hi>Negroes</hi> ſaw 'em coming with ſuch fierceneſs, they imagined themſelves betrayed, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately let fly their Arrows, yet
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:109000:66"/>
hurt none of our Men. Who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were attcked by perſons, whom they ſuppoſed to be the wretched Slaves, they ſaw on the other ſide, two days after they Landed in the Iſland; imagined, that hunger drove them to this extremity, and that taking our Men at a diſadvantage, they would have ſlain them. In this imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſo Animated themſelves, that they reſolved to cry quittance with them, when their ſtock of Arrows were ſpent. The two that were near the <hi>Negroes,</hi> perceiving their Companions miſtake, cryed out to 'em, they were deceived, and bad 'em throw away their Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and come boldly up to them. To which, they obeyed; and in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, demanded by ſigns of the <hi>Negroes,</hi> whether they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to eat; and that they would haſten to give them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. One of them anſwered in <hi>Dutch,</hi> that their wants were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:109000:67"/>
and ſhould be ſupplied, but they muſt firſt deliver up their Staves, and Knives, which was done without the leaſt heſitation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Negroes</hi> now fearing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, gave our people a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Sod Rice, which was ſo greedily devoured, that they ſtood like Men amazed, beholding how they eat it. In the mean time our Men, being impatient to get out of this place, demanded of the <hi>Negroes</hi> whether they would carry 'em thence, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to, upon conſideration of a reward; alledging they were but poor, and conſequently could not afford to do it for nothing. Our Men having Money, ſoon agreed about the price, which was four Crowns a Man; and the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpent the next Day in repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Barks. As to proviſion, they ſaid they were ſtored with Rice, ſufficient for themſelves, and us; and hoped to take Fiſh enough
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:109000:67"/>
to ſatisfie the moſt hungry among us. This diſcourſe extreamly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced our people, who immediately demanded a Hat-full of Rice, which they obtain'd for half a Crown. Whilſt the <hi>Negroes</hi> were Fiſhing, our people boyled the Rice, they had given them; and before 'twas ready, they brought them Fiſh like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, together with neceſſaries to dreſs it. At Night, when 'twas time to reſt, the Maſter ordered our Men privately to watch, one after another, to prevent the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> from uſing any treachery to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; and they on their ſide, uſed the ſame pre-caution.</p>
            <p>Two Days after, they gave us notice to make ready for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture the Night following; and as ſoon as we were imbarked, they rowed ſo luſtily, that we ſoon came to their Village. Being Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they led our people to the Governour, who gave them a kind Reception, and diſpatched two or
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:109000:68"/>
three Barks, with Proviſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that ſet out on their Boat from the Iſland. Having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this order, he made them ſit down about him, on a great Matt; and cauſed the Fiſher-men to come before him, and return the Money given for their paſſage. But they alledged 'twas not juſt to defraud theſe poor Men of their Sallary. As ſoon as they were ſat down, an Eunuch brought word, that the Governours Women had a deſire to ſee ſome of the young <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> who were ſent them. The place where they entred, is a great ſpace diſtinguiſhed by ſeveral Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; in the midſt of which is a Court, through which the Eunuch made them enter. Where imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately theſe Women Flockt about 'em, ſome of them taking 'em by the Noſe, others pinched their Cheeks: Some, again, unbuttoned 'em, to ſee and touch their Breaſts, others ſtroakt them over the Face
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:109000:68"/>
with languiſhing looks; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not one of them, but deſired theſe two young Men might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with them for ſome hours; but the ſurly Eunuch departed, and made ſigns to them, to follow him. Being joyned to their Companions, they were led altogether to a Houſe of Entertainment for ſtrangers. The next Morning, which was Market-day, the Governour came to 'em, and changed their Money into lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Shels, (which is the Money of that Country) and helpt them to buy what they wanted, to prevent their being cheated.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the Day was ſpent, in making merry; and towards Evening, the Book-keeper looking out at the Door, received a blow with a ſtone, that much injured him. Of which, having complained to the Governour, he cauſed the offender to be ſought, and found him to be one of his Domeſticks. Having ſharply reprehended him,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:109000:69"/>
he cauſed an Arrow to be run through his Noſtrils; and having a Drum tied behind his Shoulders, was thus led before the Lodging of the Perſon hurt; where having been ſeverely whipt, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to perpetual baniſhment. And this was the adventure of the five Men that remain'd in the Iſle after us: Here follows that of the ſeven, who made uſe of a Boat, in the ſame manner as we did.</p>
            <p>Having no Anchor, for the ſpace of five Days, and as many Nights, they ſtruggled againſt the force of the Tides, which caſt them upon a Bank of Sand. This Bank was of great extent, where they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, at firſt, they might find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for their refreſhment; the Proviſion they took with 'em, being ſpent. But after a long ſearch, could find nothing but a ſmall quantity of a Buffles dung, which they carefully gathered up. They had lived two Days upon the Moſs,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:109000:69"/>
which the Floods from the Sea had made, on the Trees it daſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. And their Stomachs being thus accuſtomed to filth, this laſt appeared very good to 'em, and they only complained they had not enough of it.</p>
            <p>This ſorry Food laſted them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three Days, at the end of which, they found themſelves ſo weak; that they could neither Row, nor without difficulty ſtand upright. One of the Company reflecting upon the neceſſity there was of dying, in this diſconſolate place: <hi>What think you of it,</hi> ſaid he, to the four reſt, that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, <hi>muſt we all dye with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? Is it not juſt, that ſome loſe their Lives, for the preſervation of the reſt? It is true, the Divine Law enjoyns us, to love our. Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and forbids Murther: But is there any thing more near to us, than our ſelves; and does not this precept of Prohibition ſeem to inſinuate, that</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:109000:70"/>
               <hi>every thing is permitted us, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the conſerving of that Being, which Nature has given us? We have the example of whatſoever has Life; the great Fiſh devour the ſmall; and the leaſt. Inſect, flies by a Natural inſtinct, the approaches of its Enemy. Death treads upon our Heels;</hi> ſays he, <hi>of all Enemies the moſt dreadful, and cruel. Why do we not, then, uſe againſt it, the only remedy left us? Kill we therefore, the weakeſt amongſt us, Nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces us to it, and I cannot ſee what you can oppoſe againſt my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>No marvel,</hi> replyed one of thoſe to whom he directed his diſcourſe, <hi>if your Argument be wrong, being grounded on a falſe Principle; the Prohibition to Kill, is ſo expreſs in the Law, that no reaſon is ſufficient to exempt us from it. Be it known to you therefore, in ſhort, that if you continue in this pernicious deſign, you thereby render your ſelf an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:109000:70"/>
               <hi>both to God and Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This honeſt Man's diſcourſe (whoſe name was <hi>Adrian Raas)</hi> could not prevail with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwered, Neceſſity knew no Law. The three others, who were preſent at this Harangue, reſolved with the firſt, to execute their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. <hi>Adrian Raas,</hi> well aſſured of their intent, went to give notice thereof to the two Victims. Who, at the news, fell into ſuch Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that their friend, moved with compaſſion, promiſed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them. Whereupon he led 'em to a by place, where he helpt 'em to make two holes, wherein to hide themſelves at Night; which was the time appointed, for this bloudy Sacrifice. By which means, failing of their deſign, they were forced to take other meaſures, and did as follows. Three of the accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, conſidering the trouble they had, to ſurprize thoſe whom they intended, caſt their Eyes upon one
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:109000:71"/>
amongſt them, a Corpulent Man, and in whom they believed to find, what they could not meet with in the two others. He was no Fool, and therefore well perceived their deſigns were upon him. From that time he ſtood upon his guard, and without taking notice of any thing, flattered, and exhorted 'em to hope the beſt; ſaying, he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, but ſome Barks would paſs by, and then the Tongue of that Countrey, which he learnt at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romandel</hi> (where he had been a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier) would ſtand them in ſtead. This wheedle took effect; and they thought it behooved 'em to preſerve him, for his ability in that kind. <hi>Adrian Raas</hi> helpt to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the Story, although he knew 'twas falſe; affirming, a Man of his parts, was better than a Treaſure in a ſtrange Countrey. One of the moſt hunger-ſtarved, ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done; and all his contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances rendred ineffectual: Well,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:109000:71"/>
ſaid he, is this the fruit of all our projects? Will no Body dye? Let the reſt argue how they will, I muſt feed upon ſome Fleſh, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before I ſleep. To which, the three others conſenting, <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Raas</hi> ſhewed 'em into what an abominable enormity they were ruſhing, through their impatiency; and therefore earneſtly adviſed them, to weigh the conſequences of what they were a going about. We have thought enough, and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried but too long already, replyed one of the reſoluteſt of them, and the two we would begin withal, are ſo little deſerving of their lives, that 'tis a ſin not to kill them. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian Raas</hi> ſeeing his Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would do no good, propoſed to 'em the drawing of Lots; by which means, that perſon whom Heaven judged worthy of death, ſhould have it. But his propoſal was rejected, and another expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent being ſought after, there were
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:109000:72"/>
two that offered to go in queſt of Land; whence they promiſed to ſend help to the others, with all poſſible expedition. This propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal liked us all; and to facilitate their enterprize, thoſe that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, gave to the two adventurers almoſt all their Money, with which theſe laſt parted, and arrived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly at a Village of <hi>Bengala.</hi> They being ignorant of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and being not able to make themſelves underſtood, could not indicate the place, where their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were. Yet their own particular wants being apparent, they were well treated for two Days, and then put on Board a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, wherein they Sailed near three hundred Leagues to be preſented to the great <hi>Mogol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eight days after they were gone, the five wretches that tarried ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting them, ſpied Fiſher-men paſs by the place where they were; and coming within call, they ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:109000:72"/>
him amongſt them, who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded skill in their Language, to ſpeak to 'em; and he cried out, <hi>pai, pai,</hi> but thoſe two words ſignifying nothing, the Fiſher-men could not tell what to make of them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the reſt repented, they had not eaten him. After a thouſand reproaches, and invectives againſt him, for his abuſing them; at length they made a ſhift by ſigns to make 'emſelves underſtood; and the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher-men, in approaching them, required 'em to lay down their knives, before they came on Board them: Where they had no ſooner been, but they fell immediately to fighting, who ſhould have a dead Fiſh, which they ſaw lying in the Boat, and in this buſtle, dropt a Bagg of Money; which being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of by the Fiſher-men, they immediately ſeized upon their wretched Paſſengers; and having ſpoiled them of all, turned them out again, in the ſame place where
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:109000:73"/>
they took them in. Theſe poor people, thus handled, deſtitute of all ſuccour, and void of all hope, to get out of this wretched place, laid themſelves down on the Sand, where they impatiently expected death, to put an end to their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. Having lain near four and twenty hours in this diſtreſs, there paſſed by other Boats; who ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, drew near of their own accord, and made ſigns to 'em, to come on Board. Where immediately they had a Barrel of Honey ſet before 'em. They were raviſht to find themſelves thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly treated, and for fear the Fiſher-men would not take them along with 'em, they filled in the Night, their Hats full of it, which they intended to reſerve in ſtore. Yet was their fear need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, for the next Morning they were carried to <hi>Sondiep;</hi> where the Maſter, and thoſe that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, had arrived the ſame
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:109000:73"/>
day. The Governour of the Town gave them a kind Reception, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally provided for them; and after five Days refreſhment adviſed them to go carry the news of their wrack to the Factory.</p>
            <p>As to our ſelves, who came laſt, we minded nothing but reſt, or rather eating, for Night and Day we devoured all that came before us.</p>
            <p>Having been here about five Days we deſired the Governour's permiſſion to go to <hi>Bolwa,</hi> where our companions were gone before us. He ſcrupled at firſt the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſuppoſing we were not yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure ſo long a Voyage; but finding us determined, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed three Barks to be made ready, one to carry us, and the two others for our Convoy.</p>
            <p>The Night following we arrived at <hi>Anam,</hi> a poor and deſpicable place, that afforded not any thing. Here we ſent back our three Barks,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:109000:74"/>
and hired another as far as <hi>Bolwa.</hi> At two Leagues diſtance from this Village, our Guides ſet us on ſhoar, and made us walk on Foot, the reſt of the way. Whilſt they went to the Governour, to give notice of our arrival, we bought Milk and Rice, which we dreſt in a Pot, that was lent us by <hi>Moors</hi> that ſpake <hi>Portugaiſe.</hi> It was near ready, when our guides came and told us, we muſt come immediately to the Prince, who ſent for us. This news diſpleaſed us, for we had a Canine Appetite; and were not willing to leave to ſtrangers, what we ſo dearly prized. We took the Pot, then, and carried it by turns to the Prince's Palace-Gate, where we Eat what was in it, before we entred. We were afterwards led to the place, where our twenty Companions were, who parted long before us; and within half an hour, into a great Hall, where our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was counted; to the end we
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:109000:74"/>
might be ſatisfied, in caſe we had been Robbed by the way. We were at length brought to our Lodging, and by the Prince's order, ſerved with an excellent kind of Meat (called <hi>Brenſie)</hi> ſeen only on great Mens Tables. 'Tis made of choice Rice, a fat Gooſe, and two Pullets, ſqueezed together in a Cloth, after about two or three hours boiling; To the juyce of which, there is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſeveral ſorts of ſpices; eſpecially Nutmegs, Cloves, Saffron, Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and Sugar. This was ſuch a nouriſhing Food, that in leſs than three or fours days, we recovered again our full ſtrength. Yet were not our Stomachs fully ſatisfied with it; for we were more for a leſs juicy meat, ſuch as dry Rice, and boiled Fiſh.</p>
            <p>Five days after we had been here, the States of the Kingdom, whom the Prince called, met before his Palace; where, as faſt as they came, we ſaw 'em take their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:109000:75"/>
and ſit down after the manner of the Eaſtern people. When all the Members had taken their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Prince came out of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, invironed with his Guards; ſome with Bows and Arrows, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with Sword and Buckler; and he ſeated himſelf in the ſame manner as the reſt. They kept in this poſture, from Morning till Night; and that which they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, was ſo little ſecret, that an hour after, 'twas the talk of the common people. I deſired to know the reaſon of it, and was told, that here were no Myſteries of State tranſacted, nothing being done but what came to the publick notice. And the reaſon is, that the Prince's Guard conſiſts wholly of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which are there in great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem; and although, perhaps, they are only Chriſtians in name, being <hi>Negroes</hi> born; Subjects to the King of <hi>Portugal:</hi> Yet are they counted ſuch brave fellows, that they have
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:109000:75"/>
a particular reſpect ſhew'd them; and therefore the Grandees of the Court ſo highly prize their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, that they relate to them, whatſoever paſſes in Council.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, the Prince ſent us word, that we might go when we pleaſed, the Barks being ready. This being our earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, we parted an hour after and happily Arrived at <hi>Decka.</hi> The Factory received us very kindly. We related to 'em our Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and they inform'd us that the Ship called the <hi>Weſop,</hi> was caſt away near the Iſles of <hi>Anaans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Governor, cauſed a Bark to be made ready, to Tranſport us to <hi>Ongueli,</hi> where the <hi>Dutch</hi> have alſo a conſiderable Factory. But an hour before we parted, he receiv'd a Letter from the great Mogols Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, in which he enjoyned him to ſend us to him: This being an expreſs order, we were forced to obey, ſeeing this General
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:109000:76"/>
threatned, in caſe of refuſal, to ſeize upon all the <hi>Dutch</hi> in his Maſter's Kingdom, and make them Slaves.</p>
            <p>We were forced, then, to yield, and in preparing our ſelves for a longer Voyage, than the firſt; were told, that this General, named <hi>Nabab,</hi> was a perſon very fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, having never loſt a Battel, nor raiſed his Siege from any place, before he had carried it away; that he had taken ſeveral Cities, defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whole Armies, and made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdoms tributary to the great <hi>Mogul.</hi> Theſe proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes made us imbark with the better courage in following our Guides who were ordered to bring us to the Army.</p>
            <p>We travelled thirty days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſometimes by Land, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Sea; paſſing by ſeveral Cities, made deſolate; the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Countrey being wont, in time of War to leave their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109000:76"/>
Houſes, to follow the Army, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it marches.</p>
            <p>They are a ſort of people, that are very juſt in their dealings, of an Affable Converſation, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with few things; naturally Enemies to covetouſneſs and ambition, yet quarrelſom and injurious; but in their greateſt heats, never mention the Name of the Devil. As to oaths, they ſeldom uſe 'em, unleſs in matters of great concernment; and then ſo ſtrictly obſerve 'em, that no conſideration in the World can prevail with them, to violate 'em.</p>
            <p>On the thirty fifth day, we went on Board one of the Veſſels belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Nabab;</hi> where we found four <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> ſome few <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaiſes,</hi> and two Men of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, whom we already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. From thence we went, and caſt Anchor, near the City of <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guemati;</hi> from whence, within a ſmall time we came, and were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:109000:77"/>
in the Army of the great <hi>Mogol.</hi> The General, whom we ſaluted in his Tent, ſeemed glad to ſee us, and immediately order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us a large Cup-full of <hi>Arak,</hi> to drink his health. The Cup was ſo cloſed, that 'twas a difficult matter for us to open it, and therefore the General gave it us on purpoſe, to divert himſelf with the humour of it. We took it each of us, one after another, in our hands, to no purpoſe; and were ready to give it over, when it came into my mind, that the Cup being only of Wood might be eaſily pierced: Whereupon I took it again, and made a hole in it, with the point of my knife. Being full to the brim, the <hi>Arak</hi> ſprung out abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and by this means we all drank of it, and uſed the liberty <hi>Nabab</hi> had given us, in ſaying, <hi>We muſt drink well, and fight well.</hi> This Liquour was ſo ſtrong, that we ſoon felt the effects of it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:109000:77"/>
us jolly, and confident with the General; who told us that at ſix Months end, he would ſend us to thoſe of our own Nation. He granted us the full enjoyment of all the booty we could take from the Enemy; and fifty <hi>Roupies</hi> for every Head we brought him; and an hundred for each Priſoner. In fine, he told the Maſter of our Ship, he would ſend him to the Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to inform them of the loſs of their Veſſel; and that he might take our Chirurgion with him, and our three Boys, which were too young to ſerve in the Army. In the mean time the <hi>Arak</hi> made us ſo bold, that we had like to fall'n together by the Ears for Oranges, which were given us, becauſe all had not a like ſhare, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering we were in the General's Tent. He winkt at our rudeneſs, and commanded his Chirurgion to carry us to his Tent, and drink there more moderately.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:109000:78"/>
The next Morning the General ſent us three hundred <hi>Roupies,</hi> and aſſign'd us certain Veſſels, called <hi>Gourapes,</hi> one of which carried four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Guns, and about fifty or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men. Each <hi>Gourape</hi> was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by four <hi>Koſſes;</hi> which are Boats with Oars, to tow great Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. There were alſo ſeveral great Flat-bottom Boats, that carried no Maſt, yet were well furniſhed with Guns. The greateſt part of the Officers were <hi>Portugaiſes;</hi> and the General had ſo good an opinion of the Chriſtians, that if a <hi>Moor</hi> could ſpeak but a little of that Language, he commonly preferred him to ſome conſiderable Office. There were ſeveral other Veſſels, laden only with Proviſion, and War-like Ammunition. We ſaw likewiſe, ſeveral Barges ſet forth with Strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, wherein were the Wives of Perſons of Quality, that followed the Army. The General had five hundred for his ſhare. Theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:109000:78"/>
were kept by Eunuchs, made ſo in their tender years, who were in great credit with their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as we were ordered to march, we ſought the Veſſel aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd us, but I had the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to loſe my ſelf in that vaſt multitude of people, together with one of my Companions, and were eight days, before we could know where to betake our ſelves. This ſmall miſhap gave me the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of an exact obſervation of the Army, which conſiſted of near three hundred thouſand Horſe, and five hundred thouſand Foot. The General rode in the midſt of the Cavalry; and before him marched ſeveral Trumpeters, and Kettle-Drummers, mounted on Elephants. He was followed by twenty of theſe Animals, each of them car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying two ſmall pieces of Cannon, two Gunners, with as many char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. After theſe came three or
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:109000:79"/>
four thouſand <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily well mounted.</p>
            <p>Several thouſands of Cammels, laden with the Baggage, were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by all ſorts of Merchants, Artiſans, Curtiſans; ſome mounted on Cammels, others on Horſes. 'Twas told us, that this great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtood the <hi>Mogol,</hi> in every day, above five Millions; the greateſt part of which, were paid by the Curtiſans, and Merchants, that followed the Army. Which is no hard matter to believe, becauſe I knew in that Countrey, the Cities were deſtitute of all Trade in time of War, and therefore the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were forced to follow the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; by which means, it abounded with all neceſſaries, except ſtrong drinks, the uſe of which was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly permitted to the Chriſtians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Moors</hi> in drinking never ſo ſmall a quantity, became cruel, and bloody minded.</p>
            <p>After a long march, we entred
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:109000:79"/>
into <hi>Kosbia,</hi> a Country lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Kingdoms of <hi>Bengala,</hi> and <hi>Azo,</hi> of which the General ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily became Maſter. The King of <hi>Azo</hi> imagined the Walls of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City, were proof againſt our Cannon; and believed himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; but ſoon found the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for we took his City by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, and made him Priſoner. He had an Iron Collar, faſtned about his Neck, whence hung two great Chains, which were fixt alſo to his Legs, and in this manner was ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by four Pages. A while after the King was taken Priſoner, the General was ſhewed ſeveral Caves made into rocks, wherein was hid his Treaſure, the reſt became the Souldiers booty, and we thought all to enrich our ſelves, but were miſtaken; for beſides that; theſe people wear no other Cloathing, than a piece of Linnen, which reaches from their Waſte; down to their Knees; they had ſo well hid
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:109000:80"/>
every thing of value, that we could find nothing but a Pot of Rice, and a Box full of Tow, and ſome Leaves, which they chew continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to cleanſe their mouths. We were troubled to find our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thus fruſtrated, eſpecially conſidering the ſmallneſs of our Wages, which were not ſufficient to maintain us, being no more than ten Crowns a Month, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was very dear. The reaſon why we had no more, was, becauſe we ſerved by conſtraint, whereas the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Portugaiſes</hi> that went voluntiers, received monthly twenty five Crowns a Man.</p>
            <p>Some days after, the General required our two Carpenters aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in the building him a ſtately Veſſel, from a model he ſhewed them. Which finiſhed, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed 'em their liberty. They accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the propoſal, and were ſent to <hi>Decka,</hi> where they finiſhed their undertaking, to the General's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:109000:80"/>
who kept his word with them.</p>
            <p>It was demanded of us, at the ſame time, whether either of us, was willing to accept the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Caſtle of <hi>Agra,</hi> and for our encouragement, there were ſeveral advantagious offers made us; but they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us, eſpecially conſidering we were to live amongſt <hi>Moors;</hi> and that ſuch an employ, perhaps, would ſo fix us in that Countrey, that we ſhould never get out of it.</p>
            <p>The General being a Man of diſpatch, immediately after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of the King of <hi>Azo,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened towards the Countrys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the King of <hi>Aſſam,</hi> who was one of the <hi>Mogols</hi> chiefeſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. 'Twas ſaid, that this King having notice of his march, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his diſcretion, wondering, that with eight hundred thouſand Men only, he ſhould undertake that,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:109000:81"/>
which two Millions of Men could not atchieve. In effect, it ſeemed to be a raſh Enterprize, and that the Example of ſo prodigious an Army, which lately periſhed in the ſame Parts where we went, ſhould have deterred our General. But ſo far was he from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by this conſideration, that the greatneſs of the danger ſerved only to heighten his courage; and leſt the Flood, which every ſix Months overflowed the greateſt part of this Kingdom, ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his project, he advanced with great expedition, and arrived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, at the place he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. As ſoon as we were in the Enemies Countrey, a general conſternation ſeized upon them; and the fame of <hi>Nabab</hi>'s Fortune, cauſed infinite numbers of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy's Subjects to come over to his ſide, as the ſureſt.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and we, having obſerved all the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:109000:81"/>
ſigns of an approaching tempeſt, carefully viewed, and repaired our Veſſels; but all our pre-cautions could not hinder its ſinking: For not being Ballaſted, the Currents overturned it, and that which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened our loſs, was the Sottiſh, and Extravagant curioſity of a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that had the management of it. This Man, to try experiments, would needs have all the Sails hoiſted up, which was no ſooner done, but our Veſſel ſunk. There were Boats e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to help us, had cuſtom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it; but in like accidents, the <hi>Moors</hi> help no Body, not their near Kindred, or intimate Friends, Yet by good hap, there was a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty well-ſhaped Woman, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five <hi>Hollanders</hi> upon the point of drowning, rowed up to them, and maugre two Men that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood her, received them into her Boat.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Ganges</hi> is of very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal breadth, being in ſome places
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:109000:82"/>
a League, in others a League and an half wide; ſo that when the Wind is high, this River abounds with Waves and Billows, no ways inferiour to thoſe of the Sea. There were loſt by this accident four <hi>Dutch-men,</hi> and twenty four <hi>Moors;</hi> and I had ran the ſame Fate, had not I (after four hours ſwimming towards the Land) met with a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, Commanded by <hi>Engliſh-men.</hi> As ſoon as I made my ſelf known to them, they ſent forth above ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men to my aſſiſtance, who took me into their Boat, where they gave me what was neceſſary. In fine, they carried me on Board their Veſſel, where I found one of my Countrey-men, on whom the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had ſhew'd the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. The next Morning we thankt our Benefactors, and went to the Army, where we ſought an occaſion of admittance to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>The loſs of his Veſſel was but
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:109000:82"/>
bad news to carry him, yet we could not but make it known to him, for we knew not where to beſtow our ſelves. As ſoon as he heard it, he fell into ſuch a Fit of paſſion, that we believed we ſhould be both hanged or worſe. At length he commanded us to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, and chooſe what Veſſel we had a mind to, the Enemy's Fleet being expected every moment.</p>
            <p>We were heartily glad we came off ſo well; four of our Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons went on board a <hi>Gourape;</hi> and two others, and my ſelf, choſe a Bark, that carried ſix pieces of Cannon.</p>
            <p>Two days after, our Admiral ſet Sail, in ſearch of the Enemy, attended by the whole Fleet. We immediately heard a continual roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Guns, whence we inſerred, the Land Army was engaged; but as to our parts, we could not ſo ſoon joyn the Enemy, being (as it was thought) at a great diſtance
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:109000:83"/>
from us. When the Admiral had ſet his Fleet in order, the General's Chirurgion, who was of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Lover of his Countrey, exhorted us to behave our ſelves, anſwerable to the good opinion they had of our Countrey-men. Repreſenting to us, that when we come to engage, the whole Fleet will take notice of the Chriſtians, and eſpecially of us, who were greatly eſteemed by the <hi>Moors.</hi> That 'twas the Companies intereſt, we ſhould keep up our Reputation, and that we might have a great ſhare in the glory of that days actions.</p>
            <p>Although the Wind was little favourable to us, yet we followed on our courſe; and three or four hours after daſht againſt a Rock, which ſtruck off our Helm. At length we recovered it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fixt it in its right place, held on our courſe. Not long after we diſcovered the Enemy's Fleet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſix hundred Sail. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:109000:83"/>
we were in ſearch of them, yet were greatly ſurprized to ſee thoſe ſo near us, whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be farther off. As ſoon as the Enemy perceived us, they advanced towards us, and we tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried expecting them, as well out of neceſſity, as bravery, the contrary Wind hindering us from retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Whilſt they made up towards us, we ſat down at Table, which we had no ſooner done, but a diſh of Meat that was ſet thereon, was carried away by a Cannon Bullet, which did us no other harm, but that of depriving us of our allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Whereupon we betook our ſelves to our Guns, and from that time, till midnight, ceaſed not Firing on our ſide, and were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the ſame manner by the Enemy. An hour after the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my withdrew; there came another Veſſel to our aſſiſtance, which was commanded by a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Prince, called <hi>Menorcan,</hi> who had ſet out
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:109000:84"/>
thirty Veſſels at his own charge, for the ſervice of the great <hi>Mogol.</hi> This Prince obſerving our poſt to be dangerous, aſſiſted us in ſuch a manner, that we got the Wind of the Enemy. As ſoon as we had caſt Anchor, he left us, promiſing to return the next Morning, with the whole Fleet. He had not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten far, before we perceived ſix Sail making towards us. Five of which, could not ſurmount the force of the Currents, but the ſixth came ſo near, as to give us a broad ſide. But as ſoon as a fair opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, we boarded her, &amp; quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſters of her. So that we took the firſt prize on the Enemy. Having taken out of this Veſſel, whatever was of any value, to avoid farther trouble, we ſet her on fire. Half an hour after, eight or nine of the Enemy's Veſſels made towards us, and this number daunted us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we weighed Anchor, and ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered our ſelves under the <hi>Dutch</hi> and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:109000:84"/>
               <hi>Portugaiſe</hi> Veſſels, which made 'em ceaſe purſuing us. At day-break we found our Admiral was ſtill a League off of us. The whole Fleet (of which the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Portugaiſe</hi> led the Van) were in good order, and advanced towards the Enemy, as faſt as the little Wind which then blew would permit 'em. As to our parts, the Currents were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, wherefore we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be towed by <hi>Moors,</hi> that went on ſhoar for that purpoſe. In the mean time, a Trumpet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Ten or Twelve Horſe, coming from the General, who believed, upon a falſe report, we were loſt, called out to us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times from the ſhoar, <hi>Sauwas Hollanders.</hi> The word <hi>Sauwas</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Courage. Being near, they inform'd us, how greatly the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was troubled, at the falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a <hi>Moor,</hi> who brought him word, that the Veſſels comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugaiſe</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:109000:85"/>
were loſt. They returned then towards their Maſter; who better informed of the matter, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the tongue of the <hi>Moor</hi> (who brought him that falſe news) to be cut out, and he to be whipt with a Whip, which they call <hi>Chamboe,</hi> every laſh of which cuts as deep as a Razor.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the force of the Currents, and the great advantages the Enemy had over us, we got the Wind of them; and from that time, never ceaſed Firing upon em; and at length, were ſeconded by our whole Fleet. When the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſaw it approaching, they ſet forth ſuch great ſhouts, as wou'd made a Man think all was already loſt. Yet did they couragiouſly defend themſelves, and for three hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Victory inclined to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. From that time their heat abated, and they began to ſhift their ſtation, and were ſo cloſely plyed, that they left their Veſſels,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:109000:85"/>
and ran to ſhoar, where finding they were purſued, they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in vain, to poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of a high Bank, for we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed 'em ſo cloſe, that we ſlew almoſt all of them, being ordered to give no quarter. We took three hundred of their Veſſels, the leaſt of which, carried ſeventy Men; and of this whole number, there eſcaped not above fifty, whom the King (enraged his orders were no better obſerved) condemned to ſuffer the moſt grievous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that had ſtill ſome Life remaining in them, were tyed to Stakes, where the Soldiers put an end to their Lives, with their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. Thus periſhed this nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and mighty Army; of which, very few eſcaped, to carry the news of the loſs of the reſt. The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral having diſguiſed himſelf, was notwithſtanding, taken Priſoner, and releaſed at the interceſſion of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:109000:86"/>
ſome of the General's principal Of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficers. As to the booty, 'twas not conſiderable, conſiſting only in Powder, Lead, and ſome pieces of Cannon.</p>
            <p>It was diſcourſed, that the fault of this Admiral was the leſs excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, inaſmuch as he had neglected the orders of his Prince; who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to go with ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Sail, to expect us above the City of <hi>Goaëti.</hi> Which was a very advantagious poſt, as well to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from taking in any Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as to block us up in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; but he choſe rather to be guided by his own fancy, imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhouts of his Fleet would diſmay us.</p>
            <p>The three hundred Veſſels that eſcaped, unhappily caſt Anchor at about a quarter of a Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the General, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced up the Countrey with all poſſible expedition. As ſoon as he knew where they were, he brought
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:109000:86"/>
two or three hundred pieces of Cannon, and planted 'em againſt them, and ſunk the greateſt part of them; the reſt paſt over to the other ſide of the River, where our Veſſels purſued them with ſucceſs. Some of 'em wheeled about, thro by ways, where the <hi>Moors</hi> found, and ſlew them.</p>
            <p>The Enemy's Fleet being thus routed, we paſſed by the Foot of a ſteep Rock, where was built a Fortreſs of difficult acceſs. Yet was it abandoned, but 'twas to draw us farther into the Countrey. From thence we came to the City of <hi>Gueragan,</hi> whence the King fled; and our Admiral caſt Anchor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the City of <hi>Lokwa,</hi> ſituated about ſix Leagues from thence. Some time after, the General Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the chief of the Fleet, to ſend him Money, and Proviſions for the Army. Whereupon our Commanders ſent him ſix Boats, two laden with Gold, and four
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:109000:87"/>
with Silver, but the ſix Boats un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately fell into the Enemy's hand, who in the heat of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal, ſlew the greateſt part of the Men. They reſerved ſome Chriſtians for their pleaſure, under whoſe Arms, they faſtned ſeveral wiſps of Straw, ſtuft with Powder; and when theſe wiſps were conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they faſtned others in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in their places, till ſuch time as they expired. The pleaſure of theſe Barbarians, was to hear the ſcreeks of theſe poor wretches, who, the louder they cryed, the more they rejoyced theſe cruel Monſters. Thoſe that eſcaped into the Woods, came at Night to the Army, which was in great diſtreſs, the Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already ſo high, that 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to return back.</p>
            <p>The Army lay Encamped in a place full of fruitful Trees, and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with excellent Rice. The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains yield Pepper, Agra-wood, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Simples, that are ſold for
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:109000:87"/>
their weight in Gold. As to this met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal 'tis not ſcarce; &amp; Elephants are ſo common, that the country, as fruitful as 'tis, is not ſufficient to feed them; therefore they are always lean.</p>
            <p>We choſe in this pleaſant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, a proper place to Intrench our ſelves, and cut down, to prevent ſurpriſals, all the Trees round about us. We ſent out ſcouts every day to obſerve the Enemy's motions. Thoſe that fell into the hands of our party, were cruelly ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and then had their Heads cut off, which were hung up in Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets upon the boughs of Trees. When they were too numerous to be all made Priſoners, they cut off the Heads of the greateſt part, and hung about the Necks of every one of the reſt, two of theſe Heads, which they were made to carry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Camp; where they were cruelly whipt; and when 'twas jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged they were near expiring, they had likewiſe, their Heads ſevered
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:109000:88"/>
from their Bodies; which were hanged, like the reſt, in Panniers, upon the boughs of Trees. Some had ſtakes drove through them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. Others had four double hooks thruſt down their Bellies, which tore their Bowels; and in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, were carried to the places the Enemy frequented; to the end the horrour of the Torment they endured, might move them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the weakeſt ſide.</p>
            <p>If theſe puniſhments were cruel, thoſe of the Enemy were no leſs, for they made their Priſoners lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ſo long in their Torments, as would have moved the moſt obdurate to pity. Having made 'em expire by their cruel uſage, they faſtned them, ſtanding bolt upright, to ſtakes, upon flat-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom Boats, and ſent them thus down the River, either towards the Army, or the Fleet; where they became ſuch a ſad ſpectacle, that they could not be beheld without dread and horrour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:109000:88"/>
As to thoſe that rendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they were received with great expreſſions of kindneſs. There came likewiſe to our Camp, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours from the King of the <hi>Antropophages,</hi> or Man-eaters; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the aſſiſtance of his Army, againſt the King of <hi>Aſſam</hi>'s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but the ſmall ſincerity of theſe people being known, their offers were not accepted, yet were they ſent away, with aſſurances of the great <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Friendſhip, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they aſſiſted not his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>Theſe people had fierce looks, a rough carriage, and the Mine of perſons that eat others alive. In effect, they fed on Human Fleſh, ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling to Interr their Dead, whom they deſign'd for a better uſe. Thoſe that are ſick amongſt them, and in a languiſhing condition, are knockt on the Head, and eaten; and this is all the charity they have one for another. They poſſeſs all things
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:109000:89"/>
in Common, carrying what they ſteal from ſtrangers, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Heap, where they have all an equal portion. When we told them, their way of living was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the reſt of Mankind, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unnatural to eat their fellow Creatures; they replyed, Opinion, and Cuſtom, made all theſe things either good or bad; and that a Man cannot do ill in following thoſe he found eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>There were in our Army certain Soldiers, whoſe Maxim was, Never to give back; and to dye, rather than abandon the Poſt aſſigned them. Thoſe that dye thus, are ſure of Salvation; whereas, thoſe that behaved themſelves cowardly, and were ſlain, were certainly Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. This opinion renders 'em valiant, which is not ſuch a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous one as we are apt to imagine, ſeeing many in the moſt civilized Nations have aſſerted it, extreamly meritorious, to dye for one's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:109000:89"/>
The General had honoured us, with a high Character of our Valour, ſo that the only report of our name, ſtood him in as much ſtead as an Army. Thoſe on the Enemy's ſide, who fled over to us, had ſuch a great eſteem for us, that they made room for us, whereſoever we went. The <hi>Moors</hi> ſhewed us the ſame reſpect; but thoſe dreadleſs fellows I now mention'd, kept their gravity with us, claiming precedency in all ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, which for quietneſs ſake we granted them.</p>
            <p>Next after the <hi>Dutch,</hi> certain <hi>Armenian</hi> Horſe-men, were in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt eſteem; as well for that they were Chriſtians, as that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually kept good Horſes, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved good order. Our Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus up, the Admiral judged us the moſt fitting perſons to take charge of the Artillery. For which purpoſe, he made us very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious proffers; but we liked nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:109000:90"/>
the Country, nor Manners of its People; and therefore intreated him to pitch upon ſome others, to whom this employ would be more agreeable, than to us, who were not ſo well verſed in the Tongue, as to make our ſelves obeyed, which reaſon ſatisfied him.</p>
            <p>Every New Moon is a Feſtival with the <hi>Moors,</hi> which day begins with the diſcharge of all the great Guns; after which, the Soldiers are paid, and this payment conſiſts of fifty Roupies, or 25 Crowns, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Horſe-man, ſome have a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paid them, others thirty, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and others again, only ten. The Foot Soldiers pay is but ſmall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not above five or ſix Roupies a Month. As to the Slaves, who work almoſt both day and night, they have ſcarcely any thing, or that which is given them, is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, that the greateſt part of them dye with hunger. Theſe Slaves are <hi>Indians,</hi> who eat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:109000:90"/>
endued with liſe; and their ſuperſtition is ſuch, that how great ſoever their hunger may be, they chooſe rather to dye, than to eat either Fiſh or Fleſh. Their Food conſiſts chiefly of Rice, and when they are deſtitute of it (which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens not ſeldom) they dye willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; not doubting but this kind of death, procures them Eternal Life. Theſe poor Wretches Diſcourſes were continually concerning the contempt of abundance, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of want. They could not comprehend, how thoſe that live in plenty in this World, can be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the next; and in this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, take their miſery for a mark of their Election.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of the Country of <hi>Aſſam,</hi> are another ſort of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious people, who worſhip a Cow, and conſequently never kill any of that kind. Their Temples are full of the Images of theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the greateſt part made of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:109000:91"/>
Gold and Silver, and ſome few of Braſs.</p>
            <p>About three Leagues diſtance from the place where our Veſſel lay, ſtood a Temple, which we pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged, and carried away one of theſe Golden Cows, which was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided amongſt us. It was no ſmall grief to theſe poor Pagans, to ſee their Divinity thus taken from them, and yet they ſold us Cows at a cheap rate, for we did not pay above two ſhillings for the beſt. What ſottiſhneſs, ſaid I, within my ſelf, are theſe people guilty of, to ſell their Gods; 'tis true, we were forced to promiſe, we would not kill 'em, but they knew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and when we blamed their ſilly humour, they demanded of us, whether the Chriſtians had none, and whether their actions anſwer'd the Religion they profeſſed.</p>
            <p>Our Veſſel lying at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Army, we knew but one part of what hapned there,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:109000:91"/>
and although we underſtood, they were in ill circumſtances, yet we could never have believed there dyed ſo many thouſands of Men, had not the River brought them to us. The Water became ſo infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, by the prodigious quantity of dead Bodies thrown therein, that ſeveral perſons periſhed by that means; wherefore, at length, we boyled the Water, before we uſed it.</p>
            <p>After three Months ſtay, the Water having been continually at that height, that 'twas impoſſible to come out of our Trenches, the Enemy believed we were ſtarved, and conſequently, that we might be eaſily defeated. In truth, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger preſſed us very ſorely, and the greateſt part of the Army were forced to kill the Camels, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, for their ſuſtenance. The Enemy, then, coming down, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt certain of the Victory; our General commanded, to let them
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:109000:92"/>
draw near, as if the whole Army had been dead; and in the mean time, made the Horſe to fetch a round, to hem them in: his ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem took effect, for as ſoon as they began to attack us, they were charged by our Horſe, and wholly defeated, leaving near twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dead in the place. There were not above ten Men wounded on our ſide, and ſince this skirmiſh, the Waters fell inſenſibly, ſo that we had order to be ready to give battel.</p>
            <p>Whilſt we were preparing, our General cauſed ſeveral Waggons to be laden with proviſion, and ſent them to the King of <hi>Aſſam,</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Meſſengers to tell him, he ſent him this preſent for his ſupply, in caſe he wanted it. For as for his own part, he had more than he needed for his Armys ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance this ſix Months. Our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's drift was to Allarm the King of <hi>Aſſam,</hi> who deſign'd at that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:109000:92"/>
time to retire to the Mountains, having loſt all hope of being able to reſiſt. This Prince underſtood the General's deſign; and ſaw well, this was a kind of Summons, to render himſelf at diſcretion; but he knew too well his Enemy, to expect any favour from him; and therefore choſe rather to ſend him word, that he loved himſelf too well to entruſt his perſon with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, but was willing to yield to any reaſonable terms. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer diſcovered the Enemy's weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the General who was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, that he had inſulted over him, within his Trenches, reſolved to make him repent it. He told his chief Officers then his reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to give Battel, which they all readily agreed to. Amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, there was one that ſpake thus, <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſays he, to the General, <hi>when we came into theſe parts firſt, we had four Armies, all in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and diſpoſition, whereas now we</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:109000:93"/>
               <hi>have not one that deſerves that name. The greatest part of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of theſe four Armies, being either dead, or in a ſick and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing condition. Why then do we not immediately march up to the Enemy? Shall we tarry till all our forces are ſpent? And will it not be more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for our Monarch, and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ſuch a Captain as you, to go and inſult over the Enemy, than to lye languiſhing here, where a longer ſtay cannot but be moſt ſhameful.</hi> The freedom with which this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſpake, had a good effect; for the General reſolved to follow his advice, in caſe the King of <hi>Aſſam</hi> refuſed to accept of the following conditions: To wit, that this Prince ſhould give the General half of his Kingdom, and the youngeſt of his Daughters for his Concubine; two thouſand Elephants, ſome Millions of ready Money, and his richeſt Veſſels full of excellent roots, with which that Countrey abounded,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:109000:93"/>
and which are of ineſtimable value. Although the General's Army was in very great diſtreſs, yet his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my accepted theſe conditions; and this unexpected Peace came very ſeaſonably, for 'tis certain that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Army was in a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Waters were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently fall'n, we haſtned to pack up our Baggage, being glad to leave this wretched poſt, for 'tis certain we were ſo tired, that had the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſet upon us, we could ſcarce been able to make reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>As for riches we wanted them not, having found good ſtore in Graves. It being this peoples cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, to Interr with their Dead, their beſt Apparel, Money, and greateſt part of their Servants; whom they bury alive, to bear their Maſters company. So far are theſe poor wretches from bemoaning their condition in this reſpect, that they are on the contrary, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:109000:94"/>
joyous, to follow their Maſters into a Countrey, where they hope in three days time to become great Perſonages, and enjoy certain plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which are not to be had here.</p>
            <p>Our General cauſed ſeveral of theſe Tombs to be opened, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were found vaſt Treaſures, which he carried away with him, but which he enjoyed but a ſmall time, for he died ſoon after; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtom of the great <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Empire, which is, that this Prince becomes Heir to all thoſe that dye in his Countreys, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of the General, which were to the value of four Millions, fell to this Monarch. And thus have I given you a Relation of what I ſaw in this War againſt the King of <hi>Aſſam;</hi> all which was written by a Phyſician of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> who was then in the ſervice of the great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Jemla,</hi> or the <hi>Emir</hi> (for
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:109000:94"/>
'tis thus they called our General) having ſignaliz'd himſelf in ſeveral Rencounters, and driven out <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Sujah</hi> (Brother to <hi>Auren Zeb)</hi> from the Kingdom of <hi>Bengala,</hi> he entreated the <hi>Mogol</hi> to ſend him his Wife and Children, to live with them, in a place he had choſen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from noiſe, and buſineſs, of which his great age rendred him uncapable. He imagined that this Prince (whoſe Throne he came now from ſettling, in ſubduing his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who diſturbed him in the poſſeſſion of the Empire) could not well refuſe him his demands. But he was miſtaken, for <hi>Auren Zeb</hi> was of a piercing judgment, and knew <hi>Jemla</hi> to be the Soldiers dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the Peoples Favourite. That he was a great Politician, a Wiſe and Valiant Captain, and the wealthieſt in all the Empire. He was ſenſible of his ambitious deſigns, and that he aſpired to ſet up his Son <hi>Mahomet Emirkin,</hi> on the Throne of <hi>Bengala.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:109000:95"/>
On the other ſide, he conſidered, 'twas dangerous to diſpleaſe ſuch a powerful Man; ſo that he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted him what he demanded, but created him alſo <hi>Mir-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l-Omrag,</hi> a dignity belonging only to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon in the Empire. Andas to his Son, he made him <hi>Bacchis,</hi> or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Horſe, a place of great conſequence, but which, requires him that poſſeſſes, never to ſtir out of the Court. No project could be more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for the hindering the deſigns of Prince <hi>Jemlar,</hi> for by this means he was parted from his Son, who could not be ſeparated from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under a fairer pretence, than by being tyed to the Court by ſo ſplendid an Office. <hi>Jemla</hi> well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Auren-Zeb</hi>'s deſign, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to deviſe a way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to avoid it, yielded to neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, expecting the change of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs would furniſh him with means, to have that by force which he could not obtain by ſubtilty. Theſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:109000:95"/>
two great Men were jealous of one another, and being in a manner e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually powerful, they mutually plyed each other with kindneſſes, whilſt both ſecretly endeavoured to ſtrengthen their parties. The year being paſſed over in Recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſſimulations, <hi>Auren-Zeb</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceived the <hi>Emir</hi> was not a Man to lye ſtill. He judged then, 'twere better to employ him abroad, than to give him time to trouble his Government; and therefore propoſed to the <hi>Emir,</hi> the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of that great expedition of which this latter had ſometime heretofore diſcourſed to him. Which was, to march againſt the <hi>Raja</hi> or King of <hi>Aſſam,</hi> whoſe Countrey lyes Northward off the Kingdom of <hi>Deka,</hi> which is near the Gulf of <hi>Bengala.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Emir</hi> had formerly mention'd it, to <hi>Auren-Zeb,</hi> who foreſeeing the honour, which would redound to him from his Conqueſts, objected, at firſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:109000:96"/>
difficulties, but afterwards, thought requiſit to embrace the motion, that he might thereby be rid of the <hi>Emir,</hi> and keep him em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. Although the <hi>Emir</hi> doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not his deſign, yet he obeyed without heſitating, and joyfully prepared himſelf for an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, by which, he was ſure to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh, and encreaſe his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He imbarked, then, with his Army, on a River, whoſe ſource a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes in that ſame Country, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about ſome ſixty Leagues Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, arrived at the Caſtle of <hi>Azo,</hi> which the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Acham</hi> had long ſince taken from the King of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala.</hi> The <hi>Emir</hi> attackt this place, and took it in fifteen days.</p>
            <p>He afterwards marched towards <hi>Chamdara,</hi> lying near the Country of <hi>Aſſam,</hi> where within a Month, he gave Battel to the King of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam,</hi> and worſted him. This Prince being vanquiſhed, withdrew into his chief City, called <hi>Guerguon)</hi> where
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:109000:96"/>
being followed by the <hi>Emir</hi> ſome five days after, he ſecured himſelf in the Mountains of <hi>Laſſa;</hi> and to render his eſcape more eaſie, left his treaſures behind him, with which the <hi>Emir</hi> augmented his: Theſe Mountains being unacceſſible to an Army, the <hi>Emir</hi> could not follow his Enemy; and whilſt he ſtudyed how to ſurprize him, the Seaſon of Rains came; during which, the whole Countrey is overflowed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Villages, which ſtand upon Hills. This Seaſon, which laſted three Months, hindered the <hi>Emir</hi>'s deſigns, the Waters keeping him from marching either back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or forwards. Moreover, the <hi>Raja</hi> had carried away all kinds of Proviſion, and reduced by this means the <hi>Emir</hi> into a ſtrange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. This Weather, and the incommodiouſneſs of the place, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving near ruined his whole Army. He thought of nothing, then, but how to get away, and in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:109000:97"/>
was ever and anon, ſet upon by his Enemies, who taking their advantage, encloſed whoſe Troops, in plains full of Mire, and ſlew them. Notwithſtanding theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, the <hi>Emir</hi> returned home in Triumph, laden with glory and ſpoils. His deſign was to return, and finiſh in the following year, the Conqueſt of this Kingdom, which the Caſtle of <hi>Azo</hi> (which they had cauſed to be well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified) retained, as it were, in a Bridle, and which was able to hold out a long time againſt the Forces of the <hi>Raja.</hi> But no ſooner was he returned to <hi>Bengala,</hi> but a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery deſtroyed the reſt of his Army, and himſelf alſo. And by this means <hi>Auren-Zeb</hi> had nothing to fear; who, as great a diſſembler as he was, could not forbear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his joy thereat. He told one day, the Son of the Deceaſed, in the preſence of his whole Court, that he had loſt a Father, and he
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:109000:97"/>
for his part, a moſt dreadful friend.</p>
            <p>Having been fifteen Months in the great <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Army, our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul obtained at length our diſcharge; whereupon we parted without At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, for all our Servants were dead. We came in fifteen days to <hi>Decka,</hi> where we ſaw the Veſſel our two Carpenters had built for the General. It carried 30 Guns, and they had order to begin ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, far larger.
