            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER that we had set out sail from Batavia's Rode, the 15.25. of Iuly, 1639. we have speedily performed our voyage (God be thanked) as farre as to the Baixos de Padua, which are very dangerous rockes and sands; but by the negligence of the Captains and Masters of the Pinaces, little Rotterdam and David, (which were sent out before to cast out every houre the lead) we were led wi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the whole Fleet towards the said rockes; insomuch that our Commander, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out by day, upon the bank behinde the Gallerie, perceived a great alteration of the water; wherefore he charged his Pilot to cast out the lead; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done, found first of all fourteene, afterwards nine, and at last six fadomes of water, that we could see some of the rockes lie under water. The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perceiving this, made three or foure shots, to give warning to the Fleet, and that the Pinnaces should
<pb facs="tcp:27051:3"/>
come backe againe: And thus sailed back again from thence, as they came thither, thanking God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for his gracious keeping and protection. From thence we set our course towards the Malabaerish coasts; which having got in sight, about Cananor, and Mont Fremosa, we sailed along the wall; where, in divers tides, we met with two small Vessells of Black-moores, but they had free passe of the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>Barent Pieters,</hi> one whereof was bound for Cananor, &amp; the other for Calicut, which advertised us, that Daman and Dieu, being two strong Forts, and belonging to the Portugals, were besieged by the great Mogoll, and they beleeved that Daman was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered alreadie.</p>
            <p>After that the foresaid Vessels had departed from our Commander, we went on again in our voiage, and the 18.28. of September, about evening, came in sight of us about Goas Bare, the Pinnaces Armuyen and Valkenburg, which at night came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord of the Admirall, relating unto him the newes, which they had received upon Wingurla; because they had arrived upon Wingurla about eleven or twelve daies before our comming. The next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Commander calling together the generall Counsell, communicated unto them that same, what he had understood by the Principalls of the aforesaid Pinnaces; namely that three Gallions lay in the Bay
<pb facs="tcp:27051:3"/>
of Goa Veille, under favour and safeguard of the Fort Mormagon, being not yet readie to go to sea &amp; fight. Further, he desired the Councell to consider upon, what was best to do for the good and profit of the Companie. After manie disputations and consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Councell departed againe from aboord in the evening, with order, that when the Commander, two or three houres before day light, did light againe a candle, they, together with the militarie Officers, should come aboord againe of the Admirall. Having met together again, they unanimouslie resolved to surprize the enemie without delay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he lay with the Gallions under the protection and favour of the Fort Mormagon, the greatest difficultie was, that we knew not the depth or situation of the harbour: wherefore order was given, that the Pinnace David should betake it self to the right, and the Pinnace little <unclear>Rotterdam</unclear> to the left hand, saile forward, and cast continually out the lead: Having come close to the walls, some boats were set out to cast out the lead continually in like manner, and to give warning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</p>
            <p>Afterwards order was given, that the ship Zierick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea should saile out before: upon which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander himselfe went: him followed Armuyen, Valckenburg, Franiker, Bredamme, and the ships New Harlem, and Middelburg, should come as nigh
<pb facs="tcp:27051:4"/>
as possibly they could; because the enemie lay so close under the wall, and the depth of the harbour was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known unto us; and the said ships drew so deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and had also in them the Cargozoen for Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurla.</p>
            <p>In this order about noon, with the sea winde, we sailed towards the enemie (being under sail, the Vice-commander <hi>William Tiberius,</hi> who died the same mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was set without the ship) having come under the Fort, they shot most fiercely out of the Fort, upon the Fleet: but we answered them in like manner. Seeing those of the Fort verie perplext, and timerous, (because we were not above a Musket shot from the Fort) we sailed to and fro along a wall or trench, which was drawn towards another small Bulwark, from whence they made likewise some shots. Being come neere unto the ships, we found them to be the three great Gallions; namely, Bon Iesus, Bon Ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, and S. Sebastian: Bon Ventura lay ready for to fight, but not readie for sailing: The other two had none or few Canons in them, lying yet without car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, because they expected us not so soon: yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards we heard, that many free men, together with some voluntiers, came out of Goa to affoord their aid and helpe in the making ready of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Gallions, thinking to come out against the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces Armuyen and Valkenburg, which they had
<pb facs="tcp:27051:4"/>
first perceived, but missed of it.</p>
            <p>Zierick-sea sailing out before, passed by the Forts; and the ships Armuyen and Valckenburg in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The Commander with his boat departing from the ship Zierick-sea, gave order, that Franiker and Bredamme should make towards the Gallion, Bon Ventura carrying about 80. brasse pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, let their Anchors fall; from which Gallion they shot fiercely upon us, having come on the side of him, and being not halfe a Musket shot from it, they shot crosse thorow and thorow our Pinnace, that it looked like a window where the glasses are beaten out: And thus we continued above three hours long, shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against the said Gallion; insomuch that the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace Franiker received more shots then the whole Fleet together: All the Row horses, and pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the sterne were shot in pieces; insomuch that we could not make one shot more from the sterne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the enemy, what care soever I tooke, and what encouragement soever I gave to the remainder of our men (because I my selfe in person went continually to and fro, and the shipper was upon the deckes) for we had in that Pinnace about 20 men kild, and about 40 wounded; insomuch that after the fight, we had not men to man the boat: whereupon presently afterwards were sent unto us to aid us, 20 men from other ships. Amongst the dead were divers of our Officers; as namely, the upper Pilot, high boats-man, the Cooke,
<pb facs="tcp:27051:5"/>
the Cookes mate, Gunners mate, one or two Quarter masters: and all the other officers for the most part, wounded: Our shipper was hurt in his belly, in the head, and in one of his hands; but God be thanked) he hath recovered, and is now well againe; I scaped free with a blew blow, and some other small hurts, I cannot give sufficient thankes unto God Almightie for his gracious protection and keeping. Bredamme next to us received the most shots, the shipper <hi>Iohn Symons Symein</hi> was in the first beginning kild with a shot tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row his body.</p>
            <p>Yet after this bloudy fight God Almighty by his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious help and assistance granted unto us the victory, unto whom is due all glory, praise, and thanksgiving now and for evermore.</p>
            <p>The Pinnace little Rotterdam, whilst we were shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against Bon Ventura, laid aboord the Gallion Bon Iesus, which lay before Bon Ventura, mastered the same, and set up the Princes Flagges; because very few men were in her. Our Commander seeing this, went into the Gallion called Bon Iesus, and called to the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals in Bon Ventura, that they should have good quarter, if they would yeeld: whereunto they, as stout souldiers, would not condiscend nor heare of it upon no termes, but answered the Commander, that he should do his best: Whereupon our Commander gave order, that the Cable of Bon Iesus should be chopt off, which drove directly to the belly of Bon Ventura, so that his
<pb facs="tcp:27051:5"/>
blind mast turned crosse our Bon Iesus. The Admirall asking them the second time, whether they would yeeld, or else he would fire them both; namely, Bon Iesus, and Bon Ventura. Whereupon they answered, that they would not yeeld: whereupon the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der gave order, that Bon Ventura and Bon Iesus should be set on fire; notwithstanding they desisted not with their fierce shooting, till at last the fire got into the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r Gun-powder, and was blown up. Bon Iesus after that it was on fire, drove a little off from the other.</p>
            <p>Whist all this passed, the Gallion Saint Sebastian was likewise fired by the ship Armuyen: so that all three together at once were on fire, without the losse of any of our Pinnaces or ships, that the Generall and Councell of India had ordained the Pinnaces, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damme, little Roterdam and David for fire ships.</p>
            <p>I am of opinion, if we should have laine with the Pinnace Franiker twenty paces neerer to the Gallion, it would likewise have been in danger to be blowne up, because our fore-mast, and some ropes were likewise blowne up into the aire; all our ropes and cords are spoiled, tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they hung like cut yarne.</p>
            <p>After that Bon Ventura was blown up, some boats have been in the Ferry-water, to knocke the Portugals in the head that lay in the water: yet after that they had kild some of them, our Commander bid them to give quarter; insomuch that we got prisoners above 100 men, about 50 white, and 50 Negroes, amongst which
<pb facs="tcp:27051:6"/>
were two or three Priests, and four Lords of the Crosse, or Fedalges: the Captaine of the Gallion was likewise taken up: our Commander entertaines the said Lords and Patres at his owne table in the Cabinet.</p>
            <p>At night we tooke up again our Anchors, and sailed againe out of the Bay close under the Fort Mormagon, out of which divers shots were made, because they could very well see us by the flame of the burning Gallions: yet at last we got out of their shot, and cast Anchor within two or three leagues of the wall.</p>
            <p>The upper Merchant, <hi>Peter Bad-neighbour</hi> is chosen by the Councell Vice-commander in place of the deceased <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second of October, new stile, sailing towards Wingurla, we met two saile of ships, after which we pursued with the whole Fleet; but being our ships were so battered and spoyled, we were faine to desist from pursuing any further after them; and order was given that we should goe with the Pinnace Franiker to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Wingurla; where we arrived the fourth of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Afterwards came newes that the Pinnace Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damme had driven a small vessell to the wall; out of which the Portugals fled and made the vessell to leake: yet the Bredammes boat comming in haste to it, got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and kept it above water with pumping, till all the goods, consisting of Ivorie, or Elephants teeth, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goods, were taken out of it, which were brought
<pb facs="tcp:27051:6"/>
aboord of the Commanders ship. Another Gallion was pursued after the 2.12. of October, by the Pinnace Armuyen, which the same night overtooke the Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and after that our Pinnace had fought a good while with it, it gave the slip againe, and escaped. By nine prisoners taken by the Pinnace Armuyen with the boat of the said Gallion, we understand, that it had in her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 80 dead, but was manned with above 400 men, being the Gallion which went last yeare towards Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: The other vessel that was chased to the wall, came out of Mosambique. The 10.20. of October the ships Middelburg, Armuyen and Bredamme, received order to go towards <unclear>Cotcheyn</unclear> to crosse there, and to lie in wait for the enemies vessels, which by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent might passe by Goa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Vice-roy within Goa, is departed out of this life; in whose place by election, succeeds <hi>Don Antonio Teles,</hi> who last yeare was Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the enemies Fleet The said Vice-roy reports, that hee will come with all his Fregats about 60 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to visit us, which we long to see.</p>

together with all the Hollanders, and some of the chiefest Merchants; for the execution whereof, hee should be rewarded with eleven or twelve thousand Pageden, who ended his life as followeth: The afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Mogoller, with a traine of 25 persons, comming into Wingurla himselfe, together with another Mogol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, sitting on horse-back, came before the lodging of the great Governour <hi>Mameth Radia,</hi> who, at that time, was come to Wingurla to view his Fregats: The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goller asking for him, was answered by the Mameths servants, that he lay and slept. At which the Mogoller replied, that he himselfe must see it; who going with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother towards his chamber, (because hee was well knowne, and had been alwayes very familiar with the Governour) opened the curtains, and found him play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his childe. The Mogoller drawing his Sable, chopt off one of his hands, thinking to turne off the blow with it, as also gave him a great wound in the neck; insomuch that he presently after died: From thence the Mogoller rode towards the lodging, to massacre the Netherlanders; he was twice beaten backe from the moat: In the mean time an Alarme rose amongst the Governours people, which flockt together about foure hundred strong, kild fifteen or sixteen of the Mogol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers men, took prisoners three or foure. The Mogol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler betook himselfe to flight; after whom they pursued with their naked Sables: whereupon the said Mogoller

leaping with his horse into the water, thinking to swim over the river, was seen by some of the Governours servants, which were in a house not farre from the shore; they seeing their fellow-souldiers run with their naked Sables after him, stopt him, and shot him with a peece down from the horse, the rest gave him many cuts and blowes after he was dead.</p>
