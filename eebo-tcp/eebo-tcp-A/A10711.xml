            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To diſcouer them therefore, to thoſe that haue any liſt to eſchue them, I haue compoſed this looking Glaſſe, which I haue fronted in the forehead with the title of <hi>My Ladies Looking Glaſſe.</hi> Not that it is any thing leſſe behoouefull for my Lord, than it is for my Lady to looke in; for although women doe vſe their looking glaſſes, but to eſpie the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of their bodily beautie, yet this looking Glaſſe is

            <p>I might here indeauour your Ladiſhips further praiſes, and that without either fraud or flatterie, but as the vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full painter, that would take vpon him the draught of ſome rare perfection that were more then ordinary, how well ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he might be furniſhed with colours, yet wanting art, he might rather blemiſh than grace the worke he tooke in hand: I will therefore here ſtay my ſelfe, beſeeching your Ladiſhip to pardon his bold preſumption, that will reſt to doe you ſeruice during life,</p>

            <p>But they onely denounced againſt the letting of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and they did it no doubt but according to the rule of Gods word, for the lending of mony to vſe is directly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by Gods owne mouth, and therefore ſinne; but the inconuenience that I do finde is this, <hi>Vſury</hi> is reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,<note place="margin">Vſury repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but not truely defined</note> but it is not defined but according to the letter, whereupon the great <hi>Vſurers</hi> indeed, that do thinke that in their trade of buying, and ſelling, the gaine of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds for an other a great deale too little, and that howſoeuer they can defraud or exact by bargaining, they do thinke themſelues to be very honeſt and true dealing men; and that this prohibition: <hi>Thou ſhalt not put thy mony to vſury,</hi> doth nothing at all concerne them; and as they ſuppoſe, it ſtretcheth no further then to the lending of mony, when many great <hi>Diuines</hi> haue giuen their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that as in that petition <hi>giue vs this day our daily bread:</hi> all our other neceſſaries are there comprehended; ſo in thoſe wordes, <hi>Thou ſhalt not giue thy mony to vſurie:</hi> all other exceſſiue gaine, is likewiſe included.</p>
            <p>To this agreeth the opinion of that ancient Father <hi>Saynt Hierome,</hi> who writing vpon the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>

What ſhould I need to bring any further teſtimony in this caſe, when there is no learned <hi>Diuine</hi> that did euer deny it?

And who will be more ready to exclaime againſt vſury then he that is himſelfe the greateſt vſurer?</p>
            <p>Vſury needs no more but the bare name to make it hatefull: the <hi>Ribauld,</hi> the <hi>Robber,</hi> the <hi>Theefe,</hi> the <hi>Murtherer,</hi> the <hi>Drunkard,</hi> the <hi>Whore-maſter,</hi> the <hi>Swearer,</hi> the <hi>Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> they all cry out againſt vſury; they that are of nore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will yet pleade religion, and bitterly raile at him, that lendeth mony to vſe: he that hath no conſcience at all, will yet pretend a conſcience, and wil exclaime againſt the vſurer: when if he did but looke into his owne impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or if his owne faules were written in his forehead, he might pulle his cap ouer his browes as low as his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: but whileſt they would bereaue the vſurer of his intereſt, they themſelues would robbe him of his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall.</p>
            <p>I would not haue any man to thinke that what I haue formerly ſpoken is in the defence of vſury, that I know at all times, in all places and by all good men, hath euer bin condemned.</p>
            <p>I am now come to figure forth a ſinne that in a certain kinde hath ſome affinity with vſury, and that is that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous<note place="margin">Of Murther.</note> ſinne of <hi>Murther:</hi> for as he that in bargianing, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; ſelling, can by any fraudulent or deceitful meanes, circumuent, or ſo ouer reach his neighbour to make him pay for a commodity three times more in value then it is worth, yet this he accounteth to be no vſury, nor any manner of cracke to his credit or reputation; but doth thinke it to be Merchant-like, or Tradſeman-like tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffique,

               <note place="margin">Of Murther as it is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Chriſt.</note> When the <hi>High Prieſts</hi> by ſubtilty brought Chriſt to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and by falſe accuſations procured his death, they thought themſelues to be cleane and pure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pilate</hi> againe, when he had deliuered Chriſt to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, waſhed his hands, and pronounced himſelfe to be innocent: but our Sauiour Chriſt in the fift of Mathew, hath there determined the matter, both what <hi>Murther</hi> is; &amp; who is a <hi>Murtherer;</hi> his words be theſe: Ye haue heard how that it was ſaid, to them of old time, kill not, for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer killeth ſhall be in danger of iudgment. But I ſay vnto you, whoſoeuer is angry with his brother ſhall be in danger of iudgment; and whoſoeuer ſaieth to his brother <hi>Racha,</hi> ſhall be in danger of councell, but whoſoeuer ſaieth to his brother, thou <hi>Foole,</hi> ſhall be in danger of <hi>Hell fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Phariſies</hi> that had corrupted the Scriptures with their falſe gloſſes, interpreted this place: he that ſlayeth ſhall be guilty or in danger of iudgment, that is to ſay, if a man commit a <hi>Murther,</hi> his act is ynough to teſtifye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, there needs no more but to pronounce the ſentence of death: this text did the <hi>Phariſies</hi> extend no further then to kill with the hand, or to murther by ſtroke or dent of weapon; but our Sauiour Chriſt reſtoring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the true ſence, auowed flatly, that a man to be angry<note place="margin">VVho be murtherers by Gods Law</note> with his brother, is to murther him, and deſerueth death, for the Law is not ſo much reſpecting to the hand, as to the heart.</p>
            <p>But this is a hard ſaying ſaith the malicious, but yet a true ſaying, as <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> in his firſt <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> &amp; 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmeth, <hi>that he that hateth his brother is a Murtherer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now actuall <hi>Murther</hi> indeed findeth friends, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16379:21"/>
to kill a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though ſometimes cowardly, it is rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for Man-hood, then for <hi>Murther,</hi> or will be found but Man-ſlaughter or Chance-medly: and there be that<note place="margin">Cowardly Murtherers.</note> can tell how to murther a man with a <hi>Pinne,</hi> better then they know how to do with a <hi>Pyke,</hi> and dare aduenture to murther him with a word, that they neuer durſt looke in the face with a ſword; but theſe ſorts of <hi>Murtherers</hi> are not to be taxed, when murther in former ages hath beene knowne ſometimes to ſit roabed in Scarlet, and when<note place="margin">Cruell Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers</note> hiſtories do make mention of ſome mercileſſe <hi>Magiſtrats,</hi> that hath murthered more poore ſuiters with their Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh anſwers, then the <hi>Hangman</hi> of <hi>London</hi> did euer ſtrangle with his Hempen halter.</p>
            <p>To conclude, as amongſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurers,</hi> thoſe that do offend by the letting out of mony, are the feweſt in number, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>Murtherers,</hi> the number is farre more greater of thoſe that doth both ſlay and ſlaughter by their merciles cruelty, then are the other that do moſt bloudily commit murther with their hands.</p>

            <p>He that ſhould now ſpeake againſt the <hi>pride</hi> of the time, where ſhould he be able to ſhew his face, but that both men and women, would be ready to worrow him? <hi>whoredome</hi> and <hi>adultery,</hi> hath ſo many friends to ſupport them, ſo many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites to vphold them, ſo many of all ſorts, both old and yong, rich and poore: that doth delight &amp; follow the game, that he that ſhould but open his lips to reprehend it, the whole rablement of <hi>whoremaſters, harlots, bawdes, panders,</hi> and ſuch vicious liuers, they would ſay he were <hi>a criticke, a ſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, a preciſian, a puritane,</hi> or a counterfeit <hi>hipocrite,</hi> but they would not mend their liues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Drunkenneſſe</hi> againe is growne into that generalitie that he is not accounted to be an honeſt man that will not bee
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16379:40"/>
drunken for good fellowſhip, but amongſt <hi>drunkards</hi> that be of diuerſe kindes, I hold thoſe to bee more dangerous ill, that are drunken with vanitie, then thoſe other that are drunken with wine; for the one, two houres ſleepe may reſtore him againe to the vſe of his ſenſes: but the other, many houres, daies, monethes nor yeares may ſuffice to make him to looke into his owne folly. Amongſt theſe I commend me to the drunken <hi>Tobacconiſts,</hi> that doth beſot themſelues in their owne conceits, attributing that ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty to a ſtinking Indian weede, that if they were not enemies to their owne diſcretions, daily experience would teach them that their exceſſiue ſucking at their <hi>Tobacco pipe,</hi> is but a flat mockery; and would make that <hi>fauorite,</hi> that doth thinke himſelfe moſt wiſe to defend it, to confeſſe his owne ignorance: neither can there be a ſtronger argument to proue it meere vanitie indeed, then to ſee it ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by ſo many vaine men, that doth ſo much dote and are ſo farre in loue with it, that ſome of them are more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him that doth but ſpeak againſt their <hi>Tobacco,</hi> then they would be with him that ſhould take exceptions at the ſhalowneſſe of their wit.</p>
            <p>But hee that weares a ſiluer or a golden <hi>Mine</hi> on his backe, there is no queſtion to be made, neither of his wit nor of his honeſty: he may praiſe or diſpraiſe, how or what he liſt, he is priuiledged, and he hath a parcell of ſcripture to avow in his owne behalfe, <hi>Dixit inſipiens,</hi> Pſal. 14.</p>
            <p>By this it may appeare, <hi>Sinne</hi> is growne to that ſtatelines of <hi>Pride,</hi> that ſhee will not be controld. If we ſpeake againſt ſinne, we muſt doe it liſpingly, wee muſt not ſpeake it out too bitterly: but the follies of this age muſt bee ſeaſoned with ſugar, they muſt be made ſweete; but thoſe ſinnes that do ſeeme ſweete in the committing, will be found as bitter, when without repentance they come to be accounted for.</p>

like old feſtered ſoores, that are not to bee cured but with biting <hi>coroſiues;</hi> we can not therefore too bitterly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them. We are become like naturall beaſts that do bring all things to triall but by the ſenſes; but if we could carry them to the inquiſition of the ſoule, we ſhould finde it a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iudgement of <hi>God,</hi> for men to be giuen vp ſo much to their owne luſts, to haue no ſenſe nor feeling of their ſinne: he that hath this hardneſſe of heart, that he neither feeleth his owne ſinne, nor will not be told of it by another, he is no more of the race of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was aſhamed of himſelfe, but of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao,</hi> who hardened his owne heart, and whoſe heart <hi>God</hi> did harden.</p>
            <p>If the head doth but a little ake, our <hi>vrins</hi> muſt knocke at the <hi>Phiſitions</hi> doore, and alas how inquiſitiue we be about the ſtate of our bodies? but let our conſciences cry out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime how they liſt, our ſickly famiſhed ſoules are neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, we are ſo farre in loue with our ſinnes, that wee care not for the loſing of our ſoules.</p>
            <p>Are theſe the works that faith affordeth, is this the life that <hi>God</hi> requireth? we goe to <hi>Church</hi> (indeed) and we ſay, to ſeeke the <hi>Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but we do not ſeeke him as if we ment to finde him, wee ſeeke him not with humble and penitent heart, but with proud and preſumptuous ſpirits, decking and pranking vp our ſelues with thoſe gawdy and vngodly attires as are more liker to poiſon our praiers then to profit our ſoules, better fitting indeed for a <hi>Brothell houſe,</hi> then for the <hi>houſe of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We goe to <hi>Church,</hi> rather to ſhow our pompe and our <hi>pride,</hi> then with any zealous intent, to ſerue our <hi>God</hi> as we ſhould do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>We goe to the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Iudas</hi> went to the <hi>Supper</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> we returne home in a worſe caſe then when we firſt went thither.</p>
            <p>With what faces can we make ſhow to profeſſe the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when we be ſo giuen vp to that monſtrous pride, that we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſire to follow our owne voluptuous pleaſures, then to ſerue <hi>God?</hi> the world doth ſee it, our conſciences doth witneſſe it, neither can we denie it.</p>
            <p>They will make ſhow by their ſpeeches, as if they could not indure that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be diſhonoured: but looke vpon their

actions, their <hi>pride,</hi> their <hi>vanity,</hi> their <hi>drunkenneſſe,</hi> their <hi>exceſſe;</hi> and they doe ſhew them plainly what they are: and he that ſhould iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the rules of holy ſcriptures, might boldly pronounce them to be farre from euerlaſting life: our Sauiour Chriſt hath confidently avowed: <hi>The vnrighteous ſhall not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the kingdome of heauen:</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1. Cor. 6. <hi>Be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, neither fornicator, neither adulterer, nor drunkard, nor idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let them flatter themſelues therefore how they liſt, they are in a dangerous plight, &amp; we cannot be too plaine to put them from that vaine hope that thus deludeth them, that will euery day pollute themſelues with theſe abhominations, &amp; yet will truſt or hope for ſaluation, they thinke it time ſoone ynough to repent, when their <hi>climacterical</hi> yeare is paſt, &amp; then if they haue but time to ſay, <hi>Lord haue mercy vpon vs,</hi> and for their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors to giue penny dole when they bee dead, it wil ſerue for a <hi>quietus eſt,</hi> for all their ſins forepaſſed: they may perhaps ſometime dreame of a dying time, and it is but a dreame, for being not throughly reſolued, that this time draweth euery day neerer then other, they neuer prepare themſelues againſt the time, but are many times taken ſuddenly in the fulneſſe of their filthineſſe, and in the very prime, when they be acting of the abhominations.</p>
            <p>I haue little hope therefore to reforme thoſe by my writing, whom the thundring voyce of Gods word pronounced euery day by the <hi>Preacher,</hi> can neither conforme, nor any thing at all terrifye: I know I ſhall rather procure hatred, for ſpeaking truth, then win loue for wiſhing well: but I little feare the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterat</hi> cenſure of a ſenceles multitude; the wicked are like an <hi>Ocean,</hi> that cannot reſt from raging: and a madneſſe for him that will run amongſt thornes, and thinke ſcorne to be prickt; let them then rage &amp; raile as they liſt, he that is throughly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled and compoſed in himſelfe, moues in ſo high an <hi>Orbe,</hi> and at ſo far a diſtant from the malicious and ill diſpoſed, that their vnſauoury belchings can neuer annoy him. It ſufficeth me that I maske in the true ſimplicities, of a loyall honeſty, my conſcience bearing me witnes, I haue ſpoken thoſe truths, that I am in nothing more agrieued, then in that they are too true.</p>
