            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VINDICATION
OF
A Passage in Dr. Sherlock's Sermon,
&amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHen I first saw that Pamphlet, which bears
the Title of, <hi>A Remonstrance, by way of
Address from the Church of</hi> England, <hi>to
both Houses of Parliament, with some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
upon Dr.</hi> Sherlock's <hi>Sermon,</hi> I was
not so curious to examine the Contents of that Paper, as to
see what he had to say against that Sermon, which received so
great an Approbation from the House of Commons; and
turning over the Page, I was soon directed by the Margin to
the place; where I find these words prickt out for the subject
of his Remarks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I deny not, but some, who are Papists, in some junctures of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
may and have been very Loyal; but I am sure the Popish
Religion is not; the English-man may be Loyal, but not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist;
and yet there can be no security of those mens Loyalty,
whose Religion in any case teaches them to Rebel.</hi> Now this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Address from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is so well
acquainted with Popish Loyalty, any one would in reason
have expected, that the Doctor should have received a Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for touching that Cause so gently; and in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50187:3"/>
had any one attacked him there, he would have
found more trouble, and been put to more shifts, in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Personal Loyalty of Papists, than in proving that the
Popish Religion does not teach Loyalty: which is the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
brought against him by the Author of this <hi>Remonstrance;</hi>
that he charges the Popish Religion with being Disloyal,
though some who are Papists may be Loyal. And I should
have wondered at the discretion of this Writer (had he given
any Specimen of Wit or Understanding in any thing else) that
he would engage in so baffled a Cause. The better way had
been to have thanked the Doctor for his Complement, and
to have left the Doctrine of their Church to have shifted for
itself.</p>
            <p>But I confess, I have so great a kindness for the Doctor, that
I am unwilling he should continue under so scandalous an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
of having charged the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with any
Doctrines which she dishowns, which had at all times been
very wicked, but at this time had been folly and madness;
and therefore not to enter into the Merits of the Cause, which
this Writer has given no just occasion for, I shall onely very
briefly consider, what he urges in vindication of the Popish
Loyalty.</p>
            <p>The first Argument he uses to prove, that their
Religion does not teach them to Rebel,<note place="margin">Remonst. <hi>p.</hi> 2.</note> is because
they themselves (though they are very zealous for
their Religion) deny that it does. <hi>Do both in their publick
Writings and private Discourses, declare and maintain, that
their Religion teaches no such Doctrine, and that they are ready
to maintain and practise true Loyalty, with the hazard of their
Lives and Fortunes.</hi> As for their practising true Loyalty, I
shall civilly wave that, because the Doctor has thought fit to
do so, and therefore it is no Argument against him; for it is
no new thing for men to act contrary to the Principles of their
Religion, and sometimes to be better than their Religion in its
just consequences teaches them to be, as I charitably hope
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50187:3"/>
many Roman Catholicks are. But who are these men, and
what is their Authority, who teach, that the Deposing Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Kings, or those who are Favourers of Hereticks, is no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> I say, the <hi>Deposing Doctrine;</hi>
for I grant, they do not teach Rebellion by that name: for
when a Prince is deposed by the Authority of their Church,
they absolve their Subjects from their Fealty, <hi>and then it is
no Rebellion to Rebel.</hi> And I wish our Author had not some
such reserve in those doubtful terms, <hi>Rebelling</hi> and <hi>True Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty:</hi>
for to resist and dethrown a deposed Prince, is not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi>
according to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> nor
to defend him, <hi>True Loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But does this Gentleman think, we have no other way of
knowing the Doctrine of their Church, but by what they
say, is the Doctrine of their Church? Suppose some of these
Sayers be so ignorant, that they know not what is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of their Church; some so crafty, as to conceal it;
some so heretical as to deny it, and to be censured, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
for it at <hi>Rome;</hi> what does their saying so or so
signifie to us? who have the authentick Decrees of their Popes
and Councils. They are very angry with us, when we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
the Testimonies of their private Doctors, though of
the greatest Note and Eminency among them, whose Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
have been published with the greatest Authority, and
received with the greatest Applause, and yet they have the
modesty to send us to an Irish Remonstrance, and the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of <hi>P. W.</hi> or to the renowned Author of the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Principles, to learn the Doctrine of the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> admirable Vouchers for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> some of
whom at least are no better than Apostates themselves, and
are condemned for such at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppose we should be perswaded by the Authority and
Rhetorick of this Author, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not
teach the Deposing Doctrine, and should assert it against all
the Jesuits in the World, and one of them should answer in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50187:4"/>
the very words of this Remonstrance. <hi>What reason has any man
to say, that our Religion does not teach us to Rebel</hi> (that is to
Depose and Murder Heretical Princes) <hi>when we who are so jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of our Religion, that we voluntarily suffer the loss of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
our Liberties, and our Lives, rather than renounce the
least tittle of it; do both in our publick Writings and private
Discourses, declare and maintain that our Religion does teach the
Deposing Doctrine, and that we are ready to maintain and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
it with the hazard of our Lives and Fortunes?</hi> What a
fine case are we in now! when the Doctrine and Practice of
the Jesuits proves, that the Deposing Doctrine is the Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Doctrine and Practice (says
our Author) of some other nameless Party proves, that it is not
the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and yet I see no reason,
why the Jesuits may not pass for as good <hi>Catholicks</hi> as any other
Order amongst them, nor why <hi>Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and
<hi>Suarez,</hi> &amp;c. may not be thought as good Catholick Doctors,
as some few late Writers. This Argument then will prove
nothing because it proves both parts of a contradiction to be
true, that the Deposing Doctrine is, and is not, the Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had he ingenuously acknowledged, that the Deposing
Doctrine had been decreed and practised by their Popes and
General Councils, that no Pope or Council since <hi>Gregory</hi> the
Seventh had ever condemned it, that the Jesuits do still main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, and yet in the late Censure of some other Jesuitical
Doctrines, the present Pope thought fit to let the Deposing
Doctrine escape without censure; but notwithstanding this,
they did utterly disown it, and would do so, though they
knew the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had defined it, or ever hereafter
should do so, this had been something to the purpose to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
both Prince and People of their Loyalty. But to say,
that this is not the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
all mankind, who have eyes in their heads, and skill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to read the Decrees of their Popes and Councils; and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50187:4"/>
to found their Loyalty upon this supposition, that the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Doctrine is not the Doctrine of the Church, gives too
great a suspicion that if this were the Doctrine of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> or ever should be so, or they should ever be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that is so, then they would be for the deposing of Princes
too; and whatever some little inferiour People in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> think of these matters, while
the governing part of the Church believes otherwise, as they
certainly do at this day, (if the Pope and his Adherents are
the governing part) Princes have no security, that Popes
will not challenge and exercise this authority, but their want
of power to do it; and this, I am sure, is wholly owing to
the Reformation: for till Princes had Subjects who valued
not the Popes authority, they themselves were the Popes
Vassals, and must necessarily be so again, could they extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
this pestilent Heresie, the great fault of which is, that
it has given strength and security to Princes, by weakening
the Pope.</p>
            <p>But our Author proceeds: <hi>'Tis true, some persons in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with</hi> Rome <hi>have broached Tenents inconsistent with Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty;
but 'tis true likewise, their Books have been condemned
and burnt (as they often tell us) by the publick Executioner.</hi>
It is true indeed, <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Book <hi>de Rege &amp; Regis institutione,
Suarez defensio fid. Cath. &amp; Sanctarellus Tractatus de Haeresi,</hi>
and it may be some others, were condemned to be burnt by
the Parliament at <hi>Paris;</hi> but no thanks to the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> for this, who never condemned these Doctrines. It is
said indeed, that <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Book was censured by the Pope;
and it is true, the Pope did censure one of his Books, as we
learn from <hi>Alegambe in Biblioth. Script. Societ. Jesu,</hi> p. 258.
but not that <hi>de Rege</hi> which was burnt at <hi>Paris:</hi> And as for
<hi>Sanctarellus,</hi> his Book was printed at <hi>Rome</hi> by the express al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of <hi>Vitellescus</hi> the General of the <hi>Jesuits;</hi> and when
the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> took great offence at it, and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some of the Jesuits what they thought of it, Father <hi>Coton</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50187:5"/>
answered, that they disliked it. And being farther asked,
how they could disapprove what their General allowed, he
replied, That their General being at <hi>Rome,</hi> could do no less.
Upon this they enquire what they would do, if they were at
<hi>Rome;</hi> the Jesuit frankly answered, They should think as
they do at <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Gramondus</hi> relates. And how this proves
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is such an Enemy to the Deposing
and King-killing Doctrine, I cannot tell: for it seems, that
those who upon some prudent considerations may condemn
such Doctrines at <hi>Paris</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> may prove good Catholicks
at <hi>Rome,</hi> such influence has a different Climate upon some
mens Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he addes,</hi> The Roman Catholicks do frequently declare,
that it is an Article of Faith in their Church, and expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> that the King-killing, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
or Murder of Princes Excommunicated for Heresie, is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and Heretical, as being contrary to the known Laws of God
and Nature.</p>
            <p>But whatever the Roman Catholicks declare (which we
have but one nameless Author's word for, the
Author of the Roman Catholick Principles,<note place="margin">Roman Cathol. principles, <hi>p.</hi> 6.</note> who
yet assignes this as the chief reason, <hi>why many

be killed by any of his Vassals and Subjects

So that the Council condemns the killing of a Tyrant, not

of a Heretick; and the killing of a Tyrant who is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and deposed, not of one who is excommunicated for
Heresie. And that last clause, <hi>without expecting the Sentence

it, but may be a very lawful and meritorious act, to kill such
Princes as are deposed by superiour Judges, that is, by the Pope
or Council, which is the onely Authority that ever pretended

fitting, even by taking and imprisoning their Persons, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon them any corporal Punishments with which Hereticks use
to be punished, according to the Canonical Sanctions. <hi>This is the
Council, which our Author tells us expresly declares, that the
King-killing Doctrine or Murder of Princes excommunicated
for Heresie, is damnable and heretical, as being contrary to the
known Laws of God and Nature; and yet for ought I can
perceive by this Bull, the greatest Emperour in the world, if
he be a Heretick, or a Favourer of Hereticks, if the Pope have
as much power as authority, may be burnt, as</hi> John Huss, <hi>and</hi>
Ierom <hi>of</hi> Prague, <hi>were by this Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The account of that Article, <hi>Quilibet Tyrannus,</hi> in short is
this: The Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had caused <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>
to be murdered; <hi>Johannes Parvus</hi> a Divine of <hi>Paris,</hi> to justifie
this action, defended that Proposition, That a Tyrant might
be killed by any of his Subjects, without expecting the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
or Command of any Judge; which
<hi>Mariana</hi> asserts to be certainly true,<note place="margin">Richerius Hist. Conc. Gener. part 2. <hi>p.</hi> 162.</note> and that
the onely difficulty is to know, who is a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
So that this is a true Commonwealth-Principle, like
the seventeenth Article of <hi>John Wickleff,</hi> which was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
also in this Council; <hi>Populares possunt ad suum arbitrium
dominos delinquentes corrigere.</hi> The people may correct their
Lords or Governours, when they do amiss, according to their
own will and pleasure. And this I grant is not the Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which reserves this power wholly to
it self, though it has been defended by many Jesuits, such as
<hi>Mariana</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> from whence our late Rebels learnt their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50187:7"/>
Maxims of Government. But these two Questions ought to
be carefully distinguished, or else we may indeed injure the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> Whether the People have an inherent right
in themselves to Depose, or Punish, or Murder Tyrannical
Princes; and whether the Pope have authority to Depose
Princes for Heresie or other causes, and to Absolve their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from their obedience: The first is not the Doctrine of
the Church, (though it be of many Jesuits) but is expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by this Council; though <hi>Mariana</hi> truly observes, that
the condemnation of this Proposition, <hi>Quilibet Tyrannus,</hi> is not
confirmed by the Popes Bull, as the condemnation of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of <hi>Wickleff</hi> and <hi>Huss</hi> expresly is; which gives some suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
that he did not much like it, especially considering what
<hi>Gerson</hi> tells us, that this Doctrine of <hi>Johan Parvus</hi> was branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out into nine Articles, and he was very zealous to have had
them all distinctly condemned, but could not obtain it; and
therefore complains, <hi>Errorem illum non sufficienter sed valdé
diminute damnatum esse,</hi> That this Errour was not sufficiently,
but very imperfectly condemned; which he attributes to that
kindness many of them had for the Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I do not find this Doctrine defined in any of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils, and it is condemned (though <hi>Gerson</hi> says im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly)
in this, and therefore is not to be accounted the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But as for the Popes Deposing
power, it is not onely asserted by Jesuits, but decreed by their
Councils, and therefore must be accounted the Doctrine of
their Church.</p>
            <p>But our Author proceeds: <hi>That no Catholicks, as Catholicks,
believe that the Pope hath any direct or indirect authority over the
Temporal Power and Jurisdiction of Princes: so that if the Pope
shall pretend to absolve or dispence with his Majesties Subjects
from their Allegiance upon account of Heresie and Schism, such
Dispensation would be vain and null, and all Catholick Subjects
(notwithstanding such Dispensation or Absolution) would be still
bound in Conscience to defend their King and Country, at the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of their Lives and Fortunes, even against the Pope himself, in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50187:7"/>
case he should invade the Nation.</hi> And yet we see that Popes
challenge this Deposing power, and their Councils own and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
it; and where to find the Roman Catholick Faith, but in
the Decrees of their Popes and Roman Catholick General
Councils, I cannot guess. And if we may take and leave what
we please of their Councils, and be good Catholicks still, I see
no reason why we may not reject the Decrees of their Councils
about Transubstantiation, Purgatory, Indulgences, the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Saints, and Worship of Images, and continue as good
Catholicks as they are, who renounce the Authority of their
Councils as to the Deposing Doctrine. I am sure the Council
of <hi>Constance</hi> would have condemned these men for Hereticks,
who should presume to reject any Doctrine, which this or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
General Councils had determined; for in the Bull of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
V. in the Articles of Inquiry after Hereticks, they were to
ask them this Question among others: <hi>Whether he believed,
that what this holy Council of</hi> Constance, <hi>representing the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church, hath approved and doth approve in favour of the
Faith, and the salvation of Souls, is to be held and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of all Christian people;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. To. 12. <hi>p.</hi> 268.</note> 
               <hi>and what it hath and
doth condemn as contrary to Faith and good Manners, that is to be
held, and believed, and professed by them to be condemned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were easie to multiply Testimonies to this purpose; as
the Deposition of the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> II. in the General
Council at <hi>Lyons</hi> by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> IV. the <hi>Breve</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> V.
to the English Catholicks, against taking the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance;
but my Author has given no occasion to proceed any
farther. He appeals to the General Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> and
I joyn issue with him here, and leave it to every man to judge,
whether that Council has decreed the King-killing Doctrine,
or Murder of Princes Excommunicated for Heresie, to be
damnable and heretical.</p>
            <p>The first of those three Treatises against the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
which are published by the Title of <hi>The Jesuits Loyalty,</hi>
proves at large that the Deposing Doctrine is the Doctrine of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by several very material Arguments.
<q>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50187:8"/>
                  <p>1. That Popes have taught it as sound Doctrine, proving it
from Scripture and Tradition, and condemned the contrary as
erroneous in Faith, pernicious to Salvation, wicked folly and
madness, and inflicted Censures on them that held it.</p>
                  <p>2. That Popes have in the highest Tribunals of the Church
deposed Soveraign Princes, and absolved their Subjects from
their Allegiance; and this with the advice and consent of
their Councils, and not onely Patriarchal, but sometimes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
General.</p>
                  <p>3. That Popes, and General Councils by them confirmed,
have denounced Excommunication to such as should obey
their Princes after such Sentence of Deposition and Absolution
of their Subjects from their Allegiance.</p>
                  <p>4. That a General Council, confirmed by the Pope, hath
made a Cannon-law, regulating the manner of Deposing
Princes in some case, and absolving their Subjects from their
Allegiance.</p>
                  <p>5. That all Catholick Divines and Casuists that have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of it, from the first to the last, (after <hi>Calvin</hi>'s time) in all
the several Nations of <hi>Christendom,</hi> have asserted this power
of the Pope, without so much as one contradicting it in all
that time.</p>
                  <p>6. That all Catholick Emperours, Kings, (yea, even they
that were deposed) States, Magistrates, and Lawyers, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
all the Catholicks in the world, for the time being, have
(by tacit consent at least) approved and received this Doctrine
of Popes, Divines and Casuists, and these Censures, Canons,
and Practices of Popes and General Councils.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is enough in all Conscience, if it be well proved (as I
think truly the greatest part of it is) to prove the Deposing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and when
there is so great and potent a Party among themselves, who
appear so zealous in this Cause, I cannot understand what
fault the Doctor committed in charging them with that which
they are so ambitious to be charged with. If it be a Calumny,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50187:8"/>
Popes and Councils, Divines and Casuists and Lawyers, are the
Authors of the Calumny (not those who believe it upon their
report) who are the properest Judges, what authority it is
they challenge; and all the world knows what it is they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
as often as they can.</p>
            <p>There is indeed an Answer given to this Treatise by one of
those Catholick Divines (as they call themselves) who will
not own this to be the Doctrine of the Church. I read it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with great zeal and expectation to see it confuted, which I
profess I should have been very glad to have seen fairly done:
for I take no pleasure in the Errours and Mistakes of any
Church; and I think he has proved, that those Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
who were deposed, did not like the Deposing Doctrine,
as any one would guess; and I confess, I thought it at first a
bold attempt in the Author of that Treatise to prove the
contrary, which is the onely matter of fact, wherein he has
apparently the better of his Adversary; but as for other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
(excepting the Opinions of all Catholick Divines and
Casuists before <hi>Calvin,</hi> which may admit of some debate) he
yields it all, and laughs at his Adversary for taking so much
pains to prove what no body denies, <hi>viz.</hi> that Popes have
taught this Doctrine, that Popes and Councils have made such
Decrees, and have actually executed them upon Kings and
Emperours; and that their most eminent Divines and Casuists
have defended this Doctrine, and justified such Decrees and
Practices: but yet he says, all this does not prove it to be the
Doctrine of their Church, nor <hi>de fide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this does not concern the Doctor, who did not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with their Church nor Articles of Faith, but asserted that
the Popish Religion is not Loyal, and that in some cases it
teaches Subjects to Rebel. Now if the Doctrine and Decrees
of Popes and Councils be no part of the Popish Religion,
whether they be in a strict sence Articles of Faith or not;
if the Decrees of Councils to depose Heretical Princes or the
Favourers of Hereticks, and to absolve their Subjects from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50187:9"/>
their Allegiance, do not teach Subjects to Rebel in such cases,
then indeed the Doctor may be mistaken, especially if it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
comfort to a deposed Prince, that he is deposed by vertue
of a Decree of Popes and Councils; but yet the Popes power
of Deposing Princes, is no Article of Faith.</p>
            <p>But yet it may be of good use to set this matter in a clear
light, and to hear the utmost that can be said to vindicate
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from teaching so pernicious a Doctrine as
this. And what the Answerer to the first Treatise against the
Oath of Allegiance says, is contained in a narrow compass,
and I shall reduce it into as easie a method as I can. The truth
is, I generally like what he says very well, and think he has
proved that it ought not to be the Doctrine of the Church, and
that no man is bound to believe it, whatever Church teaches
it; but I think he has not proved, that it is not the Doctrine of
the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> He frankly acknowledges, that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Doctrine has been taught by Popes, and has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
by General Councils (which our Remonstrancer denies)
let us hear then how he vindicates the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from
teaching such a Doctrine, and truly I cannot find that he ever
attempts it.</p>
            <p>1. He says indeed this is not the Doctrine of the Church,
and we believe it is not, if by Church he means the Universal
Church of all Ages; but yet it may be the Doctrine of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which teaches a great many Doctrines which
the Primitive and Apostolical Churches never heard of: and
therefore though it be true what he says, <hi>That all the Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
Gregory <hi>the Seventh were positively against the
Deposing Doctrine;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 18.</note> 
               <hi>That this was a Doctrine brought in
in the Eleventh Century, against the Judgement and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Ten before;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 10.</note> 
               <hi>That the Fathers were not of this
mind;</hi> and a great deal to this purpose: yet this does not prove
that the present Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not teach this Doctrine;
which is plain matter of fact to be seen in the Decrees of their
Popes and Councils, as he himself acknowledges.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50187:9"/>
Thus he proves, That this Doctrine is not an Article of
Faith: For two things are necessary to make an Article of
Faith. <hi>First, That the Point have been originally revealed by
Christ; And Secondly, That this Revelation have been preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by an uninterrupted and uniform Practice of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and if any of these conditions are wanting, he denies
any engagement of the Church in these concerns, or that the
Church has believed, taught, or practised this Deposing Doctrine:</hi>
that is to say, If any Church teaches such Doctrines, as
have not the true Characters of Articles of Faith, she does
not teach true Articles of Faith; but yet such Doctrines
may be Articles of Faith in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though
they be not Articles of the Catholick Faith; for if no
Church can make Articles of Faith for her self, which are
not Articles of the Catholick Faith, then no Church can be
guilty of Heresie, for she never can have an heretical Faith,
if nothing can be the Faith of the Church, but what is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick;
which indeed is the only expedient I know of in the
World, to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not to be guilty of
Heresie; but then it will justifie all other Churches, as well
as the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thought all different Churches or Communions of
Christians had been distinguisht from each other by their
Articles of Faith, and Ecclesiastical Policy, their Canons,
or Laws of Discipline; and if I would know, what is
the Doctrine, Government, or Discipline of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I must not enquire
either what the Scripture teaches, or what was taught ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages since by the Primitive Fathers, but must examine
the Authentick Records of these Churches, the Decrees of
Popes and Councils, their Articles and Canons; for it is
impossible to know, what is believed and practised in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>England</hi> at this day, but by such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords:
What is the true Catholick Faith, and what is the
Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50187:10"/>
are two very different Questions, and must be proved
different ways; we must learn the Catholick Faith of the
Church from the Doctrine of the Scriptures, or the Writings
of the Primitive Fathers; but we must learn the Faith of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> or any other Church, by
their own Writings, confirmed by the highest Authority that
is in such a Church: And therefore as we must learn the
Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from our Articles and
Canons, so we must learn the Doctrine of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> by the Definitions, Decrees, Constitutions, Canons
of Popes and Councils, whose Authority is received and
acknowledged in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and as he, who
renounces the 39 Articles, or any of them, does so far sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and renounce its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Communion; so do those, who renounce the
Decrees and Definitions of Popes and Councils, so far
forth renounce the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Doctrine, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and Discipline of it. And as it would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
to say, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not renounce
Transubstantiation, because this Author thinks, it is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Doctrine; so it is equally absurd to say, That this
Doctrine of Deposing Princes, is not the Doctrine of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though taught by Popes and Councils,
that is, by the highest Authority of that Church, because
this Author believes, That, notwithstanding what Popes and
Councils say, it is not the Doctrine of the Universal Church
in all Ages; which is a good reason indeed to prove, That
we ought not to receive such Doctrines, though taught by
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but is no proof, that this is not taught
by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is nothing to the purpose, as far as we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this Controversie, Whether Popes or Councils be
Fallible or Infallible, Whether what they decree be an Article
of Faith, or not, Whether it be true or false; for if the Popes
and their Councils be the highest Authority in the Church
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50187:10"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> we must learn from them, What is the Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> be it true or false, as we do, what
the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is, from the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
and Canons agreed on in Convocation; though we do
not pretend that the Convocation is Infallible, or that what
they determine must be true, because they determine it.</p>
            <p>All the little (not to say senceless) Distinctions, which
this Answerer uses, tend only to prove, That what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
by Popes and Councils, is not therefore the Doctrine
of the Church, that is, of the Universal Catholick Church,
unless it have the confirmation of Catholick Tradition,
which I will easily grant him; but yet it may, and must be
the Doctrine of the present Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by all the Authority, that is in that Church: For
that is the Doctrine of any Church, which is agreed on, and
determined by the highest Authority in it; and I know no
greater Authority in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than that of Popes
and Councils; and therefore the Deposing Doctrine being
defined and decreed by Popes and Councils (as he himself
acknowledges) must be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. No says this Answerer, Councils have made a Canon
for the Deposing heretical Princes, but have not defined,
That the Pope or Council have Authority to do it. <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
use to define those things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 13.</note> 
               <hi>which they intend we should be
obliged to believe. To make a Canon is one thing, to define is
another. Decreeing and Supposing are plainly not defining;</hi> and
therefore this Deposing Doctrine is no Article of Faith in
the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> nor are they bound to beleive it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
though it has been decreed, it has not been defined in
any Council. An admirable Apology for the Church of
<hi>Rome! The Council of</hi> Lateran (says this Answerer) <hi>made a
Decree concerning Deposition;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 14.</note> 
               <hi>the Council of</hi> Lyons <hi>assented to
an actual Deposition; therefore they were both perswaded, they
or the Pope, had power to depose. I, for my part, see not
what more can be made of it.</hi> And for my part, I see not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50187:11"/>
what more need be made of it, to justifie the Doctor, or any
one else, who charges the Church of <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> with the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Doctrine. He may dispute with his Adversary, if he
pleases, Whether such a Deposing Canon, prove the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Doctrine to be an Article of Faith; but I think it is
much at one, Whether a Prince be deposed by an Article of
Faith, or by a Decree or Canon. If that Canon, which
decrees the Deposing of Princes, and Absolving their Subjects
from their Allegiance, teaches Subjects to rebel, and the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has made such a Canon, (as evidently
they have, if <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick General Councils be the
Representative of that Church) I think it does not mend
the matter much, whether the Deposing Doctrine be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Faith or not. And yet I am not satisfied, but, that
to decree what shall be done, includes a virtual Definition of
that Doctrine, on which that Decree is founded. To decree,
that an heretical Prince shall be Deposed, signifies something
more than a bare Definition, that an Heretical Prince may
be deposed; and I believe all mankind, who have not lost
common sense by Metaphysical Subtilities, have always taken
it for granted, That a Decree includes a Definition. Nay to
decree without a Definition, supposes the Deposing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
whereon the Decree of Deposition is founded, to be
so universally received and acknowledged, that there was no
need of an express Definition; which, I think, ties it as
hard upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as any Definition could do.</p>
            <p>The Sum is this: This Answerer acknowledges, That
Popes and Councils have decreed the Deposing Doctrine, but
will by no means grant, that this is the Doctrine of the
Church, (there by meaning, the Universal Church of all ages)
nor that they are bound to believe it, and I readily grant
him all this, but do still averr, That it is the Doctrine of the
present Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which is all that I intend to
prove, for I never thought it was the Doctrine of the true
Catholick Church, or that any Christian ought to believe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50187:11"/>
it. As the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is distinguished from other
Communions of <hi>Christians,</hi> we have no other way to learn
what she teaches but from Popes and Councils, who are the
highest Authority in that Church, and they teach the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Doctrine; and therefore those, who live in Communion
with that Church, and own its Authority, must own it too.
Those who disown this Doctrine, so far disown the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and may be the better Subjects
for being the worse Papists, which I think is no great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
to that Religion.</p>
            <p>3. Now since Popes and Councils have decreed and
thereby defined the Deposing Doctrine, and this Answerer
does and must believe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church. I desire to know, how he can avoid that Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
That this Deposing Doctrine, ever since it has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
by Popes and Councils, has been the Doctrine of the
Church? For is not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Church still,
since it decreed the Deposing Doctrine? and is not a General
Council, the Representative of the Church of that age,
wherein this Council is held? And are not the Decrees of
such a Council then the Doctrine of the Church? No, says
our Answerer, <hi>I do not understand, how the Church can be
engaged,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer to the first Treatise, <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>unless she proceeds on those Grounds, on which alone a
Church as a Church, or Congregation of Faithful can proceed.</hi>
Which he there tells us, is a revelation by Christ, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by an uninterrupted and uniform practice of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that is, by that exploded Oracle of Infallible Tradition.
But <hi>If any, or all of those, who make the Church believe not, or
act on other grounds than these, I conceive they believe and act,
not as a Church or as faithful, but as Men, or Scholars, or in
some other Capacity.—The truth is, when Councils leave
their proper work, defining and declaring to Posterity the Faith
received from their Ancestors, and fall to discoursing, or rather
acting on discourses formerly made, they are not in strict forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Councils, I mean in that propriety in which they are held
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50187:12"/>
to be Infallible, but men assembled to be a Council, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now, not as a Council, but as so many men.</hi> And must this
pass for good Catholick Doctrine; that all the men in the
Church may err, and yet the Church cannot err, which
preserves Infallibility in the Church by as great a Miracle,
as the <hi>species</hi> of Bread and Wine in the Sacrament without a
Subject. But, I beseech you, When are General Councils In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible?
When they decree and define, what is Infallibly
true. Right! And thus the Convocation of the Province
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> or <hi>York</hi> are as Infallible, as any General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
Nay any private Christian is as Infallible as either, if
he adhere to Infallible Tradition. But I thought it had been
Catholick Doctrine, That a General Council are no longer
to be considered as men, but as the Church representative,
which is under the Conduct and Influence of an Infallible
Spirit to secure them from Error: But it seems even a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council may err; only then they err not as a Council,
but as Men: but how shall we know, when they are a
Council, and when they are Men? Truly this is not to be
known, till they have made their Definitions and Decrees;
and then if they be agreeable to Catholick Tradition, they
acted as a Council, if not they were only Fallible Men. But
who shall be Judge of this? Who is the Keeper of this C<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Tradition? Why every Man must judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 71.</note>
               <hi>It is the sence written in the hearts of the Faithful, and
appearing in their Actions: The Writing foretold by the Prophet,</hi>
Jerem. 3. <hi>in the bowels and hearts of the house of</hi> Israel. And
thus I hope in time our Quakers may be good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</p>
            <p>The Sum then of his Argument, whereby he proves, That
the Deposing Doctrine is not taught by the Church, though
it be taught by Popes, and General Councils, is this, That
the Pope is not Infallible, at least that his Infallibility is but a
probable Opinion; That General Councils are not the Church,
but Fallible Men when they err, and Infallible only when
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50187:12"/>
they do not err; That though Popes and Councils and all the
Men in the Church teach this Doctrine, yet the Church
does not teach it. Now, Whether these Propositions be true
or false, I enquire not, but desire all good Catholicks to
observe, That they must renounce the Infallibility and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Popes and General Councils of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> or acknowledge the Deposing Doctrine to be the
Doctrine of the Church.</p>
            <p>This Distinction between the Church and the Men of
the Church, destroys all the Visible Authority of the
Church, and leaves every man at liberty to judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
What is Catholick Tradition; which is so loose a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
that a Doctor of the Church of <hi>England</hi> would be
ashamed of it; let them no more talk of a Visible Church,
if the whole Visible Authority of the Church be not the
Church; if all those men, in whom the teaching and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
Authority of the Church resides, whether Popes
and Councils may teach such Doctrines, and yet the Church
not teach them; does the Church cease to be a Church,
when it teaches any thing contrary to Catholick Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Then it seems there was no Church during all the
time of those Popes and Councils, which taught the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Doctrine; nor is there any <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church to
this day, wherein these Doctrines are still taught, and will
be so, till those Decrees of Popes and Councils be repealed,
which teach these Doctrines: Or, are they a Church, and
yet the Church not teach, what they, who are the Church,
teach with all the Authority of a Church? Or, are they
a Church, and no Church, at the same time? Is not the
Sentence, which a Judge pronounces by the Authority of
a Judge, a Judicial Act, though it be contrary to Law?
And by the same reason, Are not the Decrees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
which is, the, Church representative, the Acts of the
Church, though they be contrary to Catholick Faith and
Tradition? Does a Judge cease to be a Judge, or the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50187:13"/>
Church to be the Church, when they pronounce false?
And if not, Are not such false Judgments, or erroneous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
the Acts of the Judge, or of the Church still? Let
him but tell me, Whether he will have a Church or no
Church, and he shall find me very civil in granting either;
but how this Doctrine will relish with good Catholicks, I
cannot guess.</p>
            <p>In short these men, who will not allow the Deposing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though
they acknowledge it to have been decreed by Popes and
Councils, go upon these Principles;</p>
            <p>1. That Popes and Councils may and have decreed such
Doctrines, as are contrary to Scripture, and Catholick
Tradition.</p>
            <p>2. That no good Catholick is bound to own such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
though decreed by Popes and Councils.</p>
            <p>3. That the Doctrine of the present Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
is not the Doctrine of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>4. That men are good Catholicks not by adhering to
the Doctrine of the present Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of the
Scriptures expounded by Primitive and Catholick Tradition.
All this I firmly believe, they are the very Principles on
which our Reformation is founded, and by which we justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our selves against the Innovations of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
but though these principles will justifie the Reformation, yet
they will not prove, That this Deposing Doctrine is not
taught by the present Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then now return again to our Remonstrancer, and
having got rid of the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> and proved,
That it is so far from condemning, that it hath approved and
confirmed the Deposing Doctrine, What remains is nothing
but Insinuation, and Address, without the least appearance
of an Argument: but let us hear what it is;<note place="margin">Remonst. p. 2.</note> and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
thus.</p>
            <p>I say seeing Roman Catholicks do thus generally declare
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50187:13"/>
their Loyalty, I think they ought no more in Justice to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with disloyal Principles, for the extravagancy of some few of
that vast body, and those censured and condemned too by them,
than I am to be charged with the Principles of the like Disloyalty
and Injustice, because some of my Children have been for the Bill
of Exclusion, and others who communicated with me, have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
scandalous Pamphlets, Narratives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tending to Treason
and Rebellion.</p>
            <p>This is spoke in the Person of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and a very fair Speech he has made for her, wherein there
is not any one thing fairly represented. For 1. the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
does not charge Loyal Papists with disloyal Principles,
only says, That the Popish Religion is not Loyal; but it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that many Papists may not believe this to be the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as many of them profess not
to do; others may abhor the Doctrine, and renounce the
Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this particular, though
they hold Communion with her in her Worship; others
may have such a Natural and Inbred Loyalty, such a Love
to their Prince and Country, as antidotes them against the
Infection of bad Principles; now these men may be Loyal,
as the Doctor acknowledges, and may act upon very Loyal
Principles too, but they are not the Principles of the Popish
Religion; and there is some hazard, that while men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
a Religion, and own the Authority of a Church,
which teaches the Deposing Doctrine, they may be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by their Religion, when there happens any competition
between their Loyalty and Religion; which is all the
Doctor asserted, and which any disinterested Person would
have thought as inoffensive as it is true. And since this
Passage has raised such an unjust clamour against the Doctor,
I shall only observe, what just reason there is for such a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
after all their declarations of Loyalty, in that (some
very few excepted) they obstinately refuse the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance,
which there can be no colourable pretence for,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50187:14"/>
but that they will not forswear the Deposing Doctrine, and
there is reason to suspect, That those who will not abjure so
pernicious a Doctrine, may be perswaded to practise it,
when time serves. Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth, <hi>An.</hi> 1606. by a
<hi>Breve</hi> written to the English Catholicks, declared and
taught them, as Pastor of their Souls, That the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
established by Parliament 3. <hi>Jac. salvâ fide Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>câ,
et salute animarum suarum praestari non posse, cùm multa
contineat, quae fidei ac saluti apertè adversantur;</hi> cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
without violating the Catholick Faith, and injuring the
Salvation of their Souls, as containing many things, which
are manifestly contrary to Faith and Salvation. Now as
the Author of the First Treatise against the Oath of Allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
well observes <hi>(p. 11.)</hi> there are not in it <hi>(multa)</hi> many things
to which this censure is possibly applicable, unless this be
one, That the Pope hath no power to depose the King, or
absolve his Subjects from their Oath of Allegeance. Now,
when, in Obedience to the Pope, the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks to
this day obstinately refuse this Oath, Is there not reason to
suspect, that they are not clear in this point? and then, let
any man judge, what security there is of their Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>2. He says it is unjust, That <hi>they should be charged with
Disloyal Principles for the extravagancies of some few of that
vast body, and those censured and condemned too by them.</hi> This
I must acknowledge would be very unjust, but it is not true.
Those whom he calls a few, are no less than Popes and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils, and their most eminent Divines, School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Casuists, Canonists, for several ages; who neither
were, nor could be censured, because they were the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Authority in the Church; whereas in truth it is only some
few, who have taught the contrary, and those indeed have
been censured and excommunicated at <hi>Rome,</hi> as some <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Chatholicks can inform him.</p>
            <p>3. He makes the Church of <hi>England</hi> say, That some of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50187:14"/>
her Children were for the Bill of Exclusion. If he would
have passed for a Church of <hi>England</hi> man, he should have
observed a better <hi>Decorum</hi> in personating the Church, and
not have made her say such things, as no Ingenuous Papist
would affix to her. If ever the Loyalty of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> was tried, it was in that Affair, which she had no
other Interest, but a sense of Duty, to oblige her to; and I
know not any one man, who was firm and stedfast to the
Church, but was so to the Succession too, though he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
the Imputation of being a Papist, or Popishly inclined
for it. It is sufficiently known, that the prevailing party of
these Houses of Commons, who were for the Bill of Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
were ready prepared to accommodate and comprehend
away the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and he might, with equal
truth, and honesty have charged the Rebellion of 41 on the
Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the Bill of Exclusion.
But this is so barefaced a Calumny, that it confutes it self, and
shames its Author.</p>
            <p>4. Let us then consider, What comparison there is between
the case of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
or, Whether there be the same reason to charge the
Church of <hi>England</hi> with disloyalty, that there is to charge
the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Doctrine by all the Authority that is in that Church;
the Church of <hi>England</hi> teaches the strictest Obedience to
Princes, without any reserved cases, and threatens eternal
Damnation to all Rebels, how religious soever their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are. Those who teach the Deposing Doctrine, speak
the sense of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are her true and genuine
Sons; those who allow Subjects in any case to rebel, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore
it is as unjust to charge the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with the
Treasons and Rebellions, which are committed contrary to
her declared Doctrine, as it is just to charge the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> with such practices, as she her self decrees and teaches.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50187:15"/>
If <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks be loyal to a deposed and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
Prince, no thanks to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for it, who
forbids them to be so. If any in Communion with the
Church of <hi>England</hi> be disloyal, this is no fault of the
Church, which teaches Loyalty. And since he has been
pleased to mention the Bill of Exclusion, I would desire him
to tell me at his leisure, What <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Nation,
who had all the Power in their hands, would have suffered
a Protestant Prince to have succeeded quietly to his Throne?
We know how it fared with <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi>
notwithstanding the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> burnt <hi>Mariana</hi>'s
Book, and what <hi>Henrician</hi> Hereticks in those days signified.
But our Church teaches better, and the true Sons of the
Church practise better, and will never repent of what they
have done, though they be unjustly reproached by Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
for doing it, and as unjustly charged by as kind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating
Friends, as any <hi>Rome</hi> affords, with opposing it.</p>
            <p>And now I come to his <hi>convincing Argument; That the
Papists do not hold such pernicious Doctrines; That he sees so
many Kings and Princes in other Countries no less jealous of
their Lives and Authorities than others, who yet profess and
maintain that Religion, and think themselves secure by their
Principles, when they dare not trust the</hi> Calvinist. The
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> you know, Sir, never wants Miracles, and
it may be, this is none of the least. For my part I dare
not pretend to give a Reason, Why any man professes that
Religion, much less, Why Princes do so; and yet it is not
more impossible, that men should maintain a Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Interest, than believe contrary to their Sences.
I suppose, it is as much against the Interest of Princes to
be actually deposed by Popes and Councils, as it is to profess
a Religion, which teaches the Deposing Doctrine; and yet
when <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth was deposed by <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII. and
<hi>Frederick</hi> the Second by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Fourth in the
Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and in such other Instances of the actual
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50187:15"/>
exercise of this Deposing Doctrine, neither the deposed
Princes and Emperors, nor other Catholick Kings, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for it; and
if Kings can be contented to continue in the Communion of
that Church, which actually deposes Princes, nay, deposes
themselves, it does not seem to me so convincing an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not teach the Deposing
Doctrine, meerly because Princes, who are jealous of their
Lives and Authority, hold Communion with it.</p>
            <p>If they can perswade Princes, That there is no Salvation
to be had in any other Church, those who have a mind to
be saved, must be contented to dispense with some tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Inconveniencies to save their Souls; and indeed they
have made the way to Heaven so very easie, that it may
perswade Princes, who love their Pleasures, to bear with the
Rudeness and Insolencies of Popes. And yet no man ever
denied, but the Papists may be very good Subjects to Popish
Princes; while they obey the Pope, the Pope commands
their Subjects to obey them; the only danger is, when the
Pope and the Prince are not of a side, whom the Subjects
shall obey then, the deposed Prince, or the deposing
