            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Nation is in too high a Ferment, for me to expect either fair War, or even so much as fair Quarter from a Reader of the opposite Party. All Men are engag'd either on this side or that: and tho' Conscience is the common <hi>Word,</hi> which is given by both, yet if a Writer fall among Enemies, and cannot give the Marks of <hi>Their</hi> Conscience, he is knock'd down before the Reasons of his own are heard. A <hi>Preface,</hi> therefore, which is but a bespeaking of Favour, is altogether use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. What I desire the <hi>Reader</hi> should know concerning me, he will find in the Body of the Poem; if he have but the patience to peruse it. Only this Advertisement let him take before hand, which relates to the Merits of the Cause. No general Characters of Parties, (call 'em either Sects or Churches) can be so fully and exactly drawn, as to Comprehend all the several Members of'em; at least all such as are receiv'd under that Denomination. For example; there are some of the Church by Law Establish'd, who envy not Liberty of Conscience to Dissenters; as being well satisfied that, according to their own Principles, they ought not to persecute them. Yet these, by reason of their fewness, I could not distinguish from the Numbers of the rest with whom they are Embodied in one common Name: On the other side there are many of our Sects, and more indeed then I could reasouably have hop'd, who have withdrawn themselves from the Communion of the <hi>Panther</hi>; and embrac'd this Gracious Indulgence of His Majesty in point of Toleration. But neither to the one nor the other of these is this Satyr any way intended: 'tis aim'd only at the refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and disobedient on either side. For those who are come over to the Royal Party are consequently suppos'd to be out of Gunshot. Our Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians have observ'd, that in Process of Time, some Diseases have abated
<pb facs="tcp:48937:3"/>
of their Virulence, and have in a manner worn out their Malignity, so as to be no longer Mortal: and why may not I suppose the same concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some of those who have formerly been Enemies to Kingly Government, As well as Catholick Religion? I hope they have now another Notion of both, as having found, by Comfortable Experience, that the Doctrine of Persecution is far from being an Article of our Faith.</p>
            <p>'Tis not for any Private Man to Censure the Proceedings of a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince: but, without suspicion of Flattery, I may praise our own, who has taken contrary Measures, and those more suitable to the Spirit of Christianity. Some of the Dissenters in their Addresses to His Majesty have said <hi>That he has restor'd God to his Empire over Conscience:</hi> I Confess I dare not stretch the Figure to so great a boldness: but I may safely say, that Conscience is the Royalty and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of every Private man. He is absolute in his own Breast, and accountable to no Earthly Power, for that which passes only betwixt God and Him. Those who are driven into the Fold are, generally speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rather made Hypocrites then Converts.</p>
            <p>This Indulgence being granted to all the Sects, it ought in reason to be expected, that they should both receive it, and receive it thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. For at this time of day to refuse the Benefit, and adhere to those whom they have esteem'd their Persecutors, what is it else, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to own that they suffer'd not before for Conscience sake; but only out of Pride and Obstinacy to separate from a Church for those Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they now judge may be lawfully obey'd? After they have so long contended for their Classical Ordination, (not to speak of Rites and Ceremonies) will they at length submit to an Episcopal? if they can go so far out of Complaisance to their old Enemies, methinks a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reason should perswade 'em to take another step, and see whether that wou'd lead 'em.</p>
            <p>Of the receiving this Toleration thankfully, I shall say no more, than that they ought, and I doubt not they will consider from what hands they receiv'd it. 'Tis not from a <hi>Cyrus,</hi> a Heathen Prince, and a Foreigner, but from a Christian King, their Native Sovereign: who expects a Return in <hi>Specie</hi> from them; that the Kindness which He has Graciously shown them, may be retaliated on those of his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48937:3"/>As for the Poem in general, I will only thus far satisfie the <hi>Reader:</hi> That it was neither impos'd on me, nor so much as the Subject given me by any man. It was written during the last Winter and the beginning of this Spring; though with long interruptions of ill health, and other hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances. About a Fortnight before I had finish'd it, His Majesties Declaration for Liberty of Conscience came abroad: which, if I had so soon expected, I might have spar'd my self the labour of writing many things which are contain'd in the third, part of it. But I was alwayes in some hope, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> might have been perswaded to have taken off the <hi>Penal Lawes</hi> and the <hi>Test,</hi> which was one Design of the Poem when I propos'd to my self the writing of it.</p>
            <p>'Tis evident that some part of it was only occasional, &amp; not first intended. I mean that defence of my self, to which every honest man is bound, when he is injuriously attacqu'd in Print: and I refer my self to the judgment of those who have read the <hi>Answer to the Defence of the late Kings Papers,</hi> and that of the <hi>Dutchess,</hi> (in which last I was concerned) how charitably I have been represented there. I am now inform'd both of the Author and Supervisers of his Pamphlet: and will reply when I think he can affront me: for I am of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Opinion that all Creatures cannot. In the mean time let him consider, whether he deserv'd not a more severe reprehension then I gave him formerly; for using so little respect to the Memory of those whom he pretended to answer: and, at his leisure look out for some Original Treatise of Humility, written by any Protestant in English, (I believe I may say in any other Tongue:) for the magnified Piece of <hi>Duncomb</hi> on that Subject, which either he must mean or none, and with which another of his Fellows has upbraided me, was Translated from the Spanish of <hi>Rodriguez:</hi> tho' with the Omission of the <hi>17th,</hi> the <hi>24th,</hi> the <hi>25th,</hi> and the last Chapter, which will be found in comparing of the Books.</p>
            <p>He would have insinuated to the World that Her late Highness died not a Roman Catholick: He declares himself to be now satisfied to the contrary; in which he has giv'n up the Cause: for matter of Fact was the Principal Debate betwixt us. In the mean time he would dispute the Motives of her Change: how prepostrously let all men judge, when he seem'd to deny the Subject of the Controversy, the Change it self. And because I would not take up this ridiculous Challenge, he tells the World I cannot argue: but he may as well infer that a Catholick can
<pb facs="tcp:48937:4"/>
not fast, because he will not take up the Cudgels against Mrs. <hi>James,</hi> to confute the Protestant Religion.</p>
            <p>I have but one word more to say concerning the Poem as such, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting from the Matters either Religious or Civil which are handled in it. The <hi>first part,</hi> consisting most in general Characters and Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have endeavour'd to raise, and give it the Majestick Turn of Heroick Poesie. The <hi>second,</hi> being Matter of Dispute, and chiefly concerning Church Authority, I was oblig'd to make as plain and perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as possibly I cou'd: yet not wholly neglecting the Numbers, though I had not frequent occasions for the Magnificence of Verse. The <hi>third,</hi> which has more of the Nature of Domestick Conversation, is, or ought to be more free and familiar than the two former.</p>
            <p>There are in it two <hi>Episodes,</hi> or <hi>Fables,</hi> which are interwoven with the main Design; so that they are properly parts of it, though they are also distinct Stories of themselves. In both of these I have made use of the Common Places of <hi>Satyr,</hi> whether true or false, which are urg'd by the Members of the one Church against the other. At which I hope no <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of either Party will be scandaliz'd; because they are not of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention: but as old, to my knowledge, as the Times of <hi>Boccace</hi> and <hi>Chaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> on the one side, and as those of the Reformation on the other.</p>

               <l>Eternal truth, and what they taught, believ'd.</l>
