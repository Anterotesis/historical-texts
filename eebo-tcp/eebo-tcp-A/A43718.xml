            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of Reverend <hi>IEWEL,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury;</hi> and by

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou art not, we presume, ignorant that
Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> hath lately writ a History<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of
the Reformation of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
His Learned name is of such
great credit, that it doth not only invite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but bespeak his Readers approbation and
acceptance. The love we bear to the Reformation of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and an earnest desire to be satisfied
about it, led us forth to the view and consideration of that
History; wherein we labored to follow our Reason more
then our Fancy; and the truth of the Story, more then the
cry of Fame; as not being willing to have any mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in admiration. All that the learned Doctor hath
storied about the Reformation in many parts and parcels of
his Book, having interwoven it with variety of civil Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
both Forraign and Domestick, thou wilt finde
here Methodically put together, and shalt have a full view
of it at once; which by several skips and leaps thou wilt be
put to search for in the Doctors History.</p>
            <p>We could heartily wish, the Doctor would have saved us
this trouble, and put together the parts of this goodly
Building (as he is pleased to call it) that we might at once
have gone round about it, and viewed the Towers and
strength thereof. This thou shalt finde faithfully done to
thy hand, wherein thy patience is intreated to stay and
consider the several particulars, lest by overmuch haste,
thou lose the fruit of these few lines.</p>
            <p>We have here laid before thee the Evidence the Doctor
<pb facs="tcp:56431:3"/>
brings for the Reformation, with some Observations out
of his own Book, Reverend <hi>Jewel,</hi> and others of our own
upon it, and the judgement is left to thy own breast. We
can assure thee, thou art candidly dealt withal in all that
we alleadge; either out of the Doctors Book or any other.
His Printer hath mis-numbred some Pages, &amp; thou mayst
be at some loss (if thou compare some of these quotations
with the Doctors Book) through the neglect of Printing;
but otherwise thou shalt finde the Page, the words many
times as they lie, or at least the substance of the Doctors
sense faithfully communicated to thee. We suppose, the
Doctor cannot desire a fairer way of Tryal in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of the Churches Reformation, then when himself in his
Book, and the testimonies he brings, be upon the matter
constituted Iudges of it, we hereby conceive, that any
person, not byassed by interst, will conclude from the
Doctors premises, that <hi>Englands</hi> Reformation is sadly
defective.</p>
            <p>There was a time, when there was no Smith found in
<hi>Israel,</hi> and the <hi>Israelites</hi> went down to the <hi>Philistims</hi> to
sharpen their Weapons. We contend not for Victory, but
for Truth; and if in this contest something may be laid
hold on, even in the Tents of an Adversary, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
and advancement of it, we shall not scruple to
undergo the shame of our own weakness, and the discredit
of our own poverty, as being fain to borrow both the shop
and tools of an Adversary to vindicate it, and support it.
<hi>Reader,</hi> we leave these few sheets with thee, desiring thy
prayers for the Churches through-Reformation, which is
their sole desing.</p>

            <p>It is not the purpose of these lines to vie abilities of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of a learned Doctor, and police Orator. But the work at
present is, to scan over some passages in your History of the
Churches Reformation; and in such a season as this (<hi>a Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
now sitting)</hi> to press onward toward perfection. And
in the pursuit of this design, please you to take along the
judgement of that Reverend Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> in
the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> one whom you often
mention with deserved honour in your last History. You
stile him, pag. 123. in the latter part of your History, The
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56431:4"/>
right Learned Mr. <hi>Iohn Iewel.</hi> Pag. 129. Reverend <hi>Iewel,</hi>
that learned Prelate. Pag. 147. The right Reverend Bishop
<hi>Iewel,</hi> pag. 155.</p>
            <p>His Book which he wrote in defence of the Apologie of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> against that foul-mouth'd Caviller <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
is yet extant in most Churches in this Kingdom, and next
unto the Bible their best Ornament.</p>
            <p>From this Book, and some Sermons of this reverend Bishop
bound up with it, and several passages in your own, something
is tendered to your judicious consideration: Whether the
reformation of the Church of <hi>England</hi> be, or were at any
time so compleat, and in such Primitive lustre as you phrase
it, in the close of your History, that nothing is more to be
done for the perfection and beauty of it. Be assured, learned
Sir, the World shall not be abused with false quotations, with
wrested interpretations, either out of your Book, or this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Bishops; you shall have the page, the words quoted,
without the least prevarication.</p>
            <p>And first of all, Sir, What a soul blot doth your pen cast
upon the Reformation, when you tell the world <q>That you
cannot reckon the death of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth for an
infelicity to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </q> They are your own
words, in the fourth pag. of your Epistle to the Reader;<q>That he was ill principled in himself, and that his Reign was
unfortunate, <bibl>pag. 141. part. 1.</bibl>
               </q> And the ground of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
is, Because it is not to be thought (had he lived) but
that the rest of the Bishopricks (before sufficiently impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished)
must have followed <hi>Durham,</hi> and the poor Church
been left as destitute of Lovers and Ornaments, as when she
came into the world in her natural nakedness. This Vein
runs throughout your whole Book. You tell us in the history
of <hi>Edward,</hi> pag. 33. that the Grandees of the Court began
to entertain some thoughts of a Reformation, on an hope
to inrich themselves by the spoil of the Bishopricks,</p>
            <p>You tell us pag. 48. <q>That the first Parliament, in the first
year of his Reign, though it consisted of such Members as
disagreed among themselves, yet they agreed well enough
in one common Principle, which was to serve the present
time, and preserve themselves, that they came resolved to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56431:4"/>
further such a Reformation, as should most visibly conduce
to the advancement of their several ends, and to prepare a
way for exposing the Revenues of the Church unto spoil
and rapine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You tell us pag. 95. <q>That the alteration of Altars into
Tables, and the disfurnishing of the Altars, of the Hangings,
Palls, Plate, and other rich utensills was taken up by some
great men about the Court, on hopes of profit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You tell us in the fifth year of King <hi>Edward,</hi> pag. 99.
<q>
                  <hi>Gardiner</hi> was lifted out of the wealthy Bishoprick of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
to give the Courtiers opportunity to inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by the spoil thereof. And in pag. 101. That one
<hi>Iohn Poynet</hi> succeeded him to serve other mens turns. And
in the same page<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Pyrates of the Court were intent
upon all advantages to inrich themselves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You tell us in the second year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> page
121. <q>That the Bishops Sees were kept void, till the best
flowers in the whole Garden of the Church had been cull'd
out of it. That the Queen and her Hungry Courtiers had
alienated many fair Mannors from the rich Sees of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
Elie,</hi> and indeed what not?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, you have muddied the first Springs of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
by casting into it the abhorred filth of covetousness.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, Did your pen and your heart agree together, when
you said you could not reckon it for an infelicity that <hi>Edward</hi>
the sixth died so immaturely; or which in plain English is,
'Twas good for the Church he was taken out of the way?</p>
            <p>The Preface to the Book of Homilies makes an honourable
mention of him. And when our precious <hi>Iewel</hi> had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to speak of him, page 359. Of his defence, these are his
words, <q>That noble Prince of blessed memory King <hi>Edward</hi>
the sixth.</q> Was it not an infelicity to the Church to lose
her chiefest stay and pillar? To have the hopes of a glorious
Reformation nipt in the very Budd? To have a fearfull De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
of blood and idolatry rush in upon us by the succession
of Queen <hi>Mary?</hi> in whose Reign more precious blood was
spilt, then in all the times of her Predecessors.</p>
            <p>The persecution under her Reign, and the carriage of the
Papists in it, you relate out of Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> page 81. of your
History.</p>

You have given a large testimony of King <hi>Edwards</hi>
Learning, before he wes eight years old, page 12.</p>
            <p>Of his tenderness to consent to sign the Warrant for the
execution of <hi>Ioan</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> page 89.</p>
            <p>Of his great zeal for God, in resisting the tolerarion of
Popery only to his sister the Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> though pressed
to it by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and the Bishop of
<hi>London;</hi> resolving rather to venture lite and all things else
which were dear unto him, then to give way to any thing
which he knew to be against the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> expressing his inward
trouble by a stood of tears, page 103.</p>
            <p>Of his Piety and fervent Charity in his last godly Prayer;
wherein he calls upon God, <q>O my Lord God! Bless my
people, save thy chosen people of <hi>England.</hi> O Lord God!

            <p>What better qualities and Principles could be desired in a

            <p>And do not you Mr. Doctor shake hands with the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
rayler <hi>Harding</hi> against our glorious <hi>Iewel.</hi> When you
hear him call'd Rayler, be not displeased. Look on that large
Catalogue of hellish slanders, poured out on that blessed man,
summ'd up by himself immediately before his decease. This
is offered to you the rather, because when you have occasion
to mention <hi>Harding (a base Apostate, and grand enemy of the

               <q>Dr.
<hi>Iohn Harding,</hi> one of the Divines of <hi>Lovain,</hi> and the most
learned of the Colledge, page 128,</q> in the latter part of your
History. But when you speak of those glorious lights of the
Reformation, <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin;</hi> it is barely
<hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Iohn Calvin,</hi> as all along your History is evident.
That <hi>Rabshakeh Harding,</hi> dipt his Pen in the same gall and

attended and guarded with Princely routs behinde and
before. And thereof ye make no small account, specially
in respect of our estate, which you call beggarly. In such
disdain the Heathen sometime said, That Christ was the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garliest
and poorest of all the Gods that were in Heaven.
Howbeit, our Bishopricks, saving that certain of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have shamefully spoil'd them, are now even as they
were before; certainly the poorest Bishoprick in <hi>England,</hi>
as it is reported, is better in revenues, then some three or
four of your Popes <hi>Italian</hi> Bishopricks in the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples.</hi> Howbeit, the Gospel of Christ standeth not by
riches, but by truth. In comparison of the one, we make
small reckoning of the other.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Had that glorious King lived to perfect the Reformation
(<hi>which you would have accounted an infelicity to the Church</hi>)
and taken away more of her Patrimony; yet if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Right Learned Prelate <hi>Iewel,</hi> he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok't
in all those grants made by his Predecessors: See his
Defence page 639. <q>If our Kings in that darkness and blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the former times, gave them these things of their
own accord and liberality, for Religions sake, Now, saith he,
when the ignorance and error is espied out, may the Kings
their Successors take them away again, seeing they have the
same authority the Kings their Ancestors had before. For
the gift is void, except it be allowed by the will of the Giver,
and that cannot seem a perfect will, which is dimmed and
hindered by error.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing, Mr. Doctor, to be spoken to, is the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
it self; whose History you present to us. And in
p. 34. p. 1. you write, <q>That neither to lose time, nor press too
much at once upon the people, it was thought fit to smooth
the way to the Reformation, by setting out some prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
injunctions; this to be done, by sending out Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners,
accompanied with certain godly Preachers; who
when they went from the people, left behinde them Homilies
to instruct the people. The Preachers abovementioned,
were more particularly instructed to perswade the people
from praying to Saints, for the dead; from adoring of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56431:6"/>
Images, from the use of Beads, Ashes, and Processions; from
Mass, Dirges, praying in unknown languages</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>All which was done to this intent, That the people in all
places being prepared, by little and little might with more
ease, and less opposition, admit the total alteration, which was
intended in due time to be introduced. You mention also cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
injunctions appointed for the Bishops, that they should
personally preach once a quarter in their Diocess; that they
should cause their Chaplains to Preach; that they should
Ordain none, but such as were learned in the Scriptures.
There was also a Form of Bidding-prayer prescribed, or
bidding of the Beads, as you say it was then commonly called
in page 37. You lead us next to the Parliament, page 47.
which took beginning the 4.<note place="margin">Note.</note> of <hi>November;</hi> in which you tell
us of packing the Cardes by Sir <hi>Ralph Sadler;</hi> that this
Parliament, without any sensible alteration of the Members,
continued till the death of the King; and you say, page 48.
a great part of the Nobility, and not a few of the chief
Gentry were cordially affected to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> In
the same page you tell us, that several Acts were repeal'd,
which touched the Subject in life or liberty for matter of
conscience; by which repeal, you say, all men had a liberty
of reading Scriptures, and being in a manner their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors,
(<hi>which you scruple whether it may be counted for a
felicity.</hi>)</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There was an Act, you say in the same page, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
page, against such as spake against the Sacrament of the
Altar, and for the receipt thereof in both kinds; with these
Provisoes notwithstanding:—If necessity did not
otherwise require; as in the case of suddain sickness, and
other such like extremities, that wine could not be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the use of the Sacrament, nor the sick man depart this
life in peace without it. And secondly, that the permitting of
this liberty to the people of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> should not be constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the condemning of any other Church, in which the
contrary was observed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The next great business you say, page 50. was, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of a Statute made in the 27. year of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. By
which all Chanteries, Colledges, Free-Chappels, and Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56431:6"/>
were permitted to the King during his life; but dying
before he had taken many of them into his hands, the great
ones of the Court not being willing to lose so rich a booty,
it was set on foot again, and carried in this present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And you say page 51. these Chanteries consisted
of Salaries allowed to one or more Priests, to say daily
Mass for the souls of their deceased Founders and their
friends.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But in the same page you say, That which made the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
alteration, and threatned most danger to the State
Ecclesiastical, was the Act for Election of Bishops, and what
seals and styles should be used by Spiritual persons. In the
compounding of which Act you say (in the same page) there
was more danger couched, then at first appeared; for you
say it was the intent of the Contrivers, to weaken the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Episcopal Order, by forcing them from their
strong Hold of Divine Institution, and making them no
other then the Kings Ministers, only his Ecclesiastical She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs;
and such use was made of this Act, that the Bishops
were not in a capacity of conferring Orders, but as they
were impowered by especial Licence; the tenour whereof
you mention page 52. and in the same place you say, The
true drift of the design of this Act, was to make Deans and
Chapters useless for the time to come, and thereby to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them for dissolution.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The next Church-business you mention, is page 55. where
you tell us, the first heats of the Visitation beginning to cool,
there were two Orders sent forth for the taking down of
Images.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Page 57. you tell us, Some godly Bishops and other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Religious men were busily imploy'd in the Castle of
<hi>Windsor,</hi> appointed by the Kings Command to consult
about one uniform Order for the administring the holy
Communion in the English Tongue, under both kindes of
Bread and Winde, according to Act of Parliament before
mentioned. You are in the dark who the persons were, but
you think they were the same which made the Liturgy in
this Kings time; and you say, being convened together, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
into consideration as well the right rule of Scripture,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56431:7"/>
as the usage of the Primitive Church (<hi>How doth this appear
good Dector</hi>) agreed on such a form and order as might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the intention of the King and the Act of Parliament,
without giving (<hi>note these following words good Sir</hi>) any just
offence to the Romish party, for they so ordered it, that the
whole office of the Mass should proceed, as formerly in the
Latine Tongue, even to the very end of the Canon, and the
receiving of the Sacrament by the Priest himself; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
passed over, they began with an exhortation: Dearly
beloved in the Lord, ye coming to this holy Communion,
which afterwards remained in the publick Liturgy. Then
followed the invitation: You that do truly repent, &amp;c. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
to the general confession—distribution of the
Sacrament to the people upon their knees; which godly
Form you say was presented to the King, and published by
Proclamation; which Proclamation you have at large,
page 58, 59.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The next care was you say, page 59. to send abroad print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
copies to the several Bishops: But now you come to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the chief Key to the whole work of Reformation the
Liturgy (as you phrase it) page 65. and the same men which
drew up the Order for the holy Communion, were now
again imploy'd as you confess, page 64. <hi>Calvin</hi> being reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
though offering his assistance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Liturgy you say is finished, accepted by the King,
Enacted by Lords and Commons then assembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though you say the passing of the Act gave great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to the Romish Party; not that they could except
against it,<note place="margin">Note.</note> in regard either of the matter or manner of it;
but because it was communicated to the people in the vulgar
Tongue, page 66. Which exception you take a great deal of
pains to prove to be an error.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You tell us page 106. That the Reformation under King
<hi>Edward</hi> proceeded more vigorously then before, by review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Liturgy, and composing of a book of Articles. You
say page 107. <hi>Calvin</hi> and his followers had taken some of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
at some parts thereof, and did excite the King and
Council to a further Reformation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And you say he prevaild so far in the first two years, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56431:7"/>
in the Convocation there were debates about such doubts
as had arisen about some things contained in the Common-prayer
book; but you say, page 107. and 108. not one alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
made in it. For though you say it was brought under
a review, and being so reviewed, was ratified by Act of
Parliament; yet by the tenour of the Act you mention, it
doth appear first, That there was nothing contained in the
said first book, but what was agreeable to the Word of God,
and the Primitive Church. Secondly, That such doubts as
had been raised in the use and exercise thereof, proceeded
rather from the curiosity of the Minister and mistakers, then
any worthy cause: they are the very words of the Act as you
quote them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, Mr. Doctor, you might have spared your
pains, <hi>p.</hi> 108. in seeking the names of those good and godly
men, by whom it was altered for (<hi>bona fide</hi>) there was no
alteration at all, if you will believe your own Book.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You tell us <hi>p. 121, 122. part</hi> 1. of the hand the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had in canvasing the Articles of Religion: but you que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whether they had any such hand in reviewing the
Liturgy; and you speak of digesting of such alterations; as
were considered and resolved on, but shew not what they
were in the least, and possibly you say it might recieve the
like authority from the Convocation (<hi>you cannot say it did
receive</hi>) as the book of Articles had. But whether so or not,
say you, it received as much authority and countenance as
could be given unto it by an Act of Parliament, by which it
was imposed, you say, upon the subject under penalties—
(A worthy foundation for divine service.)</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And then <hi>page 121. p.</hi> 1. Mr. Doctor, you begin to triumph,
as if you had got a firm bottom for the Liturgy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Liturgy
(you say) thus setled and confirmed in Parliament, was by the
Kings command—And <hi>p.</hi> 123. you say, we have seen a
reformation made in point of doctrine and setled in the
forms of worship, the superstitions and corruptions of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> entirely abrogated (<hi>good news if it were
true</hi>) and all things recteifed according to the <hi>Word of God,
(How prove you this, Sir</hi>) and the Primitive practice (<hi>we can
see nothing, but an Act of Parliament.</hi>)</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56431:8"/>
               <q> This is all account you give us in your History of the
Reformation of the Church, in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
sixth, saving that p. 125. you speak something of Holy dayes,
and Fasting dayes, which were to be abolished or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But possibly more may be behind: we shall not follow you
in your History of the Church in the reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
when the Reformation by your own confession went down
the wind, and the professors and assertors of it persecuted in
all parts of the Nation.</p>
            <p>We shall therefore pass on with you to the times of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and see what was more done to the repairing and
carrying on this work.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And when we consider, what you say in the 103. page of
your History of her reign, that she retained such as had
been of privy Council to Queen <hi>Mary</hi> her sister, to be of
her Council:</q> of which according as you have set them down
there were thirteen, of which one was an Archbishop, and
adding but seven to them, it cannot in reason be imagined,
that Church reformation should be so far from growing to
perfection, that it is more likely to decrease and wither.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And so it proved, for the Parliament that was summoned
which passed an Act as you say <hi>p.</hi> 110, 111. for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
and imposing the Book of Common Prayer, and
administration of the Sacraments, took care to revise the
book, and to make alterations and corrections, (<hi>now Mr.
Doctor we have found some alterations in the Liturgy, and
what are they</hi>) why say you, <hi>p.</hi> 111. great care was taken for
expunging (<hi>mark Mr. Doctor</hi>) all such passages in it,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as might
give any scandal or offence to the Popish party: in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany
(<hi>you say</hi>) the Pope and his detestable enormity were
expunged, as giving offence: and in the delivery of the
Sacrament, though by <hi>Calvins</hi> means (<hi>as you say</hi>) some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
had been made in the second Liturgy in King
<hi>Edwards</hi> time,<note place="margin">Note.</note> now it is returned back into the first form:
and besides (<hi>you say</hi>) a whole Rubrick was expunged as not
favouring (the <hi>figment</hi>) of Transubstantiation,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and not only
so, but there was made alteration in the Bread of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Alters, and the standing of them, in gestures, vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56431:8"/>
musick and what not? by which compliances (<hi>with</hi>
Rome <hi>your plain dealing is commendable)</hi> the book was made
so passable (<hi>you say,</hi> p. 111.) amongst the Papists, that they
repaired to our Parish Churches without scruple.<note place="margin">Note.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And to give us a more full account of the State of Religion
in these times: you tell us, <hi>p. 172. part 2.</hi> Such a well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
piety did at that time appear in the Devotions of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> that generally the English Papists still
resorted to them: moreover you tell us, <hi>p. 131.</hi> that
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> doing all this in the form and fashion of
our devotions, did so far satisfie the Pope then being, that
he shewed himself willing to confirm all by his Papal power,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
and that <hi>Parpalio</hi> was instructed to offer in the name of his
Holiness, that the English Liturgy should be confirmed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And now you triumph again, <hi>p. 173. part 2.</hi> as if the
matter were past all doubt; telling us, Thus we have seen
the publick Liturgy confirmed in Parliament, with divers
penalties on all those who either did reproach it, or neglect
to use it, or willfully withdrew their attendance from it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But pray you Sir, look back to what you say of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
which confirmed the Liturgy,<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>p. 107.</hi> there wanted
not (<hi>say you</hi>) some rough and furious spirits in the house of
Commons, who eagerly opposed all propositions which
seemed to tend unto the prejudice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
of which number, none so violent as <hi>Story</hi> Doctor of the
Laws, and a great instrument of <hi>Bonners</hi> butcheries;<note place="margin">Note.</note> others
there were (<hi>say you</hi>) and doubtless many others also in the
house of Commons, who had as great a zeal as he to the
Papal interest.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, Mr. Doctor, we have travailed over your History,
and have pickt up and laid together, the several pieces of
this goodly building<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you call it, that you and others may
have the full prospect of it at once, and for the integrity of
this action in these quotations, we appeal to the great search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of hearts.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, would you have the world satisfied in such a
Reformation? Can the conscience of a Protestant comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
repose it self on such a foundation as you have here laid?
We gladly embrace the reformation of Doctrine contained in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56431:9"/>
the book of Articles, because we see (blessed be God) they
have a clear and full authority from the Holy Scriptures: but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Sir, you have dealt very deceitfully with your readers in your
History, in jumbling Doctrine, Discipline, and Worship to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
as if, because there was a Reformation in Doctrine,
and that grounded upon the Word of God, there must also
be a Reformation in the rest too (which was little or not at all)
and that grounded upon the Word also; this deceit runs
through your book: you tell us ever and anon of a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
according to the Word of God and the Primitive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:
but in all your book there are but three instances of
the conformity of the Reformation to the rule of the Sacred
Scriptures, and they are only in point of Doctrine, and not in
Discipline or Worship.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The first instance is <hi>p.</hi> 49 of your History of <hi>Edward</hi> the
sixth, where having mentioned an Act of Parliament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
that it is according to Scripture, that the Sacrament
be administered to all Christian people under both the kinds
of Bread and Wine: you spend a great many lines borrowed
out of Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> to prove that this Declaration of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and the words by which it was enacted, do every
way agree with Christs institution:</q> 
               <hi>no Protestant, not</hi> John
Calvin <hi>your great eyesore, will deny you this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second instance is <hi>p.</hi> 66. where you mention the Popish
exceptions against the Act confirming the Common Prayer
not to be upon any other account, but because it was in the
vulgar tongue, and then you run out into a large discourse to
prove that prayer ought to be made in a tongue understood
of the common people; the like you do <hi>p. 157. part 2. Calvin
and</hi> Cartwright <hi>that firebrand, as you call him, will conform Mr.
Doctor to this Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third instance is <hi>p.</hi> 67. where you take notice of an
Act for advancing the work of Reformation, which took
away all Laws forbidding Ministers marriage, in allowance
whereof you spend many lines: in this Mr. Doctor the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian</hi>
and <hi>Zuinglian</hi> faction concur with you.</p>
            <p>These are all the Presidents of Scripture or Primitive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
you alledge in your whole book for the Reformation of
the Church, and in matters of this nature so evident and clear
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56431:9"/>
out of the word of God; amongst all the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
as you call them, you shall not have one dissenter, or Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist.</p>
            <p>And because you mention a memorable challenge publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> against the Romish Clergy, who injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
you say, pag. 129. part. 2. upbraided the Church of
<hi>England</hi> with the imputation of Novelty, and charged it with
teaching such opinion, as were not to be found before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
time; the <hi>Calvinian</hi> and <hi>Zuinglian</hi> faction which you
so blot with your learned pen will willingly be his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds
in this challenge.</p>
            <p>Nay, Sir, the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Gospellers do renew this Challenge
against the sacred Hierarchy, (as you <hi>call</hi> it) in the same
terms as you deliver the stout and gallant challenge of that
Learned Prelate <hi>Iewel,</hi> against the Romish Clergy.</p>
            <q>The <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Gospellers challenge,</q>
            <p>
               <hi>If any learned man of our Adversaries be able to bring one
sufficient sentence out of the holy Scripture, or any one example
of any Bishop, Minister, or Martyr, either in the time of King</hi>
Edward <hi>the sixth, viz.</hi> Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley, Hooper,
Farrar, Philpot, Bradford, Taylor, <hi>or any other, or in the times
of Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>out of Reverend</hi> Jewel, <hi>who do directly and</hi>
ex professo <hi>plead for, and commend the present Liturgie in the
frame of it, or that Episcopacy is</hi> Jure divino, <hi>or for Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
toward the Altar, Bowing at the name of Iesus, sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the sign of the Cross, wearing of Caps, and Surplices,
kneeling at the Sacrament, or for the exercise of Church power
by lay-Chancellors; if you, Reverend Sir, or any other be able to
produce any such authority or example, contending as you do
professedly for these things, the</hi> Zuinglian <hi>Gospellers will be then
content to yield and subscribe.</hi> These are the things M. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
which administer trouble to the Church of God at this
day. Satisfie but our consciences, that these things, ought to
be continued in the Church, &amp; we have done: We beseech you
read this passage of Reverend <hi>Iewel</hi> in a Sermon preached
by him in St. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> it is in the beginning of the
Book, called his Defence of the Apology, pag. 6. <q>This only,
saith he, will I speak, and that in a word, They which brought
in Transubstantiation, Masses, calling upon Saints, sole life, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56431:10"/>
Images, Vows, trifles, follies, bables into the Church
of God, have delivered new things, and which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
never heard of, whatsoever they Crie or Crake, they
bring not a jot out of the Word of God. And these, as I
have said, are the things wherewith the Church of God is
disquieted at this day: upon these lieth the watch, and ward
of the Church. These they honour instead of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and force them on the people instead of the word of
God, upon these men suppose their salvation and the summ of
Religion to be grounded. And that which is much more
grievous, notwithstanding at this present by the great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, religion is restored (note Mr. Doctor) almost
(not to the lustre you Mr. Doctor imagine) to her former
dignity and light, yet (poor and pitifull fouls!) they set great
store by these things, they to them again, and teach them
(do you see, Mr. Doctor) as though without them the Church
could not be in safety. O if the Word of God might be
heard among so many clamours, and in so great a Hurly burly;
if we would suffer God himself to sit as Judge in his own
case, the matter would be passed over with less tumult a great
deal, and more easily might we agree about the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Wherefore if all the worship of God, all godliness, all
religion be to be sought out of the word of God: if the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men have miserably perverted all things in all times;
let us my Brethren (<hi>beware Doctor</hi>) unto whom the office of
teaching is allotted. Consider how dangerous a thing it is to
speak more: and let all who will be, and will have themselves
accounted to be Christians, remember how dangerous a
thing it is to believe more.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You say, Mr. Doctor, pag. 130, 131. Reverend <hi>Iewel</hi> in
his learned writings, is a magazin of all sorts of learning, and
that all our Controversors have, since he wrote, furnisht
themselves with Arguments and authorities from him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If you have been so well acquainted with his writings as you
pretend to in your history, you would not have presented the
Churches reformation to be so glorious and splendid as you
have done, and would have pitcht it on a better bottom, then
the authority of two acts of Parliaments, the members where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
you have rendred in your history to be too much swayed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56431:10"/>
in their votings and actings by wordly Popish and politick
respects.</p>
            <p>We do highly reverence the memory of our first Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but is it meet to Idolize them? why should not the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments
of succeding times do the work of the Lords house
according to the light and temper of their generation, as
well as they did in theirs? and why should not the present Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
who (according to the character of his most Excellent
Majesty our Gracious Soveraign) are known to be men of
great sufficiency for Learning, prompt them and put them
on such a work? Is it not a dishonour to the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> after so many years standing to be fed with the dish
and spoon, and suck-bottle, provided for her infancy?</p>
            <p>And must it be still with us in matters Ecclesiastical, as <hi>Spain</hi>
would have it to be in Civils, to be wards to the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> that we may not espouse a thorough-Reformation, for
fear of the Popes curse, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> rage?</p>
            <p>For this (Mr. Doctor all along your history) was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
our first Pilots steered by, pag. 58. part. 1. and in pag. 103.
part. 2. <q>You say Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> resolved to proceed to a
Reformation as the times should serve: so also pag. 116.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Do you not tell us, pag. 12, 13. <q>That though the Letters
written by Prince <hi>Edward</hi> to his father, may be used as good
evidences of his great proficiency with reference to the times
in which he lived; Yet in our days, in which either the wits
of men are sooner ripe, or the method of teaching more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
and facile, they would be found to contain nothing which
is more then ordinary? And speaking of Doctor <hi>Ridley</hi> one
of the greatest of them, pag. 53. you say, he was a man of
great learning as the times then were.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And shall our ripe witted times, and more exact methods
every way, bow down to their dull forms and paterns?
Our heavenly Master (the only Arch-bishop of our souls) had
intrusted them with two talents, and they (take it so) traded
faithfully, and gained other two talents: and shall not we, who
have five talents committed to us, labour to be faithfull in a
like proportion?</p>
            <p>We have justly separated from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
have departed from her, because she hath departed from the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56431:11"/>
Word of God: what she had remaining according to the
Scriptures in doctrine or worship, the Protestant Churches
have retained, and embraced, not because it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by her, but because they saw it founded
on the Word of God. And (Mr. Doctor) <hi>England</hi>
hath been numbred among the Protestant Churches, and
your title page tells of a history of the Reformation of the
Church of <hi>England:</hi> a Reformation of what, but of the
Idolatries, Errors, Heresies, Superstitions, and Corruptions (it
should be so) which the pride, avarice, ambition of many of
the blind Ring-leaders in the Romish Clergy had brought
into it? There are yet such things remaining in the worship
and appendents to it in the Church of <hi>England</hi> (for with the
doctrine we meddle not, the blood of the Martyrs shed in the
defence of it alone by the Word of God, hath washed away
the Romish filth cast into it) which are visibly seen, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
in the Romish Churches. We have before named
them, but that you may know where our shoe wrings us, and
what are our just scruples; We tell you again, that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Liturgy is <hi>tantum non</hi> the Romish Mass. Do not you tell us,
pag. 76. that King <hi>Edward</hi> tells his Popish Rebells, <q>It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
saith he, somewhat altered, and pag. 66. That the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Mass (which used to be served up in Latine) into
English, was the cause why the Romish party were offended
with the Act confirming the Common-prayer book.<note place="margin">Note.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We say also, The <hi>Ius divinum</hi> of Episcopacy, <hi>i. e.</hi> Prelacy,
Bowing toward the Altar, Bowing at the name of Jesus, sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the sign of the Cross, holy Vestments, Kneeling at
the Sacrament, these are found most evidently in the tents of
Popery.</p>
            <p>How come they then to be found in the Protestant Church
of <hi>England?</hi> Hath she received them from Scripture? Where is
any thing there that gives the least shadow? Shew us, good Dr.
And therefore these are some dreggs of that disease, and some
reliques of those abominations which <hi>England</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with in the times of Papacy; which through a
strong Zeal to these in some, State-policy in others, and a fear
of giving offence to the Romish party at home and abroad in
others of our State and Church Physicians, have not to this
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56431:11"/>
day been purged out, but suffered to remain.</p>
            <p>But you will say,<note place="margin">Objection.</note> it may be, Mr. Doctor, that the Apostles
rule,<note place="margin">Concio Synod. pag. 29.</note> Let all things be done decently and in order, will
warrant all these things (tending to decency and good
order.)</p>
            <p>This is a rule of Natures teaching, for the Apostle tells the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> to whom he spake,<note place="margin">Solution.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13, 14. Jugde in
your selves,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14 40. explained.</note> Is it comely that a woman pray unto God unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered?
doth not nature it self teach you, that if a man have
long Hair, it is a shame unto him? And in chap. 14. of the
same Epistle, where these words are, ver. 40. he taxeth some
for over-priding themselves in their gifts, not aiming at the
Edification of the Church, ver. 5. and saith he, <hi>ver.</hi> 23.
If the whole Church be come together in some place, and all
speak with tongues, and there come in some that are unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or unbelievers, will not they say, that ye are mad? And in
ver. 29, 30. That the Prophets should speak but one at a
time, and the rest should hold their peace, while any one
speaketh. And in ver. 34, 35. he gives order, That women
should not speak in the Church, and saith, It is a shame (that is,
it is not decent, as the speaking of many at once, was not
orderly) for women to speak in the Church. And then he
concludes with a general rule founded in nature, Let all
things be done decently and in order, ver. 40. What is here
(Mr. Doctor) to warrant any such things as are before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
which neither nature nor reason direct to, but are taken
up by the will and pleasure of men, and receive their legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
not by any connaturalness to the worship of God,
but by forinsecall Canons and Constitutions? Let us put the
case thus, Mr. Doctor.</p>
            <p>Suppose you, or some of the Prebends of <hi>Westminster</hi> should
forsake your Cloyster, and go down into the Countrey, to
some one of your Parsonages, and coming among an ignorant
and unlearned people, should officiate the Liturgy after the
Roman order, and so turn the Common-Prayer into the
Mass again; Or suppose you should preach to them in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
Greek, or Latine, which they understand not: or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
while you are preaching in the Abbey, another of your
fellow-Prebends, puffed up with his knowledge and gifts,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56431:12"/>
should at the same time take upon him to stand up and speak
together with you; Or that women should usurp authority
to speak, or teach, thinking they can speak more to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the people, then you or any of your Brethren:
in these cases this rule of the Apostle is to be prest and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
Let all things be done decently and in order; for to
remedy such unnaturall disorders and confusions, the Apostle
left it; and your <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Gospellers are as much as your
self for this decency in the church.</p>
            <p>But you will reply,<note place="margin">Object.</note> Mr. Doctor, These things, though they
be indifferent, yet the Church having judged them meet and
expedient to be used in the worship of God, it becomes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man to observe them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Pierce <hi>his</hi> Concio Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, pag. 37.</note> though they have not any express
warrant in the Word; there is nothing in the Word against
them, and there is an express command to obey the laws
and constitutions of our Superiors, and therefore obedience
is due, though not for the things themselves, yet for the
Authorities sake enjoyning them.</p>
            <p>In answer to this weighty objection,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> we shall propose these
Queries,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Whether the talent of Authority be faithfully and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid out and improved in making that necessary, which
God in his Word hath in silence past by, and so left indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent?
We do not dislike Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> his <hi>Scala of Obedience</hi>
mentioned pag. 33. of his <hi>Synodica Concio, à Synodo ad Regem à
Rege statim ad Deum:</hi> that we must proceed in the path of our
obedience from the Convocation to the King, from the King
immediately to God: we are very well pleased with this order
(though the Doctor would have it otherwise, pag. 39.) We
know, God hath tied every soul to be subject unto the higher
powers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. and God requires the higher powers to
be subject unto himself, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Whether by parity of reason, Authority may free us, where
God hath bound us, as bind us to observe such things where
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God hath left us free? Whether if Authority judge it meet to
bind us to indifferents, such things be to be enjoyned, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
offence to the Reformed Churches abroad, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good men at home, and link us in a conformity to that
Church, from which in many other things we have separated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:56431:12"/>
We shall take a little liberty to debate upon this last Querie,
waving at present the two former. We shall speak first to the
first branch.</p>
            <p>First therefore, we say, that the things before mentioned,
Liturgy, Vestments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been an offence to the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Churches abroad. You tell us, pag. 79. part. 1. <q>That
<hi>Bucer</hi> (who was sent for over to be <hi>Regius Professor</hi> in
<hi>Cambridge</hi>) was not well satisfied in some particular branches
of the Liturgy: you tell us, he had given an account to
<hi>Calvin</hi> of the English Liturgy, desiring a Letter from him
to the Lord Protector, which you say, pag. 80. proved the
occasion of much trouble to the Church, and Orders of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In this Letter, you say, <hi>Calvin</hi> approving well enough of
set forms of Prayer, descends particularly to the English Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
and makes it his advice (<hi>it is wholsome counsel Mr.
Doctor, and for this alone, your rash pen flings so much scorn on
that learned and blessed man</hi>) that all these Ceremonies should
be abrogated, that he should go forwards to reform the
Church without fear, (<hi>but not, as you say, without wit</hi>) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regard of peace at home, or correspondency abroad, such
considerations being to be had in Civil matters, but not in
matters of the Church, wherein (<hi>as you quote his own words
in latine in your Margin</hi>) not any thing is to be exacted
which is not warranted by the Word (<hi>doth not</hi> Jewel <hi>say so?</hi>)
and in the managing whereof there is not any thing more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastefull
in the eyes of God then worldly wisdom, either in
moderating, cutting off, or going backwards, but meerly as
we are directed by his will revealed. You tell us in the same
page, he toucheth on the Book of Homilies, permits them very
faintly for a season, (<hi>you say</hi>) but by no means allows of them
for along continuance, or to be looked on as a rule of the
Churches, or constantiy to serve for the instruction of the
people.</q> Would you have it so, Mr. Doctor? The Church and
people of God are then little beholding to you: The Churches
rule is the Word of God, and the people of God have found
far better helps for their instruction by painfull and able
Preachers (and hope it shall be so still) then the reading
of a Homily by a simple non-preaching Curate.</p>
            <p>You add concerning <hi>Calvin,</hi> pag. 80. That he must needs
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56431:13"/>
trouble the Protector about the Ceremonies, that he writes to
him (you quote his own words in the Margin) to this effect,
you say, <q>That the Papists would grow insolenter every day
then other, unless the differences were composed about the
Ceremonies: But how, say you? not by reducing the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
to conformity (<hi>which it seems you would have</hi>) but by
encouraging them rather in their opposition, and that he
solicited the Protector in behalf of <hi>Hooper,</hi> who was then
fallen into some trouble about the Ceremonies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Do not you see, Mr. Doctor, that these Ceremonies have
ever been the occasion of trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You tell us next of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> a great and eminent
Divine (as you report him) pag. 97. part. 1. yet pag. 92.
you tell us, That Caps and Surplices were utterly opposed by
him, That he thinks it (you quote his own words in your
Margin) most expedient to the good of the Church that
they and all others of that kind should be taken away. And
he gives (you say this reason for it) That where such Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
were so stifly contended for, which were not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
and supported by the Word of God, there common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
men (<hi>lay your hand upon your heart, Doctor</hi>) were
less solicitous of the substance of religion, then they were of
the circumstances of it; and you say, he tells of himself in
one of his Epistles, that he had never used the Surplice when
he lived in <hi>Oxford,</hi> though he were then a Canon of <hi>Christs-Church,</hi>
and frequently present in the Quire.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You tell us, pag. 107. part. 1. That <hi>Calvin</hi> desiring esteem
here in <hi>England</hi> as well as in other places, writes to King
<hi>Edward</hi> (after the Refomation had gone as far forward as
ever it went) that many things were still amiss in <hi>England,</hi>
which needed Reformation.</p>
            <p>Thus (Sir) by your own confessions, Liturgy and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
have been an offence and trouble to the Reformed
Churches abroad, <hi>Martin Bucer, Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi>
the glorious lights of these Churches, men of renown in the
Church of God, have strugled and born witness against them.
The last but not the least of which three worthies (for he is the
chiefest of the three) Mr. <hi>Iohn Calvin</hi> (then whom the
Church of God since the time of the Apostles never had a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56431:13"/>
more choice and happy instrument both for learning, piety,
wisdom, moderation and diligence) you and most of the sacred
Hierarchy, as you stile it, do still decry and vilifie as <hi>Iosephs</hi>
Brethren did him, because he brings your evil report amongst
the Churches, and cries down your <hi>Diana</hi> (Liturgy and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies)
as not warranted by the Word, and so not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
in the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Never shall you or any man by all your starcht Oratory,
bring Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> out of credit in the Churches of God, they
have tasted such a soul edifying and strengthning sweetness
in his learned and happy labours, that you may assoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the Church of God that the Sun is dark, and Honey
bitter, as that Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> was not a heavenly spiritual holy
man. But this is no new thing (Mr. Doctor) to hit men (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to see the Church perfectly reformed) in the teeth with
<hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> as if they were a couple of pestilent
fellows, of whom all men that loved themselves or the Church
had need to beware. How is your History all along
chequered with <hi>Calvin, Zuinglius,</hi> and the <hi>Calvinian</hi> and
<hi>Zuinglian</hi> faction? as your betters (Mr. Doctor) will honour
and have honoured these blessed men (for see what a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> gives of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> in page 360.
of his defence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> saith he, <q>
                  <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and <hi>Hulderike
Zuinglius</hi> are most excellent men, even sent of God to give
light to the whole world)</q> so worse men then you (we are
sorry to see you tread so much in their steps) have laboured
to make this the reproach of our chief Reformers, that they
have been too much addicted unto <hi>Calvin.</hi> You may read
a passage in Bishop <hi>Iewels</hi> Preface to his defence or to the
Reader, where in the tenth page are these words. <q>He telleth
the world, saith Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> (meaning <hi>Harding</hi>) Mr. <hi>Iewel</hi>
is the open enemy of the Church, Mr. <hi>Iewel</hi> is the enemy of
God,</q> Mr. <hi>Iewel</hi> honoureth that Idol <hi>Calvin,</hi> more then
Jesus Christ, so that you see (Doctor) Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> had a very
high if not too high an esteem of <hi>Calvin,</hi> whose assistance in
our reformation <hi>Cranmer</hi> rejected, and whom you have so
causelesly asperst.</p>
            <p>Not only the reformed Churches abroad, but also many
holy and learned men (who suffered Martyrdom in Queen
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56431:14"/>
               <hi>Maries</hi> time) have had a continual grudge against the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
profest their dislike of them, and suffered as Non-conformists
in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth. And to
make this evident, we will use no other proof, but your own
history.</p>
            <p>And if you please to compare the number of those that were
for the Ceremonies, with those that were against them (though
preferment and ease, Mr. Doctor, will never want numbers)
we shall find (considering the bias of preferment) no great
odds, between their numbers, as you have cast up the account
for us.</p>
            <p>You cannot tell us certainly, who were the compilers of
the Liturgy, for <hi>page</hi> 57. You say, you think they were such
as you there name, but <hi>p. 126. p.</hi> 2. Having occasion to
mention Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Coronation, and wondring that
the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> should refuse to Crown her, having his first
preferments from her Father; you say this Bishop assisted in
the composing of the publick Liturgy, and appeared forward
in the Reformation, but afterwards he was one of those which
were sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to tender the submission of this Kingdom
to the Pope then living; upon this ground he refused to
Crown Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> this was one whom you call <hi>Thomas
Goodwick, p. 57. p.</hi> 1. Sure you will set him aside, as not fit
to be reckoned: and besides him you reckon thirteen more,
who (you think) compiled the Liturgy. <q>And amongst these you
very often glory in <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> whom you call a
learned, stout, and resolute Prelate,</q> 
               <hi>p. 78. p.</hi> 1. but surely
you have cast a fly into this ointment of their great names,
which doth very much defile and debase their reputation:
when you tell us, <hi>p. 103. p.</hi> 1. <q>That these two moved King
<hi>Edward</hi> so importunately to license, or at least to connive
at the exercice of the Romifh Religion by the Princess <hi>Mary,</hi>
that they forc't tears from him, whereupon, you say, with
admiration they withdrew.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You bestow no encomiums on any other in all your history
of Kings <hi>Edwards</hi> time, but on these two, who were so stiffe
in point of Ceremonies: these are your only sticklers for
them.</p>
            <p>On the other side you say, <hi>p. 90. p. 1. Iohn Hooper</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56431:14"/>
Bishop of <hi>Gloucester</hi> (whom you commend for his
constant Preaching, and learned writings, and note his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
that the King bestowed on him the Bishoprick of
<hi>Gloucester</hi> without his seeking) applying himself to the Arch-Bishop
for his consecration, desires to be forborn in some
Ceremonies at his hands, and to be dispensed with for the
oath of Canonical obedience to his Metropolitan. <hi>Cranmer</hi>
and <hi>Ridley</hi> would, you say, by no means yield. And the
King being moved by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> wrote to the
Archbishop (which Letter you mention, <hi>p. 91. p.</hi> 1.) in
favour of <hi>Hooper:</hi> notwithstanding this gracious Letter,
you say, the two Bishops would not obey the King: but
<hi>Hooper</hi> persisting in his obstinacy and willfull humour (as you
term it) was for his disobedience and contempt committed
prisoner.</p>
            <p>Here you see a good man, and a designed Bishop, boggle at
the Ceremonies, and choosing a prison before conformity; he
could not swallow these gnats, though lapt up in so great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and preferments.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Ridley</hi> and he came together to the stake in the
times of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> did <hi>Hooper</hi> or <hi>Ridley</hi> then sigh out a
recantation: <hi>Hooper</hi> for his indiscreet obstinacy, or <hi>Ridley</hi> for
his unchristian and unbrotherly rigor? look on what you
say (Mr. Doctor) on this occasion, you tell us <hi>page</hi> 51. in the
history of <q>Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
               </q> that <hi>Hooper</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> being both
prisoners (<hi>you see, Mr. Doctor, what dealing both Conformists
and Non-conformists receive at the hands of</hi> Rome, <hi>if we think
to charm her with some fond compliances, we are mistaken</hi>) the
<q>Controversie concerning the Episcopal habit which <hi>Hooper</hi>
refused, reviv'd in Bishop <hi>Ridley's</hi> thoughts; and he writes to
him in these words as you say, <hi>p.</hi> 51. My dear Brother, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as I understand by your books, that we throughly
agree and wholly consent together in those things which are
the grounds and substantial points of our Religion, against
which the world so furiously rageth in these our daies, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
in times past, in certain by-matters and Circumstances
of Religion,<note place="margin">Note.</note> your wisdom and my simplicity (I must confess)
have a little jarred, each of us following—</q>
            </p>
            <p>Do not you perceive (Sir) how his conscience prickt him
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56431:15"/>
for his overhasty violence toward his tender Brother, doth
not he shame himself for his folly in pressing so hard upon the
conscience of his Brother in such by-matters (which <hi>Iewel</hi>
calls bables, follies, trifles) commending his wisdom (which
you brand with obstinacy and a willfull humour) for his gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fortitude in contending against them, even to the loss of
his pretious liberty.</p>
            <p>As stout and resolute a Prelate as he was, yet his courage
comes down, he dares not look death in the face, till he had
washt away the stain and guilt of that unchristian action by
a humble and penitent confession of the folly of it. The wind
of persecution, and the apprehensions of death made a strange
alteration in his thoughts; the dust and cobwebs of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical
dignity and glory, were now blown over, and he sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
perceives a good conscience (holding fast the truth and
standing stedfast in the liberty of the Gospel) to be a more
desireable portion then the Bishoprick of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verily (Mr. Doctor) it is a bad cause which doth not answer
for it self; when death knocks at the door, the hot contests
which you and others sweat in for these by-matters of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
are not like you see to contribute any thing to your
comfort and joy in the evil day.</p>
            <p>You are yet warm in your Cloyster, lined with manifold
favours, your zeal for the Church cannot want its recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;
but sir, it is good to remember your latter end, you
know not, but that your conscience may be then awakened,
and read over this history you have written, and pinch you for
the Errata's of your zeal and charity against your poor Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
we are confident, that much of that you have laid into
the foundation of the Reformation of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
(though you and others judge it gold, silver, pretious stones)
will be found wood, hay and stubble, when he appeareth, who
is like a refiners fire.</p>
            <p>There is one very naughty passage in your book, pag. 38.
part 1. utterly unbecoming the mouth of a Christian, much less
a Doctor of Divinity, where you are not ashamed to say,
<q>That because in the twenty fourth Injunction in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
time, that upon Holy and Festival dayes, it
shall be lawful for men to labour in harvest, you extend this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56431:15"/>
liberty, as well to the Lords day, as the Annual Festivals, and
then you quote an Act of Parliament, to authorize this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and say that by that Act, any man, either in harvest, or
or at any other times in the year (when necessity shall so
require, <hi>who will not pretend necessity</hi>) may labour, ride,
fish, or work any kind of work at their pleasure upon the
Lords day. And you tell us what was done at Court on that
day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, we are confident that the intention of that Act did not
reach to allow so gross a prophanation of the Lords day; and
you that are so versed in Acts of Parliament, (for they are
the only sphere wherein Liturgy and Ceremonies move) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
you find an Act of Parliament restraining this abuse? If
you cannot (which we know you may) it had been the duty
of a Protestant Reformed Doctor of Divinity, to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the evil of such abuses, and to have laboured with all
your might, that such an Act may pass.</p>
            <p>Oh Sir, must Jesus Christ our Lord, have no preheminence
above our Lady? and must <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> be lifted up to an
equality with him, whose shoe-latchet he confessed he was
not worthy to unloose?</p>
            <p>What! have <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> done
as much for us as Jesus Christ? and where is the least hint that
one hour is to be set apart to their honour?</p>
            <p>Must every paltry holy-day be set in equality of reputation
with the Lords day, which Christ sanctified by his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(the accomplishment of a far greater work then that of
Creation) and his Apostles instituted by their constant solemn
Assemblies upon it?</p>
            <p>You say in page 38. part 1. in the latter times, the Lords
day began to be advanced into the reputation of the Jewish
Sabbath; If by latter times, you mean the Apostles times,
it is true, for then it began; and when ever it began, why
should not Christians be as zealous to advance the Lords day
unto the highest pitch of reputation, that ever the Jewish
Sabbath was in (abateing the Ceremonious rigor?) have
not Christians greater obligations, greater encouragements
to glorifie God, and lift up his name, which is Holy, Holy,
Holy?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:56431:16"/>
Oh Mr. Doctor, the time past may suffice you for this folly.
You need not have now told us, that men may do any thing
at their pleasure, if they say they have necessity, on the Lords
day, and seek to establish this mischief by a Law. We would
be loth to be in your coat in the day of the Lord, for your
debasing the Lords day, for the best preferment the Church of
<hi>England</hi> can give us. We say to you, as Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> said to
<hi>Harding, Arripe severitatem Christianam, &amp; palinodiam
cane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well Sir, to go on with our reckoning, you have seen one
Non-conformist, and <hi>Ridley's</hi> recantation for his Prelatical
rigor, which amounts to another, and so he is to be taken off
the file, and you have two less then you had. We shall pass
on with more speed in the numbring up the rest. You tell us,
page 93. part 1. of one <hi>Trins</hi> a Deacon, who refused to wear
the vestments appointed to be worn: Of one Mr. <hi>Iohn
Rogers</hi> Prebend of Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> and Divinity Reader of that
Church, who could never be perswaded to wear them: The
like aversness (as you call it) you ascribe unto Mr. <hi>Iohn
Philpot,</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Winchester,</hi> who suffered in Queen
<hi>Maries</hi> time. So that here you have <hi>Hooper, Ridley</hi> (when
in his cold blood) <hi>Trins, Rogers,</hi> and <hi>Philpot,</hi> all disgusting
these Ceremonies. Many more there were, but these you have
left upon record with your own pen.</p>
            <p>To proceed to the times of Queen <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> you have
heard <hi>Iewels</hi> testimony in part, who was the glory of her
Reign for learning, and you will see it more fully by and by.
You tell us, page 120. part 2. that one <hi>Whitehead</hi> who had
been Chaplain to <hi>Anne Bollen</hi> the Queens mother, was offered
the Archbishoprick of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but you say he refused it,
because he was more inclined to the Presbyterians, then the
Episcopal form of Government.</p>
            <p>And page 123. part 2. you say <hi>Coverdall</hi> waved the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of the Bishoprick of <hi>Oxon,</hi> or any other then vacant,
out of a disaffection to the Habit of that Order.</p>
            <p>And page 124. part 2. you say, <hi>Alexander Nowell</hi> Dean
of Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> Preaching before Queen <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> spake
irreverently of the sign of the Cross, for which she from her
closet window immediately checked him, commanding him to
retire from that ungodly digression.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:56431:16"/>
And page 165. part 2. you tell us that Father <hi>Iohn Fox</hi> the
Martyrologist, being called on to subscribe, appeared before
the Bishop with the New Testament in Greek, To this, said
he, I will subscribe, and if this will not serve, take my Prebend
of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the only preferment I hold in the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and much good may it do you.</p>
            <p>You tell us of <hi>Sampson</hi> Dean of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> who was
deprived, you say, pag. 164. part 2. for refusing to wear the
Habit belonging to his place. You tell us also of one <hi>Hardiman</hi>
page 115. part 2. a Prebend of <hi>Westminster</hi> deprived also, for
throwing down the Altar, and defacing the vestments. And
in the same page you say, both the Professors of divinity in
the two Universites, and <hi>Whitington</hi> Dean of <hi>Durham</hi> were
Non-conformists.</p>
            <p>These instances are your own, and so you have no reason
to except against them. We have not wronged you (<hi>as far as
we know</hi>) in a syllable, and now, Sir, we leave it to you to judge,
Whether the point of conformity to such Ceremonies, (which
have been a continual occasion of offence to the Reformed
Churches, both at home and abroad) be still to be pressed
with accustomed rigor?</p>
            <p>A second branch of the third Querie was, Whether such
Ceremonies which link us in a conformity with that Church,
from which in many other things we have justly separated, be
to be continued and enjoyned? We say, that the Church of
<hi>England</hi> having renounced Communion with the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in all material points of Doctrine, ought in point of
Prudence and Conscience, to reject conformity with her in
Worship and Discipline; for the same reason which moved
us to depart from her doctrinal corruptions, binds us to leave
her to her self in the superstitions of her worship and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
The reason, why we reject Communion with the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> is for that the Popes Supremacy, Infallibility, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
Merit of good works, Invocation of Saints,
Purgatorie, Latine Service, Worshipping of Images, half
Communion, and such like, which are the Pillars of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Fabrick, cannot be proved and made good out of the
Word of God. And is not this reason of like force against the
Ceremonies of that Church yet in use among us? Is there a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56431:17"/>
               <hi>scriptum est</hi> for one of them, without which authority, the
Devil the father of lies, pretends not to be believed and
adored.</p>
            <p>Though Doctor <hi>Pierce</hi> in his <hi>Synod. concio, p.</hi> 44. be pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to lay the maintenance of the Ministry, Infant Baptism, the
Sanctification of the Sabbath, yea the Personalities of the
Godhead, in an even levell of authority, with the Orders of
the Church about Liturgy and Ceremonies, as if the one as
well as the other, must depend on his <hi>Traditionis fulcimentum,</hi>
his shore of Tradition, and would all otherwise fall to the
ground: Yet we can by no means give way to this Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
unscriptural assertion; if he will please to produce but
one Text of Scripture, as fairly concluding for Service-Book
and Ceremonies, as have been and can be produced in great
numbers for those four things, we will never put him to the
trouble of a hard word more; and we shall be as ambitious
to advance the reputation of the Ceremonies, as well as of
the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>You may possibly say, these Ceremonies are small matters,
far from the foundation, and if men had not more of humour
and will in them, then reason or conscience, they might down
with them well onough.</p>
            <p>We might reply, that any action (especially conversant
about the worship of God) not undertaken in faith, is sin;
and faith hath no ground to stand upon, but Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>But we refer you to Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> in the 11. page of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of his preached upon this Text, <hi>Ioshua</hi> 6. Now <hi>Iericho</hi>
was shut up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is bound up in the same Book of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
in the end of it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ioshua<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> (saith that learned Bishop) suffered nothing to
stand, he burnt all together, he left nothing remaining, were
it never so little—In Religion, no part is to be called lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
a hair is but little, yet it hath a shadow, in the body a little
disquiet is often-times cause of death: The Ciniphes are but
little, yet are they reckoned among the great plagues of
God.—<hi>Paul</hi> saith, a little leaven leaveneth the whole
lump. I speak not this, because I think nothing at all may
be left to any special purpose. For even in <hi>Iericho,</hi> where
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56431:17"/>
was made a general destruction, God himself commanded
that all silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron should
be saved, and brought into the Lords Treasury. Howbeit,
the things that may be reserved, must not be dust or chaff,
or hay, or stubble, but gold, and silver, and iron, I mean,
they may not be things meet to furnish (<hi>do you see Doctor</hi>)
and maintain superstition.</q> And if you will know what he
accounts superstition, he tells you in his Reply unto <hi>Hardings</hi>
Answer, page 310. in the ninth Article of the Canopie,
<q>
                  <hi>Moses,</hi> saith he, was commanded to make the Tabernacle,
neither durst <hi>Moses</hi> or his work-men add or diminish, to do
any thing more or less, otherwise then God had appointed
him. <hi>Solomon</hi> built the Temple, but he followed not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
any part of his own fancy, but only that self-same plat
and proportion that God had given to his father, for so saith
<hi>David, I Chron.</hi> 28. Here mark (good Christian Reader,
<hi>saith he</hi>) in these examples God hath bridled our devotion,
and hath taught us to worship him, not in such sort as may
seem good in our eyes, but only as he hath commanded us.
Yet Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> by his cunning, would make use of these
examples to prove, that we may honour God in such sort, as
we of our selves can best devise. This was (saith this learned
Bishop) evermore the very root of all superstition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore Mr. Doctor, I wish you would learn of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
worthy Father <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> as <hi>Iewel</hi> quotes him, page
280. in his Defense. <q>
                  <hi>Discamus Christum ex ipsius voluntate
honorare: Nam qui honoratur, eo maxime honore laetatur,
quem ipse vult, non quem nos optamus.</hi> And because you see
<hi>Chrysostom</hi> cited, give us leave to pass an observation upon
one passage you let fall, in page 123<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> part 2. you are there ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
the beauty of the face of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and this is one part of her comeliness, that the Priests as you
call them, executed not any divine Office but in their Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice,
a vestment set apart for Religious Services, you say
in the Primitive times, as may be gathered, you say, from
<hi>Chrysostom</hi> for the Eastern Churches, and from Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>
for the Western.</q> But Sir, what if this vestment come not
from the Primitive times, but from the usages of the Heathen.
Then either <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> were mistaken in saying
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56431:18"/>
so, or you have abused their names, in fathering an heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
vanity on them, and the Primitive times.</p>
            <p>Pray you, hear the Right Learned <hi>Iewel,</hi> page 281. of his
Defense. <q>Neither, saith he to <hi>Harding,</hi> may ye justly and
truly say (<hi>take heed of lying, Doctor</hi>) you have received
none of your orders and usages from the Heathen. <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus
Leonicenus</hi> saith, <hi>Isidis sacerdotes in Aegypto utebantur
lines vestibus, &amp; semper erant detonso capillo, quod etiam
per manus traditum ad nostra usque tempora pervenisse videtur,
siquidem ii qui apud nos divino cultui &amp; sacris Altaribus
praesident, barbam comamque nutrire prohibentur &amp; in sacris
utuntur lineis amictibus:</hi> The Priests of the goddess <hi>Isis</hi> in
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> used to wear linnen Surplices (<hi>rub your eyes, Doctor</hi>)
and evermore had their head shaven, which thing seemeth to
have been derived from them, unto our time from hand to
hand; for they that among us minister Gods service, and serve
the holy Altars, are forbidden to suffer the hair of their head
or beard to grow, and in their divine Service they use linnen
garments.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And Sir, to draw to a conclusion in this argument, we say
it is unlawful for the Church of <hi>England</hi> to retain, either in
Doctrine, Worship, or Discipline, any Conformity to the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because we know this will hardly go down with
you, by any reasons we can lay before you: We shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it to you under the credit of your Right Learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<hi>Iewel,</hi> please you to peruse page 325, 326. of his Defence.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The learned and godly men, at whose persons it pleaseth
you so rudely to scoff, (<hi>saith</hi> Jewel <hi>to</hi> Harding, <hi>Mr. Doctor,</hi>
Harding <hi>used to scoff at</hi> Calvin <hi>and</hi> Zuinglius, <hi>and to upbraid</hi>
Jewel <hi>with them</hi>) that refuse either to go in your apparel,
or otherwise to shew themselves (<hi>note Sir</hi>) like unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
have age sufficient, and can answer for themselves. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
thus much I may say in their behalf: Neither do
they commend any manner of apparel as holy, nor do
they condemn any apparel as unholy—They say not
therefore, that the apparel is either holy or unholy,
but they may truly say, the same apparel on your part hath
been fouly abused to filthy purposes. They may justly say,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56431:18"/>
they would not gladly in any appearance (<hi>good Doctor, note
this</hi>) shew themselves like unto them, that have so untruly
and so long deceived the world. And herein they are not
without sundrie Authorities, and examples of the godly
Fathers. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, his mother left bringing of
Wine and Cakes to the Church, but only for that she was
warned, it was a resemblance of the superstition of the
Heathens, and so she left it. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> speaking of the
three sprinklings or dippings into the holy Font, saith thus,
<hi>In unâ fide nihil officit consuetudo Ecclesiae diversa; Tamen
quod Haereticiid fecerint, negant idem esse à Catholicis facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum:</hi>
The faith being one (<hi>but it is not so between us and
Rome</hi>) the diversity of customs hurteth nothing; yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as Hereticks have thus done, they say the Catholicks
may in no wise do the same.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> reasoneth vehemently, That a Christian man
ought not to go with a Laurel Garland upon his head, and
that for none other reason, but only for that the Heathen
used so to go. Whereupon <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> giveth this note,
<hi>Non solùm ab his remperandum fuit, quae manifestam praese
ferrent impietatem, sed etiam ab illis quae possent indifferentia
vocari, hoc est, quae essent neque bona, neque mala. Partim</hi> (pray
mark Sir) <hi>ne quisquam infirmior ex Christianis offenderetur,
partim ne ethnici</hi> (did not <hi>Calvin</hi> say the Papists would grow
more insolent) <hi>in suis erroribus confirmarentur, dum rectius
putant esse, quod etiam Christianos observare vident:</hi> It was
meet for them to refrain, not only from such things as have
a manifest shew of wickedness, but also from such things as
might be called indifferent, that is to say, neither good nor
ill: Partly, left any of the weaker Christians should be
offended: Partly also, lest the Heathens (we say Papists)
should be encouraged in their errors, thinking that thing,
for that the Christians themselves do it, to be the better.</q>
You may read more to this purpose.</p>
            <p>There is one particular which we know you will very much
distaste, and that is the Divine Right of Episcopacy; which
we deny, and you with great confidence assert, page 51.
part 1. for there mentioning one Act of Parliament, you say,
<q>The contrivers of that Act, did intend by degrees to weaken
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56431:19"/>
the authority of the Episcopal order, by forcing them from
their strong hold of Divine institution.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We hope Sir, you will not assume so much upon you in the
Divinity school, wich is given to <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the Logick, that
your <hi>Dixit</hi> must suffice us.</p>
            <p>We might produce the unanswered Treatise of Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Prinne</hi> (a fast friend to Monarchy, and as earnest an
Antagonist to your <hi>Ius Divinum)</hi> in his unbishoping of
<hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> to batter your strong hold: but that
learned and pious Gentleman, being a Lawyer, and also a
sufferer under your <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> is very low in your
thoughts; and whatever comes to you in his name bath little
credit with you, as being lookt upon to be either the fruit of
his ignorance, or desired revenge.</p>
            <p>And therefore we shall oppose the judgment of a Bishop;
an English Bishop, one whom you in your History do very
much extoll for his great learning, from whom you say all
<q>Controversors have furnisht themselves (being a Magazin of
all sorts of learning, page 131. part 2.) with arguments:</q> it
is Reverend <hi>Iewel:</hi> from this Magazin we will take some
weapons and Artillery to assault and batter your strong

            <p>Sir, you are no stranger to the distinction of <hi>Episcopus
praeses,</hi> and <hi>Episcopus princeps,</hi> the former we allow, as being
for order and decency in the government of the Church: but
<hi>Episcopus princeps</hi> (which is Prelacy and not Episcopacy) this
as you contend for, so we to this, oppose the judgment of
Bishop <hi>Iewel.</hi>

               <hi>Harding</hi> (page 196. of the Defence) pleading against the
sufficiency of the Scriptures, and for the credit of Traditions;
among these Traditions he reckoneth the distinction of a
Bishop and a Priest, and saith, that they that denied this
distinction between a Bishop and a Priest were condemned of
heresie: in the Margin over against these words in the letter
R. <hi>Iewel</hi> saith it is an untruth, that ever any were condemned
for heresie for denying this distinction of a Bishop and a Priest,
for if it were so saith he, both <q>St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and
other good men are condemned of heresie.</q> Afterward page
202. of the Defence having taken notice and answered what
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56431:19"/>
               <hi>Harding</hi> had said against the sufficiency of the Scriptures and
for Traditions:<note place="margin">If Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> be pleased to read the right learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>Iewel,</hi> he may learn from him (we hope he will not take it in scorn) to learn less upon tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and more upon the Word of God.</note> he comes at last to the forementioned words,
and saith, But what meaneth Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> here to come in
with the difference between Priests and Bishops? <q>Thinketh he
that Priests and Bishops hold only by Tradition? (he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the distinction but the office) Or is it so horrible an
heresie as he maketh it, to say that by the (<hi>do you see Doctor</hi>)
Scriptures of God a Bishop and a Priest are all one? Or
knoweth he how far, and unto whom he reacheth the name
of an heretick?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Verily <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith, <hi>Inter Episcopum &amp; Presbyter um

there is no difference. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> saith somewhat in
rougher sort, <hi>Audio quendam in tantam erupisse vecordiam,
ut Diaconos Presbyteris (id est, Episcopis) anteforret: cum
Apostolus perspicue doceat eosdem esse Presbyteros quos Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note>
I hear say, there is one become so peevish, that he
setteth Deacons before Priests, that is to say, before Bishops,
whereas the Apostle plainly teacheth us, that Priests and
Bishops be all one.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>St. <hi>Augustin</hi> saith, <hi>Quid est Episcopus nisi primus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
hoc est, summus sacerdos,</hi> what is a Bishop, but the first
Priest, that is to say, the highest Priest.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>So saith St. <hi>Ambrose, Episcopi &amp; Presbyteri una ordinatio,

            <p>Doth not your strong hold shake, if not fall before the face
of these Authorities, Doctor?</p>
            <p>However we will charge once more, see page 100, and 101.
of the Defence. <q>But Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> saith, the Primates had
authority over other inferiour Bishops. I grant saith Bishop
<hi>Iewel,</hi> they had so. Howbeit, they had it by agreement and
custom, but neither by Christ (<hi>observe Doctor</hi>) nor by <hi>Peter,</hi>
nor by <hi>Paul,</hi> nor by any right of Gods Word. St. <hi>Hierom</hi>
saith, <hi>Noverint Episcopi, se magis consuetudine, quam dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitionis
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56431:20"/>
Dominicae veritate Presbyteris esse majores, &amp; in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
debere Ecclesiam regere:</hi> let Bishops understand (<hi>would
to God they would</hi>) that they are above Priests, rather of
Custom, then of any truth or right of Christs institution, and
that they ought to rule the Church altogether. He proceeds
in other passages out of St. <hi>Hierom</hi>—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Augustin</hi> saith, <hi>Secundum honorum vocabula,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>quae jam
Ecclesiae usus obtinuit, Episcopatus Presbyterio major est:</hi> the
office of a Bishop is above the office of a Priest, not by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Scriptures (this is <hi>Iewels</hi> Parenthesis) but after
the names of honour, which the custome of the Church hath
now obtained.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, you see Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> with his own breath hath
blown down your strong hold of Divine institution.</p>
            <p>And therefore you have no other hold for your Episcopacy,
but <hi>Ius Politicum;</hi> and truly Mr. <hi>Doctor,</hi> if our most Gratious
Soveraign, whom we are bound to obey, and honour as our
lawful and rightful King, and to love and reverence for his
Gratious and most acceptable indulgence exprest in his
refreshing Declaration, please to cast the beams of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<q>upon the Bishops, and to make them (as you say)
his Ministers only, his Ecclesiastical Sheriffs to execute his
will, page 51. part 1.</q> such is our high esteem of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
pleasure, that we shall strain to the very utmost (so that
we may preserve the incommunicable <hi>Iewel</hi> of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science)
to conform unto it.</p>
            <p>The meanest groom receiving the impression of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
favour, shall become venerable in our eyes.</p>
            <p>And though you are pleased to say in some of your last
lines, that our interest is incompatible with the Rights of
Monarchy (wherein we understand you not, and intreat you
to give the particulars of our so inconsistent interest) yet
though we will not vie with you in learning and oratory, we
have and shall ever (according to his Majesties expectation in
his Princely and pious Declaration) in our several vocations
with all our parts and strength, as much endeavour to indear
the hearts and affections of his people both to his Person and
Government, as you or any other whosoever.</p>
            <p>And we hope and pray, that the Bishops and others met
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56431:20"/>
together in Convocation, will be so tender of his Majesties
Honour and the peace of his Kingdoms, that they will not
suffer these by-matters of Liturgy and Ceremonies to be
a partition-wall between a Gratious King and a willing
people.</p>
            <p>You are afraid (we suspect Mr. Doctor) that that covetous
piratical hungry humour, which you say was at work so busie
in our first Reformers, is lurking in us, and that we have an
evil eye upon your great preferments and revenues (our
jealousie is not causeles, if you please to peruse a passage in
your fourth page of your Epistle to the Reader, and compare
it with another passage page 95. part 1.) But, Sir, we deal
clearly with you; we envy not any mans titles and dignities;
we have food and raiment, and are contented with our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and seek not great things. All that we begg at the
hands of our Superiors, is a liberty to worship God according
to his Word, that we may have nothing imposed upon us, but
what we may be directed in our compliance with, by the rule
of the Scriptures; we desire that men may not command,
where God is silent, <hi>voniat verbum Domini,</hi> and you shall
lead us with a twine thred, nay we will gladly follow and bless
God for any example: we desire not to be judged stubborn
or factious, if we bow not down to the single authority of a
Canon; we can do nothing against the truth.</p>
            <p>(Sir) we hope this is a fair request, and we are sure ought to
be granted.</p>
            <p>As for the Bishops, we say of them, as <hi>Iewel</hi> said of the
Pope, page 366. in his Defense.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Let the Pope do the duty of a Bishop: let him exhort:
let him preach: let him dispense Gods mysteries: let him
fulfill his office: let him do the part of an Evangelist: and
we will love him and reverence him, although not as Christs
Vicar general, yet at least as a Bishop; otherwise we must
say unto him, as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> said sometime to <hi>Cyriacus</hi> the
Bishop of <hi>Constantinople: Omnes magnos esse &amp; honorabiles
cupio, quorum tamen honor honori omnipotentis dei non detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat:
nam quisquis se contra deum honorari appetit, mihi hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilis
non est,</hi> I wish that all men might be great and
honourable, so that their honour be not prejudicial to the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56431:21"/>
honour of Almighty God; for whosoeve shall desire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be honoured against God, shall not be honourable
unto me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We conceive (Sir) there is work enough for the Bishops,
(though they trouble not their heads about the by-matters of
Ceremonies (<hi>as your stout Prelate</hi> Ridley <hi>at last called them</hi>)
either in contriving Canons to establish them, or in seeing to
the execution of those Canons) to preach frequently as his
Majesty expects, to-govern their Clergy, to preach to them,
to exhort and quicken them to their duty, to direct them in
their studies, and guiding of their flocks, to punish the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
and scandalous, to turn out the insufficient and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible,
to countenance them against the prophane insulting
rabble, to see their maintenance duely paid to them, to hold
Provincial Synods, to set up Lectures in all the chief Market
Towns of their Diocesses, to watch against and punish such as
preach treason, sedition, heresie, to take care that Church
censures be duly executed upon ignorant and scandalous
sinners, to see that the ordinances of Christ be kept up in due
reverence, neither disused through idleness, nor polluted by
reminess and lukewarmness; to discountenance the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
customs of May-poles, revellings, dancings, and all
other prophane disorders, especially on the Lords day: <hi>Hic
labor, hoc opus,</hi> this will finde them work enough, and this is to
be a Bishop indeed. And if Episcopacy (after it hath lain so
long fallow) bring forth such a fruitful crop, we shall be so far
from muttering and repining, that we shall cry, Grace, Grace
unto it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Doctor, we are not against external decency in Gods
worship; Ministers habits ought to be grave and comely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
their function, and if any be garish, or fantastical, or
clownish and slovenly, let the Bishop punish him; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
of Minister and people ought to be very reverent,
both in coming in, going out, and during their abode in the
Congregation, and if any be rude and irreverent, let him be
admonisht, and censured; we say, the Churches ought to be
kept in a handsome <hi>decorum</hi> free from nastiness and sluttish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
that the Pulpit, Reading place, great Bible, Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-table,
Seats, Pavements, Windows, Walls, Roof, Cushions,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56431:21"/>
Carpits, Church-yard, be all kept neat and comely, and in
good repair. And what would you have more? We know
you miss the Common-Prayer-Book, and some other Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Truly, Mr. Doctor, we desire to deal plainly with you, the
greatest part of the people of this Nation are very ignorant,
(Oh that you would leave your Cloyster, and make some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
by questioning and reasoning with them) and we
conceive plain and frequent preaching to be far more necessary
for them, and more required at all our hands, then the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of prayers, or decking and adorning of Churches.</p>
            <p>Would you commend that Nurse, that should spend the
greatest part of her time in decking and tricking up a child,
and in teaching it to speak and say after her, and in the mean
time suffer the child to pine away for want of milk? While
here is a great stir about Ceremonies, Ornaments, Liturgy, the
people perish for lack of knowledge: Sermons decay apace,
it is come to once a day already, and in some places to once a
fortnight.</p>
            <p>Sir, diligent and frequent preaching, is the great wheel
should be kept going, without which, Prayers, Sacraments,
Sabbaths, will be but blind and blunt devotions, and will
quickly lose their savour and efficacy.</p>
            <p>To bring you in love with Preaching, we shall offer to you
Bishop <hi>Iewels</hi> esteem of it, who is of so great esteem with
you.</p>
            <p>And first, we shall commend to you part of that Sermon
preached at Saint <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Oxon,</hi> which is to be found before
the Book called the <hi>Defence,</hi> it is upon these words, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
4. 11. <hi>If any man speak,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the third page are these words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If the Sun were taken away from the world, all things
should be left dark, disparkled and confounded; so if the
voice of the Pastor be taken out of the Church, Religion is
left at sixes and sevens, it is left blind, troubled, all things are
mingled with error, superstition and idolatry; of so great
weight it is to be a Steward of the house of God. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
Religion, Godliness, the health of the Church, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of us alone. This is our office, this we take upon us, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56431:22"/>
this we profess. And except we do this, we do nothing, we
serve to no use at all. It is not enough to know I know not
what learning, the Devils perhaps know more then any of
us all, it belongeth to a Pastor not so much to have known
many things, as to have taught much. Let it shame us, that
the basest kind of men, even Coblers and Porters, do that
which belongeth unto them, and we which ought to give
light to all others, are idle and do nothing: For God would
not have us to be idle bellies, but he would have us to be
interpreters of his mind, Ministers of Jesus Christ, the
light of the world, salt, Angels, and the sons of God.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>Much more excellent matter to this purpose you may there
read. And he concludes his Sermon thus, <q>Whatsoever we are
able by nature, whatsoever by counsel, whatsoever by wit
or cunning, let us bestow it all to serve the Church of
God—If we be the Brethren of Christ, let us hear
Christ, let us feed his Lambs, let us feed his sheep, let us go,
let us preach, let us teach—</q>
            </p>
            <p>And Mr. Doctor, this great office of preaching is
mightily hindred by non-residence and pluralities, by <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
of which</hi> the Church is pestered with a generation of
silly <hi>Curates,</hi> who can scarce read the <hi>Common-Prayer, or an
Homily as they should,</hi> who <hi>neglect</hi> preaching, which <hi>Bishop
Iewel</hi> complains of as a sure in-let to Popery, in his Sermon
upon <hi>Ioshua</hi> 6. from these words, <hi>Now</hi> Jericho <hi>was shut up,</hi>
&amp;c. page 14. <q>But when, saith he, we see the great blindness
and ignorance in all places abroad: (how could you, Mr.
Doctor, so admire the face of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> page
123. part 2. when you see her so blind, for this Sermon was
either preached before Queen <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> or at <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross
in her Reign) what hope may we have to see <hi>Iericho</hi> (he
<hi>meaneth Rome</hi>) suppressed or quite overthrown? It cannot
be, but great inconveniences shall follow in the Church of
God, as confusion of Order, and dissolution of life, to the
indangering of the State, unless by godly care of the Magi|
strates, some help be provided. This care must shew it self in
removing blind Watch-men, who have no knowledge (<hi>he
doth not say, that cannot read the Common-Prayer</hi>) who are
but dumb dogs that cannot bark, who lie and sleep, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56431:22"/>
in sleeping. These greedy dogs can never have enough,
faith the Prophet <hi>Isaiah.</hi> Non-residence and absence from
their Cure, is a fault that would be amended in the Shepherds
of the Lords flock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Though they be never so able to instruct,
and therefore worthy to have the Rooms in the Church, yet
if they have not a desire to do good, if they feed not Christ's
sheep, if they be strangers to the people of their charge, if
they be not at hand to give their flocks their bread in due
season, what let may here be (<hi>the Common Prayer could
not prevent it</hi>) but that ignorance and blindness shall grow
and increase in the people.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Another fault, saith he, no less hurtful to the Church of
God, is the suffering of Pluralities, when one man taketh
the profit of two or more Benefices, which is not worthy of
one. These Non-residents and Plurality-men teach not, they
know not, nor care for the people of their charge; they have
brought this confusion (<hi>do you see, Doctor, what a glorious
Church we had in the time of Queen</hi> Elisabeth?) and shame
into the House of God, they are blind guides, they are the
darkness of the world. Against those which are such, God
sheweth his heavy displeasure, <hi>Ezek. 34. Ier. 2. Ier.</hi> 10.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These either be a Remnant (<hi>do you see, Sir, we are not yet
fully reformed</hi>) of the wicked inhabitants of <hi>Iericho,
(i.e. Rome</hi>) that resist the passage of Gods people (<hi>we are
yet in the Wilderness, Doctor</hi>) towards the Land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise—
These be they that seek the restoring of <hi>Iericho,
(do you know no such in the Convocation Sir?</hi>) and the over|
throw of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> therefore the curse of God will fall
upon them, the blood of Gods people shall be required at
their hands, because they bring the abomination of desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into the holy place, because they suffer Christs flock to
perish for lack of knowledge—God grant (<hi>Amen</hi>) all
such, that they may see with their eyes, and understand with their hearts, and know the gracious goodness of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that the people be not through their negligence like Horse
and Mule; but that they may discern between darkness and
light, and between <hi>Iericho</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Let us go on, Mr. Doctor, to his next Sermon to this, about
<hi>Iericho,</hi> upon <hi>Haggai</hi> cap. 1. V. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Thus speaketh the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56431:23"/>
Lord of Hosts, saying, This people say, that the time is not yet
come, that the Lords house should be builded,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>After much excellent matter, which you may there read,
page the fifth, he speaks thus, <q>What greater disorder can be
in the Church of God, then when Antichrist shall come and
sit in the place of God? I know many are offended to hear
the Pope pointed out for Antichrist, and think it an uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
point of doctrine; therefore I refrain to use any such
names, and only will report to you of others, by what tokens
Antichrist may be known when he cometh. <hi>Gregory,</hi> as it
were in the Spirit of Prophesie, writing against <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> saith, <hi>Rex superbiae prope est, &amp; quod dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefas
est, sacerdotum est praeparatus exercitus:</hi> The king of
pride is at hand, and which is unlawful to be said, an army of
Priests is prepared; by these tokens, saith <hi>Gregory,</hi> you may
know him, he shall be the Prince of pride, and he shall have
an army of Priests to wait upon him. In another place he
saith, <hi>Quisquis se universalem sacerdotem vocat, vel vocari
desiderat, in Elatione suâ Antichristum praecurrit:</hi> Whosoever
calleth himself the Universal Priest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or desireth so to be
called in the pride of his heart, is the fore-runner of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ—
When the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> saw the Miracles
that Christ had done, and heard some men doubt whether he
were the Messias or no, Why, quoth she, when Messias shall
come, shall he do more signs then this man hath shewed?
So may we say by the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> when Antichrist shall
come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall he work more signs, then they of that See have
done? Shall he work more disorder in the Church? Shall he
do more to the dishonor of God, and against Christ?</q>
            </p>
            <p>We desire you would at your leisure read page 480, 481. of
his Defence, and page 365. where, and in many other places,
you will find this Right Learned Prelate not so shie, as in this
Sermon, to pronounce the Pope Antichrist. And we put this
Reverend Bishop in the scales with <hi>Gr. Williams</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Ossorie,</hi> and leave it to you to judge who weigheth heaviest in
in this point: If one be as you call him, Right learned, then
the other must be Wrong.</p>
            <p>Let us go on Sir, with this Sermon, page 8. Here saith he,
<q>must I touch the causes that withhold men from the building
of Gods Temple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:56431:23"/>
               <q>The first seemed to be despair of the cause, for they saw it
was a long travel from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Others charged them with sedition, and said, if these men
may once recover their City, they will pay no more tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute—Look
in your Chronicles, and you shall find that
the Jews have ever been traitors.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Even so when the man of God <hi>Luther,</hi> was raised up by
God to reforme the Church, a friend of his said unto him:
O Father <hi>Luther,</hi> you shall never be able to prevail, the Pope
and Princes and all the world are against you, the matter is
past recovery, go into your study, and say, <hi>Deus misereatur
nostri.</hi>—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Even now that it hath pleased God to restore his Gospel,
they that are of the contrary part (of which side are you
Doctor) cry out, these men be rebels, they would have no
Magistrate, they would have all things in common, behold
what they have done in <hi>Helvetia,</hi> behold what they have
done in <hi>Germany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> look out your Chronicles, you shall find
that all the uproars and seditions which have been these
forty years, have been stirred up by some one of them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But all this discouraged not the good Prince <hi>Zorobabel</hi>—
some confess many things are out of frame, but they say it
is no time to fall a building, we must look for a general
Council.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Some others say it is not yet time, the Bishops be they
should redress the Church, would to God they would; for
they should be <hi>lux mundi,</hi> the light of the world; they
should be Shepherds and Watchmen, they should be builders
of Gods Church: but what if the light become darkness?
What if the Shepherds become Wolves? What if the Watch|
men lie asleep? What if the builders become overthrowers?
<hi>Ieremy</hi> saith, the Pastors have overthrown the Vineyard,
and is it likely they will reare it up again? I pray God lighten
their hearts with his holy Spirit, and make them to be that
they profess themselves to be, the light of the world, and
true labourers in Gods Vineyard, and faithful builders of
his house (<hi>Amen</hi>).</q>

            <p>
               <q>In the mean season let us remember, that in the old Law,
whensoever the Bishop grew out of order, God raised up
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56431:24"/>
sometimes Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sometimes Princes to reform the
Church—For the Prince is Keeper of the Law of God,
and that of both Tables, as well of the first that pertaineth to
Religion, as of the second that pertaineth to good order—By
that authority <hi>Moses</hi> rebuked <hi>Aaron</hi> the Bishop: <hi>Ioas</hi>
redressed the riot of the Priests: <hi>Salomon</hi> put down high
Bishop <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and set up <hi>Sadoc.</hi>—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>After the coming of Christ, <hi>Constantine</hi> a godly Emperor,
threatned the Bishops if they would not be ruled, he would
take upon him to see them punished, as having indeed autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and power over Bishops.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Other impediments there be that keep men from building
of Gods house, but that which God complaineth of by the
Prophet, is, that every man fell to build his own house, and
left the house of God unbuilded.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh that <hi>Aggeus</hi> the Prophet were now alive and saw the
rearing up of Gods Temple here in <hi>England! (he doth not
mean the repairing of</hi> Pauls <hi>Church, but teaching and feeding
Gods people</hi>) what, think you, he would say, You build your
own houses, and leave the house of God forsaken: nay he
would say, you build your own mansions, and pull down the
house of God.</q>

               <q>The Masters of the work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> build Benefice upon Benefice,

            <p>
               <q>There lack Ministers throughout the Realm, to teach the

up the walls of Gods Church, one poor hireling is driven to
serve two or three Parishes—If there be none to be
found, nor hope of any to be hereafter: be you well assured
(<hi>good Doctor consider this</hi>) that Acts of Parliament and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
are not enough to content the conscience of the
people, and to build up the Temple.</q>

            <p>
               <q>Oh that the Queens Majesty knew the great scarcity, and
miserable need of Ministers that is abroad! And I beseech
you, good my Lords, and other Honourable and Worshipful
that are here, that have or may have access unto her, to put
her in remembrance, that her Grace will be mindful of the
house of God, and redress the greediness, both of corrupt
Patrons, and of such who ingross and gather into their hands
many livings, being themselves the remnant (<hi>do you see Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>)
of the ignorant and persecuting <hi>Babylon;</hi> and yet
leave to take charge over the people; blind Sir Johns, not
only lack Latin,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but lack honesty, and lack conscience, and
lack Religion. It would be a great furtherance to the
Church of God (<hi>Doctor commend the care of this to the Con|
vocation</hi>) and a wonderful way to increase Schools and the
Universities. Now I come (saith he) to the manner of the
building. And what better way can be devised to restore
Christs Church (<hi>Doctor tell the Convocation so</hi>) then that we
see used by Christ himself; when in any matter he was opposed
by the Pharisees, he calleth them back to the Scriptures; so
<hi>Iosias,</hi> so <hi>Ezechias,</hi> so <hi>Iosaphat</hi> reformed the Temple of God
when it was polluted, according to the pattern of the Scri|

            <p>

let us remember to do the contrary (<hi>note Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Gods Word.—</q>

Consider this last passage (Mr. Doctor) you have little
reason to find such fault with Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Stephen</hi> (as you call him, page
93. part 1.) or with other Reformers since, who were desirous
to be as contrary to <hi>Rome</hi> as the Word would warrant them:
if it were a peccancy of humour, a right learned Prelate would
not have advised to it.</p>
            <p>This pretious <hi>Iewel</hi> sparkles once more concluding his
Sermon with a sharp reproof, and moving exhortation.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We are in love (saith he) with our own corruption, and as
the people saith, we rejoyce when we have done wickedly;
we cannot abide to have our faults touched, our pride is
grown up as high as heaven, and our covetousness is sunk as
deep as hell: our poor weak brethren be offended, and
think that these be the very fruits of Christs Gospel; yet we
can in no wise suffer to be reproved, we say to the Preacher,
Peace, and talk not to us in the Name of the Lord, tell not us
of the Scriptures, tell not us of Christ, of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi>
We bid him speak us fair, and bless those things that be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
by Gods own mouth: We say, he is too busie, he
medleth with that he knoweth not. Yes, yes man he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it well enough, he knoweth that pride is pride, that sin is
sin, and thou and thine own conscience knoweth it too, if
thou wouldst be known of it, and this is extream misery that
we are so far plunged in sin, that we can neither abide our
own faults, nor yet the amending of them. Are these the
fruits of Gods Gospel? Are these the fruits of the innocent
blood, that we see shed before our eyes? Are these our tears
for the sins we have committed? Are these the thanks we
render unto God for giving unto us so great blessings? But,
what said I, blessings? would God we were so blessed that
we might consider our blessedeness. Many already bewray
the weakness of their stomacks, they brook not the Gospel,
yea they seem already weary of these Preachers, they call
them Pulpit-men of the Spirit, and I know not what; as
though they themselves had nothing to do with Gods Spirit.
Ah merciful God—</q> and so this blessed Bishop goeth on
most excellently and seasonably for our times.</p>
            <p>In the following Sermon upon these words, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 9.
<hi>The zeal of thine house,</hi> &amp;c. he hath these words.</p>

               <q>All men ought to be patient and gentle in matters pertain|

            <p>He directs his speech to Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> 
               <q>Oh that your
Grace did behold the miserable disorder of Gods Church
(<hi>where is your glorious reformation, your goodly building Mr.
Doctor?</hi>) or that you might foresee the calamities that will
follow. It is a part of your Kingdom, and such a part as is
the principal prop and stay of the rest. I will say to your
Majesty, as <hi>Cyrillus</hi> sometimes said to the godly Emperor
<hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian, Ab eâ quae erga deum est pietate,
reipublicae vestrae status pendet,</hi> the good estate and welfare
of your Commonwealth hangeth upon true godliness: you
are our Governor, you are the nurse of Gods Church, we
must open this grief before you. God knoweth if it may
be redressed,<note place="margin">We say also help O King.</note> it hath grown so long, and is run so far; but
if it may be redressed, there is no other besides your Highness
that can redress it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I hope I speak truly,<note place="margin">Fully verified in our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous King.</note> that which I speak without flattery,
that God hath endued your Grace with such a measure of
learning and knowledge as no other Christian Prince. He
hath given you peace, happiness, the love and true hearts of
your Subjects. Oh turn and employ these to the glory of
God, that God may confirm in your Grace the thing which
he hath begun.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let us follow him to his next Sermon on these words, <hi>Mat.</hi>
9. 37, 38. <hi>The harvest is great, but the labourers are few,</hi> &amp;c.
—He saith not the harvest is great, and there are but few
<q>Scribes, but few Pharisees, but few Sadduces, but few Priests,

Priests that should be Preachers (<hi>not Common-prayer-book|
men, Sir</hi>) few Archdeacons, few Chancellors; few Deans,
few Prebendaries, few Vicars, few Parish Priests, for the
number of these is almost infinite—Cardinals have Pillars
and Poleaxes carried before them in token that they be
Pillars and Stayes of the Church, and Poleaxes to beat down
all evil doctrine. And what shall I speak of Bishops, their

cloven Miter signifieth the perfect knowledge of the Old Te|

Common-prayer?</hi>) without knowledge, without the food of
life, without the comfort of Gods word, such a misery as never
was seen among the heathens—(<hi>where is your Primitive

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In such a state as a flock is in, which hath no Shepherd,
as the ship which hath no Pilot to guide it, or the sucking-child
which hath no nurse to feed it; even in such state
are your souls, if you have not the Ministery of Gods
Word.—</q>

            <p>

yet <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> said, they worship their God in the

Church, were wont to paint out in mockery, the God of the

token that the Christians professed learning, but indeed were
Asses, rude and ignorant. And do not our Adversaries the
like this day, against all those that profess the Gospel of
Jesus Christ? O, say they, who are they that favour this
way? None but Shoemakers, Taylors, Weavers, Appren|

States. And these reports they did not only scatter among
the common people, but also dropt them into the Magistrates
and Princes ears, that they might have an ill opinion of
Christian Religion, and suppress (<hi>Note Sir</hi>) the Ministers

            <p>WE might, Sir, have been much more plentiful in our
gatherings out of this holy Bishop, there is not a waste
line in all his Sermons. Some we have not touched upon at all,
but so much we thought good to present unto you, that you
may see both the complexion and constitution of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> in the time of Queen <hi>Elisabeth.</hi> You see by the
judgement of the best Bishop (the rarest <hi>Iewel</hi> the Church of
<hi>England</hi> ever had, who was an eye-witness, lived, and preach|
ed, and writ in the prime of his age, for he was not full fifty
years old when he dyed) a good part of her reign, the Church
of <hi>England</hi> to be full of blindness, disorder, prophane con|
tempt of the Word of God, yea to have something of <hi>Rome</hi>
remaining in her, of necessity to be purged out.</p>
            <p>And truly, Sir, when we have read over the Sermons of this
Reverend Bishop, and your History, we should rather judge
you to be the Pupil of Doctor <hi>Harding</hi> (whom you would be
thought to oppose) then of Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> whom you do seem
to reverence. Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> doth not think he fouls either his
tongue or his pen, in naming the Gospel of Jesus Christ: But
how oft in your History, do you by way of scorn, tell us of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56431:27"/>
               <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Gospellers, as if this were some reproach to them,
and you had nothing to do with the Gospel; which in an hun|
dred places your Doctor <hi>Harding</hi> upbraids Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi>
with?</p>
            <p>There are some parcells and odd passages in your History,
which we shall only mention, and refer you to learned <hi>Iewel</hi>
to answer your self out of him; page 53. part 1. you say,
<q>The <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Churches were in an error, in that they deny|
ed a Real presence, and held there was nothing else in the
blessed Eucharist but signs and figures; and that <hi>Ridley,</hi> whom
you encline to, affirmed, That in the Sacrament are truly and
verily, the body and blood of Christ made forth effectually
by Grace and Spirit. Sir, <hi>Harding</hi> saith the very same as
you do.</q> See <hi>Iewels</hi> reply to <hi>Harding,</hi> page 235<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Real presence; and there you shall see, how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Iewel</hi>
takes him up; and you will understand to speak more like a
Protestant Doctor; and in page 262. of the Defence, saith
he to <hi>Harding,</hi> 
               <q>You call our doctrine naked and cold, for
that we say, the Sacrament is a figure.</q> You will there see
how pitifully he baffles <hi>Harding.</hi> Mr. Doctor, it was wont to
be said, <hi>sursum corda,</hi> but now it is <hi>deorsum corpora,</hi> your
stickling for a Real presence effectually made forth by Grace
and Spirit, doth very well sort with your low postures and
cringings to the holy Altar, which was a thing unknown to
Bishop <hi>Iewel.</hi> You shall find these words in his answer to Mr.
<hi>Hardings</hi> Preface, page 5. <q>You say we have overthrown
Altars, verily Mr. <hi>Harding,</hi> we have overthrown nothing,
but that which Gods good will (<hi>note Sir</hi>) was should be
overthrown. Christ saith, <hi>Every plant that my heavenly
Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</hi> An Altar we have,
such as Christ and his Apostles had, the Table of the Lord,
and stood not at the end of the Quire, but in the midst of the
people,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as many wayes it may appear—</q>
            </p>
            <p>You say also, page 140. part 2. That the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Gospel|
lers, or the <hi>Genevian</hi> party (<hi>why cannot you call them Prote|
stants?</hi>) did rejoyce at a lamentable accident which happened
to <hi>Pauls</hi> Steeple; and there you fall into the praises of that
Idolatrous Fabrick; and to quit it of the displeasure of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
you have got a tale by the end, of an old Plumber, who
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56431:28"/>
confessed, that woful accident came by his negligence, in
leaving carelesly a pan of coals in the Steeple when he went to
dinner.</p>
            <p>We shall be as careless of examining the truth of this story,
as your plumber was of his coals; and shall only tell what

was the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi>—</q>
            </p>
            <p>In ten of your last lines, you threaten the world with a
Presbyterian History, for the carrying on of whose designs
since the dayes of <hi>Calvin, (you may say</hi> Luther <hi>as well</hi>) they
have most miserably, you say, imbroyled all the States and
Kingdoms of these parts of Christendom, the Realms and
Churches of great <hi>Britain</hi> more then all the rest. Mr. Doctor,
where was your conscience and modesty when you writ thus?
Where was your Loyaltie and Obedience to your Dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
which you profess in your Epistle Dedicatory? Will
not your bitter spirit be conjured down, neither by Royal
command, nor Soveraign example?</p>
            <p>Sir, you know, or may know, that Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> is fain to
Apologize for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to wipe of that slander
you have cast upon the Presbyterians, page 10. of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
<q>They cry out upon us (faith he) at this present
every where, that we are all Hereticks, and have forsaken
the Faith, and have with new perswasions and wicked learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
utterly dissolved the concord of the Church. And again,
page 15. That we labour and seek to overthrow the state of
Monarchies and Kingdoms. Nay Sir, do not you shake hands
with that Varlet <hi>Harding,</hi> pag. 18. Before <hi>Luthers</hi> time
saith he, (<hi>before</hi> Calvins <hi>time say you</hi>) all Christian people
came together peaceably into one Church, in one accord,
but after, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That which this Reverend Bishop returns to <hi>Harding,</hi>
by way of answer to these filthy slanders, will very well serve
to take out that blot your unhappy and uncharitable pen flings
upon the Presbyterians. We will not justifie the seats and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56431:28"/>
passions (oppression makes a wise man mad) of every <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduum</hi>
of that perswasion, but having been all this time ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
standers by then actors, and seriously weighing their rule
by which they desire all Church concernments may be regu|
lated, and considering that you, as the mouth of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,
have pleaded nothing but two Acts of Parliament (the
Members whereof, you more then once tell us were led mostly
by politique and Popish considerations in what they did) for
authorizing and confirming all the matters in difference, we
are bold to say; they are got upon the better ground, (though
the wind be against them) and their advantages for inward
peace (though not for outward preferments) are so much
greater, as the Word of God is greater then an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and the authority of God, then the authority of
men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh, Mr. Doctor, when shall the voice and authority of
Christ be heard and bear sway in the Church of God?</hi> Non est
Ecclesiae loqui (<hi>saith</hi> Beza) sed meritum loquentem audire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Mr. Doctor, we are sorrie, that having travailed over your
History, we must say of you, as Reverend <hi>Iewel</hi> said of
<hi>Harding</hi> in his Preface to the Reader of his Defence, <q>When
Scriptures fail, then discourse of wit must come in place (<hi>of
your Acts of Parliaments</hi>) and when wit and discourse will
not serve, then good plain round railing must serve the turn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Then he discourseth and flingeth now at his Lutherans; now
at his Hugenotes; now at <hi>Brown;</hi> now at the Puritans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
now at <hi>Bale;</hi> now at <hi>Illyricus (Now at the Calvinists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now
at the Zuinglian Gospellers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Thus he, saith <hi>Iewel,</hi> jumpeth and courseth this way and
that way, as a man roving without a mark, or a Ship fleeting
without a Rudder. Thus he sheweth us a mountain of words
without substance, and a house full of smoak without fire
and imagineth that his little Elder-pipe, by discourse of <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
will resemble the sound of a double Canon. When <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
we may say of him, as the poor man said that shore <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

Here is a great crie, and little wool.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Bring us but the authority of Scripture (that wisdom that
is from above) to justifie our obedience in these points in
difference, you shall find us gentle and easie to be intreated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But if you resolve to turn us off (as you say <hi>Weston</hi> did Mr.
<hi>Iohn Philpot,</hi> and the five other Divines, page 30. part 2)
It is not, saith he, the Queens pleasure, that we should spend
any longer time in these debates, and ye are well enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
for you, saith he, have the Word, and we have the
sword, if you resolve to assault us with this Argument, the
Lord put on you the bowels of mercy, and on us the Armour
of patience.</q>
