            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

None was more loath to yeeld to such a death,</l>
                  <l>None more desired to respit time for life</l>
                  <l>Her nature was so mild, her heart so kind,</l>

                  <l>Though law and justice both did bid her strike.</l>
                  <l>Besides when any of her priuate traine</l>

                  <l>Did seeke to saue her life whom they so lou'd:</l>

                  <l>Now drawing neere to death, she stay'd on still,</l>
                  <l>The faith she held in life she kept in death,</l>

Yet they rejoic'd to see her so depart</l>
                  <l>As in her death they saw a present life:</l>
                  <l>For at her death she did remember well</l>
                  <l>Both what concern'd her soule, her heauenly state,</l>
                  <l>And how she must depart without delay,</l>
                  <l>As when her soule her mortall bodie left</l>
                  <l>VVith triumph she did mount straight into heauen.</l>
                  <l>Nor when she died, she did forget hers here,</l>
                  <l>As many mothers doe forget their babes,</l>
                  <l>But left vs such a King whose vertues might</l>
                  <l>Abridge the griefe which lacke of her might breed.</l>
                  <l>This was her end, this was her liues last act</l>
                  <l>VVith clap of hands for sorrow, but not for joy,</l>
                  <l>For who can but bewaile the losse of such a prince?</l>
                  <l>What time can serue to stint the streame of wosull teares?</l>
                  <l>For who is't we haue lost? a prince whom man did not,</l>
                  <l>But God alone did choose protector of his word,</l>
                  <l>The trumpet of his truth, a mother to vs all,</l>
                  <l>Apillar to all peace, a death to all debate.</l>
                  <l>The honour of her sex, a Queene surmounting match,</l>
                  <l>Of whom when all is said, all is not enough.</l>
                  <l>I must confesse we haue just cause to grieue,</l>
                  <l>But yet two greater grounds rebate our griefe</l>
                  <l>The first because her age, her seauentie yeares</l>
                  <l>Had made her ripe, and readie for to die.</l>
                  <l>If she had been before a maried Qneene,</l>
                  <l>Or not hauevs'd a diet low and spare,</l>
                  <l>Her life had not endur'd in strength so long.</l>
                  <l>She died in happie raigne, not feeling crosse</l>
                  <l>Belou'd at home, admir'd abroad, a matchlesse prince,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:13249:12"/>
So that it seems she changed onely place</l>
                  <l>By such a blessed death cal'd vp to heauen,</l>
                  <l>VVhere here on earth she raignd in fits of care.</l>
                  <l>Now who so shall bewaile one dying so,</l>
                  <l>So throughly bles'd, in state so perfect good,</l>
                  <l>He shall not seeme to mourne for her he mones,</l>
                  <l>But to lament for losse of priuate gaine.</l>
                  <l>And yet an earnest loue cannot but mourne,</l>
                  <l>VVhen cause whence loue did rise hath his recourse</l>
                  <l>VVhich bred and borne on ground that beares it vp,</l>
                  <l>Cannot be tyred at all with shed of teares.</l>
                  <l>The second cause which ought to stay our griefe,</l>
                  <l>And that may seeme the proper cure to care</l>
                  <l>Is, that the Queene, when death approched her,</l>
                  <l>Did stint where all our griefe for her should stay,</l>
                  <l>By pointing vs a King, and that a man</l>
                  <l>Accustomed to rule: one of our English blood,</l>
                  <l>VVhich all his time hath fostered vp Gods truth,</l>
                  <l>A friend to peace, a prince of mightie skill,</l>
                  <l>To whom our Queene, our good <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Did yeeld, as to a prince her peere each way,</l>
                  <l>So that although we grieue for losse of her,</l>
                  <l>Yet this one close should knit vp all our griefe,</l>
                  <l>For that by her owne choise and right of blood,</l>
                  <l>VVe haue a King to turne our greefe to joy.</l>
                  <l>Now my liege Lord, successour to my Queene,</l>
                  <l>The greatest King that Brittish soyle hath seene,</l>
                  <l>Thou seest a mightie patterne in thine eie</l>
