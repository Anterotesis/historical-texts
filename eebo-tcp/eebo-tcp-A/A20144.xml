            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>S. Auste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> briefly answereth to these

catholike and to be allowed / it disgra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceth
and dishonoureth all the marty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res / 
and wipeth awaie all persecucion
and martirdome. For by their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the martirs hade done more godly
and more wisely / if they had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
them selues <unclear>to be christianes</unclear>
               <pb facs="tcp:10773:4"/>
before the tyrannes and persecutours / 
neither hade they made them to be
murtherours / but with lieng and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeng
the truthe / they should haue
saued their owne bodies / and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
suffred them to haue executed the

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ds.
For the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes and persecutours
were not the martyrs neighbours by
profession of Christes faithe / so that
they were not bounden to speake to
them the truthe with their lippes / 
which they spake with the hart: but
they were the vttre enemies of God
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the truth. If this wer tolerable a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
good doctrine (saieth S. Auste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) what
neded Petre to lament his sine so bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
after he hade denied Christ with
his mouthe? Thinke ye he did before
denie him with his harte? No / no (sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yeth
S. Auste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) he denyed not his mai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ster
Christ with his hart but he lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
for the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
him / that he had not professed

beleued with the hart to iustificacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb facs="tcp:10773:5"/>
therfore the wordes of the prophet
Dauid are not so to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
maie laufully lye with the mouthe / ke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ping
the truthe in his harte. But it is
therfore spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / bicause it maie be / that

onles it procede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the botome of the

words the heretikes (bicause thei mak
agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) vtterly leaue out. And the
other wordes of thapostle / layeng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte
lie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g / speake the truthe euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with his neighbour / they expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de as
the Iewes doo their lawe / wher bicau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
they be commaunded only to deale
plainly / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vse mercy with their breth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ren
and neighbours / they not only
thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke they maie / but also doo vse with
the christianes al subtiltie / deceat / gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le / 
and crueltie. But those wordes are
not so to be take / as though ther were
non other our neighbours / but suche
as be presently me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres of the body of
Christ / and professe one religion and
faith with vs: but that we shoulde ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
<pb facs="tcp:10773:6"/>
euery man to be our neighbour / 
whom we wolde haue hereafter to be
our neighbour / albeit he be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
our neighbour: as Christ did
declare the Samaritane to be neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to the straunger with whom he
vsed mercy / and the straunger to the
Samaritane.</p>
            <p>And therfore he ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for our neighbour and no straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger / 
whom we desire (as we ought to
desire all men) to professe Christ as
we do. And if bicause he is not yet of
our faithe / some misteries ought to
be kept from such a straunger / yet
we ought not therfore to speake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him that which is false. For ther we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
in thapostles tyme / that preached
Christ and the truthe not truly: that
is / not with a true minde and sincere
conscience / but of enuie / co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cion / and
with a corrupt mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet they wer
suffred a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d allowed / but non co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
for speaki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of an vntruthe with a safe
conscience. And thapostle saieth: Let
Christ be preached / whether it be by
<pb facs="tcp:10773:6"/>
occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / or by truthe: but he saied not
let Christ be first denied / that after he
maye be preached. We maie not doo
euil / that good maie folowe: for if we
doo / our damnacion is iuste and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
But let vs turne the wordes / bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we haue folowed euil / let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and doo good / that we maye co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
to saluacion. These heretikes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
for them examples out of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>As of the mydwyues of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipcianes / 
who made a lye to Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao
to saue the male children of the
Hebrewes / and therfore God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them. Of Rahab / that made a
lye / to saue the two Israelites. Of
Iehu / who fayned him selfe the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt
of Baal / bicause he wolde
destroie the priestes of Baal. And
of Naaman / that sayed to Eliseus
the Prophet. But herein the lorde
be mercifull to thy seruaunt.</p>
            <p>For whan my maister goeth in to
the house of Remmon to worship
ther / he layneth on my hande / and
<pb facs="tcp:10773:7"/>
I must bowe wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he boweth. And so
many others. But these heretikes are
like Spyders / that sucke poyso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of
swete flowres / not like bees / that sucke
out the swete and profitable honye.</p>
            <p>For the midwiues and Rahab were
not rewarded of God for their lieng / 
but for the mercie they vsed towarde
the people of God. As for Iehu / he is
not in all scripture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: no / scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture
saieth of him / that his harte was
not right before the Lorde. And the
scripture saieth not / that Naama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
a dispensacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the prophet. For if
the prophet wolde haue consented to
his request / he hade had no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> autoritie
to dispense with Goddes worde. The
dedes of au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient fathers a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d others in
scripture are not writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we
shoulde folowe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in euery thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g / but
many euil thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges be declared of them / 
to let vs knowe / that were they neuer
so holy / yet they were men / and might
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d did fall: that knowi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g their a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d our
weakenesse / we should not trust i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our
owne selues / or i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our owne works / but
<pb facs="tcp:10773:7"/>
confessing our selues to be sinners / we
should call to God for mercie. To be
short / S. Auste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concludeth / that for
no cause men maie lye or dissemble: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
specially i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they may
in no wise doo it. And that that is
thus spoken against liers and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers / 
maketh asmuche agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
and wicked doers. For in bothe of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hart and the outwarde senses
doo not agree. And this is a general
sentence in scripture without exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption:
Thou hatest (O God) all those
that worke iniquitie / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d shalt destro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie
al those that speake lies. And Christ
also saieth: He that confesseth me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / I will confesse him before my
father which is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and he that
denieth me before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / I wil denie him
before my father in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Wo be to hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dre cometh.
And again, who so euer offendeth one
of these litle ones which beleue in me / 
it were better for him / that a milstone
were hanged about his necke / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that
he were drowned in the depthe of the

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10773:8"/>Thus ye haue the iudgement of
Saint Austen in your question that

            <p>And therfore onles ye thinke your

not God in lyngryng in that lande

of God / he pull awaye his grace from

            <p>Be not carefull for to morowe / 
make not your good your God / as
they saye: let your worldly substaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10773:8"/>I haue not sene the iuste forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

your heauenly father fedeth them:
how muche more shall be prouyde
for you / O ye of litle faithe? Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre

shall receaue an hundred folde in

Of his mercie we haue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse:
of his veritie / the hope of enhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce:

recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for all. And therfore leaue
