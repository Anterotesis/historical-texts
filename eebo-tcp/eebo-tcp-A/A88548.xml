            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Propheſie of the King of Scots, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>VVHen the Lyon of Righteouſneſſe is dead, then ſhall riſe a White King in Britain, firſt flying, and after riding, after ligging down, and in this lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging down he ſhal be lymed, after that he ſhal be led. <hi>This is verified by K.</hi> James, <hi>who was by the Prophet ſtyled,</hi> The Lyon of Righteouſneſs; <hi>for many affirm, that he had the picture of a Lyon on his breſt, or ſide: and indeed he was the moſt acuteſt Prince of ſpirit that ever we read of, both in judgment either in things divine or humane, but the leaſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted unto Martial Diſcipline. He was admoniſhed of his Death by a Dream; for his Majeſty dreamed, that his Tutor</hi> Bachanan <hi>appeared unto him in his ſleep, and gave him theſe two verſes: for the rarity thereof I thought good to repeat them.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Sexte verere Deum, tibi vitae terminus inſtat,</l>
                  <l>Cum tua candenti flagrat Carbunculus igne.</l>
               </q>
               <hi>In Engliſh thus:</hi>
               <q>Thou <hi>Iames</hi> the ſixt of that name King of <hi>Scots,</hi> fear God, the term of thy life is neer at hand, when thy Carbuncle ſtone burns in the hot fire.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next morning the King related his Dream to divers of the Lords of his privie Counſel, as alſo the preceding verſes, which did exceeding aſtoniſh them; and ſuddenly after, as the King was ſitting by the fire ſide, the great</hi> Carbuncle ſtone <hi>that he uſually had fixed to his hat, fell out into the fire, &amp; his Majeſty immediatly fell ſick, and died. After King</hi> James <hi>was dead,</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>(the white King) was then proclaimed King of</hi> Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; <hi>ſo called, by reaſon of his apparelling himſelf the day of his Coronation in a</hi> White Garment, <hi>repreſenting his innocency, as the Biſhop of</hi> Canterbury
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165927:3"/>
               <hi>was pleaſed to demonſtrate; whoſe office was to preſent the</hi> Crown: <hi>but the King impatiently in great haſte, took up the</hi> Crown, <hi>and placed it upon his head with his own hands, which moved the</hi> Spaniſh Embaſſador, <hi>who was then preſent, to ſay;</hi> The Kings putting the Crown upon his head ſo raſhly with his own hands, was <hi>an ill Omen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preceding Prophecie was written by <hi>Ambroſe Merlin</hi> (the <hi>Scot)</hi> 900 years ſince; But by reaſon there is another ancient Copy extant, of the Lady <hi>Poſtons</hi> more large and emphaticall, concerning the White King, I ſhall here render it verbatim, as followeth:</p>
            <p>The Lyon of Righteouſneſs being dead, there ſhall ariſe in <hi>Britain</hi> a <hi>White King;</hi> firſt flying, then riding; then deſcending; and in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent he ſhall be inſnared. Then men will point with their fingers, and ſay, <hi>Where is this white and noble King?</hi> At that time there will be chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of men, even in the ſame nature as we do with ſheep and Oxen, &amp; it will be publikely by ſome reported, <hi>There is a King:</hi> others ſhall ſay, <hi>There is no King.</hi> After theſe things he ſhall lift up his head as a King, or ſhall manifeſt himſelf to be King; it will be a time of Gleads or Kytes, and ſeven years ſhall this War continue within the Kingdom. After that the young one of the Eagle, or his Chicken, ſhall come upon woodden horſes, within a year and a half into <hi>Brittain,</hi> and then there ſhall be war, at what time little ſhall be the Charity of moſt men, for what a man is Maſter of overnight, ſhall be taken from him in the morning. After that the <hi>White King</hi> ſhall go towards the Weſt to an ancient place, near to a running water. Then his enemies ſhall make haſt to meet him, and their Army ſhall be formed in ſhape of a Buckler; the King ſhall be ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before and behind, and on every ſide; and then the white, King ſhall ſlide into an Hall &amp;c. What remains unfullfilled is in theſe words:</p>
            <p>After that the <hi>Chicken</hi> of the <hi>Eagle</hi> ſhall build in the higheſt rock of all <hi>Britain:</hi> nay, he ſhall not be ſlain young: nor ſhall he come to old age. Note, that the Prophet mentions not the Chicken of the Eagle (who is the preſent K. of <hi>Scots)</hi> with any Kingly Title: nor doth he ſay, He ſhall acquire his Fathers inheritance, or in plain terms, obtain the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> or be crowned King thereof: he onely ſaith, <hi>He ſhall build his neſt in the chiefeſt Rock of all</hi> Britain: Which imports no more, but that like a flying Fowl, or as a man chaſed from one place to another, ſo ſhall his Worldly condition be in this World.</p>
            <p>Another excellent Prophecie I cannot omit, penned by <hi>Sybilla</hi> the Propheteſs (a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lady) touching the Reign of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and if you will know the time of the extirpation of

               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>Theſe are all the <hi>Scottiſh Prophecies,</hi> which ever I could attain ſight of; and yet none of theſe make any mention of a <hi>fifth Monarchy,</hi> or the <hi>Lyon of the North,</hi> or do any other wayes mention that ſo great a King as <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, nay greater then he, ſhall be born of the Scottiſh Race, or in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or ſhall come from <hi>Scotland.</hi> From all which, I onely conclude thus much: <hi>That the preſent</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>is not that great Lyon of the North, or he that muſt conquer the Engliſh, or the preſent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>To which prophetical expreſſions, give me leave, I beſeech you, to add the ancient prophecie of <hi>David <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pan,</hi> a <hi>Welch man, viz.</hi>
               <q>Karonog fab Ane yo wna diwedh ar y dro gane.</q>
In Engliſh thus:
<q>
                  <hi>The Son of</hi> Ann <hi>crown'd, ends all our prophecies.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We never had yet any King whoſe mothers name was <hi>Ann,</hi> but King <hi>Charles</hi> his mother was <hi>Ann,</hi> ſiſter to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> late deceaſed. The putting to death of the late King was prophecied of above 80 years before it was done, by <hi>Noſtradamus,</hi> whoſe words were theſe:
<q>
                  <hi>Senat de</hi> Londres <hi>mettront a mort leur</hi> Roy.</q>
In Engliſh thus:
<q>
                  <hi>The Senate or Parliament of</hi> London <hi>ſhall put to death their K.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There is another ſignificant prophecie now extant, which hath been reſerved in ſeveral Libraries of this Nation, even unto this day, which I ſhall here preſent, according to the Original, as followeth:
<q>Carolus <hi>Anglorum, ultimus</hi> Britannorum <hi>Rex.</hi>

            <p>And <hi>Iohannes Amatus</hi> likewiſe ſaith, <hi>That in the latter dayes there ſhall be great wars and bloudſhed, the fary of the wars ſhall laſt a long time, whole Provinces ſhall be left naked of Inhabitants, many Cities forſaken of people, the Nobility ſlaughter'd, the Gentry ruined, and great changes of Kings, Common wealths, and Rulers. The North prevaileth againſt the South, a learned and eloquent Prince, by little and little, ſhall attain the Empire; and a new King ſhall ſurmount all the reſt, he ſhall make change of Religion, when he holds thereynes of the Empire. Somewhat neere theſe times alſo ſhall a great Eagle ariſe, and ſhall have power given him of the moſt High: He ſhall carry with him by Conqueſt three Kingdoms: He ſhall foyl the</hi> Lillies <hi>in the Land of</hi> Virgo; <hi>the Sun it felf ſhalt mourn with the Lyon, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By what I have delivered out of many reverend mens Prophecies, I onely evince thus much: <hi>That the late King</hi> Charles <hi>was not the</hi> Lyon of the North; <hi>or that his ſon, it that</hi> Charles, <hi>or that</hi> Eagle <hi>which the wiſe men of former times prophecied of; or that he ſhall act either ſuch wonderful Deeds in war or peace, at the admirers of</hi> Grebners <hi>falſe printed prophecy would faſten upon him; who ſay,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That a certain Northern King named <hi>Charles,</hi> who ſhall marry <hi>Mary</hi> of the Popiſh Religion, to his great unhappineſs; ſo that his people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting him, ſhall ſet up an Earl of a very ancient Family, who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue three years or thereabouts; he dying, they ſhall elect in his ſtead a Warlike Knight, who ſhall rule a little longer; after him they ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect none. But in the mean while one of <hi>Charles</hi> his ſtock ſhal land on the Sea Coaſts of his Fathers Kingdom, and with <hi>French, Swediſh, Daniſh, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landian, Burgonian,</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Forces, in a moſt cruel Battel ſhall van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh all his Enemies, and afterward moſt happily govern his Kingdom, and be greater than <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. And about the year 1663. the King of the moſt ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> for the loſſe of ſome Ships at Sea, ſhall break his League and amity with the States of <hi>Holland;</hi> who fearing, ſhall have recourſe unto the new King of <hi>Danes</hi> (named <hi>Chriſtiernus)</hi> for ſuccour, and he by fair intreaties and large gifts ſhall win ei he ſide to agreement. Nor doth he ever ſpeak of England in all that ſamous Manuſcript, but as the moſt warlike and potent Kingdom in <hi>Europe.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:165927:5"/>
Therefore all good Chriſtians ought to wiſh the new Warre were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, rather by an happy agreement and compoſition, than by Sword and Musket, and the King placed on his Throne rather with the hands of his loving and rejoyceful Subjects, then with the Swords of Forraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

                  <hi>The true Prophecy of</hi> Paul Grebner <hi>a</hi> German, <hi>preſented to Queen</hi> Elizabeth.</head>
               <p>A Fatal neceſſity having torne and pull'd from the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> the old <hi>Roman</hi> Scepter and Diadem, and after an oppreſſion of the ſame <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Houſe by the incurſions of <hi>French, Engliſh, Daniſh, Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh,</hi> making their irruptions on all ſides; there ſhall ariſe a horrid, bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſharp conteſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> which ſhall cruelly ſhake and break away part thereof, yea ſhall expoſe the ſame being ſtrangely ſpoiled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred to egregious alterations. A <hi>Swediſh</hi> King then reigning, ſhall be invited to that quarrel to break in upon <hi>Pomerane, Mechlenburge,</hi> and ſome Provinces belonging to <hi>Denmark,</hi> being provoked by ſome offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Papers of the Romiſh See: whereunto if he ſhall hearken, he ſhall unſeaſonably and very unproſperouſly become an Allie to one that is moſt neer and intimate to him. Wherefore I adviſe the <hi>Swede</hi> to leave him in the ſame ſtate wherein he findes him. By which meanes He, his Family and Poſterity remaining contented with the bounds of their own natural Dominions ſhall preſerve intire, and keep in good order and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance their own Subjects officiouſly diſpoſed to peace and tranquillity. But if he ſhall in his heart propoſe to pervert his Subjects by fair perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, God ſhall ſoon cut him off. And then from a <hi>Charles</hi> a great <hi>Charles</hi> ſhall obtain the Scepter, who with great ſucceſs and proſperity ſhall reign over the Northern parts of the world; yea, the ſame <hi>Charles</hi> ſhall much break the Power and Tyranny of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and obtain a ſignal Victory over his Navy and Armadoe. And after the conjunction of his Forces with the States of Chriſtendom He ſhall win a difficult, cruel Battel. After this, God ſhall remove his Popiſh Wife, to the great terror of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who being incenſed and ſtirred thereby, King <hi>Charles</hi> ſhall profeſs haſtily againſt <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and joyning Forces

with the <hi>German</hi> and other Allies ſhall become enemy to Him, and the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> both. At that time ſhall the <hi>Swede</hi> be very ſuccesfull and perform admirable ſervice againſt the Enemy with Men and Ships, as well by Land as by Sea.</p>

               <p>AFter a certain time being paſt, the tayle of the Virgin ſhall enter the Lyon, and <hi>Scorpio</hi> ſhall aſcend the back of <hi>Sagitary:</hi> the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Kingdoms ſhall be waſted by Reapers, the <hi>Southern</hi> Paincipalities ſhall end in duſt, and the powers of the Iſland Monarchies without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bridle or Saddle ſhall be harneſſed. Cruel Warres ſhall be ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the winds, and quell'd by a revengeful Hayle; whoſe beginnings were by a ſtaffe, their growth and continuance by Baſtards. The Sunne it ſelfe ſhall play on the Timbrel clad with a Vermilion Coat, and the Moon with Dun buskins, ſhall amble to the Faire. Laugheſt thou oh King? But thoſe on whom theſe things ſhall come, for grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhall pine away. All theſe things ſhall ſcarce be accompliſhed, when a Prince of Royal ſtock ſhall come forth crowned from the Northern parts, as to his own people unexpected, but deſired by forraigners; who becauſe he ſhall bear a rampant Lyon, ſhall therefore be called a Lyon. He ſhall not reſt, till having called a Synod, and after diſſolved it by threats, he ſhall advance his conquering Armes againſt his Enemies, and by woful ſucceſs ſhall harraſſe the territories of neighbor Princes. He ſhall exceed <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great in vertue, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> in ſucceſs: he ſhall paſſe the Seas, and be ſaluted Emperour by many Kings. A certain ancient City ſhall he ſay levell with the ground. In the mean while a Powerful Prince out of the Eaſt ſhall provoke him to battle, againſt whom the Lyon ſhall march with all his Forces, and pitching his Camp on this ſide Euphrates ſhall expect him. If the Prince ſhall come over the River, the Lyon ſhall be overcome; but he ſhall paſſe his Army o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the River, and give his enemy a bloody defeat, and be Maſter of all the Eaſt. Whilſt theſe things are in action, divers petty Kings from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> ſhall break into <hi>Syria</hi> with mighty Armies, and provided for Battlle ſhall wait for the Lyon about the Valley of <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> where they ſhal by him be all wholly cut off.

               <p>Our Authour is now ingenuous, whilſt he confeſſeth there is nothing more extant of this <hi>Scotiſh Merlines</hi> but this only peece.

               <p>To make an end of this Story, I ſhall conclude with the Prophecie of <hi>Sybilla Tiburtina,</hi> long ſince made publique unto the world. Which Prophecie of hers followeth:
<q>Orietur Sydus in Europe Supra Iberes admagnam Septentrionis domum, &amp;c.</q>
In Engliſh thus:
<q>
                     <hi>A</hi> Star <hi>ſhall ariſe in</hi> Europe <hi>over the</hi> Iberians, <hi>towards the great houſe of the</hi> North, <hi>whoſe beams ſhall unexpectedly enlighten the whole World.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſhall be in a moſt acceptable time, when as mortal men being wearied with war and arms, ſhall unanimouſly be deſirous to embrace peace. Certainly in thoſe times it will be ſtoutly controverted, who ſhall be the beſt man, or unto whom the greateſt Dominion may befall; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a vacancie of a Governour, and whileſt there is an <hi>Interregnum</hi> or <hi>diſcontinuance</hi> of ſome priſoners. But at length the Off-ſpring of a moſt ancient Family prevails, and will proceed in a courſe of war, untill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Fortune overthrow him. For even at the ſame time, or near unto the ſetting of this Star, or dying of the Prince, ſignified by that Star, a light as ancient as the former ſhall break out, burning with more eager flames of war, and ſhall inlarge his Dominion unto the Coaſt of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, we have ſhewed from the writings of very famous men, of what Nation the Great <hi>Charles,</hi> or <hi>Lyon of the North</hi> ſhall be or Native of.</p>
