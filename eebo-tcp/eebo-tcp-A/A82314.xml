            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

out of zeale to Gods glory, care to diſcharge their own duties, and a hearty deſire of the comfort and ſalvation of mens ſoules;</hi> So that if a man ſhould ſo receive them, as they give forth themſelves, he would be ready to ſay, ſure theſe do gliſter and glimmer like ſtarres of Heaven. But yet if you ſeriouſly minde their <hi>diſcourſes,</hi> both preached, and printed, and can diſcern and judge as ſpirituall men, and can take a true view of them, by the true light, that ſhineth in the Goſpel of God our Saviour, you ſhall finde them no other then the <hi>fallen ſtarres</hi> here foretold, even ſtars fallen from Heaven to earth; from the Church, to the world; from the Spirit, to the fleſh; from the power of godlineſs, which they once pretended to, to the forme; and from Chriſt, whom they once ſeemed to preach, to themſelves, and this preſent world: a ſad and wofull fall indeed! and well worthy the tears, and aſtoniſhment of all the truly faithfull.</p>
            <p>Now to let paſſe their <hi>pulpit-ſtuffe,</hi> which is nothing for the moſt part but the cruell poyſon of Aſpes; we will take a brief view of the moſt conſiderable paſſages in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Pamphlets.</p>

               <hi>divers Applications were made to them, both by word and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to invite them to meet with the Officers of the Army, in their Conſultations, about matters of Religion, but that they did refuſe to give any ſuch meeting, becauſe they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to give a reſolution of their Judgments upon the matters, but to cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ibute their aſſiſtance in proſecution of what the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had undertaken, out of their own Sphere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where you ſee, theſe Miniſters do acknowledg they were freely and friendly invited by the Officers of the Army, to conſult about matters of Religion; which doth clearly argue the ingenuity and integrity of the Councell of the Army, that in the things that might concern all, they deſired the preſence of any, eſpecially of thoſe whom they conceived godly, and able; to hear what they could <hi>ſay</hi> for, or what they could <hi>object</hi> againſt the things there propounded, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters of Religion; which ſerves to ſilence their old ſlander, That they would not admit Presbyterians into the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117512:4"/>
Army, when yet they invite the chief Miniſters of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Councell, to ſpeak what they could in their own cauſe.</p>
            <p>But the Miniſters ſay, they refuſed any ſuch meeting as was propoſed; for they diſdained (it may be) to be called to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult about matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> having for a long time before, expected to be uſed in matters of <hi>State;</hi> and ſo took it in dudgeon, that they were not called to reſolve the Councell of the Army, whether the <hi>State</hi> way they were walking in, in reference to the Tyrant <hi>King,</hi> and the treacherous mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> were right or wrong. So that it ſeemes all <hi>Civill,</hi> aſwell as all <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> affaires muſt ſtill be ſubmitted to their Judgment, and they will be very angry if the Kingdome expect not their determination in both.</p>
            <p>But let us hear them out, they ſay, <hi>They refuſed to meet with the Councel, becauſe they did not call them to hear the reſolution of their Judgments, but to deſire their aſſiſtance in that wherein they were already reſolved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, but whatever they called you for, you being come, might have diſcharged your duty; and if you had <hi>wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> enough, might either have reclaimed them, if they had been out of the way, or elſe have left them without excuſe. And if you had been confident of the preſence, and mind of God with you, you needed not have waved a conference, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo fair a call.</p>
            <p>But you would not <hi>conferre</hi> with them, but <hi>reſolve</hi> them, that they were out of the right way, what ever they could ſay for themſelves to the contrary out of the word of God. And thus ſtill the <hi>Clergy</hi> will have their <hi>Doctrine</hi> become <hi>Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> againſt which no man may preſume to diſpute or argue: and they that will not entertain them on theſe termes, it ſeemes muſt want their company.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould the Army require your reſolution in the work they were about, they having before, better ſatisfaction in their own breſts then you could give them; being better acquainted with the true ſenſe of the Scriptures, and more uſed to live by faith, (their life being placed in <hi>difficulties,</hi> when yours in <hi>delicacies)</hi> and having more experiences of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117512:5"/>
God, and his preſence, power, truth, faithfulneſs, love, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Juſtice, all along in their courſe, and ſo being better inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the cauſe of God, then <hi>your ſelves;</hi> which you (it ſeemes) have drawn back from, ſince you perceive it is not like to performe what you firſt hoped for, and expected from it.</p>
            <p>And truly, in my poore Judgment, it would have been a ſad thing for the Army, after ſuch great and continued expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of God, to have turned aſide, to have asked councell of you what to do; whoſe councels many times heretofore, if they could have prevailed (and moſt certainly in the former Summers work, about the <hi>City Ingagement,</hi> and peradventure in the laſt Summers <hi>war)</hi> the Army had not now been alive, to have asked any Councell at all.</p>
            <p>But I was told, that the Army ſent not to you, to receive any ſatisfaction from you, in the work they were about, being ſatisfied already, that it was of God, but (if it might have been) to have given you ſatisfaction, that you might have been taken off, from reproaching and reviling that work and way of God which he had ingaged them in; and this alſo was for your own ſakes, and not for the works; ſeeing this work muſt have proſpered, whether you would or no.</p>
            <p>If you would have gone along with them in this work of God, they would willingly have taken you by the hand, not deſiring to have this Honour alone; but you being unwilling to ſerve God in ſuch difficulties, and for himſelfe only, they could as willingly let you alone; ſeeing Gods work depends on <hi>himſelfe</hi> only, and not on the <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> whether many or few, wiſe or unwiſe, honourable or contemptible.</p>
            <p>But why it ſhould be ſutable for <hi>private</hi> perſons to deſire your reſolutions, as you ſay, and not for <hi>publique,</hi> you ſure have ſome meaning underneath, that durſt not ſhew its open face.</p>
            <p>And that in ſome places you call them only <hi>private perſons,</hi> and here reckon them <hi>more</hi> then ſo; is it not becauſe your <note place="margin">Repreſent. <hi>pag.</hi> 6.</note> fancies and imaginations are <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with one another, at ſeverall times.</p>
            <p>But had they asked your reſolution, you here tell them what

               <hi>ſuch unwarrantable courſes, ſhould teſtifie their timely and godly ſorrow for what they had already acted.</hi> And I muſt needs ſay, you cut them very ſhort, telling them at firſt daſh, their courſes were unwarrantable, and they muſt repent of them: And ſo you prove their courſes to be evill, much after that manner that the <hi>High Prieſts</hi> proved <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf to be an evill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, before <hi>Pilate.</hi> Why ſaith <hi>Pilate</hi> (when the high Prieſts brought Chriſt before him, that he might condemn him) <hi>what evill hath he done?</hi> oh ſay they, <hi>if he had not been an evill doer, we would not have brought him to thee:</hi> intimating, that <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> muſt take their words for that matter, for, ſay they, we are the <hi>High Prieſts</hi> of God, and do you think that ſuch holy men as we would have brought him to you to be condemned, if we did not know he was an evill man? but <hi>Pilate</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied with what they ſaid, they after undertook to make it good if they could: which becauſe they could not do with truth, they did with <hi>clamour</hi> and <hi>violence.</hi> After this maner they deal with the Army, touching their preſent courſes, as they call them, telling them they are <hi>unwarrantable, and they muſt repent of them;</hi> for if they had not been ſo, <hi>you</hi> would not have judged them ſo; for are not <hi>forty ſix,</hi> or <hi>fifty nine</hi> able, learned, orthodox men to be believed in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? and they tell <hi>your Officers and Army,</hi> that your courſes <hi>are</hi> unwarrantable, and you ought to repent.</p>
            <p>But the light of the word hath now ſo ſhined, that they cannot reſt upon your bare teſtimony, what ever <hi>names</hi> you have clothed your ſelves withall: but they will expect that you prove what you ſay by clear Scripture, in a ſound ſenſe, or you may be confident they will never believe you.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, you tell them in your preamble, <hi>That they move out of their Sphere;</hi> and ſure this is very ill done, if you ſay true, which you are ſeldome guilty of throughout theſe diſcourſes: but it is plain to them, and to all other honeſt, and ſincere hearted men, that they move, and act in that very place and ſphere wherein Gods own hand hath both ſet and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them, maugre all your <hi>Sion,</hi> or rather (as you now

And if you moved as regularly in your ſphere, as theſe have done in theirs, you had been more ſpirituall in the Church, and leſs turbulent in the world; you had preached the Goſpel of peace more, and blown the bellows of ſedition leſs.

            <p>And if the Army have been called forth by <hi>God,</hi> to act high and ſtrong in this matter, as his own arme and power in the Kingdome, for this purpoſe; do not you quarrell them for moving out of their ſphere, for ſo it may be you may quarrell <hi>Gods</hi> work more then <hi>theirs.</hi> If you ſay, <hi>you cannot ſee it to be ſo:</hi> I anſwer, how ſhould you, when you firſt, and after ſome body <hi>elſe</hi> hath ſhut your eyes?</p>
            <p>But I ſhall not follow you further to every particular, where your pen hath halted, and ſtumbled, and fallen downe, for then I ſhould too much trouble my ſelfe, and every one that reads; wherefore I ſhall only content my ſelfe to gather up the chief <hi>crimes</hi> you charge upon the Army, and to enquire

upon what <hi>good grounds</hi> you have done it: and to ſee if you <hi>your ſelves</hi> be not moſt guilty in theſe very things, which you ſo boldly lay to other mens charge.</p>
            <p>Now the crimes you charge on the Councell and Army, in your forenamed Pamphlets, are chiefly theſe.</p>

               <item>1. Their attempts againſt lawfull authority.</item>

            </list>
            <p>We will take a brief view of them one after another.</p>
            <p>The firſt crime the Miniſters charge upon the Army, is,</p>

            <p>But what is <hi>lawfull Authority?</hi> do you underſtand this thing? or if it ſhall appear you are all of you ignorant of it, will you not diſdain to be taught? Lawfull Authority then is the <hi>power that is ordained of God,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>there is no power</hi> (that is, lawfull power) <hi>but of God; the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that be, ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus are you <hi>Teachers,</hi> taught your ſelves what lawful Authority is. And now ſhew if you can, what ſuch <hi>lawful Authority</hi> the <hi>Army</hi> hath reſiſted.</p>

Mark here now, you ſtrange Interpreters of Scripture, who alwayes make it ſound after your own fancies; <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were as mean as any of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> till the Lord appeared to them, and called them forth to the great work of <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverance from the <hi>Egyptian Tyrant;</hi> and this preſence of God with them made them great. Now <hi>Corah</hi> and his complices thought every one of the Congregation as good as they, not underſtanding how the <hi>preſence of the Lord</hi> had made a difference, and ſo tell them, <hi>they took too much upon them, &amp;c.</hi> and this <hi>Moſes</hi> calls truly, <hi>a gathering themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt the Lord.</hi> So you, not ſeeing the preſence of God with the <hi>Army,</hi> nor underſtanding that he hath called them forth, and ſanctified them, to deliver the people from the <hi>Engliſh Tyrant,</hi> think every one of the people as good as they, and tell them, <hi>they take too much upon them, and are but private men;</hi> and thus like <hi>Corah,</hi> you have gathered your ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt the Lord, in his choſen and ſanctified ones.

He ſhewes there, how Kings may be put from their Office, for miſgovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and doth prove by clear Scriptures, how God puniſhed the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for permitting their King <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> to be ſo wicked, whom they ought to have reſtrained, and removed; and alſo he ſhews by whom evill Kings ſhould be puniſhed, ſaying, <hi>Quum conſenſu &amp; ſuffragiis totius aut certe potioris par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis multitudinis, Tyrannus tollitur, Deo fit auſpice, &amp;c. When a Tyrant is taken away, by the conſent and ſuffrages, either of the whole, or of the better part of the people, it is done by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and diſpoſition of God. So the children of Iſrael, if they had diſcharged Manaſſeh from his office, they had not been ſo grievonſly puniſhed with him. If you ask how that may be done, that the greater part of the people ſhould conſent to that which is good? To this (ſaith he) I ſay, as before, If they do not agree to take away the evil, let them bear the yoke of the Tyrant, and at last periſh with him.</hi> Neither let them complain that injury is done to them, when through their own fault, they deſerve to ſuffer any thing: And a little after, <hi>Non ergo deſunt viae, per quas Tyranni tollantur, ſed deeſt publica juſtitia.</hi> i. e. <hi>There are not then ways wanting, by which Tyrants may be taken away, but there wants publike Juſtice.</hi> Thus he: and ſo no queſtion divers more, if a man had time to ſearch after them.</p>
               <p>And yet you tell the people, that no godly Miniſters are of this minde; and therefore it is a wicked and damnable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for the Parliament and Army to travel in this untrod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en path; and yet you ſee here are two godly men, and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, forthwith witneſſing againſt you in this matter.

Wherefore, let all that are not of the <hi>brutiſh</hi> among the people, know, That ſince but few Laws among us, are the <hi>pure reſults</hi> of <hi>right reaſon</hi> and <hi>equity,</hi> but there is ſomething of <hi>humane darkneſs,</hi> or <hi>luſt,</hi> or <hi>humor,</hi> or <hi>intereſt</hi> cleaving to them; therefore as men grow up into more <hi>reaſon,</hi> they may change the Laws which themſelves have made; and as ſucceeding <hi>generations</hi> grow up into more <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>refined reaſon,</hi> then their Anceſtors; ſo may they change the <hi>former Laws,</hi> as leſs ſuitable to them, ſeeing <hi>Laws</hi> are to be ſuited to the peoples <hi>reaſon,</hi> and not the peoples <hi>reaſon</hi> to the <hi>Laws</hi> in this caſe.</p>

               <p>The Laws of former ages were anſwerable to that <hi>meaſure</hi> of <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>equity,</hi> which men that made them had attained unto; but when men attain to <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>purer reaſon,</hi> the Laws muſt be proportioned thereunto, as the <hi>ſhadow</hi> to the body, and the <hi>clothes</hi> to the man.</p>
               <p>It is one of the <hi>great evils</hi> of this age, for men to admire and adore Laws, and yet not to underſtand or minde the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> of them; and hereupon, to prefer <hi>Laws</hi> above the <hi>ſafety</hi> and <hi>welfare</hi> of the people, as though men were made for the Laws, and not the Laws for them.</p>

               <p>Why may not the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Army</hi> as well change the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> as you of the <hi>Clergie</hi> the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi> Why might not they as well change thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> that were the <hi>ſlavery</hi> of the people, into the <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the people, as you change <hi>Prelacy</hi> into <hi>Presbytery?</hi> Why might not they propound as well a <hi>new Agreement,</hi> as you a new <hi>Directory, Catechiſm, Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline?</hi> You ſaid heretofore, there might be a better <hi>Government</hi> then the former for the <hi>Church;</hi> and they know aſſuredly, that there may be a better <hi>Government</hi> then the former for the <hi>State:</hi> Wherefore then do you deny them that <hi>libertie</hi> which your ſelves contend for?

Shall they be compelled by others to do it, and be deſtroyed, if they will not obey? Is not this to take power over thoſe, who have equal power with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to incroach over the freedom of thoſe, who are as free as themſelves? If they ſay they impoſe in things neceſſary—We demand who are judges of theſe things? Have not thoſe that refuſe, as much power and freedom to judg, as thoſe who would impoſe it upon them? And if they judg it to be contrary to their freedom, who can controul them herein, without incroaching thereupon, and offering violence to their Conſciences, who may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch a way, neither to ſuit with Religion, nor Righteouſneſs.</hi> So that if the caſe be but altered, who can ſpeak more clearly againſt the inforcing the <hi>Scotch Goverment,</hi> then the <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland:</hi> And ſo, <hi>in the ſnare they have laid for others, is their own foot taken.</hi> But by the way, What have the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> to do with the <hi>Agreement of the people of England?</hi> Why are they ſo buſie to impoſe their own <hi>Church Government</hi> on us, and to hinder us from our own <hi>State Agreement?</hi> Reader, do you think yet, they are out of their ſphere, or no? Or are they yet become our Lords and Maſters, that they thus ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over us?

               <p n="1">1. That they were ſet up, and preſerved, and eſtabliſhed by the power of the <hi>Mgiſtrate,</hi> but not one of them by the bare power of the Word.</p>

               <p>For (to inſiſt only on the laſt) how dangerous a thing is it to any State, to have two outward powers, or two outward Kingdoms in one Nation?</p>

Now how unſafe this is for this <hi>State,</hi> or any other, to have another outward Kingdom, beſides its own, with its power, laws, and government, joyned and mingled with it, which is not at all of it, let any wiſe or rationall man judge. For where there are two different outward powers in a Kingdom, to wit, Civill and Eccleſiaſticall, each will be ſtriving for precedency, as we ſee all along throughout the periods of Popery, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy; for the Eccleſiaſticall State will think fit to take place of the Civil; and the Civil will think much to have another out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Kingdom and Power above it ſelf, and ſo heart-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and contentions, and wars ariſe, as appears in all former Hiſtories.</p>
               <p>And ſo likewiſe, for this new Sect of Presbytery (which is the <hi>laſt</hi> round in the triple crown, and ſo the <hi>leaſt,</hi> which is the comfort of it;) ſuppoſe the <hi>national Aſſembly</hi> of the Church, an outward Society, ſhould excommunicate the <hi>Parliament,</hi> an outward Society; and the Church power, with their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in this and the neighbour Kingdom, ſet againſt the State power, (for when they are able, no doubt, but as they have been, they ſtill are, and will be willing to uphold their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by force) what work, I pray, would this ſoon be?</p>
               <p>And if the Clergy now, before they are maſters of their much deſired, and longed for power, are thus impudent and troubleſome againſt the State, what would they be, if they ſate upon their throne?</p>
               <p>And therefore I deſire the <hi>State</hi> would well conſider it, that it cannot be ſafe for it, to have <hi>two externall Kingdoms,</hi> Powers, and Dominions in <hi>one Nation,</hi> or Common wealth. For it was never known yet, but the Eccleſiaſticall Kingdom did exalt it ſelf above the Civil, as oyl above the water; and ſo it hath bridled, and ſadled, and rode upon the Nations for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years together.

               <p>Now for my part, I muſt profeſs, I greatly wonder, that theſe could never yet ſee the moſt manifeſt preſence and hand of God, in the moſt admired and conſtant ſucceſſes of the Army, and have not hitherto been ſo convinced, as to ſay with the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sorcerers, Sure the finger of God is here, yea the right hand of his power and righteouſneſs. But it ſeems blindneſs is come upon them, not in part, but fully; ſo that theſe above all others are the men, who when the hand of God hath thus gloriouſly been lifted up, would not ſee it; but God in due time ſhall make them ſee, and be aſhamed for their bitter envy at his people.</p>
               <p>But becauſe they are ſo unlearned, and ignorant in theſe ſucceſſes and providences, the manifeſt and mighty works of God, I will minde them of ſomething in this matter, if yet any thing might at laſt prevaile to do them good.</p>
               <p>God had a great work to do in this Kingdome, for the true and reall Reformation both of Church and State; and when this Councell of his firſt began to take place amongſt us; the King, and all his Clergy, and corrupt party of all ſorts throughout the Kingdome, being farre the more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, riſe up in all the ſtrength they could make to hinder this work. And yet this work being of God, prevailes, through his power and wiſdome only, and all that is oppoſite to it, is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117512:17"/>
thrown down. Hereupon ſay the unbelievers, this cauſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, for behold what helps it had! the major part of the Parliament, the City of <hi>London,</hi> the Scotch Army, and above all, the eminent Clergy of the City, and elſe where, who ſaid of themſelves, they had done the Parliament as good ſervice in their pulpits, as their Armies in the field; and therefore a cauſe thus ſupported and ſtrengthned, muſt needs proſper. Hereupon the Lord, becauſe his work was thus hid by theſe inſtruments, ſo that he had not the honour due unto his name, he proceeds in another way and method, and turnes the hearts of thoſe to hate his cauſe, who before had outwardly appeared for it; ſo that now all the former friends of Gods cauſe, are become the moſt deadly enemies of it, the former enemies being ſtill the ſame; and ſo if God uphold his cauſe and people now, ſure all the world muſt acknowledg his hand: for now the major part of the Parliament is directly againſt it, and the rich and populous, and proud City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and a Scotch Army comes in againſt it, more numerous then that which came in for it; and the Clergy, for cauſes well known, tooth and naile againſt it; and all theſe joyne in one work and Councell with the malignants, though upon diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ends, againſt the work and cauſe of God: and now alaſs, what will become of it, how can it eſcape periſhing? Yes, it is Gods cauſe ſtill, though left never ſo deſolate, and ſo proſpers as well, all theſe being at laſt againſt it, as when they were firſt for it.</p>
               <p>And ſo the Malignants are overcome every where, in field and City; the numerous Scotch Army vanquiſhed by a few, the City ſubdued, the Parliament purged, and the Clergy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and the work of God like the Sunne in the Spring, appears with beauty and comfort; and yet theſe men cannot ſee the mind, and councel, and hand of God in all theſe things, as if the fulneſs of outer and inner darkneſs were fallen upon them at once.</p>
               <p>And yet a little farther (for I take pleaſure to mention the righteous acts of the Lord;) the laſt Summer, when ſo many enemies roſe up at once, in ſo many ſeverall places; in <hi>Wales, Kent, Eſſex, Lincolnſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117512:18"/>
Some of which were at firſt quite ſhattered in pieces, and others driven into fenced Towns and Cities, and the poore Army <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> without in the fields; the Summer proved like a winter, more cold and unſeaſonable, and wet almoſt conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet for all the ſhowres of Heaven, aſwell as all ſorts of diſvantages from men, their courage was in no meaſure cooled, but rather kindled: and was not this like <hi>Eliahs</hi> ſacrifice, who being to offer ſacrifice without earthly fire, to make it evident that God was the Lord; he firſt poured many buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of water upon the wood, till he filled the trench, yet the heavenly fire came down and licked up all the water, and burnt up the wood, &amp;c. and then the people, when they ſaw that, ſaid, <hi>the Lord he is the God.</hi> But our Clergy will not be brought to ſee and ſay any ſuch thing, notwithſtanding ſuch clear appearances of God: ſeeing they conceive all theſe to be to their prejudice.</p>
               <p>And ſo, though they councell the Army to deny the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of God in all former providences, and not to own his councell in them: yet we will ſing the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Lamb, ſaying, <hi>Great and marvellous are thy works Lord God almighty, juſt and true are thy wayes, thou King of Saints: who ſhall not fear thee oh Lord, and glorifie thy name; for thou only art holy, for all Nations ſhall come and worſhip before thee, for thy Judgments are made manifeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in this matter of <hi>Providence,</hi> they hook in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>David, who though he had through a providence, an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi>

                  <hi>to have killed Saul, yet refuſed to do it, becauſe he was the Lords anointed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is a far different caſe from that of the Parliament and Army: for why did God reject <hi>Saul? viz.</hi> not for le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying war againſt the people of Iſrael, and murthering and ſlaying thoſe whom he ſhould have protected, but for his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief</hi> and <hi>diſobedience</hi> to God; therefore was he rejected of God, as you may ſee, 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 5. and <hi>Samuel</hi> told him that the Lord had ſought out another man, after his own heart, to be Captain of his people, who ſhould manage the Kingdome in the ſtrength of faith, and that was <hi>David.</hi> And now <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had no cauſe, nor call, to take away <hi>Sauls</hi> life, for his ſin
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:117512:18"/>
that immediately concerned God, having done the people no harme: no nor yet for his ſeeking and hunting after <hi>Davids</hi> own life; for a man in his own particular cauſe is not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelfe, though he have opportunity, ſeeing God hath ſaid, vengeance is mine, I will repay; and alſo if <hi>David</hi> had then ſlain <hi>Saul</hi> in the Cave, he had ſlain him as a private man, in his own cauſe, and without the ſupream Authority of the people: And ſo this of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> ſutes not to this caſe. But ſuppoſe <hi>Saul</hi> had waged war againſt the people of Iſrael, whom he ought to have protected, and killed many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the choifeſt of them, and the Lord had delivered him into the peoples hands; whether or no might not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and heads of the Tribes have juſtly tryed him for his life, and put <hi>Saul</hi> to death for a murderer? there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion at all to be made in this matter, among juſt, reaſonable, and unbyaſſed men. But you are miſerable interpreters of Scripture, who will needs make them ſerve your own turn, though their ſenſe be clean contrary.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This in it ſelf is good Councel, but falſly applyed: For, their impulſes and impreſſions (to uſe your own words) were apparently from God and his Spirit, and that according to his written word, and to moral precepts, as hath already been ſufficiently declared. And thoſe of them that are godly, are better able to judg of the vertues and influences of the holy Spirit, which dwels in them, and is truth, and no lie, and manifeſts it ſelf to be ſo, by its own light, then <hi>they</hi> can that are deſtitute of the Spirit themſelves, and yet will be judging of the operations of it, in others. And for the reſt of the Army, that are not godly, it is a wonderful thing to conſider, how God by a ſpecial influence of providence, hath ſpirited them to the ſame work with his own people, making the earth to help the woman, as was foretold.</p>
