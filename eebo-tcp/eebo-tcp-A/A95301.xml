            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> in the maintenance of their great number of

in the ſaid Houſe, in divers places of this City and Suburbs, and with ſundry
Nurſes in the Country—597</p>
            <p>The names of all which are Regiſtred in the Bookes kept in Chriſts Hoſpitall,
there to be ſeene from what Pariſhes, and by what meanes they have been from
time to time admitted.</p>
            <p>Children put forth Apprentices, diſcharged, and dead this yeare laſt paſt—84</p>
            <p>In reſpect of the troubles of the times, the meanes of the ſaid Hoſpitall hath
very much failed for want of charitable Benevolences, which formerly have been given, and are now
ceaſed, and very few legacies are now given to Hoſpitals, the Rents and Revenues thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
being alſo very ill paid by the Tenants, who are not able to hold their Leaſes, by reaſon of their
Quartering and Billetting of Souldiers, and the taking away of their Corne and Cattell from them;
And likewiſe, the ſaid Children are not now permitted to doe their ſervice at Burials as formerly,
which was a good helpe towards their relieſe: By theſe and other meanes, the ſaid Hoſpitall hath not
been able to keepe ſo many Children as formerly they have done.</p>
            <p>THere hath been cured this yeare laſt paſt, at the Charge of S. <hi>Bartholomewes</hi> Hoſpitall, of maimed
Souldiers, and other diſeaſed perſons, to the number of—901</p>
            <p>Moſt whereof being Souldiers, have been relieved with money, and other neceſſaries at their
departure.</p>
            <p>Buried this yeare after much Charge in their Sickneſſe—180</p>
            <p>Remaining under Cure at this preſent, at the charge of the ſaid Hoſpitall—268</p>
            <p>THere hath been Cured at the Charge of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> Hoſpitall this yeare laſt paſt, of diſeaſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,

            <p>Remaining under Cure, upon the charge of the ſaid Hoſpitall at this preſent—215</p>
            <p>THere hath been brought to the Hoſpitall of <hi>Bridewell,</hi> within the ſpace of one whole yeare laſt
paſt, of wandring Souldiers, and other vagrant people, to the number of—575</p>
            <p>Many whereof have been very chargeable to the ſaid Hoſpitall, for Apparrell, ſick dyet, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
beſides their ordinary dyet, and other proviſions and charges expended about them, which
could not be avoyded by reaſon of their neceſſities; and many of them have been paſſed into their
Countries, with Clothing and Apparrell to cover their nakedneſſe, which could not be otherwiſe
conſidering their miſeries, nor they thence paſſed without ſuch charge. And there are now kept and
maintained, in Arts and Occupations, and other ſeverall works and labours, at the charge of the ſaid
Hoſpitall, Apprentices and other perſons, to the number of—198</p>
            <p>The Hoſpitall of <hi>Bethlem</hi> is of great Antiquity, uſe, and neceſſity, for keeping and curing diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
perſons, who are of all other the moſt miſerable, by reaſon of their wants, both for ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and have no ſenſe thereof.</p>
            <p>The charge thereof is very great, there being kept and maintained with Phyſick, Dyet, and other
reliefe, 52. diſtracted perſons conſtantly at leaſt, beſides the charge of Servants to looke to them,
they being moſt unruly and not able to helpe themſelves, and the Rents and Revenues of the ſaid
Hoſpitall being very ſmall, not amounting to two third parts of the yearely charge, and therefore
this Hoſpitall is a fit object of charity, there having been of late by the bleſſing of God, upon the
charge of the ſaid Hoſpitall, and the care of thoſe that are intruſted with the ſaid diſtracted people,
divers reduced to their former ſenſes.</p>
