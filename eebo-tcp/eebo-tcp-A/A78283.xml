         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF William Lenthall <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Humblly Submitted to the Conſideration of the Honourable Houſe of</hi> Commons.</head>
            <opener>Setts Forth,</opener>
            <p>THAT about the Time of Sr. <hi>John Cutler</hi>'s Deceaſe, he was indebted to him, about 12000 <hi>l.</hi> Principal and intreſt to that Time, for ſecuring of which his Eſtate in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and the Fees and Perquiſits of his Office of Marſhal of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> were Mortgaged.</p>
            <p>That about <hi>May</hi> 1697. <hi>Edmund Bolter</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Executor to the ſaid Sr. <hi>John Cutler</hi> made up an Accompts of 18001 <hi>l.</hi> for Principal, Intereſt, and Charges, and did prevail with the ſaid Mr <hi>Lenthall</hi> to Sign the ſame upon Offers of great Abatements.</p>
            <p>That ſome time after, Mr. <hi>Bolter</hi> did promiſe and agree to take 15000 <hi>l.</hi> in full Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the ſaid Debt; and that one Mr. <hi>Symond Fowkes,</hi> did promiſe Mr. <hi>Lenthall</hi> he would remove the ſaid Mortgage, and pay Mr. <hi>Bolter</hi> the 15000 <hi>l.</hi> and pay Mr. <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thall</hi> 400 l.<hi>per Ann.</hi> or proportionably, for Subſiſtance, till the ſame could be done, for which Mr: <hi>Lenthall</hi> was to allow him 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and in order thereto paid Mr. <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thall</hi> ſeveral ſmall Summs, and took Notes under his Hand for the repayment of the ſame upon Demand; and never removed the ſaid Mortgage.</p>
            <p>That Mr. <hi>Fowkes,</hi> under Pretence, and in caſe of Mortality, prevailed with Mr. <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thall</hi> to excecut ſome Deeds to him of his Eſtate and Office, without any Copy, or Counterpart thereof, which were agreed to be left in Truſt in one Mr. <hi>Card</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels Hands: And Mr. <hi>Fowkes</hi> helping him to ſome ſmall Summs more, for Subſiſtance, prevailed with him to execute a Grant (together with the ſaid <hi>Edmund Bolter</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to a late Act of Parliament) of the ſaid Office, to one Mr. <hi>Gimbert</hi> (now Marſhal) at 1400 l.<hi>per Ann.</hi> Rent, as Mr. <hi>Fowkes</hi> told Mr. <hi>Lenthall,</hi> which ſince proves to be but 1000 l.<hi>per Ann.</hi> Upon ſealing of which Mr. <hi>Fowkes</hi> promiſed to pay him 500 <hi>l.</hi> the next Day, but did not.</p>
            <p>That Mr. <hi>Bolter</hi> hath been in poſſeſſion of the Eſtate in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> about five Years, which was uſually let for 700 l.<hi>per Ann.</hi> And the Office as long, which was never let under 1400 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> which Mr. <hi>Lenthall</hi> well hoped would have Sunk the Debt to 12000 <hi>l.</hi> or leſs: But inſtead thereof Mr. <hi>Fowks,</hi> brought Mr, <hi>Lenthall</hi> another Accompt, about <hi>May</hi> laſt, of the Principal, Intreſt, and Charges of his and Mr. <hi>Polters,</hi> with Intereſt upon Intereſt, amounting to 19794 <hi>l.</hi> 18 <hi>s.</hi> 5 <hi>d.</hi> which they would have him indebted to them, without having Reſpect to the 3000 <hi>l.</hi> which Mr. <hi>Bolter</hi> agreed to abate.</p>
            <p>And ſince that time, Mr. <hi>Lenthall</hi> is informed Mr. <hi>Bolter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fowkes</hi> have Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and Conveyed the Eſtate and Office, to the Right Honourable the Earle of <hi>Radnor,</hi> the Debt being now ſwelled up to above 20000 <hi>l.</hi> as they compute, without having regard to the yearly Rent Mr. <hi>Gimbert</hi> was obliged to pay for the ſaid Office.</p>
            <p>That the Eſtate at <hi>Haſeley</hi> and <hi>Latchford</hi> is eſteemed to be worth upwards of 13000 <hi>l.</hi> having a Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Built upon it which coſt 4000 <hi>l.</hi> Sr. <hi>John Lenthall,</hi> his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father ſold 1000 l.<hi>per.Ann.</hi> Land of Inhertance, when he purchaſed the ſaid Office, for which the ſaid <hi>William Lenthall</hi> hath been ſince bid, above 20000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So he hopes, if the Office be diſſolved, he ſhall have a Compenſation eqaivalent, (there having been no Miſmanagement by him) being his Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Now, ſince the ſaid Debt upon it, is ſo unreaſonably ſwell'd up, and the Eſtate and Office ſo undervalued and leſſened, and Mr. <hi>Lenthall</hi> having nothing to pay his other Debts which he hath contracted, nor to ſubſiſt on, but the ſaid Eſtates and Office, which is his Inheritance, <hi>he humbly beggs the Conſideration, Compaſſion, and Relief of this Honourable Houſe of</hi> Commons: <hi>Without which he muſt Starve in a Priſon; and humbly prays he may be heard by his Councel, at the Barr of this Honourable Houſe, before the Bill do paſs.</hi>
