            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Thus should we all set before our eies
<pb facs="tcp:2900:3"/>
the example of our master Christ, and
tread in his holy steppes: <hi>I haue giuen you
an example</hi> saith our blessed sauiour
Iohn 13. 15. this it is to run after the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of his ointment,<note place="margin">Cantic. 1. 2.</note> to followe his
sweete example. As Aarons ointment
ranne down from his head to the skirtes

are from him as our head dispersed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his members: therefore Christ
vouchsafeth to call his faithfull seruants
his fellowes or partners. Psal. 45. 7. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they partake of his goodnes, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour

            <p>Heere then is set forth vnto vs in this

that we should therein be like our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
master, to be occupied in earnest
and faithfull praier: wherein in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
diuerse profitable points are to be
obserued.</p>
            <p>I We are taught how necessary a
thing it is to be suters vnto God by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
for if Christ praied, who in respect
of himselfe needed not to pray, but for
<pb facs="tcp:2900:3"/>
our example: who neither wanted any
grace to pray for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor yet had any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection

praied for vs, much more haue
we cause to pray for our selues, both to
receiue graces, which we haue not, and
to be released of the euills which we
haue. Ambrose saith well: quid pro

so should our thoughtes be setled in
prayer, that then most of all men should
follow the wise mans counsell,<note place="margin">Prou 4 23.</note> 
               <hi>to keepe

<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as Zeno said of his schollers,

not bablers of words, but vtterers of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
Hierome fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this to be his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

aut per porticus deambulo, aut de faenore
computo: <hi>I thinke I am walking on the
streates, or accounting my mony:</hi> so it is
an easy matter for the thoughts to roue
in praier, which we are taught to settle
by Christes example.</p>
            <p>V Our blessed sauiour had therefore
free recourse to praier, because he was of
an holy and innocent life: soe if we would
haue our praiers heard, we must lift vp
pure hands as the Apostle saith 1. Tim. 2. 8.
Basilo saith well: <hi>that the presence of an
honest life doth make our praiers to haue
a loud sound.</hi>

            <p>VI Our sauiour also by his example
teacheth vs for what things we should

blessings: as v. 17. he saith <hi>sanctifie
them with thy truth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King 3.</note> Salomon, because

               <hi>whatsoeuer you desire beleeue you shall

his earnest suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
made in the daies
of his flesh, are for our edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
And as our blessed sauiour came
into this world annointed to be our king,
our prophet, and preist, soe accordingly
hereunto all his principall actions were
sorted out: in his holy workes &amp; miracles,
he shewed his diuine power as a king, in his

               </gap>e knowne his
diuine wisdome as our prophet: and in his
praiers he testified his diuine loue as a
mercifull high preist.</p>
            <p>Three of Christs praiers are especially
commended vnto vs: that at Lazarus
graue,<note place="margin">Ioh. 11.</note> the other in the garden before his
passion,<note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> this in the 17. of Iohn, as a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
thereunto: the first made with
<pb facs="tcp:2900:7"/>
sighes and grones, the second with droppes
of blood and teares, the third with great
zeale and affection: the first shewing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration,
the second making a way to
our redemption, the third the fruite of
his mediation.</p>
            <p>In three things this praier of Christ dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
from the requestes of his members:
first in respect of the person that praieth,
secondly in the manner of the praier,
thirdly in the matter prayed for: the first
was with authoritie, he praieth as our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
both God and man, the second was
with all sanctitie, whereas we can not tell
how to pray as we ought. Rom. 8. 16. the
third with great efficacy: the force of this
praier continueth to the end of the world,
whereas our praiers are weake, and had
need often to be iterated and repeated,
and therefore the Apostle biddeth vs pray
without ceasing.<note place="margin">1. Thess. 5. 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Three principall benefits are conferred
vpon vs by this praier 1. our <hi>protection</hi>
from euil and danger: keepe them from

in the first Christ stretcheth forth
his hand as to Peter, to helpe vs that we
sinke not: in the second he looketh vpon vs
with the eyes of mercie as vpon the same
Peter,<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 61.</note> to giue vs his grace: in the third
his eares are open to heare vs, as they were

concerning his owne
glorification, from ve.
1. to verse 6. or as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the confirmation of his Church, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then present, consisting of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
&amp; other Disciples, from v. 6. to v. 20.
or which was afterward to bee called by
their preaching, from v. 20. to the end.</p>
            <p>The summe of Christs prayer is for his
glorification, which is expressed v. 1. v. 5.
The reasons which our Sauiour vseth for
this his request, are four, 1. <hi>à fine,</hi> from the
end, v. 1. <hi>Glorifie thy Sonne, that thy Sonne
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2900:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
also may glorifie thee. 2. à pari,</hi> from the
like, v. 2. <hi>As thou hast giuen him power ouer
all flesh:</hi> and as power is giuen vnto him, so
also glory belongeth vnto him. 3. <hi>à cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa
meritoria,</hi> from the meriting or deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
cause, v. 4. <hi>I haue glorified thee on earth,
and now glorifie mee:</hi> he was worthy of this
glory which was due vnto him. 4. <hi>ab ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo,</hi>
from the equitie of it: it was his owne
glory before the world was.</p>
            <p>But before I descend to intreate parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
of this Scripture, or any part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
there are three necessarie considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
first to be handled: two of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
Christs prayer in particular: first of
the <hi>validitie</hi> and <hi>efficacie</hi> thereof; whose
force and vertue extendeth to the worlds
end: secondly, of the qualitie and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene Christs prayer and ours,
betweene Christs prayer then in the daies
of his flesh, and the prayer or intercession
of his Mediatorship now. The other point
is, of the vse of Praier in generall, namely
of the necessitie thereof.</p>
            <p>First concerning the force and efficacy
of our Lords prayer,<note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note> it is euerlasting, it is
not yet either extinct or slaked, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
still, and shall till the worlds end:
for though there are now sixteene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2900:11"/>
yeares well nie, since this praier was
vttered by our Sauiour, yet the benefite
thereof doth extend it selfe vnto this age:
for we also, as many as beleeue in Christ
through the word of the Apostles, are
comprehended in this praier, verse 20.</p>
            <p>1 Thus the Apostle testifieth, that our
Sauiour offered vp <hi>in the daies of his flesh,
praiers and supplications with strong cries and
teares, and was heard, Hebr.</hi> 5. 7. As he was
heard in that zealous prayer which hee
made in the Garden before his passion,
whereof the Apostle there chiefly spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth;
so also he was heard in all other his
praiers, <hi>Iohn 11. 42. I know thou hearest me
alwaies:</hi> and especially in this praier, which
he powreth forth in the behalfe of his vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
Church, then being, or which was
to come.</p>
            <p>2 If <hi>Abels</hi> voice spake after his death:
(for by saith yet being dead hee speaketh,
<hi>Heb. 11. 5.)</hi> much more doth the voice of
Christ in this praier yet speake vnto God,
which as the Apostle saith, <hi>speaketh better
things then the bloud of</hi> Abel, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 24.
If <hi>Abels</hi> voice was heard after his death
crying for vengeance, much more Christs
voice yet soundeth in the eares of GOD
calling for mercie. <hi>Salomons</hi> praier, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2900:12"/>
he made at the dedication of the temple,
1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. did consecrate the temple to that
holy vse, not during his time, but so long
as the temple stood: for thus he praieth,
v. 38. <hi>What prayer or supplication soeuer shall
be made of any man, &amp;c. and shall stretch forth
his hands in this house, heare thou in heauen.</hi>
If <hi>Salomons</hi> prayer did transferre the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
thereof to the succeeding ages, much
more auaileable is the power of Christ.</p>
            <p>3 Then like as the Manna was laid vp in
the Arke, though it was of it selfe but as a
melting dew, which faded by the heate of
the Sunne, yet by Gods blessing endured
many hundred yeares: so the voyce of
Christ,<note place="margin">Plutarc. de garrulitat.</note> though it were a transitorie sound,
yet it hath a permanent force. The Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
doe speake much of a certaine place of
Olympia, which giueth seuen ecchoes or
reflexions of one voice, which therefore
they call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of seuen voyces. But we
may woorthily admire this prayer of
Christ, which giueth not only seuen or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenty
seuen voices, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually sounds
in the eares of God &amp; reboundeth to vs.</p>
            <p>4 For the Preacher saith, <hi>Ecclesiast. 3. 12.
I know, that whatsoeuer God doth shall bee
for euer:</hi> and the Prophet saith, <hi>Psal. 119.
89. Thy word endureth for euer in heauen.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:2900:12"/>
This prayer therefore proceeding from
the sonne of God, must needes be of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
force, as the Apostle saith. <hi>This
man, because he endureth euer, hath an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
priesthood. Hebr.</hi> 7. 24. Wherefore
his prayer being an act of his priesthood,
is also euerlasting.</p>
            <p>5 Wherefore, this is much to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the Church of God, that this holy
prayer of Christ is still in memorie with
God: that like as they boldely come into
the Princes presence, when their supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is already offered, and their suit gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
so haue wee through the prayer of
Christ bold accesse: his prayer maketh a
way for our prayers, euen as the arke went
before to diuide the waters of Iordan, and
the people followed after, <hi>Iosua</hi> 3. 14. so
hath Christ our Arke, Altar, Priest, and
all, diuided a way for our prayers: he is the
doore, and by him also a doore is opened
to our prayers, as <hi>Ambrose</hi> well saith vpon
these words, <hi>Reue. 4. 1. I looked, and beholde
a doore was opened in heauen:</hi>

               </gap> Secondly we are to consider first of the

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:2900:13"/>
and the praiers of his church: then of the

                  </gap>st and of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note> 1. Christs prayer tendeth
wholly to the good of his church; he hath
no neede to pray for himselfe, as neither
did hee offer vp sacrifice for himselfe, as
the high Priest did, both for his owne
sins, and then for the sins of the people,
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 27. for euen the prayer of Christ
for his glorification is for the church, that
they may behold his glorie, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 24.
but the scope &amp; end of our prayers is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the release of our selues.</p>
            <p>2. Christs prayer is perfect, without
any doubting or wauering or any infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
besides: for God is in him well pleased,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. but our praiers are imperfect:
<hi>wee know not what to pray as wee ought, Rom.
8.</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>3. Christs praiers are meritorious, as
euerie other worke of his was: <hi>for the lamb
that was killed, is worthie to receiue power.
Reuel.</hi> 5. 14. but our prayers merite not:
for when wee haue done all, we haue done
nothing, but which was our duetie to do,
<hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10.</p>
            <p>4. Christ prayeth by himselfe, he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2900:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
none other to pray by: but our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
cannot bee accepted without a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour:
yea the Apostle dare not presume
to offer thankes vnto God, but through
Iesus Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
            <p>5. The prayer of Christ is the prayer
not of a mortall man, but of one that is
both God and man, who is inferiour to
his father as he is man, but equall as he is
God: who prayeth not as an inferiour,
when he thus saith: <hi>Father, I will that they
which thou hast giuen me, be with mee where I
am, verse</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>6. Our prayers, because they are weak
and imperfect, had neede often to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed:
but this prayer of Christ being
once made, hath an euerlasting force: as
the Apostle speaketh of the offering of
Christ, <hi>with one offering hath he consecrated
for euer, them that are sanctified, Hebrews
10.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>Now hauing thus briefly shewed how
the prayers of the head and members dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
let vs consider likewise of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Christs praiers:<note place="margin">Christ prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now as he did in the earth.</note> the apostle saith,
that <hi>Christ euer liueth to make intercession
for vs, Hebr.</hi> 7. 25. But wee must not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that Christ praieth now sitting at
the right hand of God, as he did while he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2900:14"/>
liued in earth: with sighes and groanes as
at <hi>Lazarus</hi> graue, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 38. with criee
and teares, as in the garden, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 39.
sometime lifting vp his eyes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 1.
falling vpon his face, <hi>Marke</hi> 14. 35. some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time

               <hi>tanquam, in alio loco patrem, in

facere, That the father is as it were in one
place, the sonne to stand by in an other speaking
for vs:</hi> and the Apostle, <hi>saying that Christ in
the dayes of his flesh did offer vp prayers and
supplications with strong cries, Hebrews</hi> 7. 5.
sheweth that this manner of prayer vsed
by Christ then in the dayes of his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
doth not beseeme him now in the
time of his exaltation: and our Sauiour
himselfe saith, <hi>At that day ye shall aske in my
name: and I say not vnto you, that I will pray
vnto the father for you, Iohn</hi> 16. 26. that is, in
such manner as he prayed in earth he shal
not then neede to pray for vs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to cleare this point: these
three waies our Sauior is called our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2900:14"/>
and mediatour: first, because the
Lord for Christs sake, and together with
him doth graunt vs all things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.
and he hath promised, that whatsoeuer we
aske the father in his name, he will giue it
vs, <hi>Iohn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>6.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Christ maketh intercession
for vs, <hi>non vòce, sed miseratione,</hi> not by his
voyce, but in compassion and mercie, in
continuall succouring of his members, &amp;
relieuing our necessities: and therefore he
is called by the Apostle, <hi>a mercifull and a
faithfull high Priest, Hebr.</hi> 2. 17. that is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<hi>with the feeling of our infirmities, Hebr.
4</hi> 15. Wherefore in this sense also, because
he alwayes willeth and desireth our good,<note place="margin">How Christ is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of his church</note>
and doth send continuall succour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
to his members, he is worthily called
our Mediator: for his wil and desires and
his fathers are all one; &amp; in that the Lord
God the father of our Lord Iesus perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the will and desire of his sonne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vs: as where he prayeth, <hi>Ioh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I will that they which thou hast giuen mee bee
with me, &amp;c.</hi> herein doth his mediation
and intercession consist.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Apostle saith, <hi>He is entred
into the heauen to appeare in the sight of God
for vs, Heb.</hi> 9. 14. The very appearing then
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2900:15"/>
of Christ in his humane flesh before God
in the heauen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, is his intercession for vs:
the presence of his humanitie, the exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his glorious bodie,<note place="margin">How Christ appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eth before God for vs.</note> the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of his obedience, the force of his
passion, is an effectuall mediation with
God the Father for vs: there needs no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
supplication or request making. This
<hi>Daniel</hi> saw in vision, <hi>one like to the sonne of
man come in the heauens &amp;c. and they brought
him before the auncient of daies, Daniel</hi> 7. 13.
The very approching of Christ to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and exhibiting of his flesh in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
presence, is our sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mediation.
As the Lord saith concerning the bowe in
the cloud, <hi>that I may see it and remember

whereof is, 1. by prayer, as <hi>Mat. 7. 7. Aske

            <p>3 What is more necessarie for the day of
battell, then armour? so is prayer a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
part of our spirituall armour: as the
Apostle saith, <hi>Ephes. 6. 13. Put on the whole
armour of God, that ye may be able to resist in

prayer, it is the hauen of the soule, Psal. 116.
7. Returne vnto thy rest O my soule:</hi> it is the
food of the soule, as Christ said to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<hi>Iohn 4. 32. I haue meate to eate that ye

            </p>
            <p>4 The reason of this necessitie our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ sheweth, <hi>Matth. 26. 41. Watch
and pray, that yee enter not into temptation:</hi>
because wee are continually assaulted and
tempted of Sathan, wee haue neede also
continually to arme our selues with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
an other reason Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giueth; 1.
<hi>Tim. 4. 5. all things are sanctified by the word
of God and praier:</hi> thy meate, drink, labour,
riches, marriage, are polluted, vnholy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,

            <p>5 Wherefore the negligence of this Age
is to bee condemned that so seldome vse
prayer, either priuately, or in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
together with their wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
seruants: when they sit downe at
meate, they giue no thankes: being worse
in this respect then the oxe and asse, <hi>which

When they goe to bed, they do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

themselues vnto God, neither at
their rising praise him for their rest: but
they rouze themselues as swine out of the
strawe: when they goe foorth to labour,
they call not vpon God for his blessing:
but as it is in the psalme: <hi>the voyce of ioy
and mirth is in the habitation of the righteous:
Psalme</hi> 118. It is knowne where faithfull
men dwell, by their praying and singing

effectuall, that the feare thereof bee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated

            <p>Thus praied <hi>Dauid, Psalme 121. I will
lift vp my eies vnto the hilles from whence
commeth my helpe:</hi> and not his eies onelie

            <p>3 For looke as the <hi>eyes of seruants looke to

wait vpon God, <hi>Psalme</hi> 123. 2. as <hi>Peter</hi>
biddeth the lame man <hi>looke vpon him, Acts

looke and waite vpon GOD in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
from whom wee expect a blessing; our
eyes must be as Doues eyes, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 4. 1.
that is not vnconstant, wandering vnsted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,
but simple, sober, chaste, staid.</p>
            <p>4 For the Preacher saith, <hi>Ecclesiast. 9. 10.
Whatsoeuer thou doest, pro omni facultate fac:
Do it with all thy power:</hi> therefore when we
pray, our eyes, our hands, our tongue,
our heart must all be occupied and attent
vpon God; and this it is to loue God with
all our strength, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 27. when we pray
vnto him, and worship him with all our
inward and outward powers.</p>
            <p>5 Wherfore, they which pray with wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
eyes, and wauering thoughts are
not herein like vnto our Sauiour; the wise
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2900:18"/>
man saith: that <hi>the eyes of the foole are in
the corners of the world,</hi> Prou. 17. 24. <hi>but
the eyes of the wise are in his head,</hi> Eccles. 2.
14. that is, fixed and setled to looke vp
vnto God: the wandring of the eyes shew
an vnstedfast heart and running thoughts:
<hi>for death first entreth in by the windowes,</hi>
Ioel 9. 9. And the eyes which are as the
windowes of the bodie, do first minister
occasion of euill. But like as in other
things the husband is a veile of the eyes
to the wife, as it was said to Sara, Gen. 20.
16. that is, the eyes and affection of the
wife ought to be setled vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her husband,
and his likewise vpon her: so in this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
businesse of prayer, heauen and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
things should be a veile to our eyes
to couer and keepe them, from looking
toward or attending vpon any thing else:
all worldly thoughts and earthly desires
should be chased away from our prayers,
as Abraham droue away the birds from
his sacrifice, Gen. 15. We all are subiect
to this temptation in prayer: I remember

            </p>
            <p>From hence then this doctrine is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note>
that Christ praying vnto God and
calling him Father, (and he is his Father as
he is God) did execute his Mediatorship
not onely as he was man, but as he was
both God and man.</p>
            <p>This Saint Paule testifieth 2. Cor. 5.
19. <hi>God was in Christ, and reconciled the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2900:19"/>
world to himselfe.</hi> Christ then reconciled
the world, wherein consisted the office
and worke of the Mediator, not as he was
man onely, but as God was in him; that
is, as he was God: for God to be in Christ
is nothing else, but to shew that Christ is
God; as Colos. 2. 9. <hi>In him dwelleth all the
fulnesse of the Godhead bodily.</hi> Likewise
Heb. 7. 28. <hi>The Law maketh men high
Priests which haue infirmitie, but the word
of the oath, &amp;c. maketh the Sonne, which
is consecrated for euermore:</hi> if Christ be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
a Priest as he is the Sonne, then
as he is God; for the Sonne is God.</p>
            <p>A further proofe and experience here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
we haue in this Chapter, vers. 24. <hi>

I will that they which thou hast giuen
me, be with me where I am, &amp;c.</hi> Christ
prayeth not here as an inferiour, but as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
vnto God, as whose will is one with
Gods: neuer any humble suppliant would
thus pray, I will this, or I will that. Againe
another example we haue in the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the law, which was giuen by the
hand of a Mediator, Gal. 3. 19. which
most interpreters both old and new do
vnderstand of Christ. There are onely two
of the ancient Writers that I know, <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi>
and <hi>Gennadius,</hi> that expound it of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2900:20"/>
Moses, and Maister <hi>Beza</hi> of the New. If
Christ then did in some sort performe the
office of a Mediator before his incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
he did it then as God: for whether we say
he is called a Mediator onely <hi>Propheticè,</hi>
prophetically; because he was then desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and appointed to be our Mediator, or
that the legall Mediation is one, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall
(which before his incarnation
he entred not into) another; both which I
willingly grant, yet neither of these could
be affirmed of Christ, without a necessary
relation to his diuine Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This also is yet more euidently expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in that vision of Iohn, Reu. 5. 7. <hi>Where
the Lambe taketh the booke out of the ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hand of him that sate vpon the throne,</hi> which
was a worke of the Mediator: <hi>this Lambe
stood as though he had bene killed,</hi> (wherby
his humilitie is signified) <hi>and he had seuen
hornes and seuen eyes, which are the seuen
spirits of God, and he was in the midst of the
throne:</hi> by which three circumstances of
his power, his authoritie in sending the
spirit, his sitting in one throne with God,
his diuine Nature, is insinuated.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The reason why both natures of God
and man must concurre not onely in the
constitution, but in the execution of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2900:20"/>
Mediatorship, Saint Paul sheweth, Gal.
3. 20. <hi>For a Mediator is not of one, but
God is one:</hi> the Mediator then is not God
onely, nor man onely; but he must par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of both, and exercise his Mediators
office in both.</p>
            <p>First then by this doctrine is refuted the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
opinion of the Papists, who affirme and
hold, that Christ exercised the office of
his Priesthood and Mediatorship onely
as man, not as God: because the Apostle
saith, <hi>There is one God and one Mediator
between God and man, the man Iesus Christ:</hi>
which words as they vrge them, would as
well conclude the Mediator not to be
God, as not to exercise his Mediatorship
as God. And whereas the Apostle saith,
the man Iesus Christ, though he say not,
God and man Iesus Christ; yet this name
Iesus, which signifieth a Sauiour, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the Godhead also, as the Apostle
saith, vers. 3. <hi>God our Sauiour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas the Arrians obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
that Christ was inferior and lesse
then God, because he that prayeth is lesse
then he to whom prayer is made: the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is readie; that all the parts of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators
office, which do betoken seruice
or subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto God, Christ performed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2900:21"/>
as man: but the power of the worke, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
glorie, he executed as God:
though he prayed as man, he could not
preuaile by the merit of his prayer, but as
both God and man: and as Bernard saith,
<hi>ad hunc miseria, ad illum pertinet poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia:</hi>
to the manhood belongeth the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
and sorrowes of the Mediator, to
the Godhead the honor and power: and
as Augustine, <hi>Diuina humanitas, humana
diuinitas Mediatrix: his diuine humanity,
and humane Diuinitie is the Mediator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Pray with confidence.</note> as Christ in his prayer saith
Father, so he teacheth vs to pray, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
that is, with confidence and full as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance:
like as there is no <hi>father, which if
his child aske him bread, will giue him a

whatsoeuer we desire when we pray, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that we shall haue it, it shall be done

            <p>
               <hi>So the Preacher saith, that</hi> there is a

shewing thereby, that the motion and

of times, runneth not by chaunce, but is
ordered and directed by Gods al-seeing

wherfore, because all wisdome is in God,

The first whereof did bring in a fatall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie,

Psal.</hi> 135. 6. he is not forced by, or tyed

            <p>
               <hi>The Epicures imputed all to Fortune,
so do many carnall men, that cannot look

Time and chance commeth to all. <hi>Ambrose

vsque ad lunam tantum Dei descendere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidentiam:
sed quis operator negliget operis

God taketh no care of vs: and Aristotle, that
Gods prouidence descendeth no lower then

            <p>Secondly, this doctrine hath a speciall

that when the time of mercie and
deliuerance is fulfilled, they shal surely see
the Lords sauing health. Thus the Church

patiently to expect the Lords appointed

which hauing receiued any grace or gift

men aske any thing of God to a wrong

we must simply and vnfainedly intend

giue him the glory due vnto him, which is

               </gap>od of yron in his

And as he that treadeth the wine-presse,

and tread them vnder foote in my wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reason of this great power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

Heb. 1. 2. <hi>whom he hath made heire of all

wherefore it is iust that Christ should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite

Againe, the Apostle further alleageth out

thy God hath annointed thee with the oile of

of his perfect obedience and absolute

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> First then this doctrine of Christs so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
power, doth ouerthrow that
proud conceit of the Bishop of Rome,
who challengeth to be Christs Vicar in
earth,<note place="margin">The Pope not Christs Vicar.</note> and the ministeriall head of his vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
Church: it is blasphemy to say that
any mortall man can execute this great
power of Christ ouer all flesh: Christ saith
<hi>all power is giuen vnto me,</hi> it is not giuen to
any else, neither will God giue his honor
to another: yet the Pope vsurpeth Christ
power, to command Angels, to canonize
Saints, to open and shut the kingdome of
God to whom he list; wherein he sheweth
himself to be the prince of pride, and very
Antichrist. S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>We will not reioyce
of things which are not within our measure,
but according to the measure of the line,
whereof God hath distributed vnto vs a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:2900:26"/>
to attaine vnto you. 2. Cor. 10. 13.
But the Bishop of Rome doth extend him
selfe beyond the line of his measure: he
might content himselfe with his own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesse
and go no further. Ambrose saith:
<hi>Gratia Christiana non contenta est eosdem
habere limites,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, seeing all power and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is committed to Christ, who is able
alone to take vengeance of his enemies,
let carnall and profane men stand in awe
of Christ, take heed how they do blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme

persecute his members: as the Prophet

Like as the Israelites only passed through

as desire to be made partakers of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

vnto Christ, is not to be baptised: so
was Simon Magus, and yet Peter said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

him: Thou hast no part nor fellowship
in this businesse, Act. 8. 21. nor yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
to pray: so did the Pharisie, and yet
was not iustified, Luk. 18. nor to be an
hearer of the word: so was Herode, and
yet an hypocrite. Mark. 6. 20. Nor yet
doth it suffice to preach the word: for so
did Iudas, and yet was the child of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This it is therfore to be giuen vnto
Christ, to be separate from the world, and
to cleaue vnto Christ by a liuely faith, and
to be guided by the spirit of Christ, to be
mortified in the flesh, and sanctified in the
spirit, as the Apostle saith, Rom. 8. 10.
<hi>If Christ be in you, the bodie is dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

Christ by faith, and leade their life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:
who do not onely behold as in a

into the same image,</hi> 2. Cor. 3. 18. they are

of this world do happily arriue: as it is said
in the Psalme, <hi>He bringeth them to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
where they would be,</hi> Psal. 107. 30.</p>
            <p>The reasons why God prouideth for his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
eternall life out of the Scripture, are these:
first, from Gods iustice, 2. Thess. 1. 6. it is a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2900:31"/>
iust thing with God to recompence tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
to those that trouble you, <hi>and to
you that are troubled, rest.</hi> Secondly, from
Gods honour, Mat. 22. 32. <hi>he is not the God
of the dead, but of the liuing:</hi> seeing then
that God is God of the faithful departed,
they therefore are aliue vnto him, for it
were not for the liuing Gods honour to
be the God of the dead. Thirdly, from the
state and condition of the faithfull, which
were of all other most miserable, if in this
life onely we haue hope. 1. Corint. 15. 19.
Fourthly, from the priuiledge of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession:
we are the holy temples of God
which shall not be destroyed. 1. Cor. 3. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Wherefore first we reproue the vaine
opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the heathen, who were grossely
deceiued concerning the state of the soule
after this life.<note place="margin">Enemies to euerlasting life confuted.</note> The Epicures beleeued no
immortalitie, nor yet any being of the
soule after death. Of like opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were the
Sadduces among the Iewes, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists
among vs. The Pithagoreans did
thinke that the soules did passe out of
one bodie into another, yea into the
bodies of bruite beastes, such as they
were like vnto in condition of life and
manners. The Platonists did hold the
immortalitie of the soule, but not of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2900:31"/>
the bodie. The Peripatetickes and Poets
imagined the soules of good men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
starres. None of them beleeued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
concerning the immortalitie both of
soule and body, and of eternall life with
God. This knowledge we haue from the
scriptures, and God reuealed these things
to vs by his spirit, 1. Corin. 2. 10. that both
our bodies and soules shall be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritors
of life through Christ, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
sheweth: <hi>We shall be eaught vp with
him in the clouds, to meete the Lord in the

               </gap>rnard <hi>doth very well describe the
happy state both of our bodies and soules
in the kingdome of God, agreeable to this
doctrin of</hi> Paul: <hi>first for the soule he saith:
whereas there are three faculties thereof,</hi>
rationalis, concupiscibilis irascibilis, <hi>the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
part, the election or will, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi>
Implebit Deus rationale nostrum luce
sapientiae, implebit concupiscibile nostrum
fonte iustitiae, implebit irascibile nostru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
pace &amp; tranquillitate: He will replenish
our reason with the light of wisedome and
knowledge, our electiue facultie with iustice,
that it shall desire nothing but what is to be
desired, our wrathfull and boyling affection
with peace and tranquilitie. <hi>Concerning
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2900:32"/>
the bodie, whereas it consisteth of foure
elements:</hi> Habebit terra nostra immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,
Our earthly part shal haue immortality.
Habebit aqueum nostrum impassibilitatem,
Our watrie part sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>udinem, Our fiery

            <p>Secondly, the dulnesse of our affections
is here to be quickned, and our desire to
be inflamed toward the attaining of this
happie estate, we should be still groueling
vpon the earth, but eleuate our hearts to
heauen, <hi>and to haue our conuersation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
from whence we looke for our Sauiour,</hi>
Phil. 3. 20. It is recorded by the heathen,
that one <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> reading <hi>Plato</hi> his

that hauing so pure doctrine reuealed
concerning true eternitie,<note place="margin">The desire which we ought to haue to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life.</note> which they but

Phil. 1. 23. Wherefore the assurance and

chiefe scope of all our studies, the drift of
our desires, the marke to aime at, the race

to saile vnto, the pearle to be purchased,
the inheritance to be desired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the country
to be trauelled vnto: &amp; this is that wherein
we ought chiefly to reioyce, <hi>that our
names are written in heauen,</hi> Luke 10. 20.
thy riches, honour, strength, beautie, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
wife, children, ease, prosperitie, are
not to be ioyed in, in comparison of this
blessed estate; the which if we earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
now, we shall vndoubtedly possesse
then through Iesus Christ, to whom be
praise for euer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they know thee to be the onely very
God.</hi> Our Sauiour saith not, to know thee
only to be very God; for if the father only
were God, then the Sonne and the holy
Ghost should be excluded: but the Father
is that onely God, and so is the sonne and
the holy Ghost, they all three are but only
one very God: as where the Apostle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
Iesus Christ the onely Lord, <hi>Iude</hi> 4.
neither the Father nor the holy Ghost are
excluded, for they are all the onely Lord,
though they be deuided in person, yet the
vnity and essence of the diuine nature and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2900:33"/>
power is not deuided.</p>
            <p>The knowledge then of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Doct. 2. Of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of the knowledge of God.</note>
sonne and holy Ghost is necessary to
saluation: the ignorance whereof is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to depriue vnbeleeuers of eternall
life.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> So the Apostle saith, that they which
are without Christ, and without God in
this world, are strangers from the promise
and from the common-wealth of Israell.
Ephes. 2. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Such a one was <hi>Pharao,</hi> who wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

God, the Lord would not vouchsafe to
know him, but gaue him ouer to hardnes
of heart, and got vnto himself great glory
in his destruction and confusion. Thus our

speaking to the woman of Samaria, <hi>Iohn
4. 22. Ye worship that which ye know not,
we worship that which we know, for saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

as the oxe and asse not knowing their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

they which know not God their Creator,
are in the high way to destruction, and are
barred from life.</p>
            <p>The reason hereof S. <hi>Paule</hi> sheweth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Rom. 10. 13. <hi>Whosoeuer shall call vpon the

which did hold but one person of
the godhead: as the Tritheits that do wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
teach, that there are three Gods as
well as three persons.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Against A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists.</note> all Atheists are here condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that beleeue no God at all, such as
were <hi>Diagoras</hi> and one <hi>Theodorus</hi> among
the heathen. Likewise the Gentiles are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued,
who worshipped those which
were not Gods, Gal. 4. 8. and brought in a
multitude of gods, for they did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the onely very God, both
worshipping many gods, and those also
false gods.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as heresie and prophanenesse
condemneth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so also ignorance: for that
whosoeuer knoweth not, nor yet belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
aright in the Trinitie, cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
as our Sauiour Christ saith, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 19.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2900:34"/>
               <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come
into the world, and men loued darknesse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then light.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ignorance dangerous.</note> Hearken then ye ignorant
persons, ye simple men and women,
though there were no other matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you, your owne ignorance &amp; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is sufficient to condemne you: say
not, mine innocencie shall saue me, I do
hurt to none, I do no wrong, I am harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
&amp;c. For the ignorant person cannot
be innocent, seeing by his ignorance and
vnbeleefe he dishonoureth God: it is in
vaine to say. I dishonour not man, when
thou dost dishonour God. Ambrose saith
well: <hi>Innocentia &amp; scientia beatum faciunt:
Innocencie and knowledge make happie:</hi> if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be wanting, there is no true happines.
Wherefore let euery one labour for the
knowledge of God: parents instruct your
children, maisters your seruants, husbands
teach your wiues; do not nourish your
selues in ignorance, and cast away your
soules for want of knowledge.</p>

It is not sufficient to saluation to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
God the Creator,<note place="margin">Doct. 3. No saluation without faith in Christ.</note> yea to confesse

he beleeueth not in the name of the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Sonne of God,</hi> Ioh. 3. 18. And again,
<hi>ye beleeue in God, beleeue also in me,</hi> Ioh. 14
1. It is not then enough to beleeue in God
the Almightie and omnipotent Creator,
vnlesse also we beleeue in Iesus Christ our
mercifull Sauiour. Saint Iohn according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
saith: <hi>Euery spirit that confesseth not Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ to be come in the flesh, is not of
God,</hi> 1. Ioh. 3. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Peter is commended for this faith, for
confessing Christ the sonne of the liuing
God, Mat. 16. 16. And after Thomas had
said to Christ, <hi>Thou art my Lord and my
God:</hi> Iesus said to him, <hi>Because thou hast
seene, thou beleeuest, blessed are they that
haue not seene and haue beleeued,</hi> Ioh. 20.
28. 29. Yea this was the faith of Abraham
Ioh. 8. 56. <hi>Abraham</hi> (saith our Sauiour)
<hi>reioyced to see my day, he saw it and was glad.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> So like as when Moses was absent, who
was a mediator that went betweene God
&amp; his people, the whole host went astray,
and committed most grosse Idolatrie, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xod.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>2. so and much more are we like to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2900:35"/>
perish, if we haue not the presence of
Christ our Mediator. Moses also said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, when he told them, that he wold
not go with them, because they were a
stiffe-necked people, but he would send
onely an Angell before them, Exod. 33.
2. 3. <hi>If thy presence go not with vs, carie vs
not hence,</hi> vers. 15. If then the presence of
the Mediator was necessarie to conduct
them vnto that terrestriall Canaan, much
more to the celestiall.</p>
            <p>For in Christ onely is the Lord appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
toward vs, Mat. 3. 17. <hi>This is my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued
Sonne in whom I am well pleased.</hi>
Without Christ the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no reconclli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
no peace or attonement with God.
Like as princes offended must be dealt
with by Mediators, as the cities of Tyrus
and Sidon desired peace of Herod by the
mediation of Blastus his chamberlaine,
Act. 12. 20. so God being displeased
with vs for our sinnes, there is no accesse
to be had into his presence without Christ
the Mediator.</p>
            <p>First then all heretikes are condemned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
that beleeue not aright in Iesus Christ, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
denying his natures, blaspheming
his person, or derogating from his offices.
Of the first sort are the Arria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; Paulians,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2900:36"/>
that denie his Godhead:<note place="margin">Diuerse here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies against the natures &amp; person of Christ.</note> the one saying,
that Christ is not equall vnto God: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that he took beginning from Mary.
The Valentinians denied his humanitie,
saying, he tooke nothing of his mother,
but passed through her as water through
a pipe. The Eutichians also are of this
kind, who confound the natures of Christ,
and affirme in him the diuine nature on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to remaine. Of the second sort are the
Nestorians, who make two persons in
Christ, one person of God-Christ, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of man-Christ, saying: that Marie
was the mother of the man-Christ, not of
God-Christ. Of the third ranke were the
<hi>Angelici,</hi> so called, because they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
Angels, and made them their Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
such are the Papists, that pray vnto
Saints, and ioyne them with Christ in the
office of the Mediatorship: all these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
not Iesus Christ truly, whom
God hath sent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, we must know, that it is not
sufficient to haue a general and superficial
knowledge, but liuely and effectuall: such
as Saint Paul had, confessing thus of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
Gal.</hi> 2. 20. Thus I liue, not I now, but
Christ liueth in me: and in that I liue now in
the flesh, I liue by faith in the Sonne of God,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2900:36"/>
who hath loued me, and giuen himselfe for
me. <hi>Such a faith and knowledge of Christ
then is requisite, whereby the soule liueth
vnto God, working alwaies by loue, Gal.
5. 6. For there are two things necessarie
to saluation: the inward beleefe of the
heart, and the outward confession and
demonstration of it, as Saint Paule shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
Rom.</hi> 10. 10. With the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth
vnto righteousnesse, with the mouth
man confesseth to saluation.<note place="margin">De Isaacho cap. 8.</note> 
               <hi>And Saint

and confession, let it shine in our workes and

            <p>THis is the third reason which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
vseth, for the obtaining of his
glorification: that because he had glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his Father in earth, and finished his
worke, that his father would glorifie him
againe. He reasoneth from the desert to
the reward, which are relatiues, that is,
haue respect and mutuall relation the one
to the other.</p>
            <p>That Christ sought the glorie of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
both himselfe saith it, Ioh. 4. 34. <hi>My
meate is, that I may do th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> will of him that
sent me, and finish his worke:</hi> and his Father
from heauen approueth the same: for after
our Sauiour had said: <hi>Father, glorifie thy
name,</hi> there came presently a voice from
heauen, saying: <hi>I haue both glorified it, and
will glorifie it againe,</hi> Ioh. 12. 28. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is euident, that as God had bene
glorified by the heauenly sermons and
diuine miracles shewed by Christ in his
life, so also he would set foorth his glorie
in his blessed death.</p>
            <p>From hence then we learne,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> that they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2900:37"/>
which will be assured to receiue glorie at
the hands of God in heauen, must inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to set foorth his glorie here in earth.</p>
            <p>This our Lord promiseth, Reuel. 3. 27.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>To him that ouercometh, will I graunt to sit
with me in my throne, euen as I ouercame &amp;
sit with my Father in his throne.</hi> He that
shall set foorth the kingdome of Christ in
this world in ouercoming of sinne, and
subduing his owne affections, shall be
made partaker of Christs kingdome in
heauen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus our Sauior saith to his Apostles,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 28. Verily I say vnto you, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Sonne of man shall sit in the throne of his
maiestie, ye which followed me in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
shall sit vpon twelue thrones, and
iudge the twelue tribes of Israel. <hi>As they in
their regeneration expressed the spirituall
kingdome of Christ, so they shall enioy
the fellowship of his euerlasting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Saint Paule doth confirm the same
by his owne example, 2. Tim.</hi> 4. 8. I haue
fought a good fight, I haue finished my course,
I haue kept the faith, from hence foorth is
laid vp for me the crowne of righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>For like as they that runne in a race <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
and striue for maisteries, obtain a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
crowne, 1. Cor. 9. 25. so they which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2900:38"/>
contend for the Lord, and runne the way
of his commaundements, shall receiue an
incorruptible crowne. The great king of
the Persians hearing out of the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the faithfulnesse of Mordecai,
which had reuealed the conspiracie of
two of the Kings Eunuches against him,
presently said: <hi>What honour and dignitie
hath bene giuen to Mordecai for this?</hi> Esth.
6. 3. He thought it vnreasonable that his
faithfull seruice should go vnrecompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
Much more is it iust with God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the faithfull seruice of his.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> So the Apostle saith, <hi>that God the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Iudge shall giue him the crown of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,</hi>
2. Timot. 4. 8. This iustice of
God is the ground and cause of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
which his iustice dependeth not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the merit of our workes, or worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our obedience, but vpon the free
and most gracious promise of God in
Christ: which his most free and mercifull
promise, to fulfill and accomplish to his
seruants, it standeth with his stable and
inuiolable iustice.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> First then we see a difference by this
doctrine betweene Christ and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for thogh Christ our head by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
and merit of his obedience, is worthy
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2900:38"/>
of all glorie, Reuel. 4. 11. and might thus
pleade with his father for his glorificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
because he had glorified him: yet the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
cannot challenge any thing at the
hands of God,<note place="margin">Man cannot chalenge any thing from God by his merits.</note> for any worthinesse that is
in them, but onely for their Mediators
sake. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> thus praying, <hi>Remember
me, O my God, in goodnesse, according to all
that I haue done for this people:</hi> Nehem. 5.
19. requesteth not to be remembred of
God because of his faithfulnesse, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the same: his faithfulnesse is the
rule or measure, but Gods mercie is the
cause: or else where he confesseth, cap. 13.
22. <hi>Remember me ô God concerning this, and
pardon me according to thy great mercie:</hi> but
where merit is challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, there is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
but iustice shewed: so that as <hi>Bernard</hi>
well saith, <hi>Opera non sunt causa regnandi,
sed via regni: Good workes are not the cause
of raigning, but the way to the kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly we do learne, that whosoeuer
wil be assured to receiue glory in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God, must seeke to glorifie him
here. He then that dishonoureth God in
this life, how can he looke to receiue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
at the hands of God? Consider this
well all ye whom God hath honoured in
this life, with riches, authoritie, wit, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2900:39"/>
take heed that ye rob not God of
his glorie, in abusing these gifts to your
owne pleasure: as riches to pride and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse;
authoritie, to oppresse or do
wrong; wit to deceiue; knowledge, to
maintaine errour: for they that thus hide
their talent, shall haue the reward of the
vnthriftie seruant, both to lose the talent,
and to be cast themselues into vtter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
Mat. 25. 30. How shall blasphemers
that prophane Gods name, drunken and
gluttonous persons that make their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
their gods, proud men that make flesh
their arme, how shall they escape, or with
what faces can they appeare before the
throne of Christ, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue so much
dishonoured? Happie then are they which
make Gods glorie the end of their life, the
scope of all their actions, as the Apostle
saith: <hi>Whether ye eate or drinke, or whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ye do else, do all to the glory of God. 1. Cor.
10.</hi> 30. Then, come death, come sicknesse,
come hell it selfe, such a one shall not be
dismaid, his faithfull seruice shall not be
forgotten, the remembrance of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and testimony of his conscience shal
be as the anker-hold of his soule: as the
Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, Psal. 119. <hi>This I had
because I kept thy commaundements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:2900:39"/>
               <hi>I haue finished the worke which thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
me to do.</hi> Christ did not onely begin
the worke committed vnto him, but did
finish and make an end thereof, as he him
selfe said vpon the crosse: <hi>Consummatum
est,</hi> it is finished, Iohn 19. 30.</p>
            <p>This Scripture teacheth vs,<note place="margin">Doct. 2. Continuance to the end.</note> that it is not
sufficient to make a good beginning, or to
enter into the professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christs seruice,
but we must continue &amp; proceed therein,
and hold out vnto the end. So our Sauior <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
saith, Math. 24. 13. <hi>He that endureth to the
end, shall be saued. Reu. 2. 26. He that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
and keepeth my works to the end, to
him will I giue power ouer nations.</hi> What did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
it profit <hi>Herode to reuerence Iohn, and to
heare him gladly, and to do many things,</hi> and
after to cut off his head, Marke 6. or the
yong man to haue bene trayned vp in the
keeping of the law, and afterward to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from Christ for the loue he had to his
possessions, Marke 10? Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi>
saith, <hi>Teach me thy law, and I will keepe it to
the end,</hi> Psal. 119. 33. He wel knew that his
constant and enduring seruice should be
acceptable vnto God.</p>
            <p>Like as he that runneth in a race, vnlesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
he hold out to the gole, obtaineth not the
price: and therefore S. Paul saith, <hi>I haue fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2900:40"/>
my course.</hi> 2. Tim. 4. 7. As it auailed
not Lots wife to haue gone out of Sodom
and after to looke backe, nor yet the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
to haue departed out of Egypt, and
afterward to long for the fleshpots again:
so they shall neuer come to Canaan that
are wearie of weldoing, and do as it
were runne themselues out of breath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they come to the end of their race.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The meanes then whereby we may be
strengthened to continue, and make our
obedience perfect, are these: first to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
our owne strength, &amp; to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
all our power and actiuitie to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and our abilitie to proceed to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to be of God, as the Prophet saith,
Isay 26. 12. <hi>Thou hast wrought all our works
for vs:</hi> and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore the Church prayeth,
Psal. 68. 28. <hi>Thy God hath appointed thy
strength: stablish, O Lord, that thou hast
wrought in vs.</hi> So shold we pray vnto God
to assist vs with his grace, and so vphold vs
by his spirit, that we fal not. Secondly, we
must take heed, that we rashly enter not
into Christs seruice, but do beforehand
ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t all the perils and daungers that may

Luke 14. 28. This is the cause that many
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2900:40"/>
making a shew of zeale, hauing not layed
a good foundation, are constrained with
shame to giue ouer. Thirdly, a continuall
circumspection and watchfull care is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that we walke on by feare, alwaies
doubting our owne weakenes, and suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
our strength, as the Apostle sayth:
<hi>Let him that standeth take heed lest he fal.</hi> 1.

            <p>Wherefore let vs endeuour to be like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
out maister Christ, to grow to perfection,
and to finish the worke which God hath
imposed vppon vs. Many haue good
thoughts and spirituall motions, but they
do not nourish them: they are as vnripe
grapes, or as vntimely fruit. Such are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to negligent builders, who are next
to pullers downe. Prouer. 18. 9. <hi>He that is
slouthfull to do his worke, is the brother of a

            <p>
               <hi>Vers. 5. And now glorifie me thou Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with thine owne selfe, with the glorie
which I had with thee before the world was.</hi>
This is the fourth reason of our Sauiour
his request for his glorification, and it is
taken <hi>ab aequo</hi> from the equitie thereof,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2900:41"/>
and the right which he had to this glorie,
it was his owne from all beginning: so that
he prayeth onely for the manifestation of
that glory in his whole person of God and
man, which was due to his godhead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world was.</p>
            <p>From hence then this comfortable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is concluded,<note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> that as this great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Christ, being due fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al eternity to his
godhead, was decreed to be manifested
also in his humane nature: so likewise the
glorie of Christs members, which shal be
giuen vnto them in the kingdom of God,

That we were predestinate in Christ

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This the scriptures testifie of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Therefore in the Reuelation 4. 6. is the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2900:41"/>
world compared to a sea of glasse, because
all things are open before God, and he
from the beginning did foresee and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
whatsoeuer shoud fall out in the
world: as all things in a glasse are conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
and euident. Like as Mat. 20. 2. the
husbandman agreeth aforehand what to
giue to the labourers, before yet they had
wrought in the vineyard: so the Lord in
Christ appointed saluation to his elect
before they had done either good or euil.</p>
            <p>The Apostle sheweth the reason here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
why the Lord according to his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
purpose hath chosen vs in Christ. Eph.
3. 10. <hi>That the manifold wisedome of God
might be made knowne, according to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
purpose which he wrought in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
our Lord.</hi> As the vnspeakable wisdome
of God herein appeareth, so also his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
loue, in chusing of vs before yet we
were: and therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>He
hath predestinated vs through Iesus Christ
according to the good pleasure of his will, to
the praise of the glorie of his grace.</hi> Eph. 16.
Gods wisdome then, and his gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and loue are manifest in the decree
of predestination vnto glory.</p>
            <p>First then, whereas the same glorie is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
now giuen vnto Christs whole person, as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2900:42"/>
before was due to his godhead. Hereby a
certaine erronious opinion of the Papists
is confuted, which affirme that Christ me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
his owne glorification: for this were
to say, that the glory of the godhead could
be merited. And againe, all that Christ did
he wrought for vs:<note place="margin">Christ meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not for himselfe.</note> as he prayed not for
himselfe, but for vs: as Iohn 11. 41. <hi>Father
I thank thee that thou hast heard me, I know
that thou hearest me alwayes, but because of
the people that stand by, I said it.</hi> So likewise
when a voice was heard from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Christ had said, <hi>Father glorifie thy name)
I haue glorified it, and will glorifie it againe.</hi>
Iesus answered, <hi>this voice came not because
of me, but for your sakes.</hi> Iohn 12. 30. Again
our Sauiour saith, <hi>For their sakes sanctifie
I my selfe.</hi> Iohn 17. 19. His precious death
and sacrifice, wherin he did offer and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
himselfe vnto God, was wholly for
vs. Ambrose saith, <hi>Non suae emerendae grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,
sed nostrae eruditionis causa ieiunauit: He
fasted not to merite grace for himselfe, but to
instruct vs. Non sui sed nostri causa pauper
factus: He became poore, not for his owne but
for our sakes.</hi> His birth, life, death, resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
were all for our sakes, not to gaine
any thing to himselfe, for the glorie of the
godhead was due vnto Christ, at the very
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2900:42"/>
first instance of his incarnation: as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
saith, when he bringeth in <hi>his first
begotten Sonne</hi> into the world, he saith:
<hi>Let all the Angels of God worship him,</hi> Heb.
1. 6. but the manifestation of this his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
came afterward. So that where the
Scripture saith, Reuel. 4. 11. <hi>Thou art
worthie to receiue honor,</hi> &amp;c. it is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
not of the purchasing of any
honour which he had not, but of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
thereof: yet to vs, and for our
cause, he hath worthily and infinitely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited.</p>
            <p>Secondly, seeing the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a kingdome of glorie for his, this
ought to comfort and establish vs against
all temptation, as our Sauiour saith: <hi>Feare
not litle flocke, it is your Fathers will to giue
you a kingdome,</hi> Luk. 12. And it ought to
be our chiefest care to rise vp, grow, and
increase in the assurance and vndoubted
expectation of this heauenly glorie: that
we may at the length be perswaded with
Saint Paule, that <hi>neither life nor death,
height nor depth, things present, or to come,
are able to remoue vs from the loue of God in

            <p>THe request of our Sauior being now
made for his glorification, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to make request for his Church: and
first for his Apostles and other beleeuers
then being, from vers. 6. to vers. 20.
where we haue first the preparation to the
prayer, vers. 6. to 9. then the petition it
selfe for his disciples, that God would
keepe them in the world from euill, vers.
9. to vers. 20. In the preparation is set
foorth the obedience of the Apostles in
receiuing &amp; keeping the word of Christ:
and the causes thereof: the principall their
election, vers. 6. <hi>Thine they were:</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall
meanes, Christs doctrine and
preaching, <hi>I haue declared thy name vnto
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The declaring of the name of God is
nothing else, but the manifesting of the
will of God, and publishing of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
concerning the saluation of the world
by Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:2900:43"/>
First then we are taught here,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> that the
word of God is onely effectually declared
to those that are giuen vnto Christ out of
the world, and are marked vnto saluation:
others may heare it,<note place="margin">The word of God profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble onely to the elect.</note> but it is not profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vnto them.</p>
            <p>1 Thus the Apostle saith: <hi>If our Gospell
be hid, it is hid to those that are lost,</hi> 2. Cor.
4. 3. to them then that are not lost, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be hid.</p>
            <p>2 Christ saith to his Apostles, Mat. 13
11. <hi>It is giuen to you to know the secrets of
the kingdome of heauen, but vnto them it is
not giuen.</hi> It appeareth then that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
shall be reuealed vnto, and receiued
by all them to whom it is giuen: the rest,
(though the word of God be offered vnto
them) they shall not haue grace to beleeue
it: As the Apostles Paule and Barnabas
said to the Iewes, Act. 13. 46. <hi>It was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
that the word of God should first haue
bene spoken vnto you: but seeing you put it
from you, and iudge your selues vnworthie of
eternall life, loe we turne to the Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 Like as the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>na did not profite
those that vsed it not as God commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them; for it stunke, and was full of
wormes, Exod. 16. 20. and they which
lusted after quailes died; the flesh being
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2900:44"/>
yet betweene their teeth, Num. 11. 33. so
the word of God profiteth not those,
which thankfully receiue it not.</p>
            <p>4 The reason the Apostle sheweth,
Heb. 4. 2. <hi>The word which they heard pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
not them, because it was not mixed with
faith in those that heard it.</hi> Hereof it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>all men haue not faith,</hi> 2. Thes. 3. 2.
but only those that are giuen vnto Christ,
to such onely is the word of God effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
taught. Like as the bread of the house
is onely for the houshold, as the prodigall
child faith: <hi>In my fathers house is bread e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,</hi>
Luk. 15. 17. so the word of God
is ordained for none but those that are of
Gods house, that is, true members of his
Church.</p>
            <p>5 Hereby then, as by a most sure mark,
euery man may learne to discerne of his
election,<note place="margin">The atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue hearing of the word, a marke of our effectuall vocation.</note> if he haue a desire too, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the word of God. For like as a
man is iudged to be sicke and diseased,
when his stomacke cannot brooke nor
digest wholesome meates: so the soule of
that man cannot be sound, to whom the
word of God hath no pleasa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t tast. But
when a man can say with the Prophet
Dauid, Psal. 19. 10. <hi>Thy word is sweeter
to me then the honie or honie combe.</hi> By this
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2900:44"/>
we may gather an assured trust, that we
are giuen vnto Christ, if we do continue
in hauing delight stil, and finding comfort
in the word: for otherwise a sicke man
may haue some while a rellish of his meat,
when there is some intermission of the
disease, but it holdeth not long: so is it
with them, that haue for a while some tast
of the word of God, and afterward fall
away. Ambrose saith well vpon those
words:<note place="margin">In Psal. 119.</note> 
               <hi>Let him kisse me with the kisses of his
mouth: Osculatur nos verbum Dei, quando
sensum nostrum spiritus cognitionis illuminat:
the word of God doth kisse vs, when the spirit
of knowledge doth illuminate our minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thine they are, and thou gauest them me,
and they haue kept thy word:]</hi> Thine they
are by election, giuen vnto me by their
spirituall vocation and calling: they keep
thy word, which is the fruite of their san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</p>
            <p>The keeping then of the word of God,<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note>
is the fruite and effect of our election, not
the cause or foundation thereof: therefore
we do good workes, because we are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
thereunto: we are not elected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of our good workes.</p>
            <p>1 This Saint Paule sheweth, Ephes. 1.
4. <hi>He hath chosen vs in him, before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2900:45"/>
of the world, that we should be holy
and without blame before him in loue:</hi> our
holinesse is an effect and consequent of
our election in Christ, not a precedent
cause thereof.</p>
            <p>2 This is exemplified in Esau and Iacob
Rom. 9. 11. <hi>Ere the children were borne,
when they had done neither good nor euill,
that the purpose of God might remain accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to election, not by workes, &amp;c.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
directly noteth, that the election
of Iacob depended not vpon his workes,
which as yet were not, but onely vpon
Gods gracious purpose. Saint Paul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
so of himselfe, that he was not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to be an Apostle, or put into Christs
seruice, for any thing that God saw to be
in him; but <hi>the grace of God was exceeding
abundant with faith and loue, which is in
Christ Iesus,</hi> 1. Tim. 1. 14. <hi>and I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
to mercie,</hi> vers. 13. And the Apostle
ascendeth to the very first originall and
beginning of his calling, Reuel. 1. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>separated</hi> (in the eternall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of God) <hi>to preach the Gospell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 The Prophet Ezechiel doth set foorth
this truth of Gods free and gracious ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by an allegorie, of a child, that in
the birth was cast foorth, forlorne, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2900:45"/>
forsaken, the nauell not cut, nor yet wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with water, or swadled in clowts; but it
lay wallowing and tumbling in bloud: the
Lord passed by, and had compassion v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
it, tooke it as his owne: so it grew
and became comely and beautifull, &amp;c.
Ezech. vers. 4. 8. What cause was there in
this child, that the Lord should haue res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
vnto it? but onely the Lords loue and
fauour which he had vnto it: as it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
vers. 14. <hi>Thy name was spread abroad
among the heathen, because of thy beautie:
for it was perfect through my beautie, which
I had set vpon thee.</hi> Euen so in vs the Lord
saw no cause, why he should elect vs vnto
life, onely through his owne mercie he
saued vs.</p>
            <p>4 Saint Paule sheweth the reason of our
free and gracious election, Ephes. 1. 5.
<hi>He hath predestinate vs to be adopted
through Iesus Christ vnto himselfe, &amp;c. to
the praise of the glorie of his grace:</hi> that is,
now God onely hath the glorie of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
when it is imputed wholly to his
grace.</p>
            <p>5 First then the doctrine of the Papists
is confuted, who teach, that men are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
vpon the foresight of their faith and
workes: which is flat contrarie to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2900:46"/>
               <hi>of the Apostle, Rom.</hi> 9. 14. It is not
in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth,
but in God that sheweth mercie. <hi>Thus the
Church beleeued in Ambrose his time:</hi>
Dignatione sua olim decreuit Deus peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
saluos facere,<note place="margin">In 2. Tim. cap. 1.</note> &amp;c. vt neque merito suo, qui
saluantur, neque horum per quos vocantur,
&amp;c. God by his owne vouchsafing hath long
ago decreed to saue sinners, &amp;c. so that not by
the merit of those which are saued, nor of
them by whom they are called, but by the
grace of God, this gift is conferred.</p>
            <p>Secondly, seeing God hath shewed vs
so great mercie, as before we were any
thing, to decree vs vnto saluation: we
hereby should be stirred vp to walke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of our vocation. Ephes. 4. 1. and to
shew our selues thankfull vnto God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
by liuing vnto his praise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers. 7. Now they know,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct 3.</note> 
               <hi>that all things
which thou hast giuen me, are of thee.]</hi> From
this verse this doctrine is gathered, that it
is not possible for any to receiue the word
of God, vnlesse they be perswaded and
assured indeed, that it is the word of God,
and that he which deliuereth the same,
speaketh from God. As here this reason is
giuen, why the Apostles receiued the
word of God, because they knew that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2900:46"/>
Christ came from God, and that all things
which he spake and did were of God.</p>
            <p>1. This the Apostle sheweth, 1. Cor. 14.
25. speaking of the power of the word of
God: <hi>If all prophecie, and there come in one
that beleeueth not, the secrets of his heart are
made manifest, and he will fall downe and
worship, and say plainely that God is in you
indeede.</hi> This perswasion of the hearer
that God is in the preacher, doth make
the word pierce into his heart, that the
secrets thereof are discouered.</p>
            <p>2. This appeareth by that confession of
Peter, when Christ had said to the twelue,
will ye also goe away? Iohn. 6, 67. <hi>Maister,</hi>
saith he, <hi>to whome shall we go, thou hast
the words of eternall life.</hi> Peter will not go
from Christ, because he beleeued, that he
was a teacher from God, to shew the way
to eternall life. This made Nicodemus
come vnto Christ, <hi>because he knew he was a
teacher come from God.</hi> Iohn. 3. 2.</p>
            <p>3. Like as the embassadour is reuerenced
&amp; his message willingly receiued, because
he commeth in the name, and with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of the Prince: so saith S. Paul, we
are Ambassadors for Christ, 2. Cor. 5. 20.
4. The reason the Apostle sheweth, Heb.
4. 12. <hi>The word of God is liuely and mightie
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2900:47"/>
in operation, and sharper then any two edged
sword, and entreth thorough to the deuiding
of the soule and the spirit:</hi> such operation
hath the word, whereas it is receiued and
acknowledged for the word of God.</p>
            <p>The people are taught, that where the
truth is preached, and the word of God
manifestly taught, they should receiue it
with all reuerence as Gods word: as the
Apostle testifieth of the Thessalonians, 1.
Thess. 2. 13. <hi>For this cause I thanke my God
without ceasing, that when ye receiued of vs
the word of the preaching of God, ye receiued
it not as the word of men, but as it is indeed
the word of God, which also worketh in you
that beleeue.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this verse our Sauior amplifieth that
which in the former verse was more
briefly expressed, declaring the obedience
of the Apostles in receiuing his doctrine,
and his owne faithfulnesse in giuing vnto
them no other words then which he had
receiued of his father.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:2900:47"/>
Our Sauiour then teacheth all Ministers
byh is example, that they should not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
to preach any thing to the people
but that which they haue receiued from
God, and are able to warrant by his
word.</p>
            <p>Thus the Apostle saith, <hi>Be ye followers
of me, as I am of Christ,</hi> 1. Cor. 11. 1. not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for example of life, but also in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
The Apostle will be no further fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
then he himselfe did tread in the
steps of Christ. Againe the Apostle saith,
<hi>I certifie you brethren that the Gospel which
was preached of me, was not after man.</hi> Gal.
1. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>2. Hereof the Apostle giueth himselfe an
example, <hi>I haue receiued of the Lord that
which I haue deliuered vnto you.</hi> Likewise
the Prophets preached not to the people,
till the word of God came vnto them: as
Isay 2. 1. <hi>The word that Isaiah son of Amos
saw vpon Iudah and Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Like as when our Sauiour fed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the wildernesse, first he himselfe
brake the loaues, and then gaue them to
the Disciples, and they to the multitude,
Iohn 6. so the Lord Christ must first break
vnto vs of the bread of life, before we can
breake it to you. And like as he that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2900:48"/>
speaketh continually, Prou. 21. 28. A
man must first heare the cause before he
can giue sentence: so must the Ministers
first hearken to God to be instructed by
his word, before they deliuer any doctrine
to the people.</p>
            <p>4. For it is required of such as are dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
dispensers, and stewards of Gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
to be faithful, 1. Corin. 4. 2. Like as
the embassador of the Prince must deliuer
nothing but by warrant and commission
of the Prince: so must Ministers do being
the Lords embassadors, 2. Cor. 25. 20.</p>
            <p>5. They then are reproued by this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
that presume to preach the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and commaundements of men in
stead of the word of God: as the Pharises
in our Sauior Christs time did, Marke 7. 7.
and the Pharises of this age the papists
do, who in most articles of religion, the
doctrine of the Trinitie excepted, do set
forth humane inuentions and traditions.</p>
            <p>Secondly the Ministers learne, that they
should not rashly vtter whatsoeuer at the
first sight offereth it selfe, or commeth so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
into their mind, but examine euery
doctrine how it is agreeable to the word
of God: to waite vpon God with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Isay, and to heare from him what we
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2900:48"/>
should crie: as Ambrose saith, <hi>Cum audisset

and alacritie to yeeld obedience to
the word of God.</p>
            <p>1. So the Apostle saith, <hi>Let the word of

not dwel with vs vnlesse we receiue it into

the preaching of the word.</p>
            <p>2. Thus the Apostle commendeth the
obedience of the Galathians, that they
receiued him as an Angel of God, Gal. 4.
14. and consequently his doctrine as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall.
Such were the Disciples of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,
<hi>When they heard the word they were
glad, and glorified the word of the Lord,</hi> Act.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2900:49"/>
13. 48. the willing then and chearefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
of the word, is a glorifying, a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
of it, an ornament and an honour
vnto it.</p>
            <p>3. Like as he that tasteth the hony or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>b,
findeth a pleasantnesse and a delight in it:
so the word of God should be sweeter to
the spirituall tast, then <hi>the hony or hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb,</hi>
Psa. 19. 10. And as the thirsty ground
waiteth for the raine, and drinketh it in
gladly: so should the word of God be
heard, as Iob saith, <hi>They waited for me as
for the raine,</hi> Iob 29. 23.</p>
            <p>4. Christ therfore is with all forwardnes
and earnest desire to be heard, <hi>because he
hath the words of eternall life,</hi> Iohn 6. 68.
We willingly heare men that counsell vs
for our worldly profit, much more when
for our soules health, and for that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Ministers of Christ, redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vnto Christ himselfe: <hi>He that heareth
you, heareth me: he that despiseth you, despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
me,</hi> Luke 10. 16.</p>
            <p>There are then three sorts of men, that
come farre short in the practise of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
first, they which are contemners &amp;
despisers of Gods word, that of an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and wilfull mind refuse to heare vs:
such were they that stopped their eares
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2900:49"/>
against <hi>Stephe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> Act. 7. <hi>and that cast off their
garments, and threw dust in the aire,</hi> while
Paul preached, Act. 22. 23. Such are the
obstinate popish Recusants at this day.
Secondly, there are others that preferre
their worldly businesse, as the Gergasenes
that because of the losse of their swine,
would haue Christ preach no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, Mat. 8. 34. Such are they that
coming to faires and markets wil not be
spared one halfe houre from their worldly
traffick to heare the word of God. Thirdly
there is another sort, that come to heare
but profit not: such as Ezechiel speaketh
of, <hi>They heare thy words but do them not.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zech.
33. 31. Neither do these receiue the
words of Christ: for though the word
pierceth the eare, yet they shut the dore of
the heart against it. Wherfore if we wilbe
the true Disciples of Christ, let vs neither
obstinately reiect his words, nor carnally
refuse them, nor negligently heare them,
but willingly receiue them: that euen as
we with a bodily appetite do take our
corporall food, so with a spirituall desire
we receiue our heauenly sustena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which
doth sustaine our soules, as the other

            <p>1. <hi>Saint</hi> Paul <hi>would not haue vs</hi> as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

<hi>Who was not as a reed shaken with the wind,</hi>
Mat. 11. 7. that is readie to be ouerturned
vpon euery occasion: but he continued
stedfast and vnremoueable in the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ euen vnto death. Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
was so sure of his doctrine, that if an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel

he would hold him accu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:2900:50"/>
3. We should be in respect of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
faith as nailes surely fastened, Eccl.
12. 11. and as the pillars of the temple,
Reuel. 3. 12. that cannot be remoued.</p>
            <p>4. For as God is faithfull and altereth
not, and Christ is not yea, and nay, he
changeth not, 2. Cor. 1. 18. 19. so the
faith of Christ is also certaine, and we
ought to be as certaine of it.</p>
            <p>5. Two sorts of men are here reproued:
first, they which suffer themselues to be
seduced and corrupted in religion, and do
leaue their first faith. Such in Saint Paules
time were Philetus and Alexander, 1. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth.
1. 20. Phygell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and Hermogenes,
2. Timoth. 1. 15. which turned away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Paule and departed from the faith: such
there are in these dayes, that being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedfast
in faith, &amp; vnsetled in iudgement,
are caried headlong as with a whirlewind
into the downefall of dangerous errors
&amp; corrupt doctrines, that fall into schism,
and are infected with popish superstition.
Secondly, they are here touched, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh
they be not seduced or mis-led into
any other beleefe, yet are not resolute and
constant in that faith which they professe:
but vnto many our redemption by Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is as the deliuerance &amp; returne of the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2900:51"/>
from captiuitie, euen as a dreame,
Psal. 126. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or the storie of the Gospell
is vnto many but as a thought or phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
or a tale that is told, Psal. 90. 9. So I
know not how the most of the world are
in a dead sleepe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they slumber and dreame
in Religion, neither being certaine of that
they haue,<note place="margin">Against car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal professors</note> nor yet resolued against that
they haue not, and by Gods grace I trust
shall neuer haue. Let vs therefore labour
to be constant, and setled, and fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
in matters of faith, as builded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
a rocke, that neither the wind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
waues of temptations, nor the
raine of strange doctrines, be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
vs from our foundation. Ambrose
saith well: <hi>Similes simus Nazaraeis, quorum
capilli non defluebant, &amp; Christus Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus
erat: Let vs be like the Nazarits, whose
haire did not shed, such a Nazarite was
Christ:</hi> that we may perseuere vnto the
end, and be as Christs mother: <hi>multi e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
conceperunt Christum, sed non genue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt:
for many haue conceiued Christ, but
not brought him foorth:</hi> such are they
which fall away from their faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And beleeue that thou hast sent me]</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
wold not so readily haue receiued
Christs words,<note place="margin">Doct. 4.</note> but that they were perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2900:51"/>
he came from God: so it is necessarie,
that the people shold know and approue
the calling of their teachers and Ministers
before they can subscribe and giue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to their doctrine.</p>
            <p>1. So the Apostle alleadgeth out of the
Prophet: <hi>How beautifull are the feete of
those which bring glad tidings of peace, &amp;c?</hi>
Rom. 10. 15. before the message be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
the messenger must be approued.</p>
            <p>2. This perswasion brought Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
to Christ: <hi>We know that thou art a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
come from God.</hi> And that consession
of the Pharisees and Herodians of Christ
was true, though vttered by them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
and hypocrisie: <hi>We know thou art
true, and teachest the way of God truly.</hi> Mat.
22. 16. A man must first haue a true calling
before he can teach truly.</p>
            <p>3. Like as Dauid said of Ahimaaz, that
came running to bring him newes of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saloms
ouerthrow: <hi>He is a good man and
bringeth good tidings,</hi> 2. Sam. 18. 27. so
must the minister haue a good and lawful
calling, though he be not alwaies (as he
should be) a good man, before he can be
a publisher of the ioyfull tidings of the
Gospell.</p>
            <p>4. Our Sauiour Christ saith: <hi>Euery plant
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2900:52"/>
which my heauenly Father hath not planted
shall be rooted out.</hi> Such then as are not set
of God into his seruice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
can haue no prosperous successe
in their callings.</p>
            <p>5. First the Ministers of God are here
taught,<note place="margin">The Minister must be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> that they should haue assurance in
themselues of their calling, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
testimonie of their conscience, that
they are appointed of God to labour in
his vineyard; which they may know by
these two arguments: first, by their gifts:
for they which are deputed to the Lords
seruice, are in some good measure ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
thereunto: as the Apostle saith, 2 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.
3. 6. <hi>God hath made vs able Ministers
of the new Testament.</hi>
               <note place="margin">How Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained of their calling.</note> Secondly, by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of their gifts: if they carefully
and diligently vse those graces wherwith
they are endued, to the edifying of Christ
his Church: as Saint Paule againe saith:
<hi>If I do it willingly</hi> (that is, preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell)
<hi>I haue a reward.</hi> Ambrose saith: <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarius
Minister habet praemium, coactus
di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pensat obsequium: the willing Minister
hath a reward, he that is forced is onely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
and vsed.</hi> So then they which either
want gifts to furnish them, or willingnes
to prouoke them, can neuer be sure of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2900:52"/>
their calling, nor secure of any good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
effect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the people of God are taught
to acknowledge their faithfull and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Pastors to be sent of God, and not to
doubt of their lawfull calling, the seale of
whose Apostleship and ministerie they
find in themselues, in the fruitfull and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull
effects of the Gospell, wrought in
their hearts by the spirit of God. Giue ye
not eare then to the Papists or Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes,
that would perswade you, that ye
haue neither Ministers, Church, nor Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:
For as Saint Paule saith: <hi>We
need no Epistle of recommendation vnto you,
&amp;c. you are our Epistle written in our harts,
which is vnderstood and read of all men, in
that ye are manifest to be the Epistle of
Christ ministred by vs, &amp;c.</hi> The spirituall
comfort, increase of knowledge, edifying
in the faith, sanctifying in good life, which
are wrought daily in your hearts (that
feare God) by the preaching of the word,
are euident seales and signs of our calling.
But they in whom the word of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not these effects, as they are enemies
to their owne saluation, so they are the
cause why the glorious ministerie of the
Gospell, is blasphemed and daily tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2900:53"/>
and euill spoken of by the common
aduersarie.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="8" type="lecture">
            <head>The eighth Lecture.</head>
            <p>NOw followeth the request it selfe,
which our Sauiour maketh for his
Apostles; wherein we are to consider, first
for whom he prayeth: secondly, for what.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour prayeth for his Apostles,
which first he amplifieth <hi>à disparatis,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
things diuerse or opposite: <hi>I pray for them,
I pray not for the world,</hi> vers. 10. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he confirmeth the same by certaine
reasons: First, from the right and property
which God hath in them: <hi>They are thine:</hi>
and the reason thereof, because all mine
are thine, vers. 11. Secondly, from their
fruites and effects, <hi>I am glorified in them.</hi>
Thirdly, from their present necessitie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ was no more in the world,
he commendeth them to his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> 
               <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the
world; but for those which thou hast giuen
me.]</hi> By this Scripture it is euident, that
onely they which are giuen vnto Christ,<note place="margin">Christ a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator onely for the elect.</note>
and elected of God, haue part in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
and intercession of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:2900:53"/>
1. So the Apostle saith: <hi>He is able perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to saue them that come vnto God by him,
seeing he euer liueth to make intercession for
them,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. He maketh intercession
then onely for them, that by him shall be
saued.</p>
            <p>2. Thus our Sauiour prayed for Peter
that his faith should not faile, Luk. 22. 32.
Thus he prayed for Lazarus: <hi>Father, I
thanke thee, that thou hast heard me,</hi> Ioh. 11
41. Thus still he prayeth for his owne, but
for the reprobate world he no where
prayeth.</p>
            <p>3. Like as Zacharie saw in that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vision two Oliue trees dropping oyle
through the pipes into the bowles of the
golden candlesticke, Zach. 4. 2. 3. so
Christ this Oliue tree doth not conuey his
graces vnto any by the vertue of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which are as the pipes, but to those
that belong to the golden candlesticke of
his Church. And as the precious oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vpon Aarons head, ranne downe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
his beard, and to the borders of his
garments, Psal. 133. 2. so Christ our head
giueth influence of grace, and spirit of life
onely to his members.</p>
            <p>4. For seeing the prayers of Christ are
alwaies effectuall, and he is alwaies heard
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2900:54"/>
of his Father: <hi>I know that thou hearest me
alwaies,</hi> Ioh. 11. 42. It followeth, that the
reprobate haue no part in Christs holy
prayers, because they receiue no benefite
by them. Christ also is the Sauiour of his
bodie, Ephes. 5. 23. he guideth it by his
grace, and preserueth it vnto saluation.
They then which are not of his bodie,
haue no interest in his death, nor part in
his prayers.</p>
            <p>5. First, by this doctrine their errour is
discouered, which affirme that Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for all men, as well for the reprobate
as for the elect; as well for Iudas, as for
Peter and Paule: because Saint Iohn saith,
that Iesus Christ is the propitiation for
the sinnes of the whole world, 1. Ioh. 2. 2.</p>
            <p>But seeing that our Sauiour vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth
not to comprehend the world in his
prayers, much lesse doth he extend vnto
them the fruite of his death: he would not
offer himselfe to death for those, for
whom he offereth not his prayers: neither
can they be admitted to his redemption,
that are excluded from his intercession.
And further,<note place="margin">There is a world onely of the elect and faithfull.</note> wheras Christ is said to take
away the sinnes of the world: here the
world onely, that is, the vniuersall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
of the elect, which are taken from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2900:54"/>
all degrees and callings in the world, is to
be vnderstood, as where our sauiour saith,
Iohn 14. 31. <hi>That the world may know that
I loue the father:</hi> he meaneth the world of
the faithfull: for vnto the rest of the world
Christ doth not shew himselfe. Iohn 14.
22. So <hi>Ambrose</hi> well saith, <hi>Est in electis &amp;
praescitis specialis quadam vniuersitas, vt de
toto mundo totus mundus liberatus, &amp; de
omnibus hominibus omnes homines assumpti
videantur: there is in the elect and foreknown
a speciall kind of vniuersalitie, that the whole
world out of the whole world, and all men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
all men seeme to be taken vnto life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly it may be doubted, whether
herein we are bound to follow this forme
and president of Christs praier, to exclude
some out of our prayers, and not to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the wicked in our requests vnto God.
I answer that there is a speciall considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be had of this prayer which here
our Sauiour maketh, which in all respects
cannot be folowed of vs, nor made a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of our prayers: for here our Sauiour
prayeth as God and man, hauing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
foresight &amp; knowledge of euery man,
and according to that knowledge he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth
his prayers. In this his prayer, as
Ambrose saith,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. in Luc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>Et aduocatus est &amp; iudex,

He is both an aduocate and iudge; in

which he made vpon the crosse for

ought to pray for all: seeing now that gift,
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the discerning of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
whereof the Apostle speaketh 1. Cor.

could say to <hi>Simo Magas,</hi> thy mony perish
with thee. And vnlesse we did see a man
sinne a sinne vnto death that is, to sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the holy Ghost, for the which the
Apostle would not haue vs to pray, 1. Iohn
5. 16. which case is very rare, and hard it is
to say, who is guiltie of that sinne: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then in these cases, we in Christian
charitie (which thinketh not euill and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
the best of all) may pray for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
of all; yet making a difference,
preferring alwayes the Church of Christ
in our prayers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this doctrine giueth vnto
worldly minded and carnall men a fearful
caueat,<note place="margin">Worldlings without the compasse of Christs praier</note> that they looke vnto themselues,
and in time turne vnto God: for as yet
while they are of the world, that is, profane
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2900:55"/>
persons, irreligious, without the feare of
God, they are out of Christs protection,
and barred from his prayers, and depriued
of the vertue and efficacie of his holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation.
To them therefore be that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
spoken in the Psalme, <hi>Kisse the sonne
lest he be angry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ye perish in the way. Psal.
2.</hi> 12. Kisse the sonne and embrace him by
faith, which is the kisses of his mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Cantic. 1. 1. and so by Christs powerfull
mediation and almightie protection, we
shall be preserued from perishng.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verse</hi> 9.<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> 
               <hi>For they are thine, and all mine
are thine, and thine are mine.</hi> Hence we
learne, that they which are giuen to Christ
belong vnto God his Father, &amp; the whole
blessed Trinity taketh charge of them, and
careth for them.</p>
            <p>1. So the Apostle saith, <hi>Ye are Christs,
and Christ Gods,</hi> 1. Cor. 3. 23. Al then that
is Christs, is also Gods; and as Christ is
the head of euery faithfull man, so God is
Christs head, 1. Cor. 11. 2.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Thus our sauiour saith to his Apostles:</hi>
The Father himselfe loueth you, because ye
haue loued me, and haue beleeued that I came
out from God. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 27.</p>
            <p>3. Like as the father in the parable saith
to his sonne, <hi>Thou art euer with me, and all
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2900:56"/>
that I haue is thine,</hi> Luke 15. 31. So Christ
being the heire of all, whatsoeuer his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath is his, and whatsoeuer he hath
is his fathers. Like as Iacob saith concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the two sonnes of Ioseph, Ephraim
&amp; Manasses: <hi>They shall be mine, as Reuben
and Simeon are mine,</hi> Genes. 48. 5. <hi>and let
my name be named vpon them.</hi> v. 16. so all
the children of Christ are his fathers.</p>
            <p>4. Our sauior sheweth the reason hereof,
<hi>that they may be one as we are one, I in them
and thou in me,</hi> Iohn 17. 22. 23. Because
Christ is equall to his Father, and they are
one God, of one power, eternitie, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
glorie, therfore all which the sonne
hath is the fathers.</p>
            <p>5. First by this doctrine the wicked Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
are confuted, who made the son of
God vnequall and vnlike vnto his father,
and their heresie was, that, <hi>suit tempus qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
non fuit filius,</hi> there was a time when the
sonne was not: for if all the fathers be the
sonnes, and all the sonnes the fathers, as
here our sauiour saith, there can be no ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie
betweene them; there must be the
same power, wisedom, and euerlasting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them both.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the opinion of the Church
of Rome is also refelled, which holdeth
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2900:56"/>
that Christ is not God of himselfe,<note place="margin">Christ God of himselfe.</note> as the
father is, but that he is God with and of
his father, Rhemist. annot. Iohn 1. sect. 3.
We confesse indeed that Christ is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
sonne of himfelfe, but that he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
God of himselfe is consonant to the
scriptures.<note place="margin">August. tract. 19. in Ioann.</note> Iohn 5. 26. <hi>As the father hath
life in himselfe, so he hath giuen to the sonne
to haue life in himselfe:</hi> if the sonne hath life
in himselfe, then he is God of himselfe:
<hi>Vitam in se habet, vt ipsa vita sibi sit ipse: He
hath life in himselfe, and he himselfe is life
it selfe to himselfe.</hi> It is a principle in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
that <hi>diuina essentia nec gignit nec gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur,
The diuine essence neither begetteth
nor is begotten.</hi> It is the person of the son,
not the Godhead, that is begotten of his
father from all eternitie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if they onely are Gods that are
Christs, their carnall securitie is reproued,
who flatter themselues that they belong
vnto God, and hope to be saued though
they beleeue not in Christ. We see then
that it is farre otherwise then some ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that euerie man may be saued
by that faith and religion which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
and that controuersies about faith
are needlesse and superfluous. Our Sauior
saith, <hi>he that honoureth not the sonne, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2900:57"/>
not the father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">No accesse to God without Christ.</note> Iohn 5. 23. Whosoeuer
then beleeueth not aright in the sonne,
neither careth to know him, and walke in
his wayes, hath no part in God, neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
enter into life. It is therefore a vaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
which they haue of saluation, that
thinke to come to God without Christ.
The heauens cannot be scaled without a

               <note place="margin">Doct 3.</note> This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason why Christ prayeth for his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
because they were to the praise of
Christ, and instruments of his glorie. So
then they which intend and seeke the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and glorie of Christ, and none other,
are priuiledged by his holy prayers, and
made partakers of his intercession, and
the power and vertue thereof.</p>
            <p>1. Hereof it is that our sauiour teacheth
vs thus to conclude our prayers, <hi>For thine
is the glorie,</hi> Math. 6. 13. whereby we refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2900:57"/>
all to the glorie of Christ, are assured
to be heard in our petitions.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Thus the Apostles praying to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor

            <p>3. Like as it is said of the good houswife,
<hi>Giue her of the fruites of her hands, and let
her owne workes praise her in the gates.</hi> Pro.
31. 31. the costly rayment wherewith o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are clothed, redou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to the praise
of the worker: so the graces which God
bestoweth vpon his faithfull seruants, are
referred to the praise of the author.</p>
            <p>4. This is the cause why God respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
not the wicked, <hi>He will not giue
his glory to another,</hi> Isay 42. 8. because they
are enemies to Gods glorie, and therefore
God will not giue vnto such the honor of
his gifts.</p>
            <p>5. This doctrine sheweth then in what
miserable state they stand,<note place="margin">All must be re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

the name of Christ, and cause the

Gospell of Christ to stinke before the
world by reason of their euil life that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
it: be it knowne vnto them that they
stand as outlawes before God, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be assured either of direction to good,
or protection from euil from Iesus Christ.
VVherefore let vs first make the glorie of
Christ the scope and end of all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
and endeuours, and then we shall
be sure that the Lord will heare vs. This
then is the cause why many faile of their
requests, because they ask amisse, as Iames
saith, <hi>Ye aske and receiue not, because ye aske
amisse, that ye might consume it vpon your

would not hide any thing from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
because he would commaund his sonnes

with a simple heart, purposing to referre
the same to his glorie, that the Lord will
denie vs nothing.</p>

            <p>NOw followeth the petition it selfe,
which Christ maketh for his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
that God would keepe them: and of
this request diuerse reasons are giuen by
our Sauiour. First, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their present neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
because Christ was to leaue them
concerning his humanitie. Secondly, from
the end or effect, that they being thus
kept, might be ioyned together in amitie
and loue: <hi>that they may be one, as we, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First then this truth is here deliuered,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note>
that Christ as touching the presence of
his flesh is gone out of the world.<note place="margin">Christ not present now in the world in his flesh.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. So Saint Peter further witnesseth:
<hi>Whom the heauens must receiue till the time
that all things be restored,</hi> Act. 3. 21. Christ
is not to be expected from heauen till his
second coming to iudgement.</p>
            <p>2. Stephen saw Iesus standing at the
right hand of God, but in heauen: <hi>Behold,
I see the heauens open, and the sonne of man
standing at the right hand of God,</hi> Act. 7. 56
Paule also as he went to Damascus heard
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2900:59"/>
the voice of Iesus, but speaking from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
for he saith: <hi>Suddenly there shone a
light from heauen round about me,</hi> Act. 22.
6. Paule further saith, <hi>I saw him, saying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, &amp;c.</hi> but he was in a traunce in the
temple: he saw him onely in vision or in
spirit, Act. 22. 17. as Peter saw the foure
cornered vessell let downe from heauen,
Act. 10. 11. For in both places the same
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an Ecstasie or traunce, is vsed.</p>
            <p>3. Then like as after Elias was taken
into heauen, the Prophets and Disciples
supposed he had bene conueyed to some
other place, and sought him three dayes
but were deceiued: so they which suppose
to find Christ in the earth, are erroniously
seduced.</p>
            <p>4. Diuerse reasons of Christs absence in
the flesh,<note place="margin">The reasons of Christs bodily ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</note> in the Scriptures are alleadged:
first, because of the present expediencie
for the Church of God, Ioh. 16. 7. <hi>It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
for you that I go away: for if I go not
away, the comforter will not come.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because of the future vtilitie: <hi>I go before
to prepare a place for you,</hi> Ioh. 14. 2. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Angels said to the women: <hi>Why
seeke ye the liuing among the dead?</hi> Luk. 24.
5. It was not conuenient for our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
and euerliuing Sauiour to be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2900:59"/>
still among mortall and sinfull men,
and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerse with those which are dead
in sinne.</p>
            <p>5. First, the Popish fantasie is here dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
concerning Christs carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in the Eucharist. For if the heauens
must still receiue and containe him, how
can his bodie be out of heauen,<note place="margin">Against the carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in the Sacrament.</note> if it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
in heauen? vnlesse they will make
Christ to haue many miraculous bodies:
for his naturall bodie it cannot be, which
is but in one place at once. The words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of this text are euident, that Christ in
his flesh is no more in the world: so that it
is neither visible nor inuisible here: for if
either, then it were vntrue that Christ
saith, <hi>I am no more in the world.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Origen soundly writeth: <hi>Secundum
diuinitatis suae naturam non peregrinatur
Christus, sed peregrinatur secundum dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sationem
corporis, &amp;c. sicut homo ergo pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinatur:
Christ is not a stranger or a pilgrim
in his diuine nature, but he is a stranger in
the dispensation of his bodie, &amp;c. therefore as
a man he is a pilgrime and a stranger fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We are taught, that seeing Christ is
gone out of the world, we in affection
and desire should follow after him: and
as the Apostle saith: <hi>Seeke those things that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2900:60"/>
are aboue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Our desires must be in heauen.</note> 
               <hi>where Christ sitteth at the right
hand of God,</hi> Coloss. 3. 1. Where a mans
treasure is, there will his heart be, and
where the carcasse is, thither will the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
be gathered together. If Christ be
our treasure, if Christ be our desire, our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
must be set vpon heauenly, not
vpon earthly things: that we may say
with the Prophet: <hi>The desire of our soule is
to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee;
with my soul haue I desired thee in the night,
and with my spirit within me, will I seeke
thee in the morning,</hi> Isa. 26. 8. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I come vnto thee]</hi> Christs comming to
his Father here,<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> is by prayer:<note place="margin">Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to God is by prayer.</note> so then by
faithfull prayer we draw neare vnto God.</p>
            <p>1. So our Sauiour saith: <hi>Where two or
three are gathered together in my name,
there I am in the midst of them,</hi> Mat. 18. 20.
Christ cometh to vs in prayer, and we
come vnto him: then specially is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
in heauen, as the Apostle saith,
Phil. 3. 20. when our minds and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in prayer are set vpon heauenly
things.</p>
            <p>2. Thus Peter while he prayed fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a traunce, he was rapt in the spirit, and
saw an heauenly vision. Saint Paule was
taken vp in spirit to the third heauen, 2.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2900:60"/>
Cor. 12. But these examples may seeme to
be extraordinarie: but that of Hanna is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
to all the faithfull, who is said to pray
before the Lord, 1. Sam. 1. 12. And Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
when he had made an end of that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
prayer made at the dedication of
the temple, said: <hi>These my words which I
haue prayed before the Lord, be neare vnto
the Lord our God night and day,</hi> 1. King.
8. 59.</p>
            <p>3. Like as, when the woman that had
the bloudie issue, came in the preasse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
and touched Christs cloathes, and
Christ asked who had touched him; that
woman onely is said to touch Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she did it in faith, wheras al the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
did throng him, and many touched
his cloaths beside outwardly, Mar. 5. 30.
31. So although in respect of his power he
be present to al, yet they which draw nere
vnto him in faith, are specially said to
come into Gods presence.</p>
            <p>4. Because God is a spirit, and will be
worshipped in spirit and truth, Ioh. 4. 24.
they therefore do come vnto God, which
draw neare in spirit. God being a spirit, is
onely discerned and appoched vnto in
spirit: and they onely see him, whose eyes
are annointed with the eye-salue, Reuel.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2900:61"/>
3. 18. which is faith.</p>
            <p>5. This doctrine reproueth two sorts of
men: first, prophane persons, that haue
no care nor desire to enter into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
which very seldome remember to
pray vnto God. When we heare in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that Dauid praysed God seuen times
a day,<note place="margin">Against neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance in prayer.</note> and Daniel (notwithstanding the
great affaires of so large a kingdome) yet
could find time thrice a day to pray vnto
God, what shall we thinke of those men
that pray not seuen times in so many
daies; nay, some not thrice in so many
weekes. O good God, how is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
exercise of prayer neglected! as
though men neither knew any God to
pray vnto, nor had any Mediator to pray
by. The Euchites were condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they did nothing but pray: but men
now adayes are more to be misliked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they neuer pray. If they which call
vpon the name of the Lord shall be saued,
I doubt whether they that call not vpon
God, can be saued. How should a man
thinke his labour can prosper, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
not with prayer? how should a
mans meate do him good, that is not bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with prayer? How can a man thinke,
that wife, children, and seruants should
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2900:61"/>
do their duties, not being exercised and
trayned vp in prayer?</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Against hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall prayers.</note> the prayer of hypocrites is
condemned, which pray with their lippes
but draw not neare vnto God in their
hearts. As the Lord by his Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of the old Israelites: <hi>This people
honoureth me with their lippes, but their
heart is farre away from me,</hi> Isa. 29. 13. such
are the superstitious prayers of ignorant
Papists, praying vpon their beades in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
without vnderstanding: such are their
prayers that haue an ordinarie stint, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and euening to runne ouer, hauing
no deuotion or holy feeling at all.<note place="margin">Conc. 2 in Psal. 33.</note> Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine

for as Abimelech here, so diuers of the
heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had this general grace of restraint,
whereby they were kept from notorious
sinnes, as of oppression, iniustice, adultery,
murder, and such like, though they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the true worke of regeneration. Dauid
by a greater gift and grace confesseth that
the Lord kept him from laying his hand
vpon the Lords annointed. 1. Sam. 24. 7.

            <p>3. For like as Peter had sunke downe
into the waters, if Christ had not stayed
him with his hand: so the flouds of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
are like to ouerwhelme vs, if we be
not vpheld by Gods grace: Our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is such a guide and nurse vnto vs, as
Mephiboseths nurse was to him, that let
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2900:62"/>
him fall, as she fledd away, and thereupon
he became lame, 2. Sam. 4. 4. If we stay v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the direction of nature, we shall be
deceiued.</p>
            <p>4. For seing all the imaginations of the
thoughts of mans hart, are onely euil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
Genes. 6. 5. what help is to be
expected from our nature? And least any
man should thinke, that it is otherwise
with vs now, then it was with the old
world: the Apostle in himselfe sheweth,
that we are by nature of the same mould.
<hi>I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwelleth
no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7. 18.</p>
            <p>5. First then that popish doctrine of
free will is here refelled,<note place="margin">Against free will.</note> who doe ascribe
vnto man by nature great strength to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that is good, to beleeue, to doe

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, we are taught to depend v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
God for his direction in all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to giue him thanks, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
vs from the great offences of the

            <p>
               <hi>That they may be one as we are]</hi> not that
there can be in euery respect such vnion
between the members,<note place="margin">Doct. 4.</note> as there is between

and qualification of vnitie, that it
must haue relation to God; for peace and
vnitie, vnlesse it be in the truth, is no true
vnitie.</p>
            <p>1. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> therefore saith,<note place="margin">The loue of Christians must be in the truth.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>,
I loue in the truth, Epist. 2. 1.
We must then loue in the truth, and truth
it in loue: loue without truth is erronious,
and truth without loue is not efficacious.</p>
            <p>2. Thus Iehu well answered Iehoram,
who asked if it were peace: <hi>What peace</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:2900:63"/>
(saith he) <hi>while the whoredomes of thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

with the wicked. So Iehosophat was cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised
of God, his ships were broken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he ioyned himself with Ahaziah the
idolatrous king of Israel. 2. Chron. 20. 37.</p>
            <p>3. The confederacie of the wicked is

            <p>4. For <hi>whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne.</hi>
Rom. 14. 23. therefore the peace of the
wicked being not seasoned with faith, can
not be pleasing or acceptable vnto God.</p>
            <p>5. Let vs therfore loue in truth. Nothing
ought more to moue vs to vnitie, then that
we professe one God, one faith, one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.

            <p>THese words shew another reason
why our sauior Christ prayeth for his
Disciples, that God would finish that
worke which was begun in them, that as
Christ had hitherto preserued them all,
except onely Iudas, so that God would
keepe them to the end.<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> They then which
are giuen vnto Christ to be kept,<note place="margin">They which are once tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly graft into Christ cannot finally fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</note> cannot
possibly perish or finally be lost.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>So the Prophet Dauid saith,</hi> My shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
is the liuing Lord, I shal want nothing:
though I walke through the valley of death,
I will feare no euill, for thou art with me, thy
rod and thy staffe they comfort me, <hi>Psal. 23.
1. 4. He was perswaded that the sheepe
which were vnder the conduct and custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of this shepheard, could not possibly
miscarry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Saint Paul was thus perswaded, that
nothing could separate him from the loue
of God in Christ, Rom. 8. 39. and he was
fully assured that there was layed vp a
crown of righteousnes for him. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:2900:64"/>
3. Like as none of those perished which
were saued in the Arke; nor any lost of all
the host of Israel, which were led vnder
Moses through the red sea: so much more
shall they be preserued which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the sole keeping of Christ.</p>
            <p>4. The Apostle giueth the reason here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
Heb. 7. 25. <hi>He is able perfectly to saue
them that come vnto God by him, seeing he
euer liueth to make intercession for them:
Christ then is yesterday, and to day, and the
same for euer,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. Therefore seeing
Christ neuer dieth, neither of his kingdom
is there any end, his sheepe cannot perish,
that are vnder his happie gouernement:
his kingdome is not as the kingdome of
earthly Princes, who can no longer care
for their subiects the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are in the world:
but Christ the King of his Church, not
onely when he was in the world, but now
and for euer is able to preserue those that
belong vnto him.</p>
            <p>5. First then this doctrine discouereth
a popish error, that faith may be lost, and
that they which beleeued in Christ may
fall away and perish, which is contrarie
to the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Iustifying faith cannot be lost.</note> Ioh. 14. 16. <hi>Whosoeuer
beleeueth in him shall not perish, but haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
life:</hi> they that beleeue aright in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2900:65"/>
Christ cannot be lost. Indeed an vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
faith, and which is in show rather then
truth, may be lost; but a right faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the heart is purified, and the beleeuer
iustified, cannot fall away: for then they
which are giuen vnto Christ, might belost.</p>
            <p>Secondly, though Christ do surrender
vp his disciples here into his fathers hand,
it thereby is not gathered, as though he
were not sufficient to protect them now:
but our Sauiour here speaketh of his visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
protection in the world, in which res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
he is gone from vs now: but in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of his diuine power, and euer-during
Mediatorship, he is alwaies present, and
continually careth for his Church. As at
this present this Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of England hath most comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
experience, for whom the Lord hath
prouided a Princely shepheard to gouern
his people: that although our nurcing
mother be taken from vs, he hath sent vs a
nursing father: a Baruch for a Deborah,
a Moses for a Mirriam, a Iosias for an Hul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,
which singular mercie we cannot suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
praise the name of God for.
Wherefore blessed be God, that of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
&amp; tender care hath so prouided for
vs; &amp; blessed be his annointed, that he may
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2900:65"/>
many yeares gouerne the Church &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God in all pietie, peace &amp; tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the child of perdition]</hi> That is Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note>
which was as Augustine interpreteth,
<hi>Perditioni destinatus,</hi> ordained to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
this then is an euident and certaine
truth out of the word of God,<note place="margin">Some reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the beginning.</note> that the
wicked and impenitent hypocrites and
faithlesse men, were from the beginning
ordained of God to destruction.</p>
            <p>1. This is testified Reu. 17. 8. <hi>Whose names
are not written in the booke of life from the
beginning of the world.</hi> If they were not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of God vnto life, nor numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the elect, then it is certaine they
were reiected of God, and excluded out
of his kingdome from the beginning.</p>
            <p>2. Of this decree of perdition and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
the Apostle propoundeth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of Esau and Pharao, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. the on
was hated, that is, refused of God before
he was yet borne, and left to himselfe: the
others heart according to his own wicked
inclination was hardned, that in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
Gods iustice might appeare.</p>
            <p>3. For like as the Apostle saith, <hi>In a great
house there are vessels of honor and dishonor,</hi> 2
Tim. 2. 19. so is it in this great house of the
world: as there are some appointed to be
vessels of euerlasting glorie, so others are
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2900:66"/>
worthily adiudged to eternall shame and
confusion.</p>
            <p>4. And the Lord doth all this for his
owne sake: Prouerb. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>6. 4. <hi>The Lord hath
made al things for his owne sake, yea the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
against the day of euill.</hi> As God is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in shewing mercie to his faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
so likewise he is honored in iudging
the wicked, carelesse, and impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>5. First the opinion of those is refuted,
which think that no mans end is in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
appointed of God, but that euery
mans state and condition dependeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his owne will and choise. Yea some haue
presumed so farre to say, that God not ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Paul or Peter more then Iudas, and so
consequently not reiected Iudas more
then Paul or Peter: but let them shew vs
if this were so, where Iudas in scripture is
called a chosen vessel as Paul is, Act. 9. 15.
or Paul the sonne of perdition as Iudas is.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas it may be obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
that if God in the beginning haue
cast away some, then it is needlesse for
men to endeuour to attaine to saluation,
for he whom God hath decreed shall be
damned cannot possibly be saued. To this
obiection I answer: first, that by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2900:66"/>
if it concluded any thing, Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and foreknowledge is as wel ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne,
as his decree of predestination:
for he foreseeth all things that shall come
to passe in the world, neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any thing
be otherwise disposed, then he hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene.
Secondly, if that Gods decree were
knowne in particular, who shall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
who saued, then indeed it were in
vaine for any man to striue against Gods
decree: but seeing that no man can know
his election,<note place="margin">The doctrin of Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation a spur to godlines.</note> but by his workes and fruites
of faith, euery man must labour thereby to
make his election sure, as S. Peter exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
2. Pet. 1. 10. God condemneth none
but for his sinnes, the faithfull and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
he condemneth not, but such as Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,
hypocrites, and vnfaithfull men vnto
Christ. Wherefore seeing there are some
children of perdition, but such as are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ouer to a reprobate sense, and are past
feeling, and are destitute of the spirit: we
therefore so many as God shall cal, should
labor for grace, that we may by our faith,
vertue, knowledge, loue, conscience, and
by other fruitfull workes be assured that
we belong vnto election, and are not of
the forlorne sort. And as Saint Paul saith:
<hi>Wilt thou be without feare of the power? do
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2900:67"/>
well,</hi> Rom. 13. 3. So he that will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feare of euerlasting perdition, let him
seeke to please God, and walke before
him by a liuely faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Scripture might be fulfilled]</hi> It
is then impossible,<note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> that the word of God
should faile; but whatsoeuer is declared
in the Scripture, shall most certainely be
fulfilled.</p>
            <p>1. So our Sauiour saith: <hi>It is more easie
that heauen and earth shold passe away,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Gods word.</note> 
               <hi>then
that one tittle of the Law should passe away,</hi>
Luk. 16. 17. Yea he saith further: heauen
and earth shall passe away, but my words
shall not passe away, Mat. 24. 35.</p>
            <p>2. As Mat. 2. 15. that it might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
which was spoken of the Lord by
the Prophet: <hi>Out of Egypt haue I called my
sonne,</hi> and vers. 17. <hi>Then was that fulfilled,
which was spoken by the Prophet Ieremie,
saying, In Rama was a voice heard, &amp;c.</hi> and
in many other places the Apostles shew
the accomplishment of the auncient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
in our Sauiour Christ.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore are Gods words compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to siluer seuen times purified in the
fire, Psal. 12. that as nothing is lost of pure
siluer, being now throughly tried, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
part thereof is laid vp safely: so the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2900:67"/>
words of God being most pure, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
in heauen: as the Prophet saith: <hi>Thy
word endureth for euer in heauen,</hi> Psalme
119. 89.</p>
            <p>4. The reason of the stedfastnesse of the
word is taken from the author thereof,
which is God: who it is impossible should
lie, Hebr. 6. 18. neither is there any varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
with God, or mutabilitie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a. 5. 17</p>
            <p>5. First then this doctrine teacheth vs,
that we should relie vpon the credit of
Gods word: that whatsoeuer we there
find to our comfort, edifying or instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we should as steadfastly beleeue it, as if
God spake vnto vs from heauen. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in particular the promises of God
are not made to vs, yet are they most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:
as here is no Scripture rehearsed,
wherein Iudas was declared to be a child
of perdition; but there is relation to those
generall predictions against the wicked.
As Psal. 69. 26. <hi>Let them be put out of the
booke of life, and let them not come into thy
righteousnesse.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not the cause of mens workes.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, we must not thinke, that the
prediction of the Scripture was the cause
of Iudas perdition, as though Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
imposed a necessitie vpon mens
actions.</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Predest. lib. 1. cap. 15.</note> 
               <hi>But as Augustine well saith:</hi> Des
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2900:68"/>
praescientiam non cogere hominem vt talis
scit, qualem praesciuit Deus, sed praescire ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
futurum, qualis futurus erat, quamuis
sic non cum fecerit Deus: Gods prescience for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
not a man to be such as he is foreseene,
but foreseeth him to be such as he is like to
be, though God made him not such.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers.</hi> 13.<note place="margin">Doct. 4.</note> 
               <hi>And now come I vnto thee, and
these things speake I in the world, that they
might haue my ioy fulfilled in them]</hi> This is
alleaged as another reason, why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
maketh this prayer in the hearing
of his disciples; not for any necessitie
which he had, but for the comfort of his
disciples that heard him: for the hearing
of Gods word bringeth true ioy and
comfort.</p>
            <p>1. So our Sauiour saith elsewhere,<note place="margin">Gods word worketh true comfort.</note> Ioh.
6. 4. <hi>These things haue I told you, that when
the houre shal come, ye might remember that
I told you them:</hi> it is a great comfort, when
we see things to fall out according to the
word of God.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In like manner our Sauiour hauing
prayed for Lazarus, said:</hi> Father, I thanke
thee because thou hast heard me, I know that
thou hearest me alwaies, but because of the
people that stand by, I said it, that they may
beleeue that thou hast sent me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:2900:68"/>
3. Like as Peter, though he had labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all night and caught nothing, yet was
encouraged to let downe his nets againe,
after Christ had bidden him to let them
downe to make a draught, because he
knew he should not any more labour in
vaine, Luk. 5. 5. so the Apostles here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
great ioy, being themselues eare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses
of Christs prayer.</p>
            <p>4. The reason may be gathered out of
our Sauiours words, Mat. 24. 25. <hi>Behold,
I haue told you before:</hi> that is, being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before of dangers, we are better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to beare them when they come, and
being afore assured of Gods assistance, we
conceiue the greater ioy in our deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>5. If then the hearing of Christ in his
word,<note place="margin">The danger of those that are ignorant of the word.</note> as the Apostles here heard his
voice, do worke such great ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
iudge ye what a great benefite they
are depriued of, which are ignorant of the
word, and are not acquainted with Gods
promises, neither know the familiar and
earnest prayers and requests which Christ
maketh vnto God for his Church. And as
Saint Paule saith: <hi>Whatsoeuer things are
written, are written for our learning, that
we through patience &amp; comfort of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2900:69"/>
might haue hope,</hi> Rom. 15. 4. No
maruell then if men ignorant of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and not being acquainted with
Christs comfortable words, are void and
destitute of all true ioy and comfort in
their afflictions. Dauid saith: <hi>I remembred
thy iudgements of old, O Lord, and receiued
comfort,</hi> Psal. 119. 52. that is, he found
comfort by meditating of the examples of
Gods mercie and iustice declared in his
word. Their case therefore is much to be
pitied, that either wilfully contemne, or
carnally neglect the reading &amp; medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in Gods word, which is called by the
Apostle, <hi>the sword of the spirit,</hi> Ephes. 6. 7.
Like as then a souldier set in the midst of
his enemies, without his sword and other
warlike weapons, is in danger to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured

            <p>NOw followeth another reason of our
Sauiours prayer for his disciples, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the great perils which they are
subiect vnto, and their enemies which are
set against them, which are the world:
that is, the generation of the wicked. vers.
14. and euill or sinne, which is readie to
catch hold vpon the best in this life, from
the which he desireth them to be kept,
vers. 15.</p>
            <p>In this verse two reasons are giuen of
the hatred of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they haue
the word and professe the truth, because
in respect of their righteous life, they shew
themselues not to be of the world: for
these two things the world cannot abide,
Truth and Innocencie.</p>
            <p>By the world here, neither the whole
companie of men comprehending both
good and bad, is vnderstood: as it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
taken, as Heb. 1. 6. <hi>When he bringeth
in his first begotten Sonne into the world:</hi> nor
yet for the number of the faithfull, which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2900:70"/>
are also called the world, Ioh. 1. 29. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the lambe of God, that taketh away the
sinne of the world:</hi> but the vniuersall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
of the wicked onely is here insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
As 1. Ioh. 5. 19. <hi>The whole world li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in wickednesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are here then taught,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in this life are hated for the word of
God and the truths sake:<note place="margin">The faithfull hated in the world.</note> for nothing is
more irkesome or vnpleasing vnto them,
then Gods word.</p>
            <p>1. As the Prophet Isay speaketh of the
people of his time: <hi>They would not heare
the law of the Lord, which said vnto the
Seers, see not: and to the Prophets, prophesie
not vnto vs right things, &amp;c. prophecie er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Thus Ahab hated Micaiah, because
he spake the truth vnto him, and flattered
him not, 1. King. 22. 8. For the same
cause did Herodias procure Iohn Baptists
death, because he would not dissemble
with her in her sinne, Mark. 6. This was
the cause of Saint Paules trouble at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem:
they obiected against him, that the
did teach against the law, and the temple
Act. 21. 28.</p>
            <p>3. Like as the Philistims striued with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saacs
seruants for the wels of water which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2900:70"/>
they had digged, especially for one well
of liuing or springing water, Genes. 26. 19.
so do the children of the world contend
with the faithfull about the waters of life,
which issue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word. Therfore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior
saith: <hi>I am come to put fire on the earth,
and what is my desire if it be already kindled?</hi>
Luk. 12. 49. The word of God is as a fire,
that enflameth the wicked, it maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to rage and fume as though they were
mad: as the people that could not endure
to heare Saint Paule, but cast off their
cloathes, and threw dust in the aire, Act.
22. 23.</p>
            <p>4. The reason is euident: <hi>Euery one that
euill doth, hateth the light, neither cometh
to the light, lest his euill deeds should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued,</hi>
Ioh. 3. 20. The wicked cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to be reproued, and therefore they
abhorre the word that discouereth them:
they are angrie with the looking glasse
that bewrayeth the wrinkles and spots of
their face: and as mad men that fall vpon
their phisitions that come to doe them
good: like as the man that had an euil spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
ranne vpon those that came to adiure
him, Act. 19. 16.</p>
            <p>5. First we see what we are to iudge of
those, and what they are to thinke of them
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2900:71"/>
selues,<note place="margin">A dangerous thing to hate the seruants of God.</note> which do hate any for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
sake, or do repine at Gods mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
because of their admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, they are
by the sentence of Christ, of the world. A
fearefull thing it is when a man spurneth
against the admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word, which
is especially the sin of great men. As Asa
put the prophet Hanani in prison,<note place="margin">1. Chro. 16. 10.</note> because
he rebuked him for trusting to the king of
Aram; so did not Hezekiah, who being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
by the prophet for his rashnesse in
shewing his treasures to the king of <hi>Babels</hi>
seruants, said, <hi>the word of God is good which
thou hast spoken,</hi> 2. Ki. 20. 9. Secondly, they
whome God hath called to the profession
of his word, must prepare themselues to
beare many scoffes, tauntes, and crosses in
the worlde, and to be hated for Christs
sake. Our Sauiour was no sooner baptized
and entred into his holie vocation, but
presently he is assaulted and tempted of
Sathan. Math. 4. The dragon is readie to
deuoure the childe as soone as the mother
is deliuered of it. Reuelat. 12. 4. And Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
euen in our new birth would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure
vs, and choake vs in the beginning.
Origen well noteth vpon the 17. of Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,
that presently after the Israelites had
eaten of Manna, and drunke of the rocke,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2900:71"/>
then began the battell with Amalek; <hi>&amp; tu
ergo, cum coeperis manducare panem coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem

               <note place="margin">Hom. 11. in Exod.</note> 
               <hi>and thou also,</hi> saith
he, <hi>when thou hast begunne to eate of the

warre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Because they are not of the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> 
               <hi>as I am
not of the world.</hi> In this world we are all
while we here liue; but of the world (if
we will be Christs) we must not be.</p>
            <p>1. What it is to be of the world, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
sheweth: <hi>Loue not the world, nor the
things of the world: If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loue the world,
the loue of the father is not in him,</hi> 1. Ioh. 16.
To be of the world then, is to loue the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and corruptions thereof, to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
earthly minded, and addicted, to
earthly things.</p>
            <p>2. Lot though he were in Sodom, yet was
he not of Sodome, <hi>For he was vexed with
the vncleane conuersation of the wicked,</hi> 2.
Pet. 2. 7. Nehemiah though he was in the
king of Persia his court, and waited vpon
his table, yet his heart was at Ierusalem.
Nehem. 2. 3. Daniel though in the land of
captiuitie, yet opened his window to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
Dan. 6. 10.</p>
            <p>3. Like as the Doue being sent out of
the Arke, finding no rest for the sole of her
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2900:72"/>
foote, returneth thither againe, Gen. 8. As
the marines, though in the midst of the
sea in bodie, yet in wish and desire are in
the hauen, Psal. 107. 30. so though we are
in the world, yet our desire and affection
must not be vpon it.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>For the world passeth, and the lust
thereof,</hi> 1. Iohn 2. 17. therfore it is in vaine
to settle our desire vpon vaine and transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
things; and where our treasure is,
there should be our heart: we should seek
those things which are aboue, because
Christ there sitteth at the right hand of
God. Coloss. 3. 1.</p>
            <p>5. First though we be not of the world,<note place="margin">Against sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Church.</note>
yet must we not goe otherwise out of the
world, then God hath appointed: as they
doe, which pretending corruptions of the
place, where they liue, do breake out into
schismes, &amp; separate themselues from the
fellowship of Christs Church: we must
not thus go out of the world, but rather
leaue it by the sequestring of our desire,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> separating of our bodies. The Apostle
saith, <hi>Haue no fellowship with the vnfruitful
workes of darknes, but reproue them rather,</hi>
Ephes. 5. 11. thus shall we not be of the
world, though we liue in it. Peter and
Iohn refused not to go vp to the temple
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2900:72"/>
though it were then much abused and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
with corruption. Augustine to
this point saith well,<note place="margin">Cont. Cres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">3. degrees of worldly men.</note> if we will assure our selues
that we be Christs, we must be like him: as
he is not of the world, so neither must we:

if we be risen with Christ, we must seeke those
things that are aboue,</hi> Col. 3. 1. nor to fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

do which conforme themselues to the
custome of the world, nor to warre after
the flesh and world, 2. Cor. 10. 3. that is
to become patrons and defenders of the
corruptions of the world; for these three
to affect and desire, to follow and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the world, to patronize and
defend it, are though not in the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and degree, the cognisance of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and worldly men.</p>

               <hi>Verse</hi> 15.<note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> I <hi>pray not that thou shouldest
take them out of the world, but that thou
keepe them from euill.</hi> It is not then lawfull
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2900:73"/>
for the seruants of God, in regard of the
great miseries and trauels of this life, to
wish presently to be out of the world, but
rather to pray vnto God that they may be
kept in the world, and that their life may
be preserued to serue God and liue vnto
his praise.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Church of God thus complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,</hi>
Thou hast abated my strength in the
way, and shortened my dayes: <hi>and I said,</hi> O my
God, take me not away in the middest of mine
age, <hi>Psal. 102. 23. 24. The faithfull desire
rather that their dayes may be prolonged
to Gods pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>It was the foolish wish of the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and disobedient Israelites:</hi> Wold God
we had died in the land of Aegypt, or in this
wildernesse would God we were dead, <hi>Num.
14. 1. Iob also herein shewed himselfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient:</hi>
Why died I not in the birth, why died
I not when I came out of the womb, <hi>Iob 3. 11.
Neither was Elias that great prophet alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
blameles, who being persecuted of
Iesabel, was wearie of his life,</hi> and desired to
die, and said, It is enough O Lord, take away
my soule, for I am no better then my fathers,
1. <hi>King.</hi> 14. 4.</p>
            <p>3. Like as the vnprofitable seruant is
reproued, because he hid his talent in the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2900:73"/>
earth, and put it not forth to aduantage:
Math. 25. 25. so they are vnprofitable,
which desire their bodies (before their
time) to be raked vp in the earth, and not
to liue to set forth Gods glorie. Like as it
were a foolish course, when as house is
decaied and droppeth through, to pull it
quite downe, and not to seeke to repaire
it rather: so is it with them that would
haue their crasie bodies, broken with the
cares and troubles of this life, to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dissolued, rather then to be strengthned
with grace against temptation.</p>
            <p>4. The reason, why we should not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be taken out of this world, but to be
kept from euill in the world, the Prophet
sheweth: <hi>I shall not die, but liue and declare
the workes of the Lord.</hi> Psal. 118 17. <hi>Be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificiall
to thy seruant, that I may liue and
keepe thy vvord:</hi> Psal. 119. 17. The desire
which we haue vnto Gods glorie should
make vs willing to continue in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
among the liuing.</p>
            <p>5. First:<note place="margin">Life not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly to be desired.</note> by this doctrine two corrupt
affections are discouered: the one, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man desireth life with a corrupt minde,
as that he may liue to grow rich, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in honor, or to be reuenged of his
enemie, or such like: as Ambrose noteth
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2900:74"/>
vpon those words:<note place="margin">Serm. 20. in Psal. 119.</note> Psal. 119. 154. <hi>Quicken
me because of thy word: Alius propter diuitias
viuere cupit, alius propter filios, hic propter
verbum viuificari cupit: One desireth to liue
because of their riches, another because of
their children, but the Prophet onely would
liue for Gods word sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other affection reproued,<note place="margin">Against a pre posterous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of death.</note> is when
one waxeth wearie of the world, not
for any desire he hath to God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his sorrow and trouble, to desire
with Saint Paul to be dissolued and to be
with Christ is a good affection: so that our
particular in seeking our owne perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
yeeld to the generall in furthering the
Churches consolation, as Saint Paul doth
moderate his desire, who though it were
best of all for him to be loosed, yet wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to abide in the slesh for the furtherance
of the Churches ioy. Phil. 1. 23. 24.</p>
            <p>Likewise we are taught by this rule,
when affliction commeth, and temptation
assaileth vs, to pray rather for strength to
resist, then for riddance, not at all to feele
it: Saint Paul praying, that the temptation
might depart from him which he felt in
his flesh, was not therein heard, but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
this answere, my grace is sufficient for
thee, <hi>for my power is made perfect through
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2900:74"/>
nesse:</hi> Our Sauiour prayed for Peter,
not that he should not at all be winnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Sathan, for how then should he
come foorth as cleane wheate, but that his
faith faile him not, Luk. 20. 31. Saint Paul
al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o saith, that he was deliuered from the

Nero the persecuting Emperour: but he
was not sure so to be deliuered still from

<hi>The Lord will deliuer me from euery
euill worke, &amp; preserue me vnto his heauenly
kingdome,</hi> 2. Timoth. 4. 18. He was sure to
be kept from euill, as here our Sauiour
prayeth for his disciples but not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
from the troubles of the world:
and the same also is the hope and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of euery faithfull man.</p>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2900:75"/>
and for our profite some speciall
matters and sentences are againe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>So Saint Paule saith:</hi> It grieueth me
not to write the same things vnto you, and
for you it is a sure thing, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
            <p>2 Sometime repetitions are vsed as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
and graces to the spiritual songs,
as Psalm. 136. this clause <hi>(for his mercie
endureth for euer)</hi> is repeated in euery
verse, as the ground of that Psalme, and
well setting foorth the heauenly melodie
thereof.<note place="margin">Why the Scripture vseth repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> Sometime repetitions are vsed
for the stirring and lifting vp of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
as Psal. 135. vers. 1. <hi>Praise the name
of the Lord, praise him:</hi> vers. 3. <hi>praise the
Lord.</hi> These exhortations are againe vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that our affections should be more
vehemently touched with a desite to
praise God. Sometime for doctrine sake,
and our better instruction and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
some hard matters, and sentences
are often opened, and for our better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
iterated: as our Sauiour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth
and expoundeth to his Apostles
the parable of the seed, Mat. 13.</p>
            <p>3 Therefore the words of the wise are
compared to nailes, that are sure fastened,
and driuen vp to the head, Eccles. 12. 11.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2900:75"/>
So is it, when doctrine is throughly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed:
The word of God is as siluer seuen
times purified in the fornace, Psal. 12. 7.
The foroace is our heart, where the word
of God by fruitfull meditation must be
tried, till it become siluer, and be made
profitable to vs. And as the cleane beasts
did chew the cudde, that is, they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
eate and minse the meate receiued:
so by often rehearsing and meditating, the
word of (God as our spirituall food) must
perfectly be digested.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>The reason hereof is, our dulnesse of
hearing, and weaknesse of vnderstanding,
as the Apostle sheweth to the Hebrewes:</hi>
Whereas concerning the time ye ought to be
teachers, ye haue need againe that we teach
you the first principles of the word of God.
<hi>Heb. 5. 12. whom the Prophet compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to sucking babes,</hi> that had need to be
taught precept vpon precept, line after line,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 10.</p>
            <p>5 First, though the spirit of God, that
best knoweth how to sit our affections, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
repetitions:<note place="margin">Of vaine and idle repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> yet this is no warrant for
men to vse vaine tautologies and rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
of the same things, either in prayers or
preachings: which are of three sorts; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of negligence proceeding from loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2900:76"/>
when men tosse and tumble vp and
downe the same things often in their indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
prayers. Such were the long and
irkesome prayers of the Pharises, Mat. 23.
14. Either they are for ostentation, such as
were the tedious acclamations of Baals
Priests, who did cut also and launch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with knifes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hauing nothing in their
mouthes from morning to noone, but
these wordes: <hi>Baal heare vs.</hi> Such were
the tedious Church songs vsed in popery,
full of long and vaine repetitions, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
sentences: which vse (I feare
me) is not altogether left in the seruice
and songs of some Cathedral churches to
this day. Some vaine rehearsals do shew
superstition: as the heathen did thinke to
be heard for their much babling, Mat. 6. 7.
So were people taught in poperie to say
ouer vpon their beades so many <hi>Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
Aue Maries,</hi> so many <hi>Creedes,</hi> as
though the often saying of them had a
more holinesse, and added a greater effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
vnto them. Wherfore all these kinds
of fruitlesse repetitions are held to be vain
and not at all grounded vpon Christs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we are taught, that where
the Spirit of God especially commendeth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2900:76"/>
vnto vs any doctrine or sentence in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it should so much the more of vs be

            <p>AS hitherto Christ hath prayed for
the preseruation of his Apostles, so
now he moueth his Father by these his
heauenly prayers for their sanctification:
which is of two sorts, either generall, to
be sanctified by the word of God, that is,
made truly obedient to his will, as euery
faithfull man must be: or speciall, in
making them able and sufficient for their
calling, whom now he sent vpon his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage
into the world, ver. 18. Then, the
reason and ground of this request is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which is the sanctification of himself,
vers. 19.</p>
            <p>1 Here then by this Scripture it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note>
that our hearts and affections are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
sanctified, consecrated vnto the
will and seruice of God, onely by the
truth reuealed in his word. So saith the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2900:77"/>
phet:<note place="margin">The word of God onely conuerteth.</note> 
               <hi>Wherewith shall a young man redresse
his way, in taking heed according to thy word,</hi>
Psal. 119. 9. the reforming and redressing
of our waies is wrought by the word of
God. The Apostle also saith, that the
Scriptures are profitable, <hi>to teach, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue,
to correct and instruct in righteousnes,</hi>
2. Tim. 4. 16.</p>

as the word of God is sufficient to purge

searcheth, purgeth, and purifieth, as Gods

that which is otherwise vnsauourie.<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>4 For the proper worke of faith is to
purifie our hearts, Act. 15. 9. which is as
the eye salue of the soule, by the annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
whereof our spirituall blindnesse is
cured. Reu. 3. 18. which faith is wrought
in vs by the hearing of the word of God,
Rom. 10. 17.</p>
            <p>5 First, in that our Sauiour saith: <hi>thy
word is the truth.</hi> We are taught, that all
truth necessarie to our sanctification and
saluation is contained in the Scriptures:
contrarie to the doctrine of the Church
of Rome,<note place="margin">All truth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to saluation to be found in Scripture.</note> who hold many traditions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
to saluation, not expressed nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
in the Scriptures. And lest they
might haue this euasion, that there is some
part of Gods word vnwritten, beside the
Scriptures. Our Sauiour himselfe sendeth
vs to the Scriptures: <hi>Search the Scriptures,
for in them you thinke to haue eternall life,
and they are they which testifie of me: but ye
will not come vnto me, that ye may haue life.</hi>
If the Scriptures then declare Christ, and
Christ giueth life: and if in the Scriptures
we may find eternall life, what other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is necessarie to saluation, beside the
truth reuealed in the Scriptures?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:2900:78"/>
Secondly, if the word of God do san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
vs, then they are vnprofitable hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
which by the preaching of the word
are not sanctified. If salt will not season a
man, what can? If the finger of God,
which did write his law in the tables of
stone, cannot write the same in our hearts,
then are they harder then flint or stone.
Gods word is as his pen, as Ambrose well
saith vpon these words, <hi>Psa. 45. My tongue
is the pen of a readie writer. Vide ne scriba
velociter scribens sit verbum Dei, quod ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae
vitia procurrat &amp; penetret, &amp; inscribat
dona gratiae: See if the Scribe swiftly writing
be not the word of God, which pierceth the
soule, and discouereth the errors thereof,
and writeth there the graces of Gods spirit.</hi>
If Gods pen then cannot graue his will in
mens hearts, no other writing can do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verse 18. As thou didst send me into the
world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> 
               <hi>so haue I sent them into the world.</hi>
Now followeth the speciall sanctification
of the Apostles to their office: Christ sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them into the world, and whom he
sendeth, he furnisheth with all graces
needfull for that function, wherein they
are employed.</p>
            <p>1 Therfore the Apostle alleaging out
of the Psalme saith,<note place="margin">God sendeth none but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled with gifts.</note> he hath ascended vp
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2900:79"/>
on high, &amp;c. and hath giuen giftes
vnto men, &amp;c. <hi>he therefore gaue some to be
Apostles, some Prophets, some Euangelists,
some Pastors, some Teachers,</hi> Ephes. 4. 8. 11.
God hath not onely appointed these cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and offices in his Church, but hath
also giuen gifts answerable, to some Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall,
to some Propheticall, to other
Pastorall and Doctorall gifts.</p>
            <p>2 Thus <hi>Moses</hi> was furnished of God,
both with the power of miracles, and the
gift of vtterance: <hi>I will be with thy mouth,
and teach thee what thou shalt say.</hi> Exod. 4. 3
12. Thus <hi>Isay his lips were touched with a
cole fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the altar,</hi> Isa. 6. 6. Our sauior Christ
in his baptisme receiued the holy Ghost
descending vpon him in the likenesse of a
Doue, Mat. 3. The Apostles, before they
were dispersed in the world to preach the
Gospell, were assisted by the holy spirit,
which came vpon them in prayer in the
likenesse of fierie clouen tongues.</p>
            <p>3 For to send an vnfit messenger, not
enabled with gifts, is as if one should send
a lame man of his errant: <hi>He that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a message by a foole</hi> (that is, one that is
vnwise, and not qualified with gifts) <hi>is as
he that cutteth off the legs,</hi> Pro. 26. 6. The
Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> compareth such messengers
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2900:79"/>
to dumbe dogs, that delight in sleeping,
<hi>Isay</hi> 56. 10. A man wil not keepe a dog to
watch his house, that will not barke at a
theefe: neither are the blind fit to be
watch-men, as the prophet saith in the
same place; their watch-men are blind: no
more is it fit that they should be ignorant
that watch ouer other mens soules, or
slouthfull or negligent that haue the
charge ouer others.</p>
            <p>4 By this distribution of gifts to his
members, our Lord and Sauiour sheweth
his great victory and triumph: <hi>That being
ascended, he hath led captiuitie captiue,</hi> and
dispoyled his enemies, and deuided the
spoile among his faithfull seruants: so that
the diuersitie of graces and gifts in Christs
Church, redoundeth to the glorie of out
victorious Captaine. And againe, as the
Lord hath appointed the end, <hi>the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
together of the Saints, the edification of
his bodie,</hi> Ephes. 4. 12. so likewise he hath
ordained the meanes to that end, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
of gifts working thereunto.</p>
            <p>5 First, by this Scripture are reproued
all they which intrude and thrust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
into the office and calling of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
being not with gifts thereunto ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
certainely let such know, that they
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2900:80"/>
are not of Gods sending: they either run
then of themselues, not called of God, or
sent, as the tares were sown of the enuious
man, who enuieth the profit &amp; feeding of
Christs flocke. The people must needs be
blind, where their guides are blind, as our
fauiour saith: <hi>they be blind leaders of the blind,</hi>
Mat. 15. 13.<note place="margin">Ad Furiam.</note> For as Hierom saith, <hi>detrimentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
pecoris, ignominia pastoris: The wants of the
shepheard, are the woes of the flocke.</hi> The
poore flock of Christ pincheth and smar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
for the ignorance and negligence of
their pastors.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we are taught to giue thanks
vnto God for those excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t graces which
he bestoweth vpon his Ministers: as this
Church of England shineth with a great
number of such starres, that I thinke no
Church in the world may be compared to
it. Let vs therefore praise God for such,
as the churches did for <hi>Paul: They glorified
God for me,</hi> Gal. 2. 23. and pray earnestly
vnto God to increase the number of them
<hi>that the Lord of the haruest will vouchsafe
to send forth labourers into his haruest,</hi> Mat.
9. 38.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verse</hi> 19.<note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> 
               <hi>And for their sakes sanctifie
I my selfe, that they also may be sanctified
through the truth.</hi> We see then that Christ
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2900:80"/>
is the sanctifier of his Church, and that
he hath receiued all graces and riches of
the spirit onely to inrich vs.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>So the Euangelist saith:</hi>
               <note place="margin">All gifts deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto the Church by Christ.</note> Of his fulnes
haue we all receiued, and grace for grace.
Iohn 1. 16. <hi>Christ is a full vessell, the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings
whereof do fill all his members.
The Apostle also saith,</hi> Christ gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
for his Church, that he might sanctifie
it and clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se it, Ephes. 5. 26.</p>
            <p>2 Thus was <hi>Paul</hi> called and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Christ: <hi>Neither receiued I it of man,
neither was I taught it, but by the reuelation
of Iesus Christ,</hi> Galat. 1. 12. Thus the
Angel Christ gaue vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> a litle book
which he did eate, and thereby propheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Reu. 10. 11.</p>
            <p>3 Christ is the Oliue tree that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
before the ruler of the whole earth,
and emptieth it self by the pipes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits
of his word into the golden candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke
of his Church, Zach. 4. He is the
head, from whence the bodie receiueth
life and power,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 16.</note> as the Apostle saith: <hi>Let
vs in all things grow vp vnto him, which is
the head, euen Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ist, by whom all the bodie
being coupled and knit together, according to
the effectuall power, which is in the measure
of euery part, receiueth increase of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2900:81"/>
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 For without a Mediator no grace is
deriued from God vnto man: like as the
nurse suckleth the child by the meane of
her breasts, a part of her selfe. As the mind
imparteth not her secrets, but the words
and voice: so Christ is Gods eternal word
to make known his wil; he by his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the nurse by her breasts, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey
vnto vs heauenly grace. The booke of
Gods secrets could not be opened, till the
Lion of the tribe of Iuda had obtained to
open it. <hi>Reu.</hi> 5. 3. 5.</p>
            <p>5 First, in that Christ sanctifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
he is manifested to be perfect God,
who hath the fountaine of grace and life
in himselfe, who needeth not by an other
to be sanctified as man doth, but the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Godhead dwelleth bodily in
him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9. that is, essentially &amp; substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially:
for God giueth him not the spirit by
measure, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 34. as to others. Secondly,
Christ had no need of the grace of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
for himselfe, but to sanctifie vs.
Christ therefore was borne, died, rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
ascended, not for himself, but for vs:
he merited not to himselfe;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not for himselfe.</note> but all the
fruite of his merits redound to vs, contrary
to the doctrine of the Church of Rome,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2900:81"/>
who teach that Christ merited for himself.
Ambrose toucheth this point well:<note place="margin">Lib. 5. de fid. cap. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Ad hoc
natus est Christus, vt faceret creaturam, nec
enim sibi natiuitas sua proficit, sed nobis; quia
non eguit nasci, erat enim in Deo qui processit
de Deo: si ergo natiuitas prima illi non profuit
multò minus secunda. Christ was borne to
this end, to make the creatures; for his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie
did not profite himself, but vs; he needed
not to haue bene borne or begotten, for he was
in God that proceeded from God: if then his
first natiuitie did not profit him, much lesse his
second.</hi> As Christ was euerlastingly begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of God, not for himselfe, but for the
creation of the world; so he was borne in
the fulnesse of time, not for himselfe, but
for our redemption.</p>
            <p>Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here may euery one learne, how
to know himselfe to be a true member of
Christs bodie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely by his sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
for as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>If the first fruites be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so is the lumpe; if the roote be holy, so are
the branches,</hi> Rom. 11. If then we be graft
into the true vine, the life of the tree is in
vs, and the spirit of sanctification doth
quicken vs: and as Christ did sanctifie
himselfe, so are we sanctified by him. He
then that hath not the spirit of Christ,
whereby he shold be sanctified, is not his.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>NOw followeth the second part of
our Sauiours prayer for his Church,
namely, for those which would afterward
beleeue in him vnto the worlds end. First
it is shewed for whom he prayeth, ver. 20.
then what he prayeth for: first for their v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
and perfection in this life, from vers.
20. to 24. Secondly, for their euerlasting
saluation, from vers. 24. to the end.</p>
            <p>First we learne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that to our great comfort
the prouident care and mercifull loue of
Christ is extended,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> not vnto that age only
then present,<note place="margin">Christ praieth for all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers to the end of the world.</note> but to all the companie of
beleeuers in all ages, so long as the world
endureth.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>So our Sauiour saith.</hi> Other sheepe I
haue also, which are not of this fold, them also
must I bring, and they shall heare my voice,
and there shall be one sheep-fold and one shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 16.</p>
            <p>2. Of this sheep-fold were the Eunuch,
<hi>Acts</hi> 8. Cornelius, Acts 10. Lydia, Act. 16.
that were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended vnder this prayer
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2900:82"/>
of Christ, and by the holy vertue and force
thereof conuerted to the faith, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto Christs sheepe.</p>
            <p>3 For like as the waters of Iordan came
not together, till all the people of Israell
were cleane gone through, Ios. 3. 17. so
the Lord hath purposed to continue the
world, and to suspend the dissolution
thereof, till the number of Saints be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.
And as the people both before and
following after Christ riding to Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
cryed, <hi>Hosanna,</hi> saue vs Lord. Mat. 21. 9.
so both the faithfull people before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
of Christ, and the Church also
succeeding, haue their part of saluation in
him.</p>
            <p>4 For as the Apostle saith, speaking by
way of comparison of the fathers vnder
the law: <hi>God prouiding a better thing for vs,
that they without vs should not be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
Heb. 11. 40. So also God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
for all beleeuers which should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in the world, that without them, no
not the faithfull which then liued, could
be compleat and perfect: seeing we all
make but one bodie in Christ, which is
not full and compleat, if any of the parts
and members thereof be wanting.</p>
            <p>5 First, this is a great comfort to as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2900:83"/>
many as do beleeue in Christ, that our
blessed Sauiour hath prayed for them, and
they are all comprehended in his prayer.
Let not any man say, would God that I
had liued in Christ time, that he might
haue laid his hands vpon me, and prayed
ouer me: that I might haue seene him, and
heard him speake. What would we more?
Christ hath prayed for vs, and by this his
prayer we liue and are preserued. Was
<hi>Thomas</hi> onely blessed, because he thrust
his hand into Christs side, and felt the
print of the nailes? Did not our Sauiour
pronounce all those also <hi>blessed, that haue
not seene, and yet haue beleeued,</hi> Ioh. 20. 29.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we are taught by this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of our Sauiour, that we should not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
care for the present age, but as much as
in vs lyeth prouide for posteritie, when we
are gone. As the Lord testifieth of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:
<hi>I know he will commaund his sonnes
and his housho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d after him, that they keepe
the way of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 18. 19. he had a
care to transmit ouer to his posteritie the
true worship of God.<note place="margin">Care of poste<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie.</note> So Saint Peter saith:
<hi>I will indeuour alwaies, that ye may be able
to haue remembrance of these things after
my departure,</hi> 2. Pet. 1. 15. So shold Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Princes and Magistrates, faithfull
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2900:83"/>
Ministers and godly Parents lay such a

God when they are gone. Many parents
themselues are well affected to religion
and godlinesse, but they are carelesse of
their children. Such an one was <hi>Ely,</hi> that
himselfe fearing God, had no great care
to plant the same in his children, suffering
them to haue their owne mind. Ambrose
saith well: <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Which shall beleeue in me through their
word]</hi> By the word then and preaching of
the Apostles,<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> men are brought to faith
and beleefe.</p>
            <p>1 Thus the Apostle testifieth: <hi>Faith is
by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,</hi>
Rom. 10. 17. The word of God preached
and by attentiue hearing receiued, is that
which ingendreth faith.</p>
            <p>2 There was reading of the Scriptures
vsually vpon the Sabbath in Nazareth,
but till Christ preached vnto them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
the Scripture, they vnderstood it
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2900:84"/>
not: but then hearing him preach: <hi>They all
bare witnesse,</hi> (and gaue consent to his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine)
<hi>and wondred at the gracious words
which proceeded out of his mouth.</hi> The Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch
did reade in the Prophet Isay, but he
vnderstood him not, neither beleeued, till
<hi>Philip</hi> had expounded the Prophet to
him, Act. 8.</p>
            <p>3 Like as a medicine helpeth not, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
there be also a skilfull man to apply
the same, and giue direction how it shold
be vsed, as the Prophet ioyneth them both
together: <hi>Is there no balme at Gilead, is
there no Phisitian there?</hi> Ier. 8. 22. it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not to haue precious balme, without
a Phisitian, that should prescribe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
thereof: So the word of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not that effect, where by preaching
it is not applyed. The Samaritans said to
the woman: <hi>We beleeue now, not because of
thy saying, for we haue heard him our selues,</hi>
Ioh. 4. 42. The reading of the Scripture
is like the bare and naked report of the
woman; the preaching is as the powerfull
hearing of Christ himselfe.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>For the word of God (the Spirit wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

            <p>5 First, if the word of the Apostles haue
this property to beget faith, then we need
not maruell,<note place="margin">Faith a rare thing, where is no prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</note> that faith is so rare a thing
where there is no preaching: as in many
places, where yet there is a dumbe and
vnpreaching Ministerie, or else mens tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
are preached and vrged, and not
the word of the Apostles onely, as in the

vpon which words Ambrose
saith: <hi>Religio appellatur, cùm sit sacrilegium,

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, whosoeuer is a contemner
and neglecter of the word of God, cannot
possiblie attaine vnto faith or beleefe. If
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2900:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any man (as Iehoiakim) deface the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
who caused the booke to be cut and
mangled, and then cast into the fire, Ier.
36. 23. or stoppe their eare against it, as
the Iewes against Stephen, Act. 7. or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
worldy matters before it, as the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesenes,
Mat. 8. 34. they may liue long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
before euer they shall meet with
faith. For the wise man saith: <hi>If thou see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest

the knowledge of God,</hi> Prou. 2. 4. 5. They
then which seeke not for her, shall not
find her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they all may be one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> 
               <hi>as thou ô Father
in me, and I in thee, &amp;c. that they also may
be one in vs]</hi> Our Sauior prayeth here for
the vnion and communion of Saints; their
vnion with God, their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion among
themselues. Whereby this is gathered,
that we cannot be one among our selues,
vnlesse we be one with God: they cannot
haue peace in the world, that are not at
peace with God.</p>
            <p>1 Therefore the Angels thus sing in
that their heauenly song: <hi>Glorie to God on
high, peace in earth,</hi> Luk. 2. 14. The way
to obtaine peace in earth, is to giue glory
to God in heauen.</p>
            <p>2 Dauid first reconciled himselfe to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2900:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God: <hi>I acknowledged my sinne vnto thee:</hi>
then he is assured of the loue and fauour
of his Church: <hi>therefore shall euery one that
is godly, make his prayer vnto thee,</hi> Psal. 32.
5. 6. then the faithfull will be readie for
their parts to giue thankes vnto God for
him. The contrarie appeareth in Cham,
who first being cast off from God, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
by his sins, which he felt heauier
then he could beare, findeth no comfort
in earth, he was afraid, lest euery one that
met him, should kill him, Gen. 4.</p>
            <p>3 Christ saith: Haue salt in your selues,
haue peace one with another, Mark. 9. 50.
We must first be inwardly seasoned with
the salt of Gods grace, before we can haue
peace without: Gods grace is the salt,
peace is the sweet rellish or sauour, that
followeth vpon this seasoning. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Dauid saith: <hi>They came about me like
Bees, and are quenched as a fire of thornes:
but in the name of God I will destroy them,</hi>
Psal. 118. 12. Faith and confidence in the
name of God, doth allay strife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
as when the sting of the Bee is
doubled or pulled foorth, or as the crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
fire of thornes is extinct and put out.</p>
            <p>4 Our Sauiour mooueth vs to vnitie,
by his example: because he and his Father
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2900:86"/>
are one: where he speaketh not of the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall
vnion and consociation which he
hath with God; but of his dispensation &amp;
mediation, who as he was man, cohered
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sented with his Father in all things.
We therefore should be in vnitie, consent
and agree together, because Christ our
Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen as man, is of one accord and
consent with his Father: and the like mind
should be in vs, that was in Christ, Phil. 2.</p>
            <p>5 If then the vnion with God, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Saints do concurre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
(for peace with the world follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not peace with God: but the more we
are loued of God, the more the world ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vs. But our Sauiour speaketh of that
vnion and society, which the Church hath
with it selfe) they then do deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
which thinke they are at peace
with God, and are not in loue and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with the Church of Christ: whether
Schismatickes, that deuide themselues
from the peace of the Church, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
persons, that regard not the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of the Saints: against whom the
Apostle speaketh: <hi>Not forsaking the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
that we haue among our selues, as the
manner of some is,</hi> Heb. 10. 25. Like vnto
Ismael, whose hand was against euery
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2900:86"/>
man, and euery mans against him. So some
there are that think wel of none, nor none
thinke wel of them: but it is a true saying,

            <p>2. By this reason Moses perswadeth

Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 24. They by their euil conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
made the Gentiles more obstinate.</p>
            <p>3. Like as then the outward deliuerance
of the Israelites was famous among the
heathen, and made them stand in awe: as
the idolatrous Priests said to the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims:
<hi>Wherfore should ye harden your hearts
as the Egyptians and Pharao hardened their
hearts?</hi> 1. Sam. 6. 7. and as the heathen
praised God for the returne of the people
from captiuitie, Psa. 126. 2. So much more
occasion of praise is raised among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the spirituall deliuerance of his
Church, and redemption from sinne.</p>
            <p>4. Two reasons may be yeelded hereof
why God would haue made knowne to
the world the godly conuersation of his
Church:<note place="margin">Why God would haue the holy life of his faithful knowne to the world.</note> one for their conuersion, <hi>that they
which obey not the word, may be wonne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

to be a iudgement vnto them, that
they may be left without excuse, if by the
contemplation of the creatures, much
more by the conuersation of the faithfull.
Rom. 1. 20.</p>
            <p>5. They therefore are to be reproued,
which by their vngodly life do hinder the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2900:88"/>
beleefe of the Gentiles: what will Iewes
and Turkes say, when they see or heare of
the malice, drunkennesse, extortion, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse,
that raigneth among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?
Can they thinke that we worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the

being giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer to such great enormities?
If a man did but sinne against his brother,
or do him wrong, it would aske recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence:
but now such sinne against God,
causing his name to be euill spoken of. If
a man did by his owne sinne but slay his
owne soule, it were an heauy case: but
now drawing other after them by their

and go backe, greater must needs be their
condemnation.<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 6.</note> Our Sauiour saith, <hi>It were

            <p>HEre is another reason of Christs
petition for vnitie, taken from the
very fountaine and originall thereof,
namely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their election and fore-ordaining
vnto glorie: for this cause they are glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in Christ, that they might expresse and
shew forth this godly vnion and spirituall
coniunction.</p>
            <p>Hence then we learne,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> that such as are
ordained vnto life and euerlasting glorie,
are prepared of God vnto good workes
first, and to the seruice of loue in this life
before they shall be admitted to the
next.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>So the Apostle saith:</hi>
               <note place="margin">We are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to walke in good works</note> As he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
vs in him before the foundation of the
world, that we should be holy and without
blame before him in loue, <hi>Ephes. 1. 4. And
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2900:89"/>
againe,</hi> Ye are his workmanship, created in
Christ Iesus vnto good workes, which God
hath ordained that we should walke in them,
<hi>Ephes. 2. 10. Then both good works were
ordained for the elect, and the elect ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to walke in good workes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The holy Apostle thus testifieth of
himselfe: <hi>Who shall deliuer me from euery
euill worke, and preserue me to his heauenly
kingdome,</hi> 2. Tim. 4. 18. He assureth himself
that God will giue him grace to abstaine
from euill workes, seeing he had ordained
him for his kingdome. Christ concludeth
Zacheus to be the sonne of Abraham, and
child of saluation, because he had expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
liuely fruites thereof in his large resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and bountifull charitie. Luke 19. 8.</p>
            <p>3. Like as Dauid being deputed and
appointed to the kingdom of Israell, doth
in the meane time prepare and addresse
himselfe to walke vprightly, as he saith: <hi>I
will do wisely in the perfect way til thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
vnto me,</hi> Pfal. 101. 2. so all they which
are ordained to Christs euerlasting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
should walke in Dauids steps. As
the bride prepareth and trimmeth her self
for her husband, though alreadie espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
so the elected alreadie by Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> espoused vnto him in Christ,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2900:90"/>
must adorne and trim themselues by holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and vertue, that they may be readie
to solemnize the euerlasting mariage feast
in heauen.</p>
            <p>4. For they must first shew themselues
faithful in litle, whom the Lord should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
make rulers of much, Mat. 25. 23.
They must first shew their faithfulnesse in
seeking Gods glorie in earth, before
they can receiue glorie from God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
            <p>5. First then, seeing glorie is first giuen
and decreed to the elect, then followeth
their godly vnitie and fruitfull loue: and
the first is bestowed, that the second may
follow; not this first foreseene, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might be decreed.<note place="margin">

not by workes, but by him that calleth.
Rom.</hi> 9. 11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we haue here a certaine rule
giuen vs, whereby we may discerne our
election, namely, by the fruitfull works of
vnitie and charity, which are as seales and
pledges of that glorie which is decreed to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2900:90"/>
be giuen vs in Christ. Thus S. Peter exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:
<hi>Wherefore brethren, giue rather dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to make your calling and election sure,
for if ye do those things, ye shall neuer fall.
2. Pet.</hi> 1. 10. And S. Iohn saith, <hi>We know
we are translated from death to life, because
we loue the brethren.</hi> 1. Ioh. 3. 14. There are
two bookes,<note place="margin">Two books: the booke of life, the book of a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

iudged, the booke of life, and the book of
euery mans conscience, as S. Iohn testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
<hi>The bookes were opened, and another
booke was opened, which is the booke of life,</hi>
Reu. 20. 12. The booke of the conscience
is a true copie of the booke of life, here a
man shall find how it is written there. The
record of a mans conscience, is a certaine
and infallible euidence of the record in
heauen. Thus S. Paul found written in the
booke of his conscience, that because he
had fought a good fight, &amp; kept the faith,
he doubted not but that a crowne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
was laid vp for him, 2. Tim. 4. 8.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2900:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my brother,</hi> Cantic. 7. 11. We must now
bring Christ into our field, to shew him
our fruites, that he may afterwards bring
vs into his barnes to enioy his glorie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verse 23. I in them, and thou in me, that
they may be made perfect in one.]</hi> A third
reason is here contained of Christs peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for vnitie in his members: namely,
from the adiunct of perfection: they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made perfect without it, neither
can any man be a compleat Christian and
true member of Christ, vnlesse there be a
coniunction also with Christs bodie. So
that to this perfection, there are three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of vnion expressed: the first of Christ
the Mediator with God his Father: <hi>Thou
in me:</hi> the second of Christ with his
Church, <hi>I in them:</hi> the third of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
among themselues, <hi>That they may be
perfit in one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Here then where Christ saith, <hi>I in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi>
we are taught that there is no true peace,
concord, or vnion, but in Christ. So our
Sauiour saith, <hi>That in me ye might haue
peace,</hi> Ioh. 16. 23. and the Apostle: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>following the truth in
loue:</hi> there is no sound and true loue but in
the truth.</p>
            <p>2 Dauid fretted in himselfe, and was
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2900:91"/>
disquieted, he could find no rest, nor
peace, till he went into the Sanctuarie of
God, Psal. 73. 17. Thus Saint Paule shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that while he was vnder the law, he
found nothing but death and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>But I died, and the same commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was ordained vnto life, was found
to be vnto me to death,</hi> Rom. 7. 10. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he was come to Christ, then he found,
<hi>that there was no condemnation to them that
were in Christ Iesus,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. It did not
helpe the Apostle, that he was a Pharise,
a circumcised Hebrew, Philip. 3. 5. confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
with the high Priest, Act. 10. 1.
all this he counted as doung in respect of
the knowledge of Christ.</p>
            <p>3 The peace, friendship, and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie
of men, is like the tempering of iron
and clay together, that will not be ioyned.
Dan. 2. 43. And like as when a man lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vpon a broken staffe, the shiuers
thereof will runne into his hand, 2. King.
18. 21. such is the peace and loue of the
world, it in the end turneth to hatred.
Such was the friendship betweene Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech
and the Sichemites, a fire went
out from the one and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed the other,
Iud. 9. 20.</p>
            <p>4 For peace is one of the fruites of the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2900:92"/>
spirit, Gal. 5. 22. therefore as a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
gather grapes of thornes, nor figges
of thistles, so neither is true peace to be
expected in the world without Christ.</p>
            <p>5 First then all externall peace, which
is not combined and knit together by
Christ, can not hold: such was the league
betweene godly Iehosophat and wicked
Ahab, it brought him into daunger of his
life, 1. King. 22. 32. as the ioyning with
Ahaziah the sonne of Ahab, was the cause
of the losse of Iehosophats shippes, 2. Chr.
20. 37.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we learne that there can be
no true internall peace, but in Christ: there
may be a carnall securitie,<note place="margin">Three kinds of false peace.</note> such as was in
the old world, that gaue themselues to ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and drinking, till the floud came and
destroyed them: but this is farre from true
peace. The hypocrite also spareth no cost
nor labour to be reconciled, he will bring
thousands of rammes, and riuers of oyle,
Micah. 6. 6. but he cannot find by his own
workes the right way vnto peace.</p>
            <p>A third sort there is, that haue a feeling
of this peace for a time, but it continueth
not. As Ahab found the wrath of God
somewhat appeased toward him, after he
had humbled himselfe with fasting and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2900:92"/>
sackcloth, 1. King. 21. 27. but he soone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to his old sinnes, and kindled the
wrath of God against him againe. The
only true peace then with God is wroght
by faith in Christ, Rom. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. And the right
concord and vnitie among men is made
perfect by the profession of the truth: as
the heart of Dauid and Ionathan were lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
together in faith and in the feare of
God.<note place="margin">Paulin. Tom. 4.</note> Hier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

studia conciliant: That is true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and ioyned together in Christ, which not
priuate profite or the bodily presence, or flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie;
but the feare of God, and the studie of
Scripture doth beget.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And hast loued them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> 
               <hi>as thou hast loued
me]</hi> Like as Gods loue was manifested to
Christ, when the holy Ghost descended
vpon him, whereby he was sanctified and
replenished in his humane nature with all
heauenly gifts and graces: at what time
God proclaimed from heauen,<note place="margin">Gods loue best knowne by the graces of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that Christ
was his beloued sonne, Mat. 3. So Gods
loue is not in any thing more euident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his children, then when he endueth
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2900:93"/>
them with his holy Spirit, whereby they
are sanctified: and therefore our Sauiour
prayeth for their sanctification, that the
world may know, that God loueth them.</p>
            <p>1 Thus the Apostle testifieth: <hi>The loue
of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, which is giuen vs.</hi> Rom. 5. 5. that
is, hereby the loue of God is apparant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vs, because he giueth vs his spirit,
whereby we are sanctified.</p>
            <p>2 Thus was the loue of God confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
toward the holy Apostle, who pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the temptation of his flesh might
<hi>depart from him,</hi> and receiued this answer:
<hi>My grace is sufficient for thee.</hi> 2. Cor. 12.
9. The assistance of Gods grace was a sure
testimonie of his loue. So the Prophet
Dauid prayeth: <hi>Make me to heare ioy and
gladnesse, that the bones which thou hast bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
may reioyce:</hi> and againe, <hi>Restore me to
the ioy of thy saluation, and stablish me with
thy free spirit,</hi> Psal. 51. 8. 12. He desireth
none other testimonie of Gods loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him, but that he may feele the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
comfort of Gods spirit.</p>
            <p>3 For Gods loue is best knowne by his
best gifts; the best things he reserueth for
those, whom he best loueth. Now the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of regeneration, the spirituall giftes of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2900:93"/>
faith, hope, and loue, are without al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
the most principall. As the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith: <hi>Desire you the best giftes, and I
will yet shew you a more excellent way,</hi> 1.
Cor. 12. 31. and then in the next chapter he
treateth of faith, hope, and loue.</p>
            <p>4 Like as Ioseph sent vnto Beniamin
more plentifull measses of meate, Gen. 43.
34. and gaue him richer gifts, and more
costly sutes of apparell, then to the rest of
his brethren, Gen. 45. 22. so the Lord
bestoweth the best gifts vpon his owne
children. As the father caused the fat calfe
to be killed for his returned sonne, Luk.
15. so the fatnesse of spirituall graces the
Lord vouchsafeth vnto such, as truly turn
vnto him.</p>
            <p>5 The vse of this doctrine is excellent,
that we should not grieue to see the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie,
ease, and wealth of many worldly
men: like as sometime the Prophet Dauid
fretted in himselfe at that sight, Psal. 73. 2
But let vs consider how plentifully the
Lord doth recompence to his children
the want of things temporall, with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
graces of the spirit. Dauid prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the light of Gods countenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the abundance of wine, corne, oyle,
or any other worldly endowment, Psal. 4.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2900:94"/>
Augustine saith well: <hi>Si Deus tanta dat
malis, quanta seruat bonis? If God giue such
things, as riches, and prosperitie to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
how great gifts hath he in store for his?</hi>
Say not then in thine heart, why hath not
God made me rich, honorable, strong, &amp;
beautifull? he hath giuen thee a better por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the knowledge of his name, an heart
to feare him, a conscience to abstaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
euill. Where as thou seest a rich man gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to oppression, a prophane person, a
senslesse ignorant man: tell me, wouldest
thou chaunge states with him? I think not:
be content then with thy best lot, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
still the increase and continuance of
spirituall graces.</p>

            <p>NOw followeth the other petition of
our Sauiour for the glorification of
his Church: where we haue the request
it selfe, that they may be with Christ: the
end, to behold his glorie: the assurance,
for thou louedst me before the foundation
of the world.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> we see the efficacie of Christs
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2900:94"/>
prayer, that whatsoeuer he but willeth of
God, as the Mediator of his Church, it is
accomplished.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Thus the Apostle testifieth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The prayer of Christs mediation.</note> He is able
perfectly to saue those, that come vnto God by
him, because he euer liueth to make interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
            <p>2 Thus our Sauiour was heard for La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus:
<hi>I know thou hearest me alwaies,</hi> Ioh.
11. 42. Thus our Sauiour prayed for Peter,
that his faith failed him not, Luk. 22. 32.
and it was so fulfilled: for though Peters
faith was shaken, yet was it not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne;
though it fainted, it failed not.</p>
            <p>3 If Moses by the lifting vp of his hands
ruled the battell betweene Israel and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleck:
if Eliah by his toung gouerned
the aire, that it should not raine, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his word. If Peters shadow
commaunded diseases, Act. 5. 15. how
much more effectuall is the holy will and
desire of Christ.</p>
            <p>4 For Christ is the beloued sonne of
God, in whom God is well pleased, Mat.
3. 17. whatsoeuer Christ therefore willeth
of his Father, he cannot denie vnto him,
for the great loue he hath toward him.</p>
            <p>5 First, to our great comfort we are
taught, that seeing the will of Christ is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2900:95"/>
omnipotent: <hi>whatsoeuer it pleased the Lord,
that did he in heauen and earth,</hi> Psal. 135. 6.
and his will toward his church is most
kind, louing, mercifull, and bountifull, that
nothing can fall our amisse to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
they need not feare temptation, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,
trouble, all shall fall out for the
best, Christ will haue it so. Againe, so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
is the mediation of Christ, that
whatsoeuer we shall aske the father in his
name, he will giue it vs, Iohn 16. 23. No
man hath any such assurance in his suites
and requests which he maketh vnto men:
wherefore we ought most chearefully to
resort to the throne of grace, where our
faithfull petitions are neuer reiected and
cast forth. Hierome well saith, <hi>Peto vt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiam,
&amp; cum accepero rursus peto, auarius
sum ad accipienda beneficia Dei, nec ille de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit

quanto plus bibero, tanto plus sitio: I aske to
receiue, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue receiued, I ask again,
I am couetous to receiue Gods blessings, he
faileth not in giuing, and I am not filled with
receiuing, the more I drinke, the more I
thirst.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they which thou hast giuen me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> 
               <hi>be
with me where I am.</hi> This is a great priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that our blessed sauior hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2900:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs to no other place,<note place="margin">The faithfull shal be in the same place with Christ in heauen.</note> then where he
himselfe is.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Thus S. Paul saith,</hi> We shall meet the
Lord in the aire, and so shall be euer with him
1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
            <p>2. The Lord said to the conuert vpon
the crosse, <hi>This da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> shalt thou be with me in
Paradise.</hi> S. Paul assureth himselfe, that
when he should be dissolued, he should be
with Christ. Phil. 1. 23.</p>
            <p>3. Like as it is a great honour if the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
should set his seruant at his own table:
so our Sauiour saith to his Apostles, that
they should eate and drinke at his table in
his kingdome, Luke 12. 29. Like as Iehu
took Iehonadab vp into the chariot with
him, 2. King. 10. 15. the like honor Christ
vouchsafeth vnto his Saints.</p>
            <p>4. Our Sauiour giueth this reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they
had contiued with him in his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Luke 22. 28. And againe he saith,
Where I am, there be my Ministers also,
Iohn 12. 26. They which haue bene parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of the afflictions of Christ, shall also
be made partners in his glorie.</p>
            <p>5. If we desire then to dwel with Christ
in the kingdome of heauen, he must dwel
with vs in earth: if to be receiued into his
euerlasting habitation, then we must now
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2900:96"/>
prepare for him the habitation of our
hearts. How can they then be assured
to enioy Christs presence in heauen, that
delight not to heare him present now?
who by their corrupt communication and
prophane behauior, do grieue the spirit of
God, and chase away Christ from them.
Ambrose saith wel, <hi>Proiectus est Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> è Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiso,
no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> immerito ipse, enim se prius abscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat
à facie Dei: Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was cast out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
and not without cause, for first he had hid
himselfe from Gods face:</hi> so they which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
not Gods face, nor enioy the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of his spirit here, cannot haue the
presence of his glorie in heauen,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they may behold my glorie which
thou hast giuen me:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> they shall not onely be
beholders, but partakers also of that great
glorie.</p>
            <p>1. So the Apostle saith, <hi>We all behold as
in a mirrour with open face the glorie of the
Lord, and are changed into the same image
from glorie to glorie.</hi> 2. Cor. 3. 18. This glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
seene here as in a glasse, shall be seene
there with open face, and so seene as that
we shall be changed and transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
            <p>2 Thus <hi>Moses and Elias appeared in glory
in mount Tabor, where our Sauiour was also
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2900:96"/>
transfigured,</hi> Luke 9. 31. So Stephen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the glorie of God, and Iesus stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at the right hand of God, himselfe
also was partaker of that glorie being yet
vpon the earth, his face was as the face of
an Angell, Act. 6. 15.</p>
            <p>3. Like as Hezekiah to gratifie the king
of Babels messenger, who was sent to
congratulate with him for his recouerie,
did shew him in kindnesse all the treasure
of his house, though this were a simple
part of Hezekiah and done without
warrant. But yet like as men exalted to
honour and wealth, do delight to shew to
their friends their happie estate: so our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior
Christ desireth that his Church shold
behold his great glory. Like as the church
saith in the Canticles, <hi>I will leade thee into
my mothers house, I will cause thee to drinke
spiced wine, Cant.</hi> 8. 2. so our blessed sauior
will bring vs into his fathers house, and
shew vs of his best things.</p>
            <p>4. For this glorie which Christ hath
receiued as our Mediator, he hath to this
end receiued it, to bestow it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his church
Iohn 17. 22. <hi>The glorie that thou gauest me,
I haue giuen them.</hi> Christ hath not merited
or purchased any thing to himselfe by his
great glorie, but whatsoeuer he wrought
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2900:97"/>
for vs as our Mediator, the whole gaine
and benefite thereof redoundeth to vs.</p>
            <p>5. But as we hope to behold the glorie
of Christ in heauen with open face,<note place="margin">They that wil see Christ face to face in hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen, must see him by faith here.</note> so
must we now see him by faith: as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith, <hi>We walke by faith, not by sight, 2.
Cor.</hi> 5. 7. then we shall walke by sight, not
by faith: wherefore whosoeuer now seeth
not Christ by faith, shal not then inioy his
sight and presence in glorie. We must, as
Moses, discerne the land of promise a far
off, before we can enter into it. They ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that want the vision of the soule in
this life, cannot haue the full contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Christs glorie afterward. Certaine it is,
that Christ will reueale himselfe to all his
children before they go hence, as he was
seene and embraced of Simeon before his
departure.<note place="margin">Hom. in Mat. 13.</note> Origene saith wel, <hi>Vt naturalis

               <hi>For thou louedst me before the foundation

glorie which the Lord decreed to giue
vnto him before the beginning of the
world: whereby we do learne, that as
Christ the head was predestinate vnto
glorie, so also his members were set apart
vnto life in the euerlasting decree of God.</p>
            <p>1. The Apostle saith,<note place="margin">Christ how said to be predestinate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> that Christ was

to his kingdom: and Moses was dessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned
to be deliuerer of Israel forty yeares
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2900:98"/>
before he exercised his office: so the elect
of God were long ago ordained to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
though the accomplishment thereof
they must expect with patience.</p>
            <p>4. And this God did, <hi>to the praise of the

great goodnesse, that hath prepared for vs
an euerlasting kingdome before as yet we
were.</p>
            <p>5. Seeing then that God in his gracious
decree of electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath sorted out some to
euerlasting saluation, we must take heed of
2 gulfs, that we fal not into them: the one
is of superstition, not to thinke with the
Papistes, that it is presumption to be
sure of that which God hath most surely
and certainly decreed: the other is of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
that men without good ground
be not too confident in their hope, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to be saued whatsoeuer they do: but
that as the Apostle saith, <hi>We worke out our
saluation with feare and trembling,</hi> and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to adde dayly somewhat to our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance:
that as saint Peter saith, <hi>We giue
dili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ence to make our calling and electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sure,</hi>
and seale the same vnto our soules by the
fruits thereof. This assurance of saluation
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2900:98"/>
is neither impossible to be had,<note place="margin">Assurance of heauen is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor yet easie to be had.</note> as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
thinketh, nor yet easie to be had, as the
carnal Protestant thinketh. It may be had,
but with much study and faithfull endeuor
and godly care, by feare and trembling.
Happie are they, which by Gods grace
haue attained to this gift and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worke, as all wee which beleeue in
Christ shall in good time before we go
hence by Gods grace attaine vnto it:
then shall we with patience runne out
our course, and nothing can happen
so grieuous which this happie assurance of
heauen will not make easie vnto vs. That
we may say with Prophet Dauid: <hi>I
had fainted, if I had not beleeued to see the
goodnesse of the Lord in the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
Psal.</hi> 27. 13. Ambrose saith well:

hath not knowne thee.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN these verses following, the meanes
are expressed whereby we may attaine
vnto euerlasting glory, described in the
former verse, and they are two: the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, vers. 25. and the liuely sense
and feeling of Gods loue, verse 26. First,
in this verse our Sauior sheweth, that the
world is vtterly ignorant of God, and void
of true knowledge.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>As the Euangelist testifieth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The blindnes &amp; ignorance of the world.</note> He was
in the world, and the world was made by him,
and the world knew him not, <hi>Iohn 1. 10. So
the Apostle rehearseth out of the Psalme,</hi>
There is none that vnderstandeth, none that
seeketh after God, <hi>Rom</hi> 3. 11.</p>
            <p>2. Such a worldly man was Pharao, who
prophanely said: <hi>I know not the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wil I let Israel go,</hi> Exod. 5. 2. Such an
ignorant person and blasphemous wretch
was the messenger of the King sent for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisha:
<hi>Behold this euil</hi> (saith he) <hi>commeth of
the Lord, why should I waite on the Lord any
longer.</hi> 2. Kin. 6. 33.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:2900:99"/>
3. Like as a foole or ideot knoweth not
the way into the citie; such fooles are all
wordly men, that know not the way
which leadeth to the celestiall Ierusalem,
Eccles. 10. 15. who are herein worse then
the oxe or asse, <hi>which know their ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and their masters crib,</hi> Isay 13. but these
haue no knowledge of God, who made
them and dayly feedeth them.</p>
            <p>4. The cause of this ignorance of the
world, is the hardnes of their heart. Eph. 4
18, because through their corrupt and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
affections, they corrupt that light of
nature which they haue, <hi>Because when they
knew God, they glorified him not as God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were thankefull, but became vaine in
their imaginations, and their foolish hart was
full of darknesse,</hi> Rom. 1. 21.</p>
            <p>5. We see then what a dangerous thing
it is, not to haue the knowledge of God,
and to be ignorant of his wayes: all such
are as yet of the world, and being of the
world are vnder the regiment and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Satan: vnder Christs protection
they are not, for he prayeth not for the
world, Iohn 17. 9. This should be a caueat
to all those, who, some of contempt, some
of negligence, care not for the knowledge
of God or his word. Ambrose well saith,

Christ first knoweth, and by him and from

to his church is the fountaine and author
of all spirituall knowledge.</p>
            <p>1. No man hath seene God at any time, the
onely begotten sonne, which is in the bosome
of the father, he hath declared him. <hi>Iohn
1.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>2. Nicodemus til he came to Christ, was
ignorant of the first principles of Christian
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he knew not what it was to be born
again, Iohn 3. The holy Apostle could not
find out true knowledge at the feete of
Gamaliel, nor in the sect of the Pharises:
he was taught the Gospell by no other
meanes, but by the reuelation of Iesus
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2900:101"/>
Christ, Galat. 1. 12. neither had Zacheus
euer be come the child of Abraham, if he
had not come downe from the figge tree
and followed Christ, Luke 19.</p>
            <p>3. So that as the Israelites could neuer
haue found out the way to the promised
land, through the vast and vnknowne
wildernesse, vnlesse Christ had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them in a cloudie piller by day, and
a fiery piller by night: and like as Moses
could neuer haue described the forme and
fashion of the tabernacle, if the Lord had
not first shewed it him in the mount: so as
impossible it is, without Christs direction
in his word, to find out the way to eternal
life. He is therefore that oliue tree, that
doth conuey into the candlesticke of the
church, that oile and fatnesse, whereby the
light thereof is cherished and preserued,
Zach. 4.</p>
            <p>4. For none in heauen or in earth was
found worthy to open the book of Gods
secrets, and to looke thereon, but onely
the lambe, Reu. 5. 3. 9. The booke had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
sealed still, if Christ had not taken
the booke out of the right hand of him
that sate vpon the throne, and opened the
seales thereof.</p>
            <p>5. First then their blind endeuor is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2900:102"/>
which by the light of nature
thinke to find out the truth. The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
among the heathen,<note place="margin">A vaine labor to seeke for true wisdome without Christ.</note> and wise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Gentiles, much busied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to find out the truth, but they labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in vaine. The three wise-men that
came from the East, did not content them
selues with their humane wisedome and
natural experience, but followed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the starre to seeke for Christ. If
Saul must haue a prophet to tell him what
was become of his fathers asses; to find
out heauen, hath much more need of a
propheticall light.</p>
            <p>Secondly, all carnal and secure persons
are admonished, that if they desire know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
they should seek it at Christs hands
in his word: it is no maruell that so many
yet continue in ignorance, seeing they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the meanes of knowledge. Heauen
cannot be scaled without Iacobs ladder,
the top whereof resteth vpon Christ, <hi>Gen.

               <hi>And I haue declared vnto them

thy name, and will declare it.]</hi> Here our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior
promiseth the perpetuall assistance of
his spirit, and continuall declaration of his
word to his church,<note place="margin">God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue his Church desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of his word.</note> that as he had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and declared it, so he would still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
his seruants, &amp; not leaue his church
destitute of the ministerie of his word.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Thus the Lord promiseth by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:</hi>
I will make my couenant with them,
saith the Lord, my spirit that is vpon thee, &amp;
the words which I haue put in thy mouth shal
not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the
mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of
the seed of thy seed (saith the Lord) from
henceforth, euen for euer. <hi>Isay</hi> 59. 21.</p>
            <p>2. Thus our Sauiour leauing the world,
ordained his Apostles in his stead, to be
witnesses of him to the ends of the world.
Act. 1. 8. The Apostles also constituted E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists,
as Timothy, 2. Tim. 1. 6. To se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
their work, the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelists ordained
Bishops, Pastors and Elders in euery citie
Tit. 1. 5. to finish the work of the Gospell.</p>
            <p>3. For like as it is not enough to sow the
corne, and cast it into the earth, but it must
haue both the first and latter raine, Ioel 2.
23. so it is necessary that Apostles &amp; other
succeeding Ministers, should water that
which Paul and the other Apostles had
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2900:103"/>
planted, 1. Cor. 3. 6. And like as after the
house is builded, it must be continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
lest through the idlenesse of the
hands the house drop through, Eccl. 10. 18.
so after the foundation laid, and building
finished by Christ and his Apostles the
chiefe builders, others must be raised vp
to repaire the ruines of Gods house.</p>
            <p>4. Therefore as Saint Paul saith, Christ
gaue some to be Apostles, some Prophets,
some Euangelists, some Pastors and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
<hi>for the gathering together of the saints
the work of the ministery, the edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
body of Christ,</hi> Eph. 4. 11. So that al these of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
are necessary, Prophets to assist, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Euangelists to second Prophets,
Pastors and teachers to succeed Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
that all the Saints in all ages may be
gathered together, and the whole body of
Christ edified.</p>
            <p>5. How much then are we to giue
thankes vnto God, for this his prouident
care ouer his church, neuer leauing the
same destitute of his word, which we see
to the praise of God this day: for God
hath furnished this Church of England
with such abundance of learned pastors,
as I thinke few churches in the world may
compare with it. So that as Elias ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2900:103"/>
left his spirit doubled vpon Elisha:
as Ambrose well noteth,<note place="margin">Ambros. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 60.</note> 
               <hi>O haereditas pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciosa,
in qua plus haeredi relinquitur, quàm
habetur: mirum in modum plus Helias gratiae
dimisit in terris, quam secum portauit ad coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los:
A precious inheritance, wherein more is
left to the heire, then was first had; Elias lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
more grace in earth, then he caried to
heauen:</hi> so I doubt not but many faithfull
seruants of God departed this life, haue
transmitted their spirit and giftes double
vpon their posteritie. Seeing Christ then
hath such care to instruct his flocke, as he
hath declared his word, so doth yet and
will further declare: let no man despise
this so great riches, but profit more and
more by the ministerie of the word, that
the oftener it is declared, the greater may
be our increase in faith: that as Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are doubled vpon our teachers, so they
may be multiplied also vpon the hearers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the loue wherewith thou hast loued
them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. 4.</note> 
               <hi>may be in them:</hi> that is, they may haue
a liuely sense &amp; feeling of the loue of God:<note place="margin">Knowledge without sense and feeling fruitlesse.</note>
that as they abound in knowledge, so they
may also be quickned in the liuely feeling
and apprehension of it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>This is that which the Apostle saith:</hi>
That ye may be able to comprehend with all
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2900:104"/>
Saints, what is the breadth, length, depth and
height<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to know the loue of Christ which
passeth knowledge. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 18. 19.</p>
            <p>2 Such sense of the loue of Christ the
Apostle Paul had, who thus in particular
professeth of himselfe: <hi>Christ loued me, and
gaue himselfe for me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. Thus also
the prophet Dauid spake from his inward
feeling of Gods goodnesse toward him:
<hi>how deare are thy thoghts toward me, ô God,
how great is the sum of them! Psal.</hi> 132. 17.</p>
            <p>3. Like as Iob saith, <hi>I haue heard of thee
by the hearing of the eare, but now mine eye
seeth thee.</hi> Iob 42. 5. so they which haue
only a speculatiue knowledge of God, do
heare as with the eare; but they that haue
an inward feeling and experience of his
loue, do see him with the eye: this the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Dauid calleth, the tast of the soule:
<hi>Tast ye and see how gracious the Lord is, Psa.
34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 8. Like as Manna, though pleasant to
the sight, yet was more pleasant to the tast:
so is the mercie and loue of God more
ioyous felt and comprehended, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
onely and apprehended.</p>
            <p>4 For we are commanded to loue God
with all the heart, soule and mind, Mat. 22.
37. God must not only haue our mind and
vnderstanding, but our heart and affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2900:104"/>
we do not otherwise honour God with
all our strength.</p>
            <p>5 Hence then we are taught a most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessarie
point of Christian doctrine, that
we should labour to our knowledge to ad
affection, to our iudgement zeale, to our
vnderstanding co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science &amp; feeling. Many
seeme to know much, but there is withall
a coldnesse in their heart.<note place="margin">We must not onley vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the word but ioy in it.</note> Happy it is with
those, that when they heare the word, do
not onely conceiue and vnderstand it as
Herode did, Marke. 6. 20. but their hearts
are inflamed, as the two Disciples, while
Christ preached vnto them, found their
hearts burne within them, Luke 24. The
Prophet Dauid saith: <hi>O how I loue thy law!</hi>
Psal. 119. 97.<note place="margin">Serm. 20. in Psal. 119.</note> whereof Ambrose well saith;
<hi>Diligere amplius est, quàm custodire, hoc ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitatis

obedience to God should proceede from
a willing affection and louing heart. That
as God delighteth in the faithfull, <hi>My
delight is with the children of men.</hi> Pro. 8. 31
so our delight may be in God, that we
may say with the prophet, <hi>The desire of
our soule is to thy name, and to the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:2900:105"/>
