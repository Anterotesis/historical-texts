         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>deceitfull-workers,</hi>
transforming themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt) <hi>That it was no
marvail, for, Satan, himſelfe</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>is transformed into an Angel
of light.</hi> And indeed there is very great politick reaſon hereof; for,
ſhould not <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> firſt, put-on that brave <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodred-cloke</hi>
of <hi>ſeeming holineſſe,</hi> to <hi>dazle</hi> the eyes and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their honeſt, innocent <hi>Proſelites</hi> (as I believe many of theſe to
be) Who I pray that had any light and ſight of reaſon and Religion,
would ſo eaſily have received their ſo dangerous <hi>Opinions,</hi> or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<hi>Doctrines?</hi> If <hi>Satan</hi> ſhould at firſt ſhew his <hi>cloven-foot,</hi> and
the <hi>hornes</hi> on his head (as <hi>fools,</hi> formerly, were made to believe the
Devill had ſuch,<note place="margin">Mark this, ô all yee honeſt and plain hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that are apt to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</note> to be frighted by them) who, I ſay, would not, then
fly from him, as, eaſily diſcerning him to be a Devill? So, I ſay, if
Heretical, Erronious, &amp; Schiſmatical <hi>Deceivers</hi> ſhould at the very firſt
ſhew the <hi>inſide-danger</hi> &amp; <hi>poyſon</hi> of their aymes, plots, ſelf-intereſts and
deſignes intended by their <hi>Hereſies, errours,</hi> and <hi>Schiſmes,</hi> who would
ſo eaſily and inſtantly entertain them, and be ſo miſled and abuſed
by them? Therefore, dear Chriſtians take heed, for Gods ſake, of
being taken with <hi>painted pretences</hi> of <hi>holineſſe</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> in any man
whatſoever he be: ſwallow not down, ſo eaſily, ſuch <hi>gilded-pils;</hi>
or catching <hi>fiſh-hooks,</hi> which are onely covered-over with <hi>deceitfull

&amp; ſhew how neer they come-up to down-right Deceivers in their

And, here, give me leave, good Reader, in the firſt place for the better
making fair way, and that, moſt briefly, for what follows) to give
unto Thee, and from <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelfe, The perfect <hi>Character, Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance</hi>
and <hi>Deſcription</hi> of a truly <hi>Godly-man,</hi> a ſure, pure <hi>Saint,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and ſacred <hi>Citizen</hi> of the <hi>New-Jeruſalem;</hi> eſpecially, in theſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113660:9"/>
two or three remarkable marks of him among divers others,<note place="margin">The certain Characters of a truly Godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> 
               <hi>viz.
Hee is ſuch an One as ſpeaks the Truth from his heart; And having

prejudice;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 15. 24, 4.</note> Both <hi>Theſe</hi> being fully and fairly connected and bound

Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 12.</note> doe yee even ſo
unto them: And then alſo, doe but conſider herewith, what the Spirit

our <hi>Independents</hi> be found (and that by teſtimonies under <hi>their own
hands</hi>) to be <hi>ſuch as ſpeak not the Truth from their hearts; and when
they have promiſed and covenanted, break their promiſe and violate

livelihood, or eſtates, ſave only (perhaps) to their ungodly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

content ſhould be done to themſelves:</hi> Then can any truly-gracious or
impartiall Good-man chooſe but, at leaſt, greatly feare that they are
not ſo <hi>holy-Saints</hi> &amp; godly men as they ſhould be, or as the World too
vulgarly and eaſily takes them to be? Truly, me thinks, they cannot.</p>
            <p>Thus, then, now, to come to the <hi>try all hereof;</hi> And, here, I will,
by way of <hi>preamble,</hi> tell the Reader one pretty paſſage, not altogether
impertinent to our preſent purpoſe, touching Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> &amp; <hi>my-ſelf,</hi>
which briefly was this, I being occaſionally (about-half-ayeer ſince)
at <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A pretty paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing M. <hi>Peters.</hi>
               </note> was there encountred by Maſter <hi>Peters,</hi> that moſt

this by the way, That, <hi>Whoſoever loves to laugh at a Sermon (which

ſeeing me ſingly walking in the <hi>Hall,</hi> and being my old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
came unto me, together with his <hi>Independent Brother,</hi>
Maſter <hi>Bachiler,</hi> who heard our conference all the while, which was
this. O, Maſter <hi>Vicars</hi> (ſays Maſter <hi>Peters</hi>) certainly, a great deal
of repentance muſt needs lye upon your ſoule. Why, Maſter <hi>Peters</hi>
(ſaid I) what's the matter, what have I done? O (ſayes he) in ſadding
and grieving the hearts of Gods Saints, as you have done in your
Book, which you call the <hi>Picture of Independency.</hi> Why Sir, (ſaid I)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113660:10"/>
pray tell me what's amiſs in it? Truly Maſter <hi>Vicars</hi> (ſays hee) 'tis
naught all over, (<hi>juſt, like my ſelf, he might have added</hi>) Naught all
over. Is it naught all over, Maſter <hi>Peters,</hi> ſaid I? then, I hope you
have read it all over; and if ſo; then, I beſeech you ſaid I) ſince, you
know, <hi>Doloſus verſatur in generalibus,</hi> The Deceiver loves to deale
in Generals, ſhew ſo much candor and ingenuity toward me, as to
tell me one particular paſſage therein, which you can make evident
to be falſe or naught, and I aſſure you (ſaid I) I will yeeld you all the
reſt to be naught without any farther controverſie; whereunto, here
was all his reply; Alas, Maſter <hi>Vicars</hi> 'tis naught all over, naught
all over; which words he uttering in his old, quick bluſtering man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
inſtantly ran away ſwiftly from me, All, which, his brother <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiler</hi>
can teſtifie (if he will ſpeake the truth) to be moſt true, who
ſtood by, and heard and ſaw all I have related, from the firſt to the

fit to finde fault with other mens <hi>Works,</hi> and then <hi>run away,</hi> when
he ſhould give account of his <hi>ſlanderous words?</hi> But, now, to come
to ſome more ſerious and ſollid matter, and fully to make good and
confirme what I have promiſed and affirmed, in the Frontiſpice of
this Treatiſe, namely, That <hi>Independents</hi> (I meane very many of
the <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>braveſt</hi> of them) are a <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>notorious Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers,</hi>

them; but in regard of their ſo <hi>elated</hi> and <hi>ſelfe-flated conceit</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and others too-too high <hi>opinions</hi> of them; and alſo the great
injurie which Gods Cauſe receives thereby, many ways, <hi>Therefore,
for Sions ſake I cannot hold my peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſaiah 62. 1.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; for Jeruſalems ſake I will not
reſt, until the righteouſnes thereof</hi> (and the unqueſtionable innocency &amp;
integrity of her <hi>Presbyterians) go forth as Brightneſſe.</hi> And for this end
to add my poor <hi>Mite of Zeal</hi> (what in me is) to help to vindicate

who have made their great and groſs untruths as ſo many <hi>Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall

I willingly pretermit, and will not ſo much as mention, as, indeed, I
need not, they being ſo notoriouſly known (or may be known) abroad

the learned <hi>Antapologie,</hi> p. 220, 221, &amp;c. very worthy the reading for

let all men ſee (that will not obſtinately ſhut their eyes againſt ſuch

            <p>About the beginning of the ſecond yeer of the ſitting of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
The <hi>Preſbyterian Paſtors,</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Independents,</hi> met
together, at reverend and religious Maſter <hi>Calamies</hi> Houſe in Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manbury,
where, with mutuall conſent, they all entred into an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113660:13"/>
one party to the other,<note place="margin">A notable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of fallacy, in the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Mr. <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>p Nye,</hi> one of their grand Politicians.</note> That (for advancing of the publike <hi>Cauſe</hi>
of a happy Reformation) neyther ſide ſhould Preach, Print, or Diſpute,
or otherwiſe act againſt others way; And this to continue til both ſides,
in a full meeting, did declare the contrary, and by mutuall conſent ſet
each other at liberty, touching theſe things. And for the confirmation
of this agreement, a Writing or Inſtrument was drawn, with full and
cleer deſire and aſſent of all, and alſo by all, there and then preſent, it
was ſubſcribed with every mans name; And, this ſo done, was with
a generall conſent to be left, and ſo to abide, with Maſter <hi>Calamy,</hi> at his
Houſe, there to be ſeen at any time, by any of them that would have
recourſe unto it, to ſhew and ſee their agreement, all which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
done, and this Writing or Inſtrument was left in Maſter
<hi>Calamies</hi> cuſtody. Heere, now, let me hint this to the Reader, by the
way; That, notwithſtanding this Writing or Inſtrument of this
their ſo ſolemne agreement; no, nor their own fore-mentioned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
of their own voluntary forbearance, ſo deeply (but deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully)
profeſſed and proteſted, in their <hi>Apologie,</hi> to be ſo ſacred unto
them, &amp; to be kept ſo ſtrictly by them, with ſuch deep ſilence (for, theſe
are their very words) All theſe, I ſay, notwithſtanding, they, in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim,
immediatly after,<note place="margin">A remarkable diſcovery of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubtilty &amp; Double-deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> went on, in a too evident co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary practice, as hath
bin before ſufficiently declared; and all theſe their Proteſtations proved
the moſt advantageous Piece of Policy, on their ſide, of any one that
was, or could be done by them for the increaſing of a Party for them.
Juſt like the Declarations ſet forth by King CHARLES (by means
of the crafty <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in their late flouriſhing and domineering times)
that their ſhould be no Diſputes, no Preaching or Printing on either
ſide, for or againſt the <hi>Arminian</hi>-points, which then were in great
controverſie: Which Declarations and Inhibitions, being obſerved
by many Miniſters, but not ſo, by the <hi>Arminian-faction,</hi> was a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
means to increaſe them, and to ſuppreſſe <hi>Orthodox-Doctrines.</hi> Even
ſo, I ſay, it fell out, heer, for, by this means of the <hi>Agreement,</hi> nothing
was Preached or Printed, or any way acted againſt their way, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the foreſaid agreement to hinder the growth of <hi>Independents,</hi> on
our ſide, Ours making conſcience moſt honeſtly and tenderly of their
engagement. But, in the mean time, I ſay, many things were both
Preached and Printed for it, as I have touched before; which, if it
were not apparent unfaithfulneſſe and plain Double-dealing, I know
not what is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:113660:13"/>
But now to come to this notable trick of theirs, acted by Maſter
<hi>Philip Nye,</hi> that notable <hi>Independent-Politician,</hi> and <hi>nimble-Agent</hi>
for their <hi>Schiſmaticall Church-way,</hi> which was this. The fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Writing or Inſtrument of the mutuall Agreement between the
<hi>Preſbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> parties, being as aforeſaid, left in the
hands of reverend Maſter <hi>Calamy,</hi> by him to be kept and ſhewn and
ſeen as occaſion was offered;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably coozens Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> of the Writing or Inſtrument that tyed the Independents to be honeſt.</note> It ſo fell out, that Maſter <hi>Nye</hi> came, one
day, to Maſter <hi>Calamy,</hi> and pretended ſome reaſons for his deſire to
ſee and borrow this Writing of him for a little while; whereupon,
good Maſter <hi>Calamie,</hi> in his courteſie and ſingleneſſe of heart, ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
nothing amiſſe, but thinking he meant fairly, and would bring
it again preſently, as he had promiſed, let him have it. But he, after
he had it, carried it away with him into <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> that ſo upon any
complaints of the breach of the <hi>agreement</hi> when ours ſhould have
conſulted with that writing, or ſhewn it againſt them, and brought
their own hands ſubſcribed thereunto, the <hi>Writing</hi> was gone, and
nothing now to ſhew againſt them; As for <hi>conſcience,</hi> they (as it
ſeem'd) car'd not a ruſh for it (no marvell, then, that they ſo cry out
and plead for (<hi>Liberty of conſcience</hi>) for, this Maſter <hi>Nye</hi> hath ever
ſince kept away this <hi>Writing,</hi> and having been often intreated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
it, his anſwer ſtill hath been, that hee left it at <hi>Hull</hi> among his
other papers. This Truth, is alſo fully related by reverend and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Maſter <hi>Edwards,</hi> in his learned and moſt excellent <hi>Independent
frighting Antapologie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Antapol. p. 243</note> and is backt alſo by the unqueſtionable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

And are not theſe, then (my deare <hi>Preſbyterian friends</hi>) moſt

            <p>But to goe on, and to make their unfaithfull dealings, yet more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
and apparent to the whole world, and that, ſtill, even under

much freſh importunity, even almoſt beyond the bounds of modeſty,
they being thus urged, as it were, on all ſides and not knowing how,

<hi>M. Goodwin,</hi> and the reſt? Alas, for the Parliament to take upon it
the ordering of Church Government, or Church diſcipline, O this
was a moſt high and intollerable preſumption in them, this was a
moſt bold intrenching upon Chriſts royall prerogative, with many
ſuch like terrible taxations, and heavy imputations of wrongfull uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
an Antichriſtian Legiſlative power and authority over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences

in this Nation</hi> (there's a juggle) <hi>I am certain, it belongeth only to
the Parliament to iudge what is agreeable to the Word of God, and

now? muſt the Parliament only be judge in matters of Religion?
Whereas, heretofore, neither Parliament, nor Aſſembly (by our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries
familiar <hi>ſentence</hi>) had any ſuch power. Nay, ſee how hee goes
on. <hi>And God</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>hath bleſſed all their undertakings, in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull

Sophiſtrie divide you from them, be not importunate with
them for Church-Government, but leave it to their wiſdoms
to meaſure-out unto the Clergie, what may be for the quiet and
profit of the people.</hi> See here now how the caſe is altered with this
<hi>Independent;</hi> now, all muſt be left to the State, to the wiſdome of the

moſt audaciouſly and ſediciouſly to make a rent and diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

obſerve them watchfully, and truſt them accordingly, and let
not any of theſe eſtrange you from that your faithfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113660:18"/>
and religious Maſter <hi>Faucet,</hi> who being a ſickly Gentleman, and
finding hee could not have his health well in the City, contracted
with Doctor <hi>Homes</hi> about exchange of their livings, the one for the
City, the other for the Country in caſe of conſent of the Inhabitants
of each place.<note place="margin">An Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent jugling trick play'd by Doctor <hi>Homes</hi> with his Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioners.</note> Maſter <hi>Faucets</hi> Pariſhioners out of their good reſpect
and love to him, and for his deſired accommodation, conſented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and the rather alſo, as knowing the Doctor to be a man of able
parts, and perſwaded he would live lovingly, and deale honeſtly and
conſcienciouſly with them, as a godly and faithfull Paſtor ought
with his own people. After which conſent the Doctor procured a
preſentation from the (then) Lord Keeper to the Biſhop, and the
next thing to be done was to have an induction from the Biſhop, but
there the Doctor made a ſtand, and deſired conference with the pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioners
about it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom he declared the tendernes of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience,
and that he could not digeſt ſuch an Induction, he holding it Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian,
and yet without which he could not have the living, as the
caſe then ſtood. Whereupon the Pariſhioners having very good
thoughts of the Doctor in thoſe dayes, and hoping for much good
by his Miniſtry amongſt them, were all of them willing to accept of
him for their Paſtor, though he was not (as the manner then was)
legally poſſeſt of the living provided, that the Doctor ſhould enter
into bond to ſave the pariſh harmeleſſe from the next Incumbent, for
delapidations or any thing elſe that might befall them in that reſpect
of the living, he not being proper Incumbent. To this the Doctor
conſented, ſeald the Pariſh a Bond, for the purpoſes aforeſaid, and ſo
the Pariſhioners thought all was well between them, and thus it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſome few moneths, the Doctor conſtantly preaching and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiating
in his Miniſtry amongſt them; But now at laſt, the Doctor
began to flag, and to be diſcontented, and would neither preach, nor
doe ought elſe among his people as their Miniſter, or but very ſeldom
and diſcontentedly, and told the pariſhioners hee was troubled in
minde, and bound in his Spirit, and could not goe on comfortably
with them, and deſired therefore a conference with them All together,
whereupon a meeting there was, and he then declared to them that
he was much troubled in minde by reaſon of his engagement, and
that it was a grèat hinderance to his ſtudies, and to his other content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and that he could not goe on in preaching to them, till his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113660:19"/>
was taken off from him, making this a great Argument
therein, namely, that he had a wife, and that if God ſhould take
him away from her, his wife would then beliable to make good what
he was bound to, but, that ſhe was utterly unfit to deal in buſineſſes
of ſuch a nature, and therefore, I ſay, he deſired he might have in his
bond again, or elſe he could not goe on comfortably in his Miniſtry,
And that if they would thus far favour and reſpect him, they ſhould ſee
how highly he ſhould value their love therein, and how he would ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and ſtrive to deſerve it of them, bidding them truſt him upon his
word and promiſe, which accordingly they moſt freely and lovingly
did, and gave him in the bond preſently, and ever ſince that, they have
paid ſoundly for it, for very ſhortly after hee began boldly to play
reexs, to ſtand upon termes on tiptoe, as it were, with his Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
gathered an Independent congregation, excluding all his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
loving Pariſhioners from Chriſtian Communion in their own
Pariſh Church, except they would enter into a Covenant with him,
to walke according to his rule, which they not willing to yeeld unto
he having got the keyes of the Church from their clerke, keeps all the
Pariſhioners out, and will not adminiſter the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper to any of them, not baptize any of their children, nor doe
any act of a Miniſter or Paſtor to his people, ſave what he would
doe to a very Turke or Pagan, unleſſe they will dance after his Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
pipe; And thus now the Pariſhioners wander as ſheepe
without a ſheepherd, glad to run into others paſtures, and this they
have gotten by truſting to a grave Independents bare promiſe. And
are not now the Prophets words before recited, here too truly verified
and confirmed? The truth of all which though not extant in print
under the Doctors own hands (as for ſhame is not like to be) yet I

Away, then, with this notorious deceitfull trick of <hi>New-Lights</hi> (for

tell them of their unfaithfull dealing, and down right deceiving, by

take notice, good Reader, by way of reply hereunto in generall, that
Maſter <hi>Iohn Goodwin</hi> confeſſes, there is a <hi>Retrimentitious</hi> or <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall-Partie</hi>
among his <hi>Saints.</hi>

of their foul impieties, but ſins of infirmity. But more particularly
to the firſt, I briefly anſwer, That as I have ſufficiently made it clear,
all along in this Treatiſe,<note place="margin">Not only the Retrimentiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous-party, but the graveſt Grandees of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent-party.</note> they are not onely the <hi>Retrimentitious-Partie</hi>
of their <hi>Independent Saints,</hi> that deale thus dangerouſly and deceitfully

and ſuch foul and frequent facts of impiety (as they are too juſtly tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and <hi>conſcience-wounding abominations?</hi> For my part I conceive (under
correction) <hi>ſins of infirmity</hi> are ſuch as are committed either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly,
or if knowingly, yet) fearfully, and with much <hi>reluctation</hi> of
ſpirit, ſeldom, and that with much vehement repentance and godly
ſorrow after conviction, with purpoſe and bent of heart (by Gods
grace) to be more watch full againſt them for the future, and ſuch
like.<note place="margin">Ragining ſins briefly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> As for <hi>Reigning-ſins,</hi> I conceive them to be, ſins committed or

tell you my ſtrong fears, that, in regard of the <hi>premiſes,</hi> I cannot but
greatly ſuſpect and doubt, in the latter capacity (I ſay, very many of
them) ſo proud, ſo pragmaticall, ſo inſolent and obſtinate are they in
a moſt ungrounded defence of their evils and errours; And <hi>on theſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113660:23"/>
grounds,</hi> I muſt confeſſe I cannot judge more tenderly of them. And
again,<note place="margin">No errour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſmall ſin.</note> I ſay, in yet more full anſwer to this <hi>Objection;</hi> How dare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them call or account any the (ſeeming) <hi>leaſt of their Errours,
ſmall-ſins</hi> or <hi>no-ſins,</hi> being againſt the eternall truth, of our moſt pure <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>3</label>
and holy God? And whereas in the laſt place they cry out againſt
us,<note place="margin">The Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents tax the Presbyterians with piety for writing againſt their errours openly.</note> and tax us, not onely of want of charity, but aſperſe us with plain
impiety, for urging againſt them, and accuſing them openly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print,
of their foul offences, and openly taught and maintained dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Errours, Schiſmes, and Enormities, and of their damnable
Doctrines and Opinions: I ſay, and will avouch and maintain it, That
our work and way herein, is both holy, honeſt, and warrantable from
the word it ſelf; And particularly from that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Who <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label>
himſelfe tels us, that, <hi>When</hi> Peter (<hi>who at that time ſeemed a Pillar
of Gods houſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Galat. 2. 11. Ibid. 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>the Church) did that which was worthy of blame, and
that, openly, to the prejudice and ſo and all of Gods people and Cauſe:
This bleſſed Apoſtle, I ſay, tels us, That he withſtood</hi> Peter <hi>and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
him, even to his face for his diſſimulation, and for being a means
(thereby to enſnare</hi> Barnabas <hi>alſo into the ſame foule fault with him;</hi>
Even the very ſame, whereof I now here complain in our <hi>Independents</hi>
and their Schiſmaticall brethren, namely, <hi>Diſſimulation</hi> or <hi>Double-dealing.</hi>
Yea,<note place="margin">Titus 1. 13.</note> and (as the ſame bleſſed, wiſe, and holy Apoſtle ſaid)
<hi>They are moſt worthy to be even moſt ſharply rebuked, and alſo openly,</hi>
in regard they have <hi>offended</hi> and <hi>diſſembled ſo openly,</hi> even in print,
therefore are, I ſay, to be reproved in paint, whereas, indeed, had they
offended but in private, God forbid, but we ſhould tenderly have
dealt in private with them. And this indeed hath been a main ground
of the quarrell between reverend Maſter <hi>Edwards,</hi> and his <hi>Independent
Antagoniſts,</hi> who have moſt injuriouſly abuſed him with ſlanders,
onely, or mainly for his zealous oppoſing, and ſharpe reproving the
open Errours, Schiſmes, aud ſcandalous miſcarriages of theſe men,
who can be content to diſhonour God and his Truth, but cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to be taxt and told of it, though the Apoſtle tels them they are
worthy to be blamed for it, and therefore in this reſpect, though
(according to that old Axiome, <hi>Amicus</hi> Socrates, <hi>amicus</hi> Plato, <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic
tamen amica veritas,</hi> though ſuch an one is my friend, and ſuch
an one is my old acquaintance and friend, yet, by Gods grace, Truth
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:113660:24"/>
is and ſhall be my beſt friend, yea, and I ſay as my bleſſed Lord and
Maſter <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Iohn 18 37.</note> 
               <hi>To this end was I born, and for this cauſe
came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſſe (with the reſt of Gods

the Truth with all holineſſe, godly zeal, courage and impartiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
againſt whomſoever, in this caſe neither regarding the favours or

was the main end of my creation. But to conclude and ſhut up all
I have now to ſay, it is moſt probable that our <hi>Independents,</hi> and the

<label type="milestone">

while I have but pleaſed my ſelfe, in beating the ayre, and ſhooting at
rovers, being wide of the marke and much miſtaken, in all that I have
taxed and accuſed them with all, for none of them are at all perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or convinced in their conſciences, that any of thoſe which Maſter
<hi>Edwards,</hi> or <hi>I,</hi> call <hi>Errours</hi> or <hi>Schiſmes,</hi> are <hi>Schiſmes</hi> or <hi>ſins,</hi> but (as

I Anſwer, with ſorrow of ſoule for their ſakes, I eaſily, indeed,

               <note place="margin">Acts 19. 25.</note> And

            <p>A Certain friend of mine, an honeſt religious man hath
given me notice, that certain perſons doe finde fault
with the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> eſtabliſhed in our <hi>Church;</hi>
In which, the <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> are ſubject to the <hi>Colloquies,</hi> and
the <hi>Colloquies</hi> to the <hi>Provinciall Synod;</hi> and the <hi>Provinciall</hi>
to the <hi>Nationall Synod.</hi> And their deſire is to have every
particular <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> or <hi>Congregation</hi> of one and the ſame
<hi>abſolute authority, independent</hi> from any <hi>Superiour authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
or Aſſembly whatſoever. Upon which, my ſaid friend
earneſtly deſired to have my opinion or judgement on the
matter; which, being of ſuch a nature and importance, I
could not any way decline, or deny his requeſt, which, I
have here ſet down, and is as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:113660:25"/>
I ſay, that thoſe which propound this opinion ought in no manner
or wiſe to be hearkened unto; For if in caſe this their opinion were
followed, there could nothing elſe enſue but the certain ruine of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and an extreme <hi>confuſion,</hi> for the ſeverall reaſons, heer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It happeneth often times, that two Miniſters of one Pariſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
or Congregation, fall our and are at variance, and thereupon they
ſeparate and divide the Congregation into two factions, in ſuch an
occaſion of neceſſity, there muſt needs be the helpe of a Superiour Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Church or Congregation hath but one Miniſter,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and he leads an ungodly life, to the ſcandall of the Church, and the
Conſiſtory of that Congregation cenſureth him, all being of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
or if it happen that the ſaid Conſiſtory be divided, and of two
opinions, there can be (ſurely) in ſuch a caſe, no remedy, but by a
ſuperiour Power and Authority of <hi>Colloquies</hi> or <hi>Synods,</hi> who have
power to depoſe and appoint ſuch Miniſters (or ſuch a Miniſter) if
there be but one) as they ſhall think fit, and they or he deſiring to be
depoſeth? Who ſhall depoſe him, the <hi>Elders</hi> onely of the <hi>Conſiſtory,</hi>
or the whole Congregation or Aſſembly? Shall they give ſentence
againſt them or him?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If any one of the Congregation bee unjuſtly ſuſpended <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
from the holy Communion or abſolutely excommunicated, unto whom
ſhall he direct himſelfe to be re-admitted to the Congregation; or to
whom ſhall be direct his complaint, if ſo be the Conſiſtory who have
unjuſtly ſuſpended or excommunicated him, have an abſolute autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to themſelves without dependencie upon any other?</p>
            <p>If any new <hi>Hereſies</hi> happen to be raiſed in any Church, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
ſome Miniſters and Congregations become infected therewith, what
remedy is there to avoid this great evill, but by a Synod, who may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
and depoſe the obſtinate Miniſter or partie who infecteth the
Church? Had not the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> remedied this evill, the Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſme
was ſpreading it ſelfe over that whole Countrey, and had
unavoidably prevailed. For in caſe that every Conſiſtory or Pariſh
had been abſolute of themſelves and <hi>Independent,</hi> they might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
the reſolution of the ſaid Synod, alleadging that they were not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:113660:26"/>
ſubject to Synods, but had an abſolute authority within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> It is the chiefe and peculiar work of Synods, which they always
firſt take in hand, to heare the complaint of particular Churches, and
to judge of appeals: If theſe be taken away from the Synods, they
need no more to meet, for they have nothing to doe: For to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſhould they pronounce their judgements, if they might govern
according to their own mindes, as if every pariſh were made a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Soveraignty which would be an Order, which was never pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
nor uſed in any place ſince the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> There are many ſmall Pariſhes in the Countrey, where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory
is compoſed of one Miniſter (of none of the greateſt capacity)
and of foure or five countrey-men, or clowns, who are Elders of that
Church: And ſhall to ſuch a Church be given ſuch an abſolute Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
authority? And if their Miniſter happen to die, will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
thoſe clowns ſitting to judge of the capacity of a new Miniſter,
to give him the impoſition of hands, or to order in this caſe what ever
may be needfull?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> If upon occaſion of wars or diſtractions in the Kingdom, it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to keepe a day of faſting and humiliation, through all the
Churches in the Kingdom, who ſhall ordain this faſt, or who ſhall
appoint the day of celebration thereof?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> If it be neceſſary to remonſtrate to the Kings Majeſtie, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint

ſhall preſent the Petition of the Churches of the whole Kingdom?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> If upon any occaſion it be found needfull to alter any thing in the
Diſcipline of the Church in generall, and to make any new neceſſary
Orders in the ſame, to be obſerved generally, can this be done by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Conſiſtories being Independent, and who are not ſubject to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
generall Ordinance? In brief, It ought to be believed that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie
of particular Churches to ſuperiour powers, is that which
maintains the union of the Church, and this being taken away, there
would remain no more correſpondencie, but a wilfull and wofull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
would ſoon appear.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> No man ought to be judge in his own cauſe. But if there happen
a contention between two Churches (as it happeneth too often)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:113660:26"/>
neither of theſe two Churches can be judge in their own cauſe, and of
neceſſity there muſt be reliefe by a ſuperiour authority, elſe all will be
naught between them,</p>
            <p>I will not believe (though I confeſſe there is cauſe of jealouſie) that
thoſe that deſire this Independencie have any intelligence with the
enemie, and that thereby they ſeeke (under pretence of Reformation)
to bring us into a confuſion, or at leaſt to expoſe us to the laughter of
our enemies, though, I ſay, I fear this, by many Symptomes thereof,
I rather will (in charity) believe they err through want of experience,
and knowledge of what is profitable for the Church of God.</p>
            <p>The end of every good Chriſtian and Common-wealths man, is to
glorifie God in maintaining his true Religion, to ſerve the King in the
preſervation of his royall perſon and dignity, and to procure the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good in maintaining juſtice, and liberty of the Subject and
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>All theſe (though three branches) ariſe and ſpring from one root,
and have the ſame eſſenſe and being: But it is impoſſible that any
man ſhould truly affect the King or Common-wealth that is ſlight
and negligent in Religion, nor can any man fully diſcharge his duty
to God, that is not carefull of King and Common-wealth,</p>
            <p>See then ô Independents, by this foreſaid ſolid judgement, how
feeble and falſe, yea, how dangerous and deſtructive your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Church-way is. The Lord open your eyes to ſee
it, and give you hearts affected with much ſorrow for your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie
in it, and in his good time, graciouſly convert you from
it, to embrace Peace and Truth with your Presbyterian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
thus prayes.</p>
