         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to reſolve on; but we need not wonder at
ſo great an Obſcurity, if we conſider that
the Firſt Inhabitants of Countries had other
Cares to employ their Thoughts, than to
deliver their Beginnings to Poſterity; and
poſſibly had they been never ſo willing ſo
to do, they could not have effected it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Monopolized that little Learning they had

to confeſs, That no certain account can
be given of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was 25 Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Olympiads, and but <hi>752 Ante Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum,</hi>
till the <hi>Regiſugium,</hi> which was
268 Years <hi>Ante Chriſtum</hi> 384.</p>
            <p>A fair account then we are like to expect
concerning the firſt riſe of our own Nation,
after ſo many revolutions of Ages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Truth ſeems, as it were, more and more
to have withdrawn her ſelf from us; which
to trace out, we muſt again return to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> who are the beſt able to ſatisfy us
in this caſe,</p>
            <p>This is moſt certain, that the account of
Times before the <hi>Romans,</hi> either in <hi>Italy,
Germany, Old Gallia,</hi> or <hi>Brittain,</hi> is ſcarce ſit
to be diſcourſed of under any other Head,
than that of Impoſtures; not that I think
that theſe Nations had lain in a perpetual
ſleep till the <hi>Romans</hi> rous'd them with their
Swords, and waken'd them, as I may ſay,
into ſome kind of Civility; but that they
had no certain uniform way of conveying
the Tranſactions of their own, and former
times, to the view of Poſterity.</p>

On which account we may very juſtly
reject all thoſe pretended Succeſſions of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
and <hi>Brute,</hi> as Fabulous; as alſo that
this Iſland was Inhabited by Giants; with
a great many other, I know not what,
pretty Stories, adapted to the Ignorance of
thoſe times.</p>
            <p>However, all Hiſtorians agree in this,
That it is highly probable that the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of this Iſland were Originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from the ancient <hi>Gauls,</hi> (that part
of the World being long Inhabited before
this) which is ſufficiently apparent from
the reſemblance of their Government,
Manners, Conditions, Buildings, Habits,
and the Community of their Language,
which is the ſureſt proof a Nations Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
            <p>As for its Name, the moſt probable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
is, That it was termed <hi>Brittain</hi> from
<hi>Brit,</hi> which in the ancient <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Language
ſignifies Painted, and the word <hi>Tain,</hi> which
denotes a Nation; agreeable to the Cuſtom
of the ancient <hi>Brittains,</hi> who uſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour
and paint their Bodies, that in their
Wars they might ſeem more Terrible to
their Enemies.</p>
            <p>We are inform'd by <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> in his

            <p>He afterwards made ſeveral Inroads into
it, but without any great Succeſs; he in

ſo profound and admirable Subtilty he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57530:70"/>
wrote many Books in a dark and rude
Stile, that he deſerved the title of the
Subtle Doctor, and after his own Name
he erected a new Sect of Scoliſts; but
he Died pitifully, for being taken with
an Apoplexy, and over-haſtily Buried for
Dead, whilſt upon the return of Life
Nature was about to diſcuſs the violence
of the Diſeaſe, he endeavouring in vain
by a lamentable noiſe to call for help,
after he had a long time knock'd his
Head againſt the Graveſtone, he daſh'd
out his own Brains, and at laſt yielded
up his vital Breath.</p>
