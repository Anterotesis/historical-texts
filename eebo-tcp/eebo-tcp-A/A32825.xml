            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>AMerſham</hi> being a Burrough Town, and ſending Members to Parliament, ſome of the Burgers that were deſigned to make an Intereſt there for a Parliament which ſhould pleaſe the late King <hi>James,</hi> added near Twenty Poor People to pay Scot and Lot, which were not able, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bring them in for Voices, and then privately without notice made a Rate, pretending for Repairs of the Church, although in truth there was no ſuch thing, it being only done to lay the Burthen of thoſe Additional Burgers upon others; whereupon the ſaid <hi>James Child</hi> and ſome others refuſed to pay that Illegal Rate, and the Churchwardens thereupon Preſented them in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, and they were put to near Three Hundred Pound Charges before they could obtain a Prohibition, which at laſt was granted upon the Motion of the Honourable Sir <hi>Henry Pollixfen,</hi> Knight.</p>
            <p>
               <label>2.</label> King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth in the Ninth Year of his Reign grants a Charter of ſeveral Liberties and Priviledges to the ſaid Pariſh of <hi>Amerſham,</hi> and ſeveral other places in the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> which Charter was Exemplified in the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, at the Requeſt of the ſaid <hi>James Child,</hi> and others; and the Exemplification, by conſent of the Perſons concerned, put into the Hands of the ſaid <hi>James Child</hi> in Truſt for all Parties.</p>
            <p>The late Lord Chancellour <hi>Jefferyes</hi> Combining with ſome Perſons who Invaded the Priviledges granted by the ſaid Charter, did in <hi>May</hi> 1684 contrive a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to be made againſt the Charter aforeſaid, and upon that Complaint Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſaid <hi>James Child</hi> to deliver up the Exemplification, which he being a Truſtee was unwilling to do, whereupon the late Lord Chancellour ſent for the ſaid <hi>James Child</hi> by a Meſſenger, and had him taken into Cuſtody, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſeveral Days untill he was compelled to deliver the Exemplification up, and then the late Lord Chancellour Ordered the Exemplification to be Vacated, and the Charter to be taken off the Roll by the Name of a Schedule, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Forgery, although there was not the leaſt colour or reaſon of ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; by reaſon whereof all Perſons concerned have loſt their Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, if not Redreſſed by the preſent Parliament.</p>
            <p>By the hard Uſages aforeſaid, the ſaid <hi>James Child</hi> was put to exceeding Charges, which with the loſs of his Time, and the Noiſe of his being a Priſoner, and that the late Lord Chancellour had Threatned his Ruine, made his Creditors call in their Moneys, whereby he was forced to Abſcond, and to Sell an Eſtate worth above 2000 <abbr>l</abbr> for 1800 <abbr>l</abbr> and hath at this time a Wife and Eight Children and nothing to depend upon but the Charity of Friends.</p>
