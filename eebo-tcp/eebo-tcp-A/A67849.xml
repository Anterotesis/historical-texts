            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the midſt of our diſtractions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, and deſolations, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinings, and the increaſe of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs in the land, it would be no ſmall reviving to our hopes, if we could but procure a more general and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious obſervation of the <hi>Lords day;</hi> I mean not [a <hi>Judaizing, Touch not, Taſte not, Handle not, Go but a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes journey, Heal not on the Sabbath day, Rub not the Ears of Corn to eat,</hi> &amp;c.] but a holy diligence all the day, in learning the Will of God, in reading and hearing his Word,
<pb facs="tcp:66018:4"/>
in ſinging and ſpeaking out his praiſes; in calling upon his name in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, in the Sacramental Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the Death and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Saviour till he come: Nor do I mean the preferring of the Name of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> before the naming of it <hi>The Lords Day:</hi> But the real ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it for theſe Holy works, from all works that are common and unclean; not calling that <hi>unclean,</hi> which God hath cleanſed; but avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all unneceſſary things, which are a true impediment to the duties of the day, and to the edification and comfort of our Souls.</p>
            <p>Could we but procure a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of this Holy day and work, Oh, what a bleſſed means would it prove to the increaſe of knowledge, and holineſs among us! How could men ſpend one day of ſeven in the ſerious reading and hearing of Gods Word, and not grow in the underſtanding of it? How could
<pb facs="tcp:66018:4"/>
they ſpend each week a day in hearing heavenly diſcourſes, and in holy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, praiſes, and thanksgivings, and not become themſelves more holy, if they did this in good earnest, and not with hypocritical formality! Where there is a profitable publick Miniſtry, what a furtherance would this be to its ſucceſs? Where there is not, O what a ſupply would this be in Families. If Parents and Maſters did but ſpend the day in Catechiſing their Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and reading to them the Word of God, and holy, profitable Books, and in praying, ſinging of Pſalms, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conferences, how much would it make up the loſs of a profitable Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, where there is none? But, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, for thoſe many thouſand families where none is able thus to Read or Pray, the caſe is hard, in theſe times when they dare not come to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours families that can help them! But O, that the love of our ſouls were as
<pb facs="tcp:66018:5"/>
ſtrong, as natural ſelf-love is in the preſervation of our lives! If prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited perſons did put the caſe to me, Whether it were lawful for them, againſt their Rector's wills, to go beg bread at their neighbours houſes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than famiſh, or feed on graſs, I think their reſolutions would anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate my anſwer. And if he have not the love of God in him, who ſeeth his brother in need, and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up the bowels of compaſſion from him; I may inferr, that he neither rightly loveth God, nor himſelf, who will ſuffer his Soul and Family to famiſh, and deny God his Worſhip, and ſpend the Lords own Day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably, and think it a ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to ſay, <hi>I was forbidden, and man muſt be obeyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will it excuſe Neighbours from helping one another, who live out of the reach of publick helps (as alas, too many do, eſpecially in the
<pb facs="tcp:66018:5"/>
remote parts of the Kingdome) to caſt the blame on negligent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or to cry out, It is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates that famiſh ſo many ſouls, nor to complain of the ſilencing of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Teachers; For every man hath his own part to do in building up the City of God: And if you do not your own work, you do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn your ſelves while you complain of others.</p>
            <p>Was that your Covenant with Chriſt, that you would ſerve him, if others did, or if none forbad you, or elſe not? If others perform not their duty, will you ſin for company, and yet condemn them? If you think they do ill, why will you imitate them? If well, why do you blame them? Do you cry out of <hi>ſilent</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable</hi> Miniſters? and do you think that ſilence and unprofitableneſs in the Governour of a Family is no crime? What if all the reſt of the Town denied
<pb facs="tcp:66018:6"/>
food or cloathing to the poor? Would your obligation to feed and cloath them, think you, be the leſs or the greater?</p>
            <p>As ever you would have your <hi>families</hi> to be under the bleſſing and protection of God, and not expoſed to the miſeries of ſuch as he forſaketh, ſee that you dedicate them as holy Societies to God, and ſet up his Government over them, and his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip among them; eſpecially in the Holy Improvement of the Lords Dayes.</p>
            <p>And I take it to be a merciful and comfortable prognostick, that God hath ſuddenly ſtirred ſo many, to write on this ſubject, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute all that is ſaid againſt this duty. And ſome more are ready (if not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred) ſhortly to come forth.</p>
            <p>Among them all, I take this Book to be of ſingular weight and worth; which having declared in my own,
<pb facs="tcp:66018:6"/>
lately publiſhed, on this ſubject, it hath occaſioned many to enquire after it; and a worthy Knight, who had this Tranſlation by him, to be willing to publiſh it. I confeſs, I intended no more, than to provoke the Learned to take more notice of the Book as it is in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue; For being ſtrong in the testimonies of Antiquity, and the opening of Church-cuſtomes, (on which, as an historical evidence of fact, I laid in this controverſie no ſmall streſs) I thought it fitteſt for the peruſal of the Learned. But, ſeeing it is now tranſlated, I hope it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be profitable to many, eſpecially of the more judicious ſort of Readers, who have no more than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue. The Author was a man eminent in his time, for great Learning, Judgment, Piety, Humility; but eſpecially for his acquaintance with the Writings of the Antient Teachers of the Churches, and the Doctrine and Practiſe of former
<pb facs="tcp:66018:7"/>
ages. The Lord bleſs this, and all other Labours of his Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for the preſervation of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>Concord,</hi> which Satan and his forces are ſo fiercely, and alas! ſo ſucceſsfully aſſaulting through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the world.</p>

            <p>THe Church of Chriſt in old time, appealed to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Councils, and Records of the Ancients, in deciding of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, whereby the Peace of the Church was diſturbed, or courſe of the Goſpel retarded: and then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients did interpret the Scriptures, not as they were by the crooked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of Sectaries, or Hereticks,
<pb facs="tcp:66018:8"/>
accomodated to their own dreams, but according to the Analogy of Faith, by the conſent of other Scriptures.

            <p>I judged the ſame was to be done by me, (O Spouſe of Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Mother) when this unhappy queſtion about the Lords Day ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (alwayes in uſe and eſteem in the Chriſtian Church) aroſe: that the things which the Lord hath written upon this matter in the Holy Records, being firſt obſerved, I might betake my ſelf to the Councils and Records of the Antients: by whoſe engines, (for no new ones do I judge to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to vanquiſh the enemies which oppugn the ſolemnity of this Feſtival) I may aſſault the adverſaries of this ordination, both with the authority of Scriptures, and likewiſe with the conſent and records of reverend Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity plainly atteſted: in gathering whereof, I thought it expedient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover <hi>to Thee</hi> the purpoſe of my mind, which take briefly thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66018:9"/>Firſt of all, I gathered into one, the judgments of the Antients, upon this Subject, not that I aſcribe more to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi> than <hi>Truth:</hi> for that I leave to the Papiſts: but I am determined with St. <hi>Hierom, to read the Antients, try</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>all things, hold fast what is good, and not recede from the faith of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</hi> I run not unweaponed, that is, deprived of ſpiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, revealed in Gods Word, to the Antients; as to the <hi>Philistian</hi> Smiths, for ſharpening my husbandry inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but becauſe I ſee that the Holy Ghoſt hath very ſparingly delivered himſelf in the Scriptures (although in them he hath recommended to us its name, uſe, and Apoſtolical inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) about the Lords Day, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſult the Antients, who faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully retain what they received from the Lord by the Apoſtles, that their pious opinion and practiſe being obſerved, we may obſerve like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:66018:9"/>
what we are to do in this caſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Divers have ſet out ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things upon this ſubject, to the great profit of the Church: but few have touched what was the ſacred pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the more pure Church, in keeping this ſolemnity entirely. Theſe things gave me occaſion to enquire more deeply into the queſtion; not onely to help me againſt my own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, but alſo to mitigate tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to others, into whoſe hands Eccleſiaſtical Writers have not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fallen, or being detained with the weighty offices of their charge, could not peruſe them. <note n="*" place="margin">Ut profit homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, ſi fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri poteſt, multis; ſi minus, paucis; ſi minus, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximis; ſi minus ſib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, I judged it not unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, in this deplorate ſtate of the Church, to ſet forth this ſolemnity; and that for a two-fold reaſon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the abominable, and un-chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-like violation of the Lords Day, doth expoſe the holy Worſhip of God Almighty to the wicked's ſcorn: and from hence, even hence, hath flown an inundation of all that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whereby the darkened glory of the Church hath fallen. Alas! with what ſqualor and miſeries, is the face of the Church, ſometimes ſhining and happy, now in all Nations obſcured! They who love it with a ſincere love, do ſee, and lament it; although they who are bewitched with the malignant ſpirit of Popery, ſee, and rejoyce at it: <hi>Neither is there among us any</hi>

            </q>
            <p>This afflicted face of Chriſts Church doth call us to true repentance, in performing whereof, the violation of the Lords Day (which bringeth fuel to this fire) in the Church of every Nation, ought to grieve us. For this Feſtival hath been ſolemnized, as was fit, in the exerciſes of piety, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of Gods Word, but by few: which the many Fairs upon it, for gainful labour, in all Nations, feaſts, drunkenneſs, dancings, and the impious profanations of it, by Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playes, do teſtifie. Theſe flagitious Crimes <hi>(which do obſcure the grace of
<pb facs="tcp:66018:11"/>
Christianity, and give farther oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſlander to thoſe who blaſpheme the name of Chriſt;</hi> and which the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Church abhorred) do every where rage on the Lords Dayes, without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, to the great ſcandal of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>In another reſpect alſo any man ſees that this argument agrees not with the ſecure condition of theſe times: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this age, if ever, Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many, languiſheth under a bare profeſſion of the Goſpel, and its power lies down almoſt extinct, and dead.</p>
            <p>I judge the ſanctification of the L. day, to be a preſent remedy for both theſe maladies. Firſt, it will prepare a way to extinguiſh that vehement flame where with the Church is every where a burning. This may eaſily be taught by the example of <hi>Gunther amnus,</hi> that moſt pious King of <hi>France:</hi> who, after he had obſerved, not without grief of<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:66018:12"/>

            <p>Neither can there be uſed a more excellent remedy for curing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther malady, than the holy obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of this Feſtival; for the zeal of Religion waxing cold, and purity of holy Doctrine being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, what will be more fit to heal errours, and ſtirr up the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ſtrength of zeal, than that an entire Worſhip be offered up both publickly and privately, to God on this day? while the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word of God is piouſly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, attentively heard: the Sacred Myſteries devoutly, and according to Chriſts inſtitution celebrated: Prayers poured into the hearts of the Faithful, by the Holy Ghoſt, are with all humility offered up to God: Sacred Hymns ſound in the Church, with a godly joy; the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted

members of Chriſt, and the poor provided for bountifully by the rich; and thoſe that are ſound in mind do mercifully comfort them that are ſorrowful.</p>
            <p>Theſe are thoſe exerciſes of the Lords Day, which will uphold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when it is falling: which, if they be religiouſly obſerved of the Church, every one ſeeth how great an acceſs will be made from thence to the Chriſtian Religion, which we all profeſs.

The anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Christians obſerved the Sabbath not as an holy day: the differences between the obſervation of the Lords day and Sabbath. How <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> ordained the <hi>Paraſceve</hi> to be obſerved.

                  <hi>Chap. 9.</hi> One day in the week is even under the Goſpel, to be ſanctified. The morality of the Fourth Command, which is perpetual, requires this. Chriſt hath not aboliſhed the Law. How the Sabbath is ſaid to be a ſign between God and the Church. 134.</item>

            <head>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>In which is propounded, firſt, the ſcope of this Treatiſe. Secondly, is ſhewn why we meet with more things about the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Lords Day in the latter, than in former Councils. Thirdly, how far the Church at this day may be obliged by the authorities of Provincial Councils, ordaining theſe dayes: although ſome things of ſmaller value be put amongſt their Canons.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THat old Serpent, the perpetual hater of Divine truth, and true piety, hath buſied himſelf to remove every ſtone ſince the firſt promulgation of the Holy Goſpel, that he might turn aſide the minds of men bewitched with an impure ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of light and godlineſs, from a ſincere love
<pb facs="tcp:66018:22"/>
to the ſame. Therefore, having ſtirred up a terrible flame of perſecution, he hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſheartened the favourers of the Goſpel, from all affection to godlineſs, by moſt crafty means to hinder the happy progreſs of Gods Word: ſometimes by the diligent care of pious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ihis unhappy flame of perſecution being quenched, he hath not feared either to ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ears the very Profeſsors of Religion (not attentively enough obſerving his tricks and ſnares) or ſhamefully to alienate them (mens minds being inclined to lust, and a too great love of this preſent world) from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice of godlineſs, and from all exerciſe of true Religion. But this in vain. For ſo long as a door is open to hear Gods Word, at a time ſolemnly obſerved for the publick Worſhip of God, and the private practice of Godlineſs not neglected, through the Divine Providence [it ſhall happen, that] (maugre the enemies of the Goſpel) godlineſs ſhall flouriſh, Faith ſhall abound, and Charity, the manifeſt token of Chriſts Diſciples, ſhall not wax cold; and mens minds ſhall be ſtirred up with a greater deſire of unfeigned love to the Goſpel, <hi>and the violent ſhall take the Kingdome of Heaven by force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This thing that masked Serpent obſerveth with no ſmall diſdain, whilst that he conſiders he is a falling like lightning from Heaven, by
<pb facs="tcp:66018:22"/>
the power of Apostolical preaching, and upon that account, by his Emiſſaries, employes all his power, that he might retard the courſe of preaching the Goſpel. Nor could he take a more ready way to promote this unhappy enterprize, than either by utterly aboliſhing the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed from heaven for this work, or by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly perverting the uſe thereof. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once obliterated out of mens minds, at length piety would decay, and all care of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would lye extinct. For it's well enough known, that the Profeſſors of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion do there moſt endeavour after godlineſs, and that Church by God is moſt abundantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with all manner of gifts, where, with greateſt reverence, and ſtricteſt obſervation, the Lords Day is wholly ſpent in Divine exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. For, if the <note n="a" place="margin">Ignat. Epiſt. ad Magn. c. 57.</note> 
               <hi>Lords Day be the Queen of Dayes;</hi> that Church which gravely studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſetting forth of this ſolemnity, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly to be reputed the Queen of Churches. But the deadly enemies of piety, with all their ſtrength, endeavour to relax the obſervation of the Lords day, (whereon they willingly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not themſelves to be holden bound by the exerciſes of godlineſs) and to extricate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from this burden, thereby rovingly to give up themſelves without check, to impiety and idleneſs. Wherefore <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> that moſt godly Emperour, not ignorant
<pb facs="tcp:66018:23"/>
of theſe mens temper, when he determined with himſelf to obviate this evil, and begun with greateſt care to practiſe the true Religion of Chriſt, and provoke his Subjects to obſerve it, he made a law for a diligent obſerving the Lords ſolemnity, as witneſseth <hi>Sozomen.</hi> For ſince<note place="margin">l. 1. c. 8.</note> it's the Churches part, intermitting the affairs of this world, to meet together for the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of piety, ſuch Conventions cannot fitly be holden without a certain and determinate time. The time therefore deſtined for performing the the holy duties of Religion being aboliſhed, the minds of men will not be intent upon the offices of Religion. Whence, of neceſſity piety muſt fail; and that being extinct, what other thing can men expect, but that a tempeſt of all evils ſhould be ingruent?</p>
            <p>But yet, ſince it's no caſie thing to oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and wholly to eradicate the matter of that Law which commands us <hi>to ſet apart a whole<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. hom. 10. in Gen. T. 5</note> day within the compaſs of a week, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it for Spiritual Labour:</hi> therefore that ſly Adverſaries by his Emiſsaries (whoſe wit is ready, and that have a mercenary tongue for colouring Impoſtures; changing their opinion at pleaſure with the inconſtant <hi>Ecebolius</hi>) at the firſt, only deſputes after his crafty manner, whether ſuch a time be ordained of God. Theſe men more boldly than truly acknowledge the authority of time to be received not from Gods,
<pb facs="tcp:66018:23"/>
but Mens conſtitution; as though the Lords-Day were like the Holy-dayes <hi>which were<note place="margin">Macrob. Saturn. l. 1. c. 16. p. 226.</note> commanded the</hi> Romans; namely, <hi>ſuch as the Praetors according to their arbitrary power did proclaim.</hi> And ſo its obſervation ſhould depend upon the civil Magiſtrate, and Churches authority.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus being handled after theſe mens will, and others not ſtrenuouſly applying their minds to retard the ſpeedy courſe of their enterpriſes, reaſons are found out with a little ado (for errour is a fruitful thing) by which men not very religious and obſervant of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may at last ruſh upon the conſtant ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this time with unwaſhen hands and feet, as the Proverb is, and tread it under feet, as if it were only inſtituted of God not for the ſake of any Spiritual work, but carnal idleneſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe things (courteous Reader) have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<note place="margin">The ſum of thoſe things handled in this book.</note> me occaſion more narrowly to ſearch out both the Inſtitution, and Sanctification of this time; namely, whether firſt it could be ſhown from the Fountain of holy Writ (from whence wiſe men know we muſt always judge what is to be defined of every Divine Truth) and the ancient practiſe of the following Church (which learned it from the Apoſtles) any part of time weekly be deſtined to performe the holy exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Religion? Secondly, by what Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that time is impoſed upon the Church, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
<pb facs="tcp:66018:24"/>
or Humane? Thirdly, in what things the ſolemn ſanctifying thereof conſiſteth? Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all which, what may be ſhown from the foreſaid Fountains, the following pages will briefly, without prejudice of others, judging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth, by the grace of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us.</p>
            <p>Theſe are, I ſay, the things of which I have<note place="margin">Why men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the day is more frequently made in the latter than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</note> purpoſed to treat, God aſſiſting, which, before I enter on, ſome things remain, of which the Reader ſtudihus of truth, is timely to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. First of all, though there be none of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny authority and name amongst the Profeſſors of more pure Christianity, who beareth not moſt clear testimony to the Lords Festival; yet in no caſe muſt we expect, that all things which chiefly make for the illustrating it, can be demonſtrated out of the papers of the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Fathers in one age. Nor can any one of right be offended, or wonder at this, ſince the reverend authority of the Fathers, eſpecially in the controverſies that unhappily ſprang up in their age is to be attended; in weighing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have profeſſedly and openly declared what their mind was; but in other things, which they have touched upon only by the bye, they have not ſo roundly ſhewed their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Beſides, we know there is no point of Chriſtian Religion, the illuſtration whereof hath not more and more increaſed in the Church
<pb facs="tcp:66018:24"/>
by progreſs of time; to effect which, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Church was enforced through a certain neceſſity: for ſometimes the fooliſh frowardneſs of adverſaries, and ſometimes the lewdly-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed manners of their own men, have required this, that diverſe Canons about ſome heads of Religion (the knowledge whereof formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in the Church) ſhould be appointed. I believe none will deny that the most profound myſtery of the Holy Trinity was known to the Chriſtian Church from its infancy: yet in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils of the ſucceeding Church, diverſe Canons were ordained about it. The Reverend Fathers in the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> ordain, <hi>that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is not a Creature:</hi> and this they did <hi>according to</hi> Pauls <hi>word.</hi> In the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> all profeſs they did believe <hi>that the Holy Ghoſt is true God, as co-eſſential to God, both Father, and the Son.</hi> In the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger, the Divinity of the Son is again concluded.</p>
            <p>Theſe myſteries were illuſtrated by theſe new conſtitutions: and yet who will be ſo mad, as for that cauſe to contend they were firſt then known to the Church, when theſe new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons were ſet forth about them? which only the Holy Fathers ordained to obviate the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of Hereticks that either denyed, er adulterated the received Truth: that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb facs="tcp:66018:25"/>
verity, which the former Church embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, being obſcured, and held down by the wicked artifices of adverſaries, might be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to its ancient vigour.</p>
            <p>But not onely the madneſs of Hereticks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſometimes alſo the inordinate manners of Chriſtians, have occaſioned new Canons ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about things formerly known: for it was an uſual thing for the Fathers to inquire into the manners of thoſe Churches that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to their care; and when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that their Chriſtian people were enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in errour, or wandring from the path of truth, or at leaſt walking not uprightly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the received rule of piety, they ſtraightway uſed new Canons, as medicines congruous to both theſe evils: and ſo in the Church, as in the Commonwealth, <hi>good Laws grew out of evil manners.</hi> And although the things that were before ordained were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient to quench thoſe errours newly ſprung up, or reform their lewd manners: yet either the new breaking out of errour, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of manners, not at all conſonant to the holy light of the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and creeping every way like leaven, were stopped by the bar of new Canons. But thereupon we muſt not think that the former Church was not bound to the truth which was by a <hi>Poſtliminium</hi> eſtabliſhed with new ſanctions, or to manners reformed
<pb facs="tcp:66018:25"/>
by their authority: Which is eaſie to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this buſineſs of the Lords Day.</p>
            <p>The ſucceeding Church, through the care of the best Emperours, having obtained peace, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed divers things about the Lords Feſtival, which are not now extant in the Doctors of the Primitive Church. But who will ſay, that the piety eſtabliſhed by new Canons, for obſerving that ſolemnity, was not known to the former Chriſtians? whenas, even in the Apoſtles age, as it ſhall afterwards appear from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Lords Day was ſolemnly uſed for all the exerciſes of Religion, in which the true manner of keeping it holy doth conſiſt. And the Fathers of the ſucceeding Church, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new Canons about its ſolemnity, have not concealed this, as is to be ſeen in the ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Matiſcon,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">An. Dom. 588.</note> Can. 1. in which they grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly study to ſet forth the Lords ſolemnity, but to this they were moved <hi>by the raſh cuſtome of ſome,</hi> as they ſay, <hi>who expoſed the Lords day to contempt.</hi> In Concil. <hi>Cabilon,</hi>

                  </gap> with a freſher ſtyle, the things that were digeſted by them, and promulgated by a wholſome pen.</hi> There came out alſo <note n="a" place="margin">An. 829.</note> a new Decree in a Council at <hi>Paris,</hi> for the strict obſerving the Lords day, of which, this reaſon is aſſigned by the Fathers: becauſe <note n="b" place="margin">Can. 50.</note> 
               <hi>a due obſervation, and the religious devotion of that day, was in a great meaſure neglected.</hi> That was not then the firſt time they decreed a religious inſtitution of the Lords day, but it being grown into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, they labour <hi>Poſtliminio,</hi> to renew it, and call to remembrance the neglected or obſcured uſe thereof: and the diſſolute manners of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in performing on that day the exerciſes of Religion have produced new Canons about ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this ſolemnity: whenas yet the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelf, and the holy duties thereof, were well enough known to the former Church: and ſo the things which were neglected, through the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of the people, were afterwards with great labour inculcated.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon alſo is to be added, for the ordaining new Canons about this Feſtival. The Heathen Emperours being haters of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an name, provided by their Laws, that the Chriſtians ſhould not have liberty on the Lords
<pb facs="tcp:66018:26"/>
day, to keep their meetings. Which the wicked Edict of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> touching this thing, informs us of. How therefore would they obſerve out of the writers of that age, all the myſteries of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be performed on that day, whenas, not without great peril of life, they did celebrate the Lords dayes, not on the day time, but on the night? yet all Authors of any note, as I ſaid, do acknowledge, that the day it ſelf was to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated from the beginning of the Church: and if they had had liberty, they had executed the ſame offices of Religion on that day, by which it was celebrated in the ſucceeding Church. And theſe are the things, for whoſe cauſe the Fathers of the ſucceeding Church being moved, have treated more at large concerning the Lords day duties, than thoſe of the foregoing.</p>
            <p>There remains one other rock, upon which, leſt<note place="margin">How other Churches may be bound to Provincial Aſſemblies.</note> any daſh, I judge them alſo to be advertiſed. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Canons, upon whoſe authority a great ſort of the duties of Religion on that day to be performed, do lean, were ſet forth by Councils which were Provincial: perhaps therefore ſome will object, that none but the Churches of thoſe Provinces are obliged to keep thoſe Canons. But indeed, ſince the Decrees of Provincial Councils ſerve for the profit of the whole, and not of any particular Church onely, why ſhould they not be received of other Churches profeſſing the ſame Faith with them? although not by vertue of any
<pb facs="tcp:66018:27"/>
Provincials authority, but of Divine truth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit determined in a particular Province. And ſince the reaſon of a Provincial Synods determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is univerſal, why ſhould not Canons ſo determined, even in that reſpect, oblige other Churches, although not to undergo the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? For the impoſing of the puniſhment is particular, where the Law in reſpect of equity may be general. And whenas we ſee the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of particular Fathers to be eſteemed amongſt all; we ſhould be too partial towards them, if we ſhould ſet at nought the Canons of Provincial Councils, at which ſeveral Fathers and Biſhops were preſent: unleſs ſome body will think that a ſentence approved by the judgments of many, be of leſs weight and authority, than when it's pronounced by one ſingle perſon apart.</p>
            <p>Becauſe <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles were written to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches they are not therefore rejected of others, for that in Gods intention they pertain to the Churches of all ages and Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor do they leſs agree with their moral state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, than with thoſe for whom they were primarily deſigned.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if in any Province there be Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es rightly constituted, and according to the rule of Gods Word, doubtleſs they are to be honoured with the name and title of Churches: and the right hands of Chriſtian fellowſhip are to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them: neither is there extant at this day a
<pb facs="tcp:66018:27"/>
Church, which, upon occaſion, does not freely uſe the authorities of ſome Provincial Councils, in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the truth: to which yet this is by none impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a fault: and why may not its aſſertors ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have liberty to uſe the Provincial authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Canons for propagating the truth about the Lords day?</p>
            <p>The Orthodox Fathers anciently, when any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion aroſe, by which the peace of the Church was diſturbed, did adviſe, and mutually help one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The <hi>French</hi> Biſhops, in the caſe of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Felix,</hi> conſulted the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Millain,</hi> whoſe Letters were read in the Council of <hi>Tauritan.</hi> as appeareth by the fifth Canon of that Council. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops, in the caſe<note place="margin">T. 1 p 640.

by ſome for a trifle. Concerning which thing, it yet troubled not <hi>St. Paul</hi> to make a Canon for the married in caſe of Prayer and Fasting, <hi>1 Cor. 7. 5.</hi> Put for that part of <hi>Friuli's</hi> Canon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it's ordained, <hi>to abſtain from our Wives on that day;</hi> whether it was added by the Fathers, or foiſted into the Canon by ſome Scioliſt, on the Marginal explication of a <hi>Carnal work,</hi> I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not: I onely aſsert this, if it be their grief that trifles repugnant to the Word of God, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded on the Church of Chriſt, in this I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and accept very well their temper, who ſet at nought whatever point is diſſonant from the Holy So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All the things therein ordained, are not approved now adayes by all; and yet thoſe Councils are not therefore rejected by wiſe men. Some things enacted in the firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which have come to our hands, (if the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick acts of the Council have not periſhed through the injury of time, or cunning of the <hi>Arrians</hi>) are over orude, which ſavour not of <hi>Athanaſius, Ofius,</hi> or <hi>Paphnatius's</hi> wit, and other approved Fathers, which were preſent at the Council, and which things are now alſo antiquated: ſhall we ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

judge all things in the reverend Council, which hath ſo many witneſſes, to be rejected? far be it from us. In that Council alſo it's ordained, that <hi>there muſt be no bowing of the knees on the Lords Dayes, or from the Paſſover to Pentecoſt, in pouring out prayers to God.</hi> Perhaps there will be ſome, that will think this ordinance worthy deriſion, rather than obſervation: who will not yet for that cauſe reject the Council. Once in a Council at <hi>Trulla, Spiritual affinity,</hi> as they call it, was forbidden: <note place="margin">Can. 53.</note> yea, there we read an injunction (for the fifth Canon ſays <gap reason="foreign">

I can bring forth many more other examples of Canons determining ſmall matters, but I'le ſpare this labour: At leaſt, I add but this, when in Provincial Councils of every Province, Queſtions were handled (Conc. <hi>1. Conſtantinop.</hi> Can. 2. T. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 510.) and <note place="margin">So Conc. African. Can. 95.</note> nothing was brought to the General Council, but what could not fitly be determined in the Provincial: it was needful for the Fathers to determine of the propounded queſtions, of what kind or weight ſoever they were: and ſo if any minute things (which by ſome are reckoned trifles) do occurr in the Canons, they are rather to be aſcribed to others, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded them to the Fathers aſſembled in Council, than to them determining of them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the rocks, which in the following Treatiſe by Gods help, ſhall be more clearly explained in their places: of which things (moſt courteous Reader) I judged it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to admoniſh thee, before I diſmiſs thee to read it over, leſt in any place thou be at at a ſtand.

                  <p>The time aſſigned for Divine worſhip <note place="margin">The extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary time for Divine worſhip.</note> amongſt the ancient Chriſtians, was either extraordinary, or ordinary: ſolemnly to celebrate the extraordinary time, they were called upon only by an extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when it ſell out: ſo while the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were living, <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. that many were gathered together in <hi>Maries</hi> houſe, during St. <hi>Peter's</hi> impriſonment, and for his ſake poured out Prayers continually 10 God;—the occaſion of which conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was extraordinary, yet did they not therefore intermit the ordinary time of meeting: the ancient writers do alſo witneſs, that ſuch were the meetings of the Chriſtians after the Apoſtles times, when a juſt occaſion was offered: who, as often as perſecutions, or publick calamities ſell out, they then joyned Prayers in their meetings congregated on that occaſion: and ſo, as it were, <note n="a" place="margin">Tertul.

                  <p>Concerning the Aſſemblies of the Church while the Apoſtles were yet alive, ſome things obſervable do occurr in the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts (the Holy Ghoſts <hi>amanuenſes,</hi> and the faithful deſcribers of the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles) in declaring whereof, we will firſt conſider what is recorded of the Apoſtles in this thing, and then of the other members of the Church.</p>
                  <p>And firſt of all we will ſhortly touch upon the aſſemblies of the Apoſtles (although they cannot truly be reputed amongſt the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conventions of the Church, becauſe which way ſoever the Apoſtles turned, they took e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very occaſion to preach the Goſpel) becauſe they open us a way to underſtand others.

The, occaſion of which meeting is not mentioned; but doubtleſs, as all Interpreters conjecture, this was done, that by their mutual preſence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66018:31"/>
they might comfort one another: For as many as are Chriſts, do perpetually incline to communicate all things, whether their ſorrows or joyes, among themſelves: and then their Lord being gone, their greateſt fear was of the <hi>Jews;</hi> for which cauſe we read that the place wherein they held their meeting was ſhut and barred: when the Apoſtles were aſſembled, they conferred among themſelves of what divers related of Chriſts Reſurrection: the time of this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is noted in <hi>John,</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 20. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>it was the first day of the week, and about evening of that day,</hi> or after Sun-ſet; at which time, Chriſt, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the grave and death, preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them alive.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, after eight dayes, or the eighth day current from his appearing, the ſame Evangeliſt tells us, <hi>John</hi> 20. 26. that they were all met together, where Jeſus came again, and ſtood in the midſt of them.

on the third day from his burial, not after the third day. So alſo 'tis ſaid <hi>Luke 2. 21. When eight dayes were accompliſhed for the circumciſing of the Child, i. e.</hi> on the eighth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day: for the H.

                  <p>Thirdly, the General convention of all the Apoſtles is declared, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 4. in which they were commanded, not to depart from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but there wait for the promiſe of the Father: and thither they came after the glorious Aſcenſion of Chriſt, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gathered together, they tarried for the Spirit, promiſed of God the Father, and Chriſt. <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 1. 14.</note>. <hi>Luke</hi> reports that women alſo were preſent at this Congregation of the Apoſtles: where they continued their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> abiding with one accord in Prayer and Supplication: which fell out alſo on the firſt day of the week.

                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66018:32"/>
in this miſſes not the truth at all. For the day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> (which the Scripture elſewhere calls the Feaſt of Weeks, or of New-fruits, becauſe on that day the Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread was offered out of the new fruits) was the fiftieth incluſively from the day of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Firſt-fruits, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. which was the day immediately next after the Paſſover <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 20, 23.</note>, on which the Lord Jeſus, who was the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits of the dead, lay in the Grave: and the fiftieth day from that incluſively, was the firſt in the week, upon which the H. Ghoſt deſcended on the Apoſtles, as they were that day aſſembled. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the meetings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the Holy Scripture teſtifies the bleſſed Apoſtles held upon the fiftieth day from Chriſts reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: which being held upon the firſt day of the Week, Chriſt oftentimes honoured with his preſence. But why they met on that, and not another day, it is not eaſie to declare; although one may gueſs at the cauſe of the firſt and laſt meeting, yet hath the Holy Ghoſt ſhewn us nothing of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond occaſion. And it's uncertain whether Chriſt before his death, or for thoſe forty<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 26</note> dayes wherein he reaſoned with them after his reſurrection, of things pertaining to the Kingdome of God, gave his Apoſtles any command for ſetting apart ſome new time

But the Church being wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully increaſed, and daily corroborated in the Faith, by the frequent preaching of the Apoſtles, it appeareth by the Hiſtory of the Apoſtles travels recorded by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> that the Chriſtians where-ever they lived, were wont to meet upon ſet dayes, to handle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: to prove its truth, divers examples are ready in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> and their <hi>Epistles;</hi> in which the celebrating of their meetings is uſually denoted by theſe phraſes; <hi>meeting together to hear the word of God,</hi> Acts 13. 44. <hi>coming together to break bread,</hi> Acts 20. 7. <hi>to come together,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 20. <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring to the Lord.</hi> Acts 13. 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66018:34"/>
for no other end, as from the alledged teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies is evident. Which things let the Reader ſeriouſly weigh with himſelf. For at what time, or in what place ſoever they could ſpeak with the <hi>Jews,</hi> they ſet upon them, and preached the Goſpel to them. Therefore, both on the Sabbaths, and other dayes, as well in the Synagogues, as when they were met other where, the Apoſtles were not wanting amongſt the <hi>Iews</hi> in the office of preaching. When they had tarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certain dayes amongſt the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> becauſe no fit occaſion for preaching the Goſpel was offered (as the circumſtances of that place teach) which the Apoſtles every where greedily ſought after, they <hi>preached Chriſt on the Sabbath dayes out of the City, by</hi>

                  <p>It's granted therefore that the Apoſtles and other Chriſtians in thoſe firſt times, were preſent at the Synagogues of the <hi>Iews:</hi> yet although they met with them on the Sabbaths, they are not read in the Scripture to meet on the Sabbath dayes apart from the <hi>Iews,</hi> and by themſelves. Neither do we read that this was done of them with an intention to ſolemnize the Sabbath, or have a worſhip common to the <hi>Iews,</hi> which was not lawful to be done.

In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Apoſtles muſt not be ſaid to have obſerved the Jewiſh Sabbath, although they had divers diſputations thereon, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the <hi>Iews</hi> gave them occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Moreover if the Chriſtians had obſerved the Sabbath, then <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> had ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied<note place="margin">

                  <p>Laſtly, we read not that the Apoſtles were alwayes at their Synagogues.

                  <argument>
                     <p>The ordinary time obſerved for celebrating the publick worſhip of God after Chriſts death was the Lords day, ſolemnly uſed by the Christian Church, in the very Apoſtles age. Three Texts of the New Teſtament, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Act. 20. 7. 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2. and Apoc. 1. 10.</hi> are briefly conſidered.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AFterwards, when the Chriſtians had no dealing with the <hi>Iews,</hi> we read that they met by themſelves, in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles age, and that on the Lords day, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the offices of Piety and Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. But for the period of time, in which at firſt they held theſe conventions by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, apart from the <hi>Iews,</hi> there's nothing occurrs in Scripture, and divers diſpute about it. Paſſing by whoſe diſpute, it plainly appears in the Holy Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Lords day, while yet the Apoſtles were alive, was deſtined for the publick meeting of the Church.</p>
                  <p>There are three Texts of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">All Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of Scripture are not at one with themſelves.</note> (namely, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2. and <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 10. in which there is plain mention of that dayes celebrity) on whoſe moſt grave authorites the religious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66018:36"/>
of the Lords day, by the common ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage almoſt of all Divines, doth chiefly reſt. Yet all Interpreters agree not amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Expoſitions of them: and no wonder, ſince to all it is not given preſently to hit upon the ſenſe of what is delivered in the Scriptures, but <hi>to ſome that propheſie ſome things are revealed,</hi> according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>whilſt other ſit by.</hi> Yea, men of every<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 30.</note> age ſtudiouſly following after the known truth; even while they diligently apply their ages to the ſtudy of the Scripture, are bleſſed with a New-light of knowledge not obſerved by their Predeceſſors. It ſometimes alſo falleth out, that ſome things may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to men of inferiour condition, which are hid to others of greater name and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; as may be ſeen in St. <hi>Paphnatius,</hi> who being armed with the Divine authority of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> wherein it's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that Marriage is honourable in all, oppoſed in that famous Council of <hi>Nice</hi> the<note place="margin">

                     </note> weaker, although the leaſt, to ſpeak any

                  <p>Moreover, one and the ſame underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame moment, receiveth not all the ſacred myſteries of Faith; but the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, (the onely teacher of truth) open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to men their underſtanding at divers times. And moſt commonly it happens, that <hi>he that cannot have the firſt place for wiſdome, may have the ſecond for modeſty,</hi> by<note place="margin">Aug. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</note> retracting what he hath inconſiderately ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

                     <hi>themſelves:</hi> ſo it falleth out in the gloſs of the foreſaid Texts. For ſome of them (whereof the firſt and ſecond do note, that the offices of Religion are to be performed by the Chriſtian Church on that day; the third its name) being ſupported by teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, do piouſly and modeſtly defend the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Lords day: which others of them contend, cannot be defended by thoſe authorities.

                  <p>Whoever knows the Learned <hi>Calvin,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but acknowledge him for a moſt ſtout maintainer of Gods truth: by whoſe auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious labours, in this age, through Gods mercy, an admirable courſe hath been made to all excellency of Doctrine and Religion: which might have periſhed, had not he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtirred up by Gods grace, as another <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> upholden the ruinous affairs of the Church. He was alſo a moſt earneſt reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of Chriſtian liberty, which with might and main purſued about the uſe of meats, and dayes, againſt the Papiſts, and other adverſaries of the truth. And let none think it ſtrange, if upon the matter he find the ſame happen to him, which does to the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Husbandman, after that his good ſeed ſprouts out in his field: who perceiving Darnel and Tares, while he goes about to root them out, contrary to his purpoſe he plucks up ſome of the Wheat with the Tares.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66018:38"/>
the obſervation of the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to ceaſe, and that upon Apoſtolical authority: he thought it congruous to truth, to pronounce the Chriſtian Church free from obſerving the Weekly Sabbath. This opinion he manifeſted eſpecially, when he ſet himſelf againſt the unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Feſtivals of the Papiſts, from whoſe moſt grievous yoke, he had an earneſt deſire to free the Church of Chriſt.</p>

                     <hi>when the aſſembly was ended, after communion of the Sacraments, they went to eat and drink together.</hi> And hence it was, as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> thinks, that they <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. <hi>met to break common bread:</hi> becauſe when the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was celebrated, the common table fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> affirms, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that <hi>Hom.</hi> that the day on which they met was the Lords, and that all things that there were done were joyned to preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; But the breaking of bread in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid place, is to be expounded of the Holy Euchariſt: for there were ſundry there, and <hi>Paul</hi> took bread, not at Supper time, but mid-night. In that Text therefore the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Chriſtian Sabbath (ſuch are an holy aſſembly, breaking of bread, or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Lords Supper, preaching of the Word, devout Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are read to be performed of the Church on that day: which holy duties were not performed of them on another day, otherwiſe <hi>Paul</hi> having ſtayed there the ſpace of ſeven dayes, could not have deſerred them to this day, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he was to depart the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: neither doth <hi>Luke</hi> affirm the Apoſtle to have proclaimed this meeting of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66018:40"/>
Church as extraordinary, becauſe he was to depart the day after: but he teacheth that the Church met (namely, as it was wont) to break bread, and not to take leave of the Apoſtle: and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> conſeſſes that<note place="margin">Ep. 86.</note> 
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> departure <hi>was the expreſs cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing his ſpeech, becauſe he deſired ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inſtruct them.</hi> The received cuſtome therefore of the Church, and not the bleſſed Apoſtles departure from <hi>Troas,</hi> gave occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this aſſembly.

Whence it appears, that that Text ſhews that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Church kept ſolemnly the Lords Day in the publick exerciſes of Religion. But upon what authority the Chriſtians met on that day, we will afterwards examine, here it's enough for me only to demonſtrate that they did meet on that day.</p>

manner of the Church in collecting almes on the Lords Dayes, for the benefit of afflicted brethren, which were then at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which office of Chriſtian Charity, although no brethren liv'd in that place, ought not to be omitted of Chriſtians: but in <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtoms</hi> opinion is to be eſtabliſhed by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable law for ever, as it was done (even as it appears by <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians</hi> Apologies) in the ſucceeding Church.

That kind of collection was not ſo affixed to the Lords Day, as it could not be done on other dayes; although a peculiar reaſon was in it, why they did rather on that, than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day; namely, for the Church-aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies held at that time: and no time, as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> witneſſeth, which we ſhall ſee afterwards, is more fit to perform that office on than the Lords Day.</p>

This they aſſert, not becauſe it's the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſtruction of the Apoſtles words, but that they might elude, if they could, the genuine interpretation received every where of the Church. But whoever ſhall weigh with himſelf the bleſſed Apoſtles purpoſe, (who did ſtudiouſly provide that his ordinances ſhould not be a burden to the Churches of Chriſt, which in thoſe dayes for moſt what conſiſted of men of an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our condition) will not eaſily admit, that the Apoſtle did ſo ordain, that collections ſhould be made daily: neither is it like that he ſhould ordain, that theſe ſhould be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered on every Sabbath, properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: ſince when the Apoſtle was preſent at <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Chriſtians could not meet in one place: much leſs after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from them, was it ſafe for them to frequent the <hi>Jewes</hi> Synagogues on the Sabbath day. Let that place, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 17. be conſulted. Laſtly, neither muſt we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Chriſtian <hi>Corinthians</hi> did hold their publick meetings on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day amongſt themſelves: ſince they were held on the Lords dayes in every place: neither is there extant any teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the whole Volume of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by which it can be ſhown, that the Chriſtians kept Sabbath-day meetings
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66018:43"/>
among themſelves, or apart from the <hi>Jews.</hi> Therefore the received Expoſition of the Apoſtles words, is to be retained; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Apoſtle did ordain in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> yet when they met for Religion, weekly, as the Lords dayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, almes ſhould be collected for the poors uſe: and they ſeem privately to have laid aſide what their condition per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to beſtow for the comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the poor: and that which was thus laid aſide, they kept with themſelves till the firſt day in the week, at what time they depoſited it with the Rulers of the Church for the poors uſe.

                  <argument>

                  </argument>
                  <p>NOne who will diligently look into the graveſt writers of the following ages ſhall be ignorant, that after the Apoſtles were dead, the Church did in all Nations celebrate the Lords Day: which that it may more plainly be known to all, we muſt know; as I ſaid in the firſt Chapter, when the Apoſtles were tranſlated to Heaven, the number of dayes (on which ordinarily the Church-meetings were had) received an increaſe. For while the Apoſtles were alive, the Chriſtians ordinarily held their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on the Lords dayes only, but afterwards the ordinary time for performing the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of publick worſhip was not only week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66018:45"/>
but anniverſary; that came every week, this but once every year. But here we will not ſpeak of the extraordinary, and anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary feſtivals, that were uſed by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Church; but of the ordinary time returning every week, deſtined for Religious exerciſes. Where, in the firſt place, it will be for the Readers profit to conſider, that although the uſe of the Lords day ſpread<note place="margin">The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians met on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> abroad through the world in the Church of God, yet in ſome places the Church had weekly her publick meetings on other dayes beſides the Lords. <hi>Socrates</hi> acknowledges the Sabbath and Lords Day for feaſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning every week, on which meetings were wont to be kept. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 8.

                  <p>The teſtimonies of the Fathers hitherto mentioned, do ſhew, that although the uſe of the Lords day grew every where, yet the Church had in ſome places oftener, in others more rarely, their weekly meetings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it ſeemed equal and juſt to ſome to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain other dayes (which the ſucceeding Church proclaimed for publick meetings) to be equallized with the Lords day: and that chiefly for three cauſes; firſt, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meetings of the Church were held on other dayes beſides the Lords. Secondly, the Chriſtians were bound to the ſame duties of Religion on other dayes, appointed by the Church for meetings, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Church on the Lords day. Laſtly, ſome Feaſts, the Anniverſary name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were more eſteemed in the Church than the Lords: and theſe things are confidently enough affirmed, that they might ſhew, if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66018:46"/>
by any means they could, that the original and obligation of the Lords day and other Feſtivals is the ſame, both which they ſet forth to the world for humane: but let them look to it, to whom they affirm it, leſt they be twit with that of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 8.</p>
                  <p>But that the prerogatives of the Lords Day above others, may more clearly appear, let us by Gods help weigh of what value the reaſons are, with which they contend for other feaſts to be equallized with the Lords day: which, that it may be done with plainneſs, we will firſt clearly diſtinguiſh the Church-aſſemblies held on the Sabbath dayes, from others which were held on the Lords day, relying upon the graveſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the ancients; then by Gods aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, we will ſhew the peculiar excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Lords Day; for the dignity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is ſuperiour to other dayes, while others contend againſt it in vain.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we affirm, that, excepting the<note place="margin">The anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not as an holy day.</note> Lords, there was no other weekly (we ſpeak of ſtated and ordinary) holy day, with the whole Church next the Apoſtles. We have heard in the firſt Chapter, that the Chriſtians met on the firſt day of the week: and for the allegations in this chapter out of the Fathers and Hiſtorians, for the obſervation of the Sabbath, they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66018:47"/>
that the Sabbath was obſerved by the Chriſtian Church as an holy day: which, unleſs it be firſt explicated, they that peruſe the records of the Ancients, will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall into a troublous matter. After the Apoſtles death, <hi>Socrates, Sozomen, Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Hieronymus, Auguſtine,</hi> and if there be any more, ſay, that the Church in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick aſſembly did perform the duties of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as the Sabbaths came about: yet whoever ſhall ſay that the Sabbath was neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted holy, nor equalled to the Lords day, will do no wrong to the truth. Who will ſay the Sabbath is holy? when in the holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords a tittle cannot be read of its inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or obſervation in the Chriſtian Church, as is of the Lords day: but that the Lords day was inſtituted of the Apoſtles, indued with extraordinary power, and moved by the Holy Ghoſts inſpiration, we will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Grace of God inform you. Yea, let him tell who can, that the Chriſtians in the Apoſtles age met by themſelves on Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes, which thing yet they did on the Lords dayes, is apparent enough from the Scriptures: but after the Apoſtles death I deny not that the Chriſtians met together on Sabbath dayes, (although they account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the Sabbath holy) and thoſe aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies were chiefly in uſe with the Oriental
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66018:47"/>
people, according to ſome; becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> diſperſed in the Orient, and accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed to the Sabbatical ſolemnity, could not eaſily be contented to be plucked from it, although they obſerved the Lords Day (which what is it elſe to do, but brand them with <note n="*" place="margin">Euſ. 3. 21.</note>

ſupine negligence, or being puffed up with pride, deſpiſed the Church-meetings on Sabbath-dayes. Whether it was the ſluggiſhneſs or arrogance of theſe men, it was deſervedly blameable: whenas they might divers dayes meet at Church, without dammage of their worldly affairs, which yet to do, they were not eaſily moved, although the duties of their calling would bear it. In the old Teſtament, ſome hours in a week were conſecrated to Gods Worſhip, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. 3. but yet all the day long the whole people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould not attend on the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties of piety; this was only enjoyned to them that could commodiouſly do it. So in the Churches planted by the Apoſtles, they met on other dayes as often as they could, beſides the Lords dayes: but on the Lords dayes, appointed for this end, they were bound to be preſent at the publick aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and their abſence for a certain time from theſe on the Lords day, was to be reprehended by the ſentence of the firſt <hi>Concil.

                  <p>And let theſe things ſuffice for the Lords dayes prerogatives above the Sabbath; by which we find that the Sabbath day was not kept holy of the Church, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the ancients did not ſeparate it from common uſe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, nor conſecrate it wholly to God in an holy reſt, that on it the acts of Divine Worſhip, and thoſe things that pertain to a ſpiritual life, ſhould only be exerciſed) neither were the conventions on that day to be compared with thoſe held on the Lords day: which things ſurely once to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, had been much to our profit. For the Inſtitution of other dayes to hold meetings on, it's not needful to take much pains, ſince we have nothing writ of it in the Word of God, as of the Lords day; and many
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66018:51"/>
things which were not inſtituted of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but firſt aroſe in particular Churches, were introduced by little and little into other, which at length in proceſs of time, are made more common: which <hi>Socrates</hi> aſcribes to the Biſhops of divers Churches<note n="a" place="margin">Hiſt. l. 5. c. 22.</note>: and thoſe that received ſuch rites from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, tranſmitted them as a law to Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: as in other things, ſo in the meetings of the Church, it's to be obſerved, whoſe original was not uſed by the Church in the Apoſtles age. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in <hi>Panario</hi> tells us of <hi>Synaxes Eccleſiae quarta, Proſabbato, &amp; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minico fartas.</hi>

                     <hi>Sozomen</hi> ſeems to touch upon the cauſe of its inſtitution, who ſayes that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine gave great honour to the holy Croſs, both for the help that was brought him in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging his wars against his enemies, through its vertu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e,</hi> and alſo for the heavenly Viſion that was offered him about it; which things teach us, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (if we may ſay ſo of ſo godly an Emperour) did very ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly worſhip the Croſs: whence it happened that he attributed more to the Croſs than was fitting: and for that cauſe inſtituted that day to be ſet a part for meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in memorial of Chriſts Paſſion on that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66018:52"/>
day accompliſhed. Yet who will from that ſanction compare the obſervation of that day, ordained of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and not of the Apoſtles, with the Lords day? which was long before <hi>Conſtantines</hi> dayes obſerved of the Church, which we muſt take for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain did ſo often meet to hear the word of God, as it fitly could. Afterwards we ſhall ſee, that the Fathers did treat to their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of the Scriptures, almoſt every day; yet I truſt none will equallize every day, on which theſe aſſemblies were holden, to the Lords day. But theſe aſſemblies were free, neither was the univerſal Church ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by any law to keep them, which yet we acknowledge of the Lords day: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will add no more of them. And from what hath been ſaid, the attentive Reader will eaſily perceive, that no day was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the whole Catholick Church, with that ſolemnity that the Lords day was: and that on the Sabbath day the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did not intermit their ordinary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
                  <p>Now having gotten out of a very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome<note place="margin">Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Feuſts were not equalled to the Lords day.</note> diſputation, I haſten to that which in the third place I thought to enquire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; namely, Whether Anniverſary Feaſts were obſerved of the Church with greater ſolemnity than the Lords day, as ſome
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66018:52"/>
think? eſpecially becauſe amongſt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients they were ſometimes equalled to the Lords day, and ſometimes far preferred to it. From the Paſſover-holy-dayes until Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt, being intentive on Prayers, they did no more bend the knees, than on the Lords dayes: yea, the anſwer in<note n="a" place="margin">Juſt. Mart. qu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad orth. 115.</note> 
                     <hi>Juſtin</hi> affirms the ſame things, that <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was in equal power with the Lords day. The ſame is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the twentieth Canon <hi>Conc. Nic.</hi> 1. Mention alſo is made of this cuſtome in other Fathers, <hi>Baſil. de S.

                  </p>
                  <p>From their freedom from kneeling, ſome conclude the equality of theſe dayes: which I acknowledge was interdicted on thoſe dayes; and they were glad for their immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at that time from their Faſts; and yet I do not think that thoſe dayes are to be compared with the Lords. Verily, if theſe prerogatives had conſtituted an holy day, they that for this cauſe judge the dayes of Pentecoſt to be equalled to the Lords, had ſaid ſomething: but if they ſo think, I doubt not at all but they are miſtaken: and what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſometime anſwered <hi>Urbicus</hi> diſputing againſt thoſe that dined on the Lords day, is hither to be referred. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin

                        <note n="a" place="margin">Ep. 86.</note> concludes the Lords day must be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Sabbath for the faith of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, not for cuſtom of refection,</hi> that is, they prefer not the Lords day to the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, becauſe they remit faſting on it; which yet they do not on the Sabbaths; but becauſe<note n="b" place="margin">Aug.

                     <hi>it was declared to the Chriſtians to be the Lords day by the Reſurrection of the Lord, and thereupon began to have its own feſtivity.</hi> So we ſay here, the dayes of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt are not to be compared with the Lords Day, although as well on thoſe as on this, the time was paſſed without bowing and faſtings: becauſe the ordination, whereby bowing and faſting were interdicted them, was merely humane. <hi>Auſtin</hi> thinks it is not<note n="c" place="margin">Ep. 86.</note> 
                     <hi>defined by the Lords command, or the Apoſtles on what dayes to faſt:</hi> and not many ages ſince, while the Lords ſolemnity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Church, that ordination was vaniſht. No body therefore that's alwaies one, can by right compare the ſolemnity of Pentecoſt with the Lords: (whoſe inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution afterwards we will prove Divine;) neither is there in the places cited, made any compariſon of that with this amongſt the Fathers; but only in regard of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.<note n="d" place="margin">in Luc. l. 8. c. 17.</note>

That I may therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch in a word; if the Lords day had not been celebrated in the Apoſtles age, and if it had been honoured with no other prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives than immunity from bowing and faſting, then certainly they would have equallized them to this day: but that this is falſe, even, as the Proverb is, the blear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed, and barbers know: and ſo they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, arguing like Sophiſters from that which is <gap reason="foreign">

To thoſe that think thus, it is enough to anſwer them once after this manner; Whereas we cannot read that the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture affords a teſtimony to the inſtitution or obſervation of theſe, they are to be received as humane inſtitutions: which, omitting others, may be cleared by this one argument: If thoſe feaſts had been inſtituted of the Apoſtles, then they had
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66018:54"/>
been obſerved every where by the Church, in the ſame manner and time, according to the rule of <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis:</hi> yet the contrary doth plainly appear by Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Writers and Fathers: which it will not be irkſome to demonſtrate in ſome of them. If the Feaſt of the Paſſover had been ordained by the law of Chriſt or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, (ſayes the learned <hi>Chamier</hi>) then that law had unanimouſly been propounded of the Apoſtles, and accordingly celebrated of all Churches, in the ſame manner, at leaſt at the beginning.

Who therefore can be brought to believe, if the feſtivity of the Paſſover was ordained by the Apoſtles authority, that ſo ſoon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Churches, that were governed of the very Apoſtles Scholars, would make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from ſo holy a precept? and that in celebrating the Lords day, all the Churches
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66018:54"/>
of Chriſt through the whole world ſhould follow one and the ſame rule? Why had they not alſo done the like in the Feaſt of the Paſſover, if it had been inſtituted by Apoſtolical authority? It is not likely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was ordained of the Apoſtles. And yet I cannot but wonder at the wit of ſome men, who hold the Paſſovers feſtivity, which the Scriptures are ſilent in, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; and yet they repute the Lords day, whoſe obſervation we meet with in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for Eccleſiaſtical and humane. If therefore the Paſſovers feſtivity was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Apoſtles, no man can juſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to the Lords day, ordained of Chriſt by his Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Nor muſt we judge otherwiſe of the Feaſt of the happy Nativity of Chriſt, whoſe ſolemnity was anniverſary, but on what day of the year to be celebrated, it's uncertain.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Reaſon of obſerving the Lords Day, was the Reſurrection of Chriſt on that day: it is called the first day of the week, by the Evangeliſts and Fathers, and Lords day, and Sunday alſo; and why the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and Chriſtian Sabbath, whereupon the Fathers did rarely uſe the name of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; what the word <hi>Synaxis</hi> may ſignifie with the ancients.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe things that are obſerved thus far have taught us, that the Lords day was alwaies ſolemnized in the Church of Chriſt, from his Reſurrection: now let us enter both upon opening the reaſons for which the Primitive Chriſtians were induced to this, and alſo the names by which they uſually called this day.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, one and the ſame reaſon of this days ſolemnity, is aſſigned every where in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: then it's pointed out by the ſelf-ſame names of them all, though far remote from one another: and the teſtimonies obſerved in the former Chapter do witneſs both theſe. The Fathers plainly affirm, that the Lords
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66018:63"/>
day was ſacred with the Chriſtians, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<note place="margin">Chriſts Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the cauſe of this ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note> of the Lords Reſurrection, and that he had a feſtival ever ſince that time,. So <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius, Juſtin Martyr, Conſtant. Mag. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, &amp;c.</hi> in the places fore-cited. But we meet with the reaſon of this Feſtival no where more accurately, and to the life, as they ſay, painted out, than in <hi>Athanaſius de Sabb. &amp; Circumciſ.</hi> Of which place this is the ſumm, (to which, becauſe it is large, I referr the Reader.) There <hi>Athanaſius</hi> mentions a double world, to the former whereof, he tells us the ſaving Paſſion of Chriſt, at which the Sun appeared not, put an end, and the beginning of a new creation came after it, which took its beginning in our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>The Church relying on this reaſon (which all the other Fathers acknowledge) hath hitherto alwaies from the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, had in reverence the Lords day, namely, becauſe of the Lords Reſurrection: now the Reſurrection preſuppoſeth Chriſts Nativity and Death, or the Reſurrection is as it were the conſummation of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: therefore when the Apoſtles office is deſcribed of <hi>Luke, Acts</hi> 1. 22. they are called <hi>witneſſes of the Reſurrection;</hi> not becauſe they teſtified of the Reſurrection alone; but ſince the Reſurrection (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66018:64"/>
which, <hi>the Faith of Christians would be vain,</hi> the great Apoſtle being witneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) is the chief article of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, when they are ſaid to give teſtimony of the Reſurrection, iqis as much as if they bore witneſs of the whole Goſpel. Hence it was that the ancients preferred the Paſſovers ſolemnity to all other Feſtivals. <hi>Greg. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> calls it, <hi>the festival of festivals, a ſolemnity of ſolemnities, which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>doth ſo far excell all the other, not only the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and earthly, but thoſe alſo of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and are celebrated for his ſake, as the Sun excelleth the Stars:</hi> becauſe if he had not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen again, neither had his Nativity, nor Baptiſm, nor the other Myſteries of Chriſt been confirmed, nor made us believe them. Therefore <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> thinks the honour of that feſtival is far to be preferred to the ſolemnities of others, as his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter <hi>Nicetas</hi> thinks. Therefore, while the Fathers conſeſs, that the Lords day was conſecrated in memory of the Reſurrection, it's the ſame as if they had ſaid, in memory of our Redemption: which Reſurrection is the chief point of the Goſpel; to hear and handle which, on that day, the Church is ſequeſtred from Worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66018:64"/>
is omitted by none, although to it other are added by others.</p>
                  <p>Nor is there leſs harmonious conſent<note place="margin">Lords day is prima Sabbati.</note> amongſt the ancient Fathers of the Church, in the Name of this Feſtival, than in aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its reaſon: and in its appellation they follow the Evangeliſts, agreeing amongſt themſelves, who were the Holy Ghoſts <hi>amanuenſes:</hi> in whom it's called by two names.

                  <argument>
                     <p>The whole Lords day is to be ſanctified to God, and not onely ſome part of it.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THus far theſe notes, although ſcribled with an haſty pen, have told us, that Chriſtians muſt keep holy the Lords day, and that they largely enough ſhew was done from the very Apoſtles age. The ſecond Queſtion which I have propounded fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; namely, Whether the Church muſt keep the whole Lords day holy? Some there are who grant, that the Lords day muſt be ſanctified, yet contend that the whole and entire day is not to be celebrated
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66018:69"/>
in the religious devotion of Piety: in whoſe judgment, as much as this ſolemnity requires is done, if onely ſome, although but ſome ſmall part thereof be dedicated to Divine Worſhip; neither do they judge otherwiſe of the Lords day, (alwayes to be counted dear amongſt Chriſtians) than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens anciently did of thoſe dayes amongſt them called <note n="a" place="margin">Macrob. Saturn. l. 1. c. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>interciſi; which were common to the Gods and men: for at ſome hours of them it was lawful to ſit in judgement, and in ſome not.</hi> But who, well in his wits, ſhall judge, that a day in this manner is to be dedicated to the Good and Great God? The Lord hath not reckoned the other dayes of the week thus for our uſe: neither will he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer willingly his day to be ſanctified of us by halves.</p>
                  <p>It was provided under the Law, that if any had by vow <note n="b" place="margin">Lev. 27.</note> conſecrated a thing to God, and he afterwards repented of his vow, and would not ſuffer that thing to be ſold, or prized openly but determined to keep it to himſelf; then was he to be fined in a fifth part over and beſides the ordinary eſtimation of the thing, for his levities ſake. If nothing muſt be diminiſhed of thoſe things that are dedicated to God, although once they were in our own power; much leſs will it be ſafe to detract any thing from the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66018:69"/>
time conſecrated to God, but rather add ſomething to it of our own: for what is conſecrated to God, muſt not be be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to another uſe. Therefore they that compare the <hi>Jews</hi> inhabiting <hi>Tiberias,</hi> with others that dwell in the Mountains, do judge thoſe, and deſervedly, far to be preferred to theſe: for it was a familiar thing with them who had the ſhorter day, to add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the profane to the ſacred; but theſe that were ſited in the Mountains, who had the longer day, added to the profane, taking ſomething from the ſacred. If it be better in thoſe mens judgment, to add of the profane to the ſacred, than to take from the ſacred and add to the profane? in what caſe are they to be reckoned, who are not afraid to ſteal a great part of time from the Lords day, conſecrated of the Lord by his Apoſtles to ſacred uſes, and apply it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane? Yet although ſome here impatient of true Piety, do ſeek a knot in a bulruſh, as the Proverb is, yet by theſe mens leave I will ſay, He that will follow the wholſome counſel of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> ſhall indeed find it is no <hi>Gordian Knot. Irenaeus</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">l. 3. c. 4.</note> gives pious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; in any queſtion, when a diſputation doth ariſe, we muſt have recourſe to the <hi>moſt ancient Churches, from whom may be learned what we muſt judge of the preſent queſtion.</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:66018:70"/>
Indeed if we would but here follow the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of this Reverend Prelate, it will be an eaſie thing to untie that knot by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ancients.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, when the Fathers ſpeak<note place="margin">The whole day to be ſanctified to God.</note> of ſanctifying a day, they make mention, not of ſome ſmall portion thereof, but of a whole day: and to what end ſhould not a day conſiſt of the ſame termes with us, as it did with the ancients? Since <hi>Auſtin</hi> piouſly<note place="margin">De Civit. Dei. l. 15. c. 13.</note> teacheth us, that in the equality of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern years and dayes (which have termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in the ſame ſpace of time in former ages, as have now) being determined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the diurnal and nocturnal courſe of twenty four hours, there is the ſame ſpace of time with the former. And for what he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of the forty dayes, (<hi>whereon continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al great rain is mentioned</hi>) which were not determined <hi>in the ſpace of two hours or little more;</hi> the ſame we may ſafely conclude of the Sanctification of the Lords day; ſince it conſiſts of the ſame term of hours, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dayes in the week do, the manner of its ſolemnity is not to be judged by the ſpace of two or three houres.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth <hi>Auſtin</hi> think otherwiſe, (if that Sermon may be reckoned among his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine<note place="margin">Serm. de Temp. 251.</note> writings) <hi>who judgeth, that on the Lords dayes we muſt attend Divine worſhip on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>

and exhorts, <hi>to celebrate the Lords day with a religious ſolemnity, as the ancients were commanded about the Sabbath;</hi> yea, and not without indignation, doth he reprove thoſe that refuſed to follow the cuſtom of the Church in this thing, <hi>who,</hi> as he ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>

                     <hi>Origen</hi> upbraids ſome <hi>that reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one or two hours of the whole day to God, and came to Church to Prayer, or heard the word of God</hi> in tranſitu: <hi>but ſpent their chief care about this world, and their belly.</hi> The ſame thing doth St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> require, who thinks that the whole day muſt be ſanctified. <hi>I think,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that one of theſe ſeven dayes, and that of right, is to be ſpent in the worſhip and ſervice of the God of us all.</hi> Hom. 3. in <hi>Joh.

                  <p>Firſt, they exhort the Church <hi>to regard on that day the things that pertain to their ſouls ſalvation:</hi> where <note n="a" place="margin">Hierom in Iſ. 56.</note>

                  <p>Neither do I think good to confirm the truth in this matter by reaſons, over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe teſtimonies, that are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned: although they be not to ſeek wherewith to ſtop the mouths of diſſenters, if they be angry: and the entire ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole day, may be vindicated againſt the too earneſt ſeekers of a profane liberty.</p>

                  <p>The Ancients, who thought good to faſt on the Sabbath, ſometimes continued their faſts to the ninth hour, which being paſt, they were not afraid to relaxe their faſt, and refreſh their ſtrength with meat. <hi>Socrat. Hiſt.</hi> l. 5. c. 22. And ſometimes till the Cock-crow of the Lords day, growing light, as in the Sabbath of the great week, as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> teaches in <hi>Panario.</hi> When therefore they judged that they muſt ſimply faſt on the Sabbath, then they added nothing of the termes of the faſt, before the Sabbath it ſelf ended: but becauſe ſome judged that they muſt not abſtain on all Sabbaths, for a whole day from meats, therefore they ſignified how long their faſt was to laſt. We may ſay the ſame of the Lords day's duration: if the Church muſt not keep holy day by a Religious ſolemnity, from worldly affairs,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66018:73"/>
for a whole day, then the term (without whoſe knowledge the Church-would be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant how long the day were to be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the minds of men would ſtick pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous) of this ſolemnity would ſome way be known to us from the Scriptures; nor would the Holy Ghoſt have paſſed it by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched; and formerly we have obſerved from their writings, that the Fathers would determine nothing to be done on this whole day, that is, from the Sun-riſing to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but what relates to Piety: who being excited with an holy zeal, have explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the half ſanctification of the Lords Day.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If the glory of the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath<note place="margin">3.</note> be tranſlated to the Lords day, (which is not denied of the Fathers) I do not ſee why we ſhould not interpret this day in the ſame manner, as it was preſcribed about the Sabbath, to the worſhippers of God in old time: for to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that by Divine authoritie, it was given in command, that they, being ſequeſtred from all worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, through the whole Sabbath ſhould attend Divine Worſhip alone. With what face therefore, and upon what authoritie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying, can Chriſtians beſtow their Lords day, or any part thereof in worldly affairs, ſetting aſide the worſhip of God, let them
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66018:74"/>
look to't, that have a care of their ſalvation. This reaſon hath the moſt pious <hi>Leo</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<note place="margin">Leo Conſt. 54.</note> with his judgement and authority; for, ſaith he, <hi>if they that did obſerve a certain ſhadow and figure, did ſo greatly reverence the Sabbath Day, that they wholly abstained from all work: how is it not fitting that thoſe ſhould reverence that day, that is honoured of God, who love the light of grace, and the truth it ſelf?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Laſtly, the rule of equity and juſtice<note place="margin">4.</note> requires the ſame, if we look at what time the Lord hath indulged us for our uſes: whoſe large benevolence hath allowed us ſix whole dayes, to overcome the labours of this world, and diſpatch our own buſineſs with. Why ſhould it therefore be tedious to us, weighing this in an equal ballance, for to ſet apart one whole day for his praiſe, and ſincere worſhip: Neither can any one think this an abſurd form of arguing, who ſhall but obſerve <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> arguing in<note place="margin">Hom. 2. in Joan.</note> this matter from the duty of ſervants to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, to our obſervance towards God: he judgeth it ridiculous, <hi>if we would have our ſervants alwayes employed in our buſineſs, and and we give no ſervice to God.</hi> And we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, contending for the ſanctifying of the whole day, do ſay, that it is much more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, if we ſhould reckon thoſe dayes for
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66018:74"/>
whole ones, which are allowed us to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the affairs of this life in for our uſe, and interpret a day ſet aſide for Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, by Divine authority, not an entire one, but a ſmall part thereof to be dedicated to Divine worſhip. It would be ridiculous, yea, plainly impious, to arrogate to our ſelves, and our affairs, what we refuſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on God. <hi>Chryſostom</hi> judgeth it an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious<note place="margin">Hom. 5. in Matth.</note> thing <hi>to conſume ſix dayes in carnal, and be unwilling to ſpend one in ſpiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> So alſo <hi>Leo</hi> in the foreſaid place, <hi>How is it not the part of a wholly diſſolute Religion, whereas one of the ſeven dayes is conſecrated to the honour of God, not to preſerve it inviolate to God, but to make it common?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we muſt not contend with reaſons, but teſtimonies (for the prejudices of ſome men who condemn the truth in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as novelty) and he that ſhall underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the foreſaid teſtimonies of greateſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, will eſteem at little reaſons, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though every way valid (like the <hi>Leviathan</hi>

                  <p>And thus far being furniſhed with the authorities of the ancients, I have taught you, that they have ſtood for ſanctifying of the whole day, which they have judged
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66018:75"/>
neceſſary for the Church: How the ſacred Exerciſes of Divine worſhip performed on that day, were ſo diſpoſed, that in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thereof, the whole day was ſpent by the ancients, when I ſhall ſpeak of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of the Lords Day, then by the grace of God ſhall be made manifeſt.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Ordinance of the Lords day is not to be reckoned amongst unwritten Traditions: It was instituted of Chriſt by the Apostles: The Apoſtles prerogatives above other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church: Things ordained of the Apoſtles are Divine.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WHen the <hi>Jews</hi> had obſerved <hi>John</hi> to uſe another form of Doctrine, than was commonly received, and to begin a new Ceremony of Baptiſme, <hi>they ask who he was? i. e.</hi> by what authority he did ſet upon theſe new things, and unheard of in former ages? that being informed in that thing, they might in time conſider what
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66018:75"/>
they ſhould do. So, ſince that we have found out of Scriptures and Fathers, that the Lords day was ſolemnized by the Church under the Goſpel, inſomuch that mens minds are to be maſculouſly applied to the duties of Piety, not on the laſt, (as under the Law) but firſt day of the week; a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is made, by what authority Gods Holy Church doth this thing. For it was not ſo kept holy from the beginning, from whence even till the happy Reſurrection of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the Lord commanded that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day in every week ſhould be held ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and for ſanctifying the firſt day of every week, divers men ſeek for a command, which they confidently enough cry out is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in all the holy Scriptures: and divers more other wiſe Divines of great note, do greatly toyle in heaping up arguments whereby to enervate the Divine Authority of this day.</p>
                  <p>It is an ordinary thing with ſundry of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (although ſome amongſt them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the School-men, do think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) who ſtrenuouſly contend for unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Traditions, (on whoſe weak authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as on a ſolid foundation, many of their dotages are grounded) to reckon up the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Lords Day among this ſort of Traditions; which cannot be, fince the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66018:76"/>

                  <p>The Holy Scriptures do teſtifie, that the<note place="margin">Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting of the <hi>Lords Day</hi> by the Apoſtles.</note> Lords day was obſerved of the Church, while the Apoſtles were yet alive, nor is there much doubt of this obſervation: This is the onely thing (as I ſaid) of which the queſtion is, Whether this ſolemnity was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of the Apoſtles, or of the Church, according to that power allowed them by the Lord? And if it be aſcribed to the Holy Apoſtles, Whether they of themſelves, and by their own authority, or by Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, have preſcribed it to the Church? ſince the obſervation of the Lords day grew in uſe with the Church of Chriſt, while the Apoſtles were yet alive, it ſeems equitable,

                  <p>Thirdly, They were endued with that abundance of Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, for the Miniſtry committed to them by the Lord, that they preached the truth of the Goſpel infallibly: <hi>I know,</hi> ſayes <hi>Hierom,</hi>

                     <hi>how to eſteem of the Apoſtles in one manner, of other Doctors after another; that thoſe alwayes taught the truth, theſe in ſome things did erre as men.</hi> Whence the Doctrine commended to the Church by the Apoſtles, was alwayes accounted for the rule, and Canon of all Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Apoſtles, at the beginning of the Church, by the viſible ſign of impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, conferred the gifts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt upon others, that were inſtructed of them in the Doctrine of the Goſpel: and they were endued with divers other gifts of Miracles (by which their call was rendred clear both to themſelves and others) <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 8. And theſe are the ſigns by which the bleſſed Apoſtle teaches us, that he had executed the office of a true
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66018:77"/>
Apoſtle in the Church of <hi>Corinth. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
                  <p>Deſervedly, for theſe cauſes, were they that were elected to the honourable ſtate of Apoſtolical dignity, preferred to other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church, not only in the chief eminency of Order, but of Power: and hence it was, that all queſtions reſpecting the affairs of the whole Church, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be diſcuſſed by the Apoſtles, (whom all the Churches conſulted in doubtful caſes) as may be ſeen, <hi>Acts 15. 2. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 1. and whatever they determined, the whole Church every where embraced; which made a conſcience of departing a fingers breadth from thoſe things that were committed to them by the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>If therefore the ſolemnity of the Lords Day was celebrated while the Apoſtles were living, (which the Scriptures teſtifie was done, as we have ſeen, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.) it muſt of right chiefly be imputed to their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: otherwiſe, without doubt, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church had not followed it. <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66018:78"/>
it be becauſe the Bleſſed Apoſtles have left no ſingular command with the Church for the obſervation of this day: although he that ſhall attend their practiſe, may lawfully deny this, ſince their example and practiſe hath the force of a precept. But who will deny, that ſome things were inſtituted of the Apoſtles in the Church, whoſe uſe, while they were alive, (I paſs not for Traditions introduced into the Church when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were dead) was grown out with the primitive Chriſtians? of whoſe firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or neceſſary continuation afterwards, no precept is extant in the Scriptures: yet who will be bold to extenuate the authority of theſe commands? or will affirm, that the Church at this day is not obliged to obſerve them? becauſe their obſervation being mentioned in Scripture, is as it were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by vertue whereof the Church is bound to continue them. The thing will be more plain by examples. The Apoſtles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. and Elders in every Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. In the Ordinations of all Miniſters, impoſition of hands was uſed, but where is there extant an expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> from Chriſt for perpetuating the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thoſe, the inſtitution of theſe, or for the uſe of this ceremony? yet none doubts, but that the Apoſtles in performing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66018:78"/>
of theſe, were acted by a Divine inſtinct of the Spirit, and that the Church at this day is bound to them by vertue of Apoſtolical inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>But that I may briefly ſhew, that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtles, and no others, were the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this ſolemnity, that which follows may ſuffice. If it were obſerved while they were yet living, (which the Scriptures do evidently enough manifeſt) it is deſervedly to be aſcribed to their ordaining it: for it was either inſtituted by them, and their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or by ſome other Doctors of the Church, without their conſent; a third way is not given; the latter whereof is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and never to be admitted of any exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the Chriſtian Faith: becauſe the Apoſtolical authority (as formerly we have abundantly enough ſhewn) was ſupreme in the Church: it belonged to them to declare to the Chriſtian flock what was beſt to be done in all things: and not to the Church, to preſcribe them Statutes and Laws. Why therefore did it not appertain to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the faithful founders of the Church, amongſt other things, to commend this alſo to the Church, and not to the Church to preſcribe it the bleſſed Apoſtles?</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the general conſent of all Churches, in celebrating this feſtival, evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66018:79"/>
the ſame: otherwiſe they had diſſented from one another, as in other obſervations (not received from the Apoſtles, but obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for a time by the ſucceeding Church) as in the Feaſt of the Paſſover, in obſerving Faſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo doubtleſs it would have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in celebrating the Lords Day, if by Divine authority received from the Apoſtles its obſervation had not been uſed amongſt the Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if the Chriſtian Church had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that day to be celebrated, without the advice of the Apoſtles, either thoſe that turned <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> had done this; but not thoſe, to whom the ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of their old Sabbath was not known, but by the Apoſtles; much leſs would they attempt to do this by themſelves, or on their own authority. Neither will any wiſe man think, that thoſe whom the Apoſtles invited from Heatheniſm, to embrace the Chriſtian faith, were the authors of this Feſtival, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not uſual with them to Sabbatize after the manner of the Church, unleſs ſo far as they were inſtructed to it by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if the Holy Apoſtles, by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority committed to them from Chriſt, had not inſtituted the Lords Day, but had left its obſervation free to the judgment of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:66018:79"/>
Church, then we might on good reaſon have called the Church <hi>the Queen of the Sabbath:</hi> which yet is a very clear argument of <hi>Chriſts Divinity,</hi> (as the Learned Dr. <hi>Paraeus</hi> pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly) <hi>for none is Lord of the Sabbath, but he that hath inſtituted the Sabbath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Sabbath is of the Lord they God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if its authority did depend upon the Churches inſtitution, then it may by it be again aboliſhed, when it ſhall think good: but this was never hitherto, ſince Chriſts aſcenſion, attempted, becauſe the Lords day being taken away, the publick worſhip of God muſt of neceſſity fall.</p>
                  <p>Since, therefore, the obſervation of the Lords day was uſed while the Apoſtles were living, it muſt altogether be aſcribed to them as the firſt founders of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if it ſhould be granted, that<note place="margin">Whatever is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtle:, is Divine.</note> this ſolemnity was inſtituted of the Apoſtles, others ask, Whether therefore doth this Ordination lean upon a Divine right? We, paſſing by this rather curious, than ſound Diſputation, <hi>Whether the Ordinance of the Lords day be an inſtitution of God or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles?</hi> diſcuſſed by ſome doltiſh, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie men, do acknowledge with all willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the ancients did, that it was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Divine authority. And although its authority ſhould be granted to be of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66018:80"/>
inſtitution, it would not thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it is not Divine; unleſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be ordained in the Church by the Apoſtles, which the Holy Ghoſt did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them with: which will not eaſily be admitted of any that is in his ſenſes: becauſe the poſtles in all matters delivered thoſe things to the Churches, which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Chriſt, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. and according to Chriſts precept, taught men that embraced the Goſpel, to obſerve thoſe things which Chriſt had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. <note n="a" place="margin">De pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripti adv. haer. c. 6.</note> So judgeth <hi>Tertullian.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66018:80"/>
is a Prophet, or ſpiritual man, muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they are the Lords Precepts, which he hath written to the Churches, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 37. Surely, nothing was enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Church by the Apoſtles, which was not firſt preſcribed by the Lord; becauſe the Apoſtles were to teach what they learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Chriſt: which thing they performed with great faithfulneſs: neither will any one, who ſavours the things of the ſpirit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this; and yet I acknowledge, that ſome things were inſtituted of them for a time; inaſmuch as whoſe occaſions were ſingular, and not to be continued, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe ordinations were mutable: which yet cannot be affirmed of the Lords Day.</p>
                  <p>If there be any of the Fathers therefore, who think that the inſtitution of the Lords day was made by the Apoſtles, they are not ſo to be underſtood, as if they acknowledged it not for Divine, but Humane: becauſe the ſame Fathers elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where are not affraid to aſcribe it to God and Chriſt: and they acknowledge that the bleſſed Apoſtles were not the authors of this ſolemnity, but the Holy Ghoſts <hi>amanuenſes, (i. e.</hi> as <hi>Leo</hi> interprets it, <hi>who</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Ubi ſupra.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lords Day, becauſe this ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt; and the Apoſtles inſtituted thereby:</hi> and confeſſeth, that <hi>that day was abundantly honoured by the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lords Day therefore was inſtituted of the Apoſtles, as the faithful Architects of the Chriſtian Church, by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power, which continues not now in the Church, and by inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt; that Chriſtians might be obliged not by Humane, but by Divine authority, to keep holy Convocations, and to celebrate the private exerciſes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on that day. <hi>Apoſtolical grace,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ambroſe, hath raiſed up the dead,</hi> which,<note place="margin">Hexa. l. 4. c. 4.</note> although it was not the grace of the Apoſtles, but of Chriſt, as the Apoſtles themſelves confeſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 12. 16. is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Apoſtolical, becauſe it was poured out upon them, and by his help they raiſed up the dead: So here the Lords day is called an <hi>Apoſtolical Inſtitution,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a mere ordinance of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as they were Chriſtians, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was inſtituted of Chriſt, by thoſe who were endowed with extraordinary power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:66018:81"/>But, as I have ſaid, this is the onely thing that vexes them, that call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the authority of this inſtitution; that there is no place extant in Scripture, in which, by Divine authority, the ſolemn obſervation of this day ſeems to be enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe are men of ſubtil wits, who, as the Proverb goes, <hi>cannot ſee the wood for trees.</hi> Whoſe opinion, when I conſider, that in the Author <note n="a" place="margin">Hom. 44.</note> 
                     <hi>Oper.

Even ſo muſt we judge of theſe men. With what heat of mind, and earneſtneſs, do the very
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66018:82"/>
authors of this doubt contend for tythes, which they cry out, that the Lord hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to the Church under the Goſpel, by a Divine right, whenas yet they cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one plain teſtimony out of the New Teſtament, for their beſtowing on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel? but about the Lords Day (whoſe being obſerved more than once by the Chriſtian Church, is plain enough in the Scriptures) their faith is wavering; nor can they be perſwaded to believe, that its authority can be demonſtrated out of the Word of God. Let others judge, whether they be worthy <hi>Tenths,</hi> who deny <hi>Sevenths</hi> (if I may ſay ſo) to God. But for their ſakes, admitting the Law about Tythes, I would ask this, Whether it's likely, that the moſt good, great, and wiſe God (who hath put the ſeaſons of times in his own power, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 7.) would determine any thing certain of a Salary, to be beſtowed on the adminiſtrators of his Worſhip, when yet he left nothing certain in the Church, of the time in which his worſhip ſhould be performed? It's a wiſe mans part, firſt to determine the work, and a fit time to do it in, and then the wages, where with they that under went it, are to be rewarded. The Parable, <hi>Math.</hi> 20. relates, how the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder hired Labourers; but firſt he ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66018:82"/>
what he would have them do, and then he agreed with them for a penny a day. If therefore they aſſert, that Tythes are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God for the uſe of the Miniſters of the Church, they muſt of neceſſity grant, that God hath appointed a time, in which they muſt attend his worſhip (to whom, in their opinion, he hath granted Tythes) becauſe it is the ſame authority that muſt both define the Worſhip, and a fit time for performing of that Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Now for eſtabliſhing the Divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this day, we muſt not have recourſe to that ſpurious ſcroul, that, (as it's report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the third tome of <note n="a" place="margin">p. 1448.</note> Councils) was ſent down from Heaven to <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> becauſe that what things the Holy Ghoſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us in Scripture, they do demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it to all to be Divine, of thoſe that embrace the truth: and for the fabulous foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries about this matter, we leave them to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (whoſe Kingdome had long ſince fallen without their ſupport) and we will briefly, according to our manner, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what light may be brought out of the New Teſtament, to manifeſt the truth in this matter. Here three things come to be examined.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Whether in the compaſs of every week, muſt the Church keep holy a certain day, by Gods inſtitution?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:66018:83"/>Secondly, Whether the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath be abrogated?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What can be brought out of the books of the New Teſtament to confirm the keeping holy the firſt day in the week?</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe is more obſcure, the other two may plainly enough be obſerved out of the Holy Scriptures, and Fathers, and one of them depends upon another. Of the laſt many things have been obſerved out of the Scriptures, in our ſecond, third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chapters; but the truth about the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Queſtions being made manifeſt by the teſtimonies of the ancients, it will appear with little ado, what is to be enquired into in the third place.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Within the compaſs of a week, one day was ſanctified, from the beginning of the world: this is affirmed both by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> How <hi>Adam</hi> had need of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. The mention of obſerving the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day amongst the Heathens. The authorities are weighed, wherein the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Sabbath among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs is denied. Why the Heathens are not upbraided with the abuſe of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AS to the firſt Queſtion, namely, That in the compaſs of ſeven dayes, <hi>one is to be ſet apart for ſpiritual operation</hi> (as ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>) why ſhould I fear to affirm it?<note place="margin">Hom. 10. in Gen.</note> Eſpecially, ſince this opinion is approved by the ſuffrage of the greateſt Divines, and clearly enough taught by the manifeſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the ancients. We ſhall ſee that the Church of God, ſince the Hiſtory of the Creation was known, did alwaies ſet apart one day of the weekly ſyſteme, for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: the verity of which thing may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66018:84"/>
in the three <hi>Epocha's,</hi> or junctures of years; the firſt whereof is from the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Moſes:</hi> the ſecond from <hi>Moſes</hi> till the Goſpel was preached by the Apoſtles: the third follows to be conſidered from that time, till the end of the world: in all which we ſhall find, that one of the ſeven was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſet apart for the publick worſhipping of God. We read, it was ſo done from the beginning of the world till <hi>Moſes;</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi> till the Reſurrection of Chriſt; from thence to this very day. The controverſie at this day, is chiefly about the firſt and laſt <hi>Epocha,</hi> none doubts of the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>In demonſtrating the firſt, that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath<note place="margin">The Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was obſerved from the beginning of the world.</note> was obſerved before <hi>Moſes,</hi> yea, from the firſt beginning of the world, both the Holy Scriptures, and the Reverend Fathers, their faithful Interpreters, do atteſt it: to prove the truth whereof, we will firſt bring the authority of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is had <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3. of which places, divers have given the genuine ſenſe, and eſpecially the <hi>Learned Rivet,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> and doth Orthodoxly enough defend his Expoſition againſt thoſe that think otherwiſe, in his diſſertation <hi>de Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bato, chap.</hi> 2. and removes a <hi>Prolepſis</hi> that is deviſed by the modern, in commenting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Text: for <hi>Moſes</hi> in the foreſaid place, doth not relate what God did, when
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66018:84"/>
he writ the Hiſtory of the Creation; but what God did, after that the ſtupendious work of Creation was finiſhed: namely, that he ceaſed from creating any new work, and ordained by a Law promulgated, that the ſeventh day ſhould be ſet apart by men, to his worſhip, in memorial of the Creation. This is related by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Neither was that fore mentioned <hi>prolepſis,</hi> which the beſt amongſt the Chriſtians allow not, known to the <hi>Jews.</hi> And if we follow the ſimple and literal ſenſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> his words, they all make for us. For, how unjuſt is it, when all the <hi>Verbs</hi> are of the ſame <hi>Mood</hi> and <hi>Tenſe, Vajecol, Vaijsboth, Vajebarech; and be finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ceaſed, and bleſſed,</hi> to reſtrain the two former to the preſent, and to extend the latter, as ſome do, to a time to come two thouſand years after; this would be too harſh a conſtruction of the words.</p>
                  <p>But let us ſee how the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood this place. <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us of them, that <note place="margin">

Where <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> delivers the <hi>Jews</hi> opinion of the Sabbaths obſervation from the beginning of the world: and then he affirms, that according
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66018:85"/>
to the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Command in the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> for keeping it, reſpects the original obſervation of the Sabbath; namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God at the Creation ſanctified the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day.

                  <p>Neither do the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves deny this.

                  <p>Now if any have a mind to reckon up the grave opinions of the aforeſaid Fathers, he will not deny, that the Sabbath day was ſolemnly kept from the very beginning of the world: becauſe, by the judgment of them all, the Sabbath was ſanctified by God; nor do the Fathers ſpeak of the purpoſe of God, as though it was not then really ſet

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:66018:89"/>
are the chief of thoſe reaſons wherewith they do oppoſe the truth received of ſo many learned men. In the firſt place, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lamentable fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> there was no need of the Sabbath, on which his ſtrength, being ſpent with labours, it was to be repaired. Secondly, Nothing is read in Scripture of the Patriarchs keeping the Sabbath. Thirdly, If the Sabbath had been obſerved from the Creation, the Heathens had been obliged to obſerve it, &amp; ſomewhere in the Scriptures they would have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by God for the neglect of the Sabbath, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> yet is no where read in H. Records. Theſe are the reaſons which bear the greateſt ſhew of probability, for which they aſſert, there was no uſe of the Sabbath before <hi>Moſes</hi> in the world. To the two firſt whereof, the famous <hi>Wallaeus</hi> anſwers ſolidly. To whoſe<note place="margin">Ubi ſupra <hi>Adam</hi> had need of the Sabbath.</note> anſwer, I only add this. Since <hi>Adam</hi> could not conveniently attend at one and the ſame time, two buſineſſes of a diverſe nature, it ſeemeth not unreaſonable, that God aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a ſtated time for doing both in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently; to the end he might both till the<note place="margin">1.</note> Garden freely, and alſo ſolemnly celebrate the publick worſhip of God. Moreover,<note place="margin">2.</note> ſince we believe that the night was aſſigned to him in his happy condition of innocency, wherein he might reſt; why ſhould not alſo<note place="margin">3.</note> the day be appointed for a Divine contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66018:89"/>
of the works of God? Laſtly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Saints themſelves in that bleſſed Kingdome of Heaven, do enjoy a perpetual Sabbath, it will not be thought incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or diſagreeable to the condition of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> if the Sabbath were aſſigned to him in Paradice, to worſhip God on; although we<note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Some inſtitutions are expreſſed in Scripture, whoſe obſervation doth not conſtantly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr in the ſame. <hi>Neh.</hi> 18. 8. Thoſe that returned from the captivity are read to make themſelves tabernacles, in which they abode: which was not done before, even from the times of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> to that very day; although it was provided for in the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 40. And after the Law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> about the Sabbath, there is made no mention of its obſervation in the whole book of <hi>Judges, &amp;c.</hi> yet none will thence conclude, that the Sabbath was not inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at that time, becauſe we meet with no footſteps of its feſtivity being obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Nor do we read that <hi>Sampſon, Deborah,</hi> or <hi>Joſhua</hi> did keep the Sabbath: yet do we not deny upon that account, that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was inſtituted.

We may judge the like of the Sabbath's not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved of him: becauſe if he had the mode of worſhip preſcribed him of God, ſurely, that a time was defined of God to exerciſe it in, cannot rightly be denied: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we read nothing of the expreſs time: for it is moſt agreeable to natural equity, that as well the time for performance of the worſhip, as the worſhip it ſelf ſhould be defined.</p>
                  <p>As to the third reaſon, brought from the Heathens; Some think, if the Sabbath had been obſerved from the Creation, then the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had been bound to celebrate its ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. But this they deny for a double reaſon. Firſt, becauſe no footſteps of the ſeventh day's obſervation are found amongſt them. Secondly, they are not reproved of God for neglecting the Sabbath.</p>

                     <hi>Diogenes,</hi> although the learned <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> on that place of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> thinketh, that the obſervation of weeks, which holds at this day, uſed among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received before the times of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> Yet the learned <hi>Rivet, loc. citato,</hi> proves by divers teſtimonies, that it was in uſe amongſt the <hi>Latines,</hi> ſo to diſtinguiſh their dayes. <hi>Lampridius</hi> in <hi>Alexand. Severo,</hi> tells us, that when he was in the City, he went up to the Capitol on the ſeventh day, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the Temples.</p>
                  <p>We meet with more teſtimonies to this purpoſe in the learned <hi>Ameſius,</hi> of pious memory, in <hi>Medul. Theolog.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 15. ſect. 10. And now I will conclude with the teſtimony of <hi>Joſephus</hi> againſt <hi>Appion,</hi> l. 2. <hi>That there is no nation, either of</hi> Greeks, <hi>or</hi> Barbarians, <hi>or any where elſe, amongſt whom the cuſtome of the ſeventh day, which the</hi> Jews <hi>uſed to keep holy, was not grown com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> With whom, as we have ſeen, agreeth <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the cuſtome therefore of celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſeventh day, was common amongſt the Heathens, can be doubted by none; whether, as I ſaid, from the inſtinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or by the ordination of God, which came by tradition to the poſterity of <hi>Adam.</hi> However, if we may credit the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:66018:92"/>
Authors, it is certain, that the Feſtival of this ſolemnity was known to the whole world, although moſt know not the cauſe of this ſolemnity: which <hi>Philo de vita</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. obſerves, and <hi>Theophilus Antioche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in the fore-cited place. <hi>Theophilus</hi> ſaith, <hi>that all men call the ſeventh day the Sabbath, but moſt know not the cauſe of its appellation.</hi> Now that cauſe which moſt knew not, was Gods reſting on it, when he had finiſhed in ſix dayes that ſtupendious work of Creation; which was obliterated amongſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, by a long tract of time, although they obſerved the day, as appeareth by the mentioned teſtimonies. This <hi>Irenaeus</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more at large, in the end of the thirtieth chapter of his fourth book, whither I ſend the Reader.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, I will ſatisfie the ſecond<note place="margin">Why the beathen are not upbraided with the abuſe of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> Queſtion, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> If the Gentiles were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to obſerve the Sabbath, and the cuſtom of obſerving it was grown common amongſt them, why are they never in Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God for profaning the Sabbath? who can deny that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> were obliged by the inſtinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to worſhip God their great Creatour? Beſides, divers of the Heathen had got the knowledge of God, the Creation, and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Euſebius,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Ubi ſupra</note>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:66018:92"/>
have plainly taught us. Furthermore, let him tell us who can, why they, as well as other men, ſhould not be obliged to obſerve the Sabbath, by the Divine Law: for we know, that a determined time to perform a certain worſhip, is no leſs neceſſary to them than others. But many reaſons there were for which God might reprove the Heathen, and yet move no controverſie againſt them, about the Sabbath; either becauſe its inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was grown obſolete amongſt many of the Gentiles, (though not all) or becauſe they had violated the whole worſhip of God: for which cauſe he reprehends them: yet he reproves them not for the Sabbath by name, as being the time of worſhip: becauſe the Sabbath was onely ordained for performing the true worſhip of the true God: now the <hi>Gentiles</hi> worſhipped not God, but Idols; therefore God accuſeth them of Idolatry, and not for neglecting the Sabbath: and in vain would they have had regard of the Sabbath, while on the Sabbath they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped Idols, and not God, the author of the Sabbath. I might alſo add here, that it's not manifeſt, that all the ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Heathens were reprehended in Scripture particularly. But the famous <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet</hi> doth anſwer this objection more at large:<note place="margin">Diſſert. de Sab. c. 9.</note> in whoſe learned anſwers, they that do not
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:66018:93"/>
abhorr the truth, cannot but acquieſce. And thus much for the reaſons againſt the opinion of the Sabbath being obſerved from the beginning of the world.</p>
                  <p>Now to the authorities by which others<note place="margin">The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities are weighed which deny that the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> kept the Sabbath.</note> buſie themſelves, to infringe this opinion: theſe are in number three. The firſt whereof is that of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 30. tells us, that <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God without Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and without the Sabbath. The ſecond is, of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> in his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> in whom it's read, <hi>that</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel <hi>and</hi> Enoch <hi>were juſt, without the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Sabbath; and after them,</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>and his poſterity, untill</hi> Moſes <hi>pleaſed God.</hi> And after he adds, <hi>Before</hi> Moſes <hi>there was no need of celebrating the Sabbath.</hi> In the third place, <note n="a" place="margin">Adverſ. <hi>Jud.</hi> c. 2. &amp;c. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> is produced, in whom they read, that neither <hi>Adam</hi> nor his off-ſpring, <hi>Abel,</hi> or <hi>Noah,</hi> or <hi>Enoch,</hi> did keep the Sabbath. Theſe are the chief pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are brought againſt the contrary opinion; to which, before I anſwer, I might ſay, that the Judgments of other Fathers that affirm it, might be oppoſed to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of them that deny it. But, leſt by ſo ſaying, I ſhould ſeem to ſet together the grave Fathers amongſt themſelves, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, firſt, He that equally weigheth the foreſaid teſtimonies, ſhall eaſily obſerve, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:66018:93"/>
the Fathers intention in the foreſaid places, was this; that they might teach, that men were not juſtified by obſerving of the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath.</hi> This at the firſt bluſh will appear to him that views the places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Irenaeus</hi> he ſpeaks of the multitude of<note place="margin">Ubi prius.</note> them that were juſt before <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and were juſtified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe, (namely, without Circumciſion and the Sabbath.) It was therefore <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his purpoſe, to prove that the Sabbath, or Circumciſion were not the perfecting of righteouſneſs: neither doth <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſimply ſpeak of the obſervation of the Sabbath, but of its obſervation in order to juſtification; which thing his words do declare And <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> had the ſame meaning, who diſputed againſt <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf means <hi>by which mercy might befall him from God,</hi> (as <hi>Trypho</hi> ſpeaks) amongſt which he reckons the Sabbath and Circumciſion, <hi>that he might have ſome hope of ſalvation.</hi> Whilſt the bleſſed Martyr op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth himſelf to this mans purpoſe, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, <hi>that all the foreſaid Fathers who kept the Sabbath, pleaſed not God.</hi> Yet doth he not affirm, that the obſervation of the Sabbath was unknown to them: but he grants, that the Fathers were not juſtified by it: which they alſo confeſs, who hold faſt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66018:94"/>
opinion, confirmed to be true by a long ſeries of authorities.</p>
                  <p>It was not therefore the purpoſe of the Reverend Fathers, to define, whether the Sabbath was ſimply obſerved of the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi> or not? Onely they affirm, that by its obſervation they obtained not righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before God, nor for that cauſe did they obſerve it: as the Jews did contend in this queſtion, with whom the Fathers had to do.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Tertullian</hi> is not to be expounded otherwiſe, who attended this alſo, that he might ſhew againſt the Jews, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were not juſtified by Circumciſion, the Sabbath, or the works of the Law. His words do teſtifie this. For he ſayes, <hi>adverſ.</hi> Jud. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>He that contendeth, that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is yet to be obſerved, as a medicine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, muſt teach, that thoſe who obſerved the Sabbath formerly are juſt,</hi> &amp;c. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon what were formerly objected do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: which in this manner being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, according to the ſcope of the Author, without any injury to the words, do make nothing againſt the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Sabbath from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: eſpecially whereas <hi>Tertullian</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as formerly we obſerved, hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that the <hi>Jews</hi> do confeſs, <note n="a" place="margin">Adv. Jud. c. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>that Gods
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66018:94"/>
reſting on it, did from the beginning ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the ſeventh day.</hi> The truth of which aſſertion, <hi>Tertullian</hi> no where calls into queſtion: for if he had not taken it for true, then he would not have granted it without a reproof in any wiſe, for their ſakes; but would have uſed one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpretation, either to avoid, or clear that place, out of <hi>Geneſis</hi> 2. 2, 3. which yet he no where does. The ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification therefore of the ſeventh day from the Creation, for which the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſtood, is granted by <hi>Tertullian:</hi> out of whom it is fetch'd, that there was the uſe of the Sabbath before the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, which alſo <hi>Tertullian</hi> granteth muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue when that ceaſeth.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, in the ſecond place, I anſwer, that theſe, and the like places, if any be, amongſt the Fathers, which ſeem to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that the Sabbath was not obſerved before <hi>Moſes,</hi> are not ſo much to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Sabbath it ſelf, or the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſeventh day, as of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> obſervation thereof, and its abuſe to Juſtification before God: for they contend, either that for its obſervation eternal life befell not the Patriarchs, or that it was not obſerved before <hi>Moſes,</hi> according to the Ceremonies, wherewith it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66018:95"/>
celebrated of the <hi>Jews;</hi> neither ought it to be obſerved after the coming of Chriſt: which things are affirmed by none at all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In the foreſaid teſtimonies, the Fathers had to do with the <hi>Jews,</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded the Jewiſh Sabbath on the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:</hi> for which cauſe, when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mention the Sabbath, they ſpeak of it ſomewhat diſhonourably, if we look at the Name and Ceremonies of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: but if we underſtand the thing it ſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Lords day, they have extolled the Sabbath with wonderful praiſes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when they plead againſt the Jewiſh Sabbath, they altogether reject it, but when they appoint it to be celebrated in the Chriſtian manner, they greatly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Criticks, which are well exerciſed in the writings of the Fathers, teach us, that it is an uſual thing with the Fathers, while with all their might they decline one errour, they oftentimes do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall into another, or ſeem in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſort to fall into it: like Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (as prettily the learned <hi>Rivet,</hi> in <hi>Prolegom.</hi> in <hi>Crit. ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r.</hi> cap. 11.) who labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſtraiten a crooked ſtick, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exceed meaſure, and bend the plant
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66018:95"/>
into a contrary and diverſe form: ſo they know it very often falls out with the moſt grave Fathers, who peruſe their diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with their adverſaries: for while they contend with their enemies, out of an earneſt deſire to ſmite them, they have ſometimes even ſtruck their own compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> heat againſt the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi> carried him from the explication of the Text, and thoſe things which he purpoſed to aſſert. This thing, <hi>Austin</hi> himſelf, when he had finiſhed his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, ſignified to <hi>Poſſidonius,</hi> and others that dined with him. So <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> relateth it in the Life of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> chapter 15. And as the truth of this thing hath appeared in other queſtions, ſo in this of the Sabbath. For while <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and before him, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Martyr,</hi> have declared the foreſaid opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about the Sabbath, their work was with the <hi>Jews,</hi> who, as we ſaid, obtruded the Sabbath on the Chriſtians, as though without its obſervation, none could obtain eternal life. Which errour, while the grave Fathers ſtudied to ſhun, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this opinion of the Sabbath, (if in the teſtimonies cited this was their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) being obſerved all that time, from the Creation until <hi>Moſes:</hi> in expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which opinion, although they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:66018:96"/>
thought to ſmite the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet conſidered they not, how unwarily they wounded their own companions, who, to their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, were diligent to defend the contrary: whoſe opinions we have formerly recited in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, None that is but meanly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in the writings of the Fathers, can be ignorant, that ſome more hard ſayings do often occurr in them; which, unleſs they be expounded by other places in them, are not eaſily to be admitted. <hi>Chryſostom</hi> ſaith, in his later Sermon <hi>De utilitate ex obſcurita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te prophetiarum,</hi> in <hi>Savils</hi> Edition, <hi>Before Christs coming, faith in Chriſt was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the</hi> Jews: which words, without a candid interpretation, are not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: for if they be taken abſolutely, they agree not with the Holy Scriptures, as appears from <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. in which it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, that the Saints before the former co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, did rely upon him by Faith, and for their Faith are commended: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the genuine ſenſe of this place is to be found out of another place in his former Sermon, <hi>pag.</hi> 652. where, of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>they looked for the Lamb of God to come; that ſhould take away the ſins of the world:</hi> of which the later place affordeth no ſmall light to the Interpretation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66018:96"/>
In like manner are we to judge in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the foreſaid teſtimonies of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, wherein the Sabbath is denied to be obſerved from the beginning of the world: whoſe meaning is to be expounded from thoſe Fathers in other places, or from others that were their contemporaries. If any there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have a mind to find out <hi>Tertullians</hi> mind <hi>Adv. Jud.</hi> cap. 2. let him compare him with <hi>Tertullian</hi> adv. <hi>Mercion.</hi> lib. 4. cap. 12. where he ſhall find him acknowledging, that the Sabbath was holy from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. We may judge the ſame of the other authorities which are cited, whoſe ſenſe is to be ſought out either by other places of thoſe authors, or by other writers that were contemporaries with them. The words of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> do roundly enough expound their ſcope, as before we have heard by them, both which do only contend for this, that they may teach, that the ancient Fathers were not juſtified by <hi>the Sabbath and Circumciſion,</hi> and add no more.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THus far of the firſt <hi>Epocha,</hi> in which we have found, that from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, one day in the weekly compaſs was to be ſet apart for the ſolemn performing of the worſhip of God: and for the ſecond, from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſts reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, none doubteth, therefore I'le add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it: and will come to the third <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> of which is the greateſt controverſie, namely, Whether under the Goſpel, in the compaſs of a week, one day be to be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? Some men of great name do deny this, and ſome do ſtrongly affirm it: which later opinion being grounded upon ſo many teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and reaſons of the ancients, and the continual practiſe of the Chriſtian Church, I freely embrace: for this is neither a new,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66018:97"/>
nor an unheard of aſſertion, but by ſeveral Divines of a well exerciſed judgment, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently manifeſted to all pious ſouls, and prone to the fear of God: in demonſtrating whereof, they have recourſe to the morality of the fourth Command in the Decalogue, whoſe moral part is perpetual: for it is one of the ten words of God, engraven by his own hand in Tables of Stone, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 28. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 13. out of which number, if the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath ſhould be expunged, there would only nine remain. Now the Moral part of the Decalogue (<hi>which remaineth alſo in the new Law,</hi> Bonavent. <hi>l.</hi> 3. q. 37. p. 781.) as <hi>Alexander Hales</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">qu. 32. fol. 134.</note> once wittily, <hi>is ſaid to be ſo two manner of wayes, one way which is of the very eſſence of the Decalogue, according to the primary intention, and ſo vacation to a time indeterminately is moral in the Decalogue: another way it's ſaid to be moral, in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, which is to determine the Decalogue, and according to this vacation on the Lords day, is moral in the Decalogue, in the time of grace, as the ſeventh day in the time of the Law, and that is moral by diſcipline,</hi> i. e. by Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: and therefore, even by the ſole inſtinct of nature, it muſt needs be granted, that man at ſome time muſt attend upon God: yea, nature it ſelf dictates, that ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient dayes be ſet apart to perform his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:66018:98"/>
And who is to determine thoſe dayes, but him, whoſe <hi>the day and night are? Pſal.</hi> 74. 15. So <hi>Alexander Hales. The obſervance of a day indeterminately, that at ſome time we ſhould attend on God, is moral in nature, and immutable; but the obſervance of a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate time, is moral by diſcipline, by the adding of Divine institution.</hi> Afterwards he ſaith, <hi>when that time ought to be, is not for man to determine, but God:</hi> becauſe it is his part to define the certain time for worſhip, whoſe it is to preſcribe the worſhip it ſelf: it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not to inferiours, whoſe part it is to perform offices to others, to determine of a fit time to perform them in: Superiours, to whom they are to be exhibited, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe others, when, <hi>ex officio,</hi> they ought to attend theſe.</p>
                  <p>Nor can it be otherwiſe, becauſe if the way of ſetting apart the time for worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God in ſhould not depend upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, the mind of man would hang pendulous in this buſineſs: neither would it appear to us, what dayes would be ſufficient: ſince, if we look at Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits conferred upon us, it would not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to conſecrate the whole courſe of our life to this work: and if we look at our covetouſneſs, and ſloth, how many of us would ſuffer the very leaſt part of our time
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:66018:98"/>
(ſaith the famous Mr. <hi>D. G.</hi>) to be cut off either from our labour or reſt? A certain time is therefore to be defined of God, <hi>at leaſt for their ſakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who attend more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon this world than God,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, he that will not think much to compare the reaſon of the preſent age, with the times of <hi>Adam,</hi> the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> he ſhall ſee it equal and juſt to ſet apart in every ſeven dayes, one whole one for the worſhip of God. For why ſhould the Lord indulge a further liberty to the men of our age, in his ſervice, than he granted them? eſpecially when God, ſince he hath repealed his Goſpel, is more propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to us, than to them. Farther, if we weigh the nature of our preſent men, we ſhall find for certain, that no leſs time is required to the inſtructing of them, than of

the ancients. And to conclude, relaxation from labour is no leſs neceſſary in this age, to ſervants, and thoſe that live under other mens government, than to men in former ages. He that without prejudice weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe things, cannot deny, that one day in ſeven is as well to be ſet apart for the publick worſhip of God by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as men of the former age. I will add nothing of the nature of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, never abrogated by the bleſſed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt. Faith in Chriſt makes not void the Law, the matter of which, all men acknowledge to be written in mens hearts from the Creation, the great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle being witneſs: although we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2. that the ceremonial and typical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation thereof, being fulfilled by Chriſts coming in the fleſh, be now ceaſed. This doth alſo <hi>Irenaeus</hi> witneſs, <hi>adv. haereſ.</hi> l. 4. c. 31. who affirmeth, that God ſpoke the words of the Decalogue immediately by himſelf, and thereupon they remain perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and fixed with us, admitting of exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and augmentation, but no diſſolution by the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh. So St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32. <hi>Fulfill the Law,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which the Lord thy God came not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, but to fulfill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:66018:99"/>And certainly, no body that throughly weighs with himſelf the morality of that precept, will doubt, that the ſolemnity of the Lords day grew up by vertue of the fourth Command in the Decalogue: For it is granted of all, that the ſubſtance of the Command, included in theſe words, (<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to keep holy the Sabbath day,</hi> i. e. the day of reſt, not as the ſeventh day) is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and to be continued for ever. But if the Lords day feſtivity be not bottomed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the authority of this command, then that morality doth plainly periſh: when now there is not any other weekly Sabbath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Lords day; without which, as I ſaid, the Moral part of the Sabbath in the New Teſtament would not remain. By right therefore, as <hi>Alexander Hales</hi> hath it, <hi>the vacation of the Lords day is the Moral part of the Decalogue in the time of grace, as the ſeventh day in the time of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſome may with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doubt, why the Jewiſh Sabbath ſhould be tranſlated to the Lords day, (which yet we ſee hath been done for above one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred years) if ſo be that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians be not obliged to obſerve the fourth Command, as it is moral: whenas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would be no need of any feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val to ſucceed in place of the ancient Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66018:100"/>
But becauſe that Law doth perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bind all the worſhippers of <hi>God</hi> to the obſervation of the Sabbath, it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows, that the day on which the Sabbath is to be obſerved, muſt be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by ſome poſitive Law, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by God for this purpoſe, to be the ſeventh day in the Old Covenant, and the the firſt in the New. <hi>For it's not for man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Alexander Hales, quaeſt.</hi> 32. <hi>fol.</hi> 128. <hi>to determine, but God, when that time is,</hi> &amp;c. It's in Gods power only, to define a fit time for performing his worſhip.</p>
                  <p>But we read this queſtion of the Morality of the fourth Command, diſcuſſed at large by divers: amongſt whom, the famous <hi>Wallaeus</hi> doth it moſt excellently, who, to the great fruit of the Church, hath copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly taught us, what is Ceremonial, and what Moral, in writing of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Sabbath. I will not therefore add any more about this queſtion, but do ſend the Reader to the learned labours of others, in which this queſtion is exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. I will only add this one thing for a concluſion, out of the obſervations of this Learned Divine, namely an explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sabbath's being a ſign between God and men.</p>

He hath commanded, ſaith <hi>Philo,</hi> de Decalogo, <hi>that whoſoever recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe Inſtitutions, as in other things, ſo in this alſo, they ſhould follow God, in working ſix dayes, and reſting the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, and attending on the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things, and ſtudy of VViſdome,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>A day in every week is to be ſanctified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, which is not the ſeventh, but firſt: the celebrating of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath, <hi>Col. 2. 16.</hi> and <hi>Gal. 4. 10.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined: the places whereon the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Day in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is bottomed. The Fathers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge its Divine authority: neither can the Church change that day, and ſubſtitute another in its place.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Stated Day in every Week being granted, to perform Gods Worſhip on, it remaineth now farther to find out what day is determined by God for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſince the Light of the Goſpel was up and down diſperſed. And whereas thus far we have ſpoken of the <hi>Jews Sabbath,</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, in the ſecond place, to be conſidered, Whether Chriſtians, or no, be bound by the Fourth Command in the Decalogue, to ſanctifie one day weekly? Amongſt equal eſtimates of things (ſaith the foreſaid Learned Divine) it cannot but be without
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:66018:103"/>
controverſie, that it is as well for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as Jews, having finiſhed their labours on the ſix dayes, to ſanctifie the ſeventh, that with the Jews they acknowledge that they worſhip the moſt bleſſed and Almighty God, the Maker of Heaven and Earth. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in this both <hi>Jew</hi> and Chriſtian do agree, that when they have ſpent ſix dayes in their labours, on the ſeventh they ſhould reſt: yet they differ amongſt themſelves in the determination, or deſignation of the day deſtined to this holy reſt. For the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans keep holy that day, which to the Jews was the firſt in the week, and call it the <hi>Lords day,</hi> that they might prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſervants of God, who, in the dawning of that day ſubdued the Devil, that ſpiritual <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and redeemed his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from a ſpiritual ſervitude, by raiſing up <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord from the dead:</hi> who hath regenerated the Chriſtian Church, not unto a ſublunary <hi>Canaan,</hi> but unto a lively hope of an immortal inheritance, preſerved for us in the Heavens. And, that I may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch in a word, The Chriſtian, by ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Lords day, doth proſeſs that he is a Chriſtian; that is, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> interprets<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead.</hi> Hence it eaſily appears, that both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (though the ſame day
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:66018:103"/>
be not ſolemnized amongſt them both) were led by the ſame reaſon to ſanctifie the ſeventh day: which, to the <hi>Jews,</hi> might call to mind their liberty reſtored from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſervitude of a worldly <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> from a ſpiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, leſt any one ſhould object unto me, Chriſtians might profeſs this, by ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt day in the week: I add more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, they could not do ſo by right: for if the Chriſtians ſhould keep holy day after the manner of the Jews, then they would declare, that their ſpiritual Redemption was not yet perfected, but yet did look for it: eſpecially whenas the Redemption of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was a type and pledge of our future and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual liberty by Chriſt: and the inheritance of the earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> which thoſe that were freed from <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, did ſeek after, prefigured a celeſtial inheritance, (which the redeemed by the holy Blood of Chriſt, did look for.) Since therefore the ſhadow vaniſhed when the body was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, we muſt not believe in God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling future things by types and ſhadows: but in him that hath moſt faithfully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed the truth, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies foretold by him.

                  <p>The holy writings of the Apoſtles do<note place="margin">The ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jewiſh Sabbath, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16.</note> teſtifie, that the obſervation of the Jewiſh Sabbath, as well as other feſtivals in uſe amongſt them, is removed from off the Chriſtians ſhoulders. So St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Col. 2. 16. <hi>Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink, or in reſpect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath dayes.</hi> In that Chapter, while the Apoſtle mentions vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous corruptions of the Sacred Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he teacheth will be profitable for the Church, diligently to ſhun, he reckons up three ſorts of them: the firſt whereof, by falſe teachers, was drawn from Philoſophy, the ſecond from humane traditions, the third from the rudiments of the world. Now by the rudiments of the world, he means, the pedagogy of <hi>Moſes:</hi> out of which, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. he brings forth two cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, to wit, of the choice of meats prohibited by the Law, and ſanctifying of Feſtivals obſerved under the ſame. Amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> there were divers Feaſts, ſome of great name and authorty, celebrated yearly, namely, of the Paſſover, Pentecoſt, and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles: and then, beſides theſe, they ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:66018:105"/>
their New Moons every Month, and their Sabbath every week: the Apoſtle affirms, that all theſe Feſtivals (which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a manner, were the ſhadow of Chriſt to come, and Chriſt their truth and body, that is, they did portend what afterwards, were truly exhibited of Chriſt) had their end, when Chriſt was once come: for when the body is come, the ſhadow vaniſheth. <hi>Even as in the Emperours abſence his image</hi>

There was a time when they were to be trained up by the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but he that follows the ſhadow, when the body is preſent, is deceived. Therefore from that place of the Apoſtle, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Jewiſh Sabbath (of which he ſpeaks, under the number of a Multitude, <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> becauſe it was celebrated every week, and ſeldome do we meet with it in the ſingular number, as before was obſerved) is ceaſed by the coming of Chriſt, or that Chriſt is not yet come.</p>

                     <hi>Origen</hi> grants, <note n="b" place="margin">Hom. 232 in Num.</note> 
                     <hi>that every holy and just man ought to obſerve the Sabbath's feſtival:</hi> and he ſhews how this muſt be done: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he yet ſpeak of that ſpiritual Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, of which we meet with frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Fathers, but of the Chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which now is ſucceeded into place of the former Sabbath; which he ſhews by the works that are to be done on that day. <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Judaical obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the Sabbath, let us ſee how the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to obſerve the Sabbath.

                     <hi>Ruffinus</hi> contendeth for obſerving the Sabbath, though not carnally, or in Jewiſh delights. To theſe let be added, a place in <hi>Conſtit. Apoſt.</hi> lib. 7. cap. 37. which
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:66018:108"/>
tells us, that the Lords day ſupplies the room of the Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things argue, that the pious Fathers did not under the Goſpel explode that precept in the Decalogue about the Sabbath: and therefore ſometimes under the name of the Sabbath, which to them the Lords day is ſignified, as we have ſeen chap. 3. For they yield, that Chriſt fulfilled, and not deſtroyed the Law by his coming; and that Chriſtians are to rejoyce on the Sabbaths feſtival, and that the ſolemnity of this feſtival is grounded on the Command in the Decologue: and ſeem only to ſtand for this, that now it ſhould not be in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner celebrated of Chriſtians, that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> They celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Sabbath on the ſeventh day, and flinging off the weighty care of godlineſs, gave themſelves up to idleneſs, and delights of this world; but the Fathers taught, that Chriſtians ought not ſo to keep the Sabbath, who ſhould keep the firſt day of the week holy, not carnally, but ſpiritually. For they judged it far better under the light of purer Chriſtianity (as after ſhall appear) to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour on the Sabbath, than to attend on the alluring pleaſures of the world.</p>
                  <p>But though they abhorred the Jewiſh manner of obſerving the Sabbath, <hi>yet they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:66018:109"/>
alwayes ordained one day of the ſeven</hi> (as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>to be bestowed in the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hom. 2. in Joh.</note> 
                     <hi>worſhip and ſervice of the common Lord of us all.</hi> And therefore paſſing by the abrogating of obſerving the Sabbath, in the Jewiſh manner, being confirmed by teſtimonies both of Scriptures and Fathers; Thirdly, it remains to be conſidered, what may be brought from the ſame fountains to aſſert the authority of obſerving the Lords day. For it is moſt ſure, that the Apoſtle (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though<note place="margin">The ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lords day is gathered from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> he call back in the foreſaid places the Church from obſerving the feſtival of the Sabbath in the Jewiſh manner) doth not forbid Chriſtians all obſerving of every day: otherwiſe the Apoſtle himſelf had given an offence to the Church, in keeping the Lords day with a Church, (which it appears he did, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.) which to think of him, the candour of a Chriſtian mind will not admit. Therefore we doubt not, but by the Apoſtle's ſentence (whom we believe did not ordain it by that ordinary power which yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in the Church) a certain day is to be employed about ſpiritual labour: otherwiſe the Church had not met at a ſtated time in the dayes of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>And whereas a certain day is appointed, whereon weekly Divine worſhip is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only, that neither diminiſheth, nor
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66018:109"/>
aboliſheth Chriſtian liberty; it only direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſtians, that their minds fluctuate not in obſerving it: which is not to deſtroy Chriſtian liberty, but rightly to inſtruct Chriſtians in the uſe thereof, the better, that they miſs it not in performing ſervice to their God. Now for the weekly conventions of the Chriſtian Church, no day was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of the Apoſtles but the Lords day: the firſt mention whereof in their writings, we meet with, is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. where <hi>John</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 10.</note> ſaith, that he was in the ſpirit on the Lords day. And although that be the firſt time that it's mentioned in the Scriptures under that appellation, yet might it, before <hi>John</hi> writ the <hi>Revelation,</hi> be known in the Church by that name. No Evangeliſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>John</hi> called Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>the Lords day,</hi> before; not as by ſome new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which lately was eſtabliſhed in the Church, but as a thing well known to the Church: otherwiſe he would not ſo have named that day, without farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, but that he knew for certain it was named in the Church by that agnomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which ſhews, that the Lords day was celebrated in the Church, before that <hi>John</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:66018:110"/>
was in the Spirit. Neither could the Lords day be ſo ſolemn, throughout all Churches in <hi>John's</hi> time, but that all the Apoſtles before him had diſperſed abroad this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it appears from Scripture alſo, that this day was by Apoſtolical ordination deſtined to the collecting of almes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 2.</note> 16. 2. Where he gives order, that upon the firſt day of the week every one ſhould lay by him in ſtore the Collection for the Saints, of which he had ſpoken in the former verſe. The primary intention indeed of that place is, to give order about the collections made for relieving the neceſſity of the poor; but ſince he orders, that they may be made on the Lords day, there is no doubt but he changes them to celebrate the day it ſelf. For whenas he requires the end, why ſhould he not alſo preſcribe the means directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to that end? without doubt the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which was on that day to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, preſuppoſeth the day it ſelf: and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the end, the command of the means is alwayes included, without which we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not the end.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> do teſtifie,<note place="margin">Ubi ſupra</note> that almes were collected on that day (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by authority of the aforeſaid Apoſtolical ordination) which they had laid by them in ſtore till this day, as we have ſeen in the ſecond chapter.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it alſo appears by the Scripture, that on that day aſſemblies were held, for hearing the Word, and adminiſtring the Euchariſt: which are chiefly to be counted amongſt the ſacred offices of holy dayes. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as in the ſecond Chapter, although he abode ſeven dayes at <hi>Troas,</hi> we read<note place="margin">Act. 20.</note> not that the Diſciples met to break bread but on the firſt day of the week. Whence it is collected conveniently, that even then the Church had on that day ſolemn conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:66018:112"/>
to perform the ſacred exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion on, in the preaching of the Word, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did this cuſtome grow out of uſe with the ſucceeding Church (as after, when we ſhall treat of ſanctifying the Lords day, we will ſhew) but the devout preaching of Gods Word being happily begun on that day by the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1. was ever after continued at the ſame time to the honour of God, and profit of the Church.</p>
                  <p>From the three foreſaid places of the New<note place="margin">in 4 praec. c. 7.</note> Teſtament, and teſtimonies of various Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and Verſions of the Scripture, the learned <hi>Wallaeus</hi> concludes, that <hi>the uſe of the Lords day is to be referred to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi> And whatever is brought of ſome in their Expoſitions to the contrary, is ſolidly by him weighed and refuted.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We have ſhewn in the ſecond chapter of this Treatiſe, that the Lords day was ordinarily ſolemnized by the Church, while the Apoſtles were living, and the preheminence of it above other dayes, which the ſucceeding Church hath conſecrated to Gods worſhip, in the third Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Since therefore the Holy Scriptures do<note place="margin">Its inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</note> plainly bear witneſs of the name and uſe of this day, (for the name which the Church ever after uſed, is by St. <hi>John</hi> expreſſed, <hi>Rev.</hi>

                  <p>And theſe are the things with which I am perſwaded to believe, that the Sabbaths feſtival, by Divine authority (which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from God by the Apoſtles) was tranſlated to the Lords day: for he onely <hi>who is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> can change the Sabbath day, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. 28.

men know, that that is grounded on the word of God, which is either expreſſed in ſo many words in Scripture, or elſe by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of neceſſary conſequence, is drawn out from thence: and in this later way, the beſt of our Divines affirm, that we meet with in Scripture the inſtitution of the Lords day, as at large, and pithily the famous Mr. <hi>D.

Secondly, Apoſtolical practice is a ſign of Gods will in this buſineſs: they obſerved this day, and commended it to be obſerved by others: and if their practice in this particular had been doubtful, the perpetual and conſtant cuſtome of the Church, from the Apoſtles age (which illuſtrates their practice in doubtfuls, and confirms it in plain things) doth moſt evidently demonſtrate this.

                  <p>With theſe ſame arguments doth that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and learned Divine teach the Church to defend the truth againſt its adverſaries.

The Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ordained, that ſacred Baptiſme is not<note place="margin">Baptiſme not to be repeated.</note> to be repeated: touching which prohibition we meet with nothing in the ſacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords: but becauſe Circumciſion (into whoſe place Baptiſme ſucceeded) was not repeated: becauſe it's agreeable with reaſon that regeneration, no leſs than generation, ſhould be but once: becauſe in the Scriptures examples of once ſprinkling only do occurr: and laſtly, becauſe the Orthodox Church
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:66018:114"/>
of God hath hitherto abhorred <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> therefore all grant that Baptiſme is not to be repeated. I will add no more. What hath been ſaid, declares to them that deſpiſe not truth, that the <hi>Lord made the</hi>

                     <hi>day, on which the Stone which the builders refuſed, was made the head ſtone of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that on it we ſhould rejoyce.</hi> But ſince it is not my purpoſe to handle any queſtions on this ſubject, but leave them to others to be diſcuſſed, I will return to my undertaken task; namely, to enumerate the teſtimonies of the ancients on this particular: by which it will be made manifeſt, that the Fathers were of no other mind: becauſe they contended, that this day was religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to be obſerved, and fetch'd the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, wherein they aſſerted this, out of the holy Scriptures. To the truth of which thing, we will firſt bring <hi>Athanaſius, Homil. de ſemente. In time paſt, with the ancients, the Sabbath was of great account: which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity the Lord tranſlated to the Lords day: neither do we ſet light of the Sabbath, by our ſelves.</hi> Where, firſt, he with the finger points at the author of the Lords Feſtival, namely, Chriſt; whom he tells us, tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Sabbath day into the Lords: and then denies, that the Church of her ſelf, or by her own authority, did ordain that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66018:115"/>
for, ſaith he, <hi>we ſet, not light by the Sabbath of our ſelves.</hi> Therefore <hi>Athanaſius</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sabb. Circum.</note> being Judge, it appears, that the Church doth not of her ſelf, but by the authority of Chriſt; whereby the Lords day was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, obſerve its ſolemnity, and <hi>honour it,</hi> as he elſe where ſpeaketh. And let it move no<note place="margin">Obj.</note> body, that while he expreſſeth the honour wherewith the Church honoureth it, he doth not ſpeak in that manner of its inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as of the Sabbath; of which, when he ſpeaks, he ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

When Subjects do openly profeſs that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66018:115"/>
they with all honour do honour their own Kings and Magiſtrates, ſhall not I therefore conclude, that they are not obliged by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority to this duty? No verily: but the Subjects perform this to their Princes, with a moſt ready will, becauſe by Divine Law and authority they are bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this duty: So Chriſtians honour the Lords day, becauſe the Divine inſtitution of this Feſtival by Chriſt (which <hi>Athanaſius</hi> makes mention of in the ſame place) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires this by right of them.</p>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:66018:117"/>
ariſes not from the foreſaid prerogatives, but is founded in the authority of God the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutor.) I am more eaſily induced to believe with the ancients, its ſolemnity was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God.</p>
                  <p>Here I could, out of the Fathers, tell you, the puniſhments of ſome that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the ſolemnity of the Lords Day. In <hi>Concil. Pariſienſi</hi> ſo we read; <hi>Many</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Can. 50.</note> 
                     <hi>of us, by the ſight of our own countrey men, and many of us by the relation of others, have been informed, that certain men exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing on this day their rural works, have been ſlain with Lightning, others puniſhed with contraction of their limbs, others ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their bodies and bones alſo conſumed in an instant by viſible fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on a ſudden reſolved into aſhes, have died in great torment; as many other terrible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been, and to this day are; by which it is declared, that God is offended at the diſhonour of ſo great a day.</hi> Theſe tremendous judgments of God do ſhew, that God, the avenger of all ſin, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, (as the Fathers ſpeak) at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious violators of this ſolemnity. But if the holy feſtival of the Lords Day were not Gods own ordinance, his ſevere anger would not be ſo hot upon thoſe that are guilty of the violation thereof.</p>

                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:66018:118"/>We therefore of right do eſteem the Lords Day above other dayes, and that by reaſon of its ſolemnity: becauſe it was by a poſitive determination of Chriſt by the Apoſtles ſet apart from other days in the week, that it might ſupply the room of the ancient Sabbath; that it might preſerve Religion, and the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worſhip of God, both publick, leſt <hi>the diſorderly congregating of the people,</hi>

                  <p>Laſtly, It only remaineth, that this<note place="margin">The Church cannot change the Lords day to another.</note> queſtion may ſufficiently be ſatisfied, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in the Churches power to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Lords Day, and ſubſtitute ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in its room? Surely he that ſaith, that ſo innocent a cuſtome, ſo long received of the Church, and that through authority of God by the Apoſtles, caught not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a change, ſeems to be in the right: unleſs any think, that now great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

None in this found mind can grant, that things ordained by the Apoſtles, can be changed of the Church. I confeſs, all the ordinances of the Apoſtles were not of the ſame kind: for ſome of them pertained to Doctrine, ſome to rites, as <hi>Wallaeus</hi> obſerves, chap. 7. thoſe are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, neither any wayes obnoxious to change: he muſt be anathematized, that preacheth any other Goſpel than what we have received from the Apoſtles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. but theſe which reſpect the rites or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Divine worſhip, are of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature: for either their cauſes were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and ſuch as perpetually ſhould not have place in the Church: therefore theſe ordinances were to be varied, becauſe when the cauſe was taken away, the ordinances themſelves ceaſed: but other ordinances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting rites, were not to be changed, whoſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:66018:119"/>
occaſions perpetually continued in the Church; ſuch was the laying on of hands in the ordinations of Miniſters: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the cauſes of ordinances made by the Apoſtles, are changed, the ordinations themſelves are to be changed, but while the cauſe remains, the ordinances alſo remain unmoved. Which things being conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it's eaſie to ſee, that the ordinance about the Lords day is not to be varied: becauſe no greater cauſe than what it's bottomed on, can ever occurr, for whoſe ſake it ſhould be changed: neither hath the Church ever thus far ſince the Apoſtles age, once attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this. Therefore the foreſaid queſtion is, ſuperfluous, that I may ſay no worſe, and altogether unworthy a farther anſwer; eſpecially, whenas we know, that many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges neceſſary for a Church to be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were granted by God to the Apoſtles, which were not derived from them to the Doctors of the Church founded: for they were perſonal, and could not lawfully be challenged by others: which is ſhewn more at large in the ſeventh chapter.</p>

in the reſt, and ſecondly, in the ſanctification of this reſt: and in the obſervation of theſe things, their records will inform us, that the Lords day was ſolemnized by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</p>
                  <p>As for the reſt, the Church of Chriſt hath<note place="margin">How far we muſt reſt from labour on the Lords day.</note> uſed it, not as neceſſary of it ſelf to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, but only as an help thereto; without which, the worſhip commanded of God could not conveniently be performed of the people For, while men are intangled in the affairs of this world, they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly attend, as is fitting, on the things that pertain to God, and his worſhip. <hi>The Sabbath was not allowed for idleneſs, but that men being withdrawn from the cares of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, its reſt ſhould be ſpent in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals:</hi> as <hi>Chriſoſtom.</hi> Hom. 1. de <hi>Lazaro.

                  <p>For firſt, the very words of the Canon ſhew, that Chriſtians, as Chriſtians, ought on that day <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>to reſt:</hi> whence it appears, that labour on the Lords day is unlawful to Chriſtians. Now the exception which the Canon mentions (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>if they can,</hi> ought rather to be underſtood with a reſpect had to the time in which the Council was gathered, than to performing (namely of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt) labours. For the Council was aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> entred upon the Empire, at what time the inſeriour ſort of Chriſtians were compelled by their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Lords, to whom they were ſubject, and not of their own minds, to perform worldly works on that day, as on others: as a long time after that Council was congregated, the Chriſtians were forced to ſit and ſee the playes: for remedy whereof, the <hi>Africans</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Carthag. Concil. Can. 67. ap. Zonar.</note> ordain, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>that no Chriſtian ſhould be forced to thoſe playes.</hi> For their ſakes therefore, who were forced to labour by others, was that exception added by the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Fathers: not that labours uſed on that day were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66018:127"/>
by them, but becauſe of thoſe that were in bondage to others, and by their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere authority or impetuouſneſs, compelled to undergo them on the Lords dayes; I ſay, for the comfort of theſe, they put in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, if any contrary to their minds were forced by others to do ſo. Although divers that were ſtronger in the faith, rather died for it, than that they would any wayes vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Lords day: as formerly we heard out of <hi>Baronius,</hi> under the reign of <hi>Diocleſian.</hi> And that this, which we have brought, is the genuine ſenſe of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Canon, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers authorities of Fathers before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Laodicea</hi> (wherein Chriſtians are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited earthly labours) do ſhew: neither can there from thence any in this our age (in which all, God be thanked, have given up their name to Chriſt) take a pretence to defend the uſing of worldly labour on the Lords day, ſince now it is the faſhion as well of Maſters, as ſervants, to reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours on that day.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, that Civil Law, on whoſe authority <hi>Zonaras</hi> expoſition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, was made by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (of which briefly anon) wherein the countrey men had liberty freely to attend their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey labours on the Lords day. Now the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:66018:127"/>
                     <hi>Laodicean</hi> Fathers being gathered before the firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> could have no reſpect unto a law made ſome time after the meeting of their Council: but are to be underſtood, as I ſaid, according to the condition of that age, in which the Chriſtians, although they of themſelves reſted from labours, were by others compelled, that had not yet embraced the Chriſtian faith, to undergo them.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond Council of <hi>Matiſcon,</hi> Can. 1.<note place="margin">Conc. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſc. 2. <hi>Can. 1.</hi> is explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> about the year 588. it is ordained, <hi>that none give themſelves to labours, as on private dayes, as they ſpeak; for this is in a raſh manner to give up the Lords day to contempt.</hi> But the words of the Canon come a little more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to be examined, leſt, at the firſt ſight, the Reader be impoſed upon through ſome mens perverſe interpretation of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Fathers ordain, <hi>that if any have a Church near him,</hi> that he betake himſelf thither: Theſe words are not ſo to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, as if none were bound to be preſent at Church-meetings, but thoſe that had neighbouring Churches at hand, from which, they that lived farther off, might at their pleaſure be abſent. He that will atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively read the beginning of that Canon, will not ſay, that this was the ſenſe of the Biſhops in that Council: who had it put upon them by King <hi>Guntheramnus</hi>'s command, that by
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:66018:128"/>
all means they could, they look to, that the Chriſtian people ſhould not in a raſh manner give up the Lords day to contempt: and therefore the Biſhops admoniſhed all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in this matter, from which admonition they neither exempt Lawyers nor Countrey men, nor the Clergy, or Monks, as the words of the Canon do ſhew. And when <hi>Gunthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramnus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gunt. Ep. ad Epiſc. p. 704.</note> required it of them, <hi>that the body of all the people ſhould aſſemble on that day, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their devotion,</hi> he decrees, that thoſe who ſet at nought this admonition, ſhould by right be corrected with canonical ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the puniſhment of the Law. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he, by his own authority, according to the vigor of the Biſhops decree, allowed none a liberty to be abſent from Church aſſemblies, none can interpret the aforeſaid words of the Canon, as if only thoſe that are near to Churches, were bound to be preſent at them; ſince all, as well near as far off, are bound by one and the ſame law: when therefore they ſay, <hi>if any have a Church near him,</hi> it is the ſame with, <hi>Let all go to the Church:</hi> as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in <hi>Concil. Foroju.</hi> Can. 13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let none wonder, that the <hi>Mati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcon</hi> Fathers, reciting the exerciſes of the L. Day, in that Canon, do there only make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Prayers &amp; Hymns,</hi> as if there were no other exerciſes of piety, beſides Prayers and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:66018:128"/>
ſinging of Pſalms, to attend on that day: for afterwards, in the ſame Council, they have ordained ſomething of the Sacraments, <hi>Can.</hi> 6. And <hi>Guntheramnus</hi> doth faithfully charge his Biſhops, <hi>that by frequent preaching they ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to amend the people, by Gods providence committed to their charge.</hi> Therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that no offices of piety be pretermitted on that day. Nor do they define thoſe things only for the exerciſes of Hymns or Prayers, but peradventure they mention hymns and prayers, becauſe they direct the Canon to the people, whoſe part it was, to attend theſe offices, and celebrate the ſame, and not to preach the Word.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Fathers in the ſame place, ſay, <hi>The Lord doth not require of us to celebrate the Lords day by corporal abſtinence;</hi> Nor are theſe words ſo to be taken, as if we were not by virtue of a Divine precept, obliged to reſt from worldly affairs, and that vacation from worldly labours on that day were not a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, but humane ordinance. For the Fathers are intent on this, to teach them, that corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abſtinence, as they ſpeak, is not on the Lords day only required of us, but that God alſo ſeeks for that obedience, through which treading under foot all earthly actions, he may in his mercy advance us to Heaven. In that phraſe therefore, there is an <hi>Ellipſis,</hi> as
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66018:129"/>
appears from the premiſes, which the Holy Ghoſt often uſes in both the Teſtaments. As <hi>Gen. 32. 28. Thy name ſhall be called no more</hi> Jacob, <hi>but</hi> Iſrael; that is, thou ſhalt not only be called <hi>Jacob,</hi> but alſo <hi>Iſrael. 1. Sam. 8. 7. They have not deſpiſed thee, but me;</hi> that is, not only thee. 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 17. Chriſt ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel;</hi> that is, he was not only, or chiefly intent on baptizing thoſe that had embraced the Chriſtian faith. So here, they grant, that God requires the body to reſt from labour, but they affirm, that he doth not only require that: and they certifie all, if they diſeſteem their wholeſome counſel, that they ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of God; yet no vengeance of God would purſue them, where they tranſgreſſed a command preſcribed of him. It appears therefore, from the puniſhment, with which, according to theſe Fathers, the violation of this reſt is attended by God, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of all to reſt on the Lords day: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his anger would not wax hot againſt thoſe that pollute the holineſs of this Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, by worldly labours, or ſlothful idleneſs. And now theſe things do evidently enough ſhew, that gainful labour is to be avoided on the Lords day.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>How far forth on the Lords day we may attend labours, namely of neceſſity, and piety: Countrey men are boud to ſanctifie the Lords day: the indulgence granted to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men by <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and revoked: the fact of <hi>Paula,</hi> and practiſe of the <hi>Coenobita</hi> [or <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi>] in <hi>Hierom,</hi> is weighed: Alſo the ſenſe of a Canon in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Orleans.</hi> Manumiſſions, and certain tranſactions law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful on the Lords Day.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ALthough the Ancients thought that labour tending to gain, was on the Lords day by no means to be undertaken of Chriſtians: yet do they not require a ceſſation from all labour generally; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, do permit that, which men moved by neceſſity do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 11. where Chriſt teaches us, that a <hi>ſheep which is on the Sabbath day fallen into a pit,</hi> may lawfully be laid hold on, lift up, and drawn out: for no laws are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to neceſſity, which defendeth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it enforceth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:66018:130"/>It is ordained in the Council of <hi>Narbo, that every man, as well free-born, as ſervant, Goth, Roman, Syrian, Greek, or Jew, ſhould do no work on the Lords day, nor yoke oxen, except there be a neceſſity</hi> [murando] <hi>for walling [otherwiſe</hi> in metendo] <hi>for fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in corn.</hi> Can. 4. They therefore allow labour undertaken for neceſſity. Of which nature there are divers reſerved caſes, of which frequent mention is made in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals. In which number, is the taking of Fiſhes, which, unleſs they be then taken, cannot be taken at another time. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the catching of Herrings, which do appear ſeldome, or but upon certain dayes, to catch which (although ſome think it no caſe of preſent neceſſity) there is liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty granted whenever they appear. <hi>Decret. Greg.</hi> l. 2. <hi>de feriis, Tit. 9. cap. licet. &amp; Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Ep.</hi> l. 11. cap. 3. Although he denies that the body is to be waſhed on the Lords day, out of luxury of mind, or for pleaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, yet he condemns it not, neceſſity ſo requiring: whereby it appears, that under the name of baths, all things done out of neceſſity to the body are allowed.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth any one find fault with that bour that is beſtowed in the exerciſes of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: as being that which directly tends to the worſhip and glory of God, and doth

                  <p>In another caſe alſo, there is by ſome a certain indulging of labour yielded.

be preſent at the aſſemblies of the Church, as if they who had beſtowed their pains in tilling the earth, had forthwith forſworn their barbarity? And becauſe they who live in the Countrey, are as well Members of Chriſt as Citizens; why ſhould not Chriſt impart his communion as well to theſe as thoſe in the exerciſes of Religion, on the Lords dayes?

Whereas he knew that thoſe who were not turned Chriſtians, could not eaſily be brought in to be bound by the Chriſtians lawes, he yielded ſomething for theſe mens ſakes: and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was ſufficiently ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, for neglecting their idolatry: and <hi>therefore by little and little he ſtudied to draw them to the true worſhip of God;</hi> as <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, ubi ſupra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, the liberty of medling with countrey labours on the Lords day, was granted to countrey men only in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, which thing the very words of the indulgence do declare: <hi>leſt through occaſion of a moment, the profit yielded by the heavenly providence periſh:</hi> by the occaſion of one moment, the profit of fruits might periſh; therefore, in gathering in the fruits, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a regard of a moment may be had; no labours are therefore permitted, but to undergo which, they were induced by a certain neceſſity, leſt the fruits ſhould periſh; in which caſe alſo we have obſerved world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour is permitted.</p>
                  <p>That exception therefore of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi>

could to perſwade them to embrace the Chriſtian faith, and in caſe of neceſſity: which being afterwards continued a while, <hi>Leo</hi> declares void, by a new law ſet forth to the contrary, and calls that indulgence a decree differing from the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe <hi>Leo</hi> doth very aptly anſwer the reaſon of this indulgence aſſigned by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> I will ſet down his very words for the Readers ſake. <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is apparent that another law doth contradict that law which commands all to reverence the day of the Lords Reſurrection, by a ceſſation from labours, which determines, that all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are not prohibited working, &amp; others have a liberty to work,</hi> (for it ſaith, Let all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as above in the Law of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>) <hi>the cauſe of which profaning that day is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on no reaſon; (for although the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fruits may be pretended, yet that is of no weight, and in very deed is fooliſh: ſince not the diligence of husbandry, but the virtue of the Sun, when it ſeems good to the bestower of fruits, doth afford the abundance of fruits;) becauſe, I ſay, ſuch a law is come forth, as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſies the Lords worſhip, and is a decree differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thoſe that by the Holy Ghoſt have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the victory against all their adverſaries; we ordain alſo, which ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and the Apoſtles instituted of him,

that all perſons ceaſe from labour that day, whereon our innocency was reſtored</hi> (he ſpeaks of the Lords day) <hi>and let neither husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, nor any others, go about any unlawful work on that day. For if they who obſerved but a certain ſhadow and figure, did ſo greatly reverence the Sabbath day, that they wholly abstained from all labour; how is it not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for thoſe who honour the light of grace, and the truth it ſelf, to reverence that day, which is of God enriched with honour, and on which deliverance from ſhameful deſtruction was wrought for us?</hi> Thus <hi>Leo,</hi> Novel. 54. <hi>Leon.</hi> And ſo (according to that common Proverb, <hi>The later day is ſcholar to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>) what by too much facility, which ſuited not with the Lords ſolemnity, was formerly granted by them that followed, who ſaw the inconvenience of the former liberty, was afterwards amended.</p>

And of others <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>who on the Lords dayes did only attend
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:66018:136"/>
on Prayer and reading. Epist. ad Euſtochium de cuſtodia virginit.</hi> But <hi>Hierom</hi> ſayes not this, as if on the Lords day to attend the duties of piety, had been only appropriated to the <note n="*" place="margin">They that lived in a Monaſtery together.</note> 
                     <hi>Coenobitae,</hi> (of whom he ſpeaks: and other Chriſtians on that day had employed their work o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

But the Holy Father doth diſtinguiſh the works undertaken by the <hi>Coenobitae,</hi> on the Lords day, from others which they undertook on the other dayes of the week: on which they fell about <hi>ſtated works,</hi> (as he ſpeaks) <hi>and thoſe being ended, they attended on Prayer, and reading alſo: which thing they alſo did every day when they had ended their labours:</hi> but on the Lords day they were intent on nothing elſe but the duties of piety.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If it ſhould be granted, that thoſe women did attend their ordinary works on the Lords day, it was proper to them onely: and then what we muſt think of that fact appears out of St. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> who,<note place="margin">Epſt. 63.</note> while he affirms that the <hi>Aquarians</hi> did bottom on no author or will of Chriſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuateth this Doctrine to us, namely, <hi>that the cuſtome of ſome men is not to be followed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs firſt we enquire whom they followed:</hi> whoſe grave authority we may very fitly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate to the aforeſaid women. We are to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:66018:136"/>
conſider not only what thoſe women did, but upon what authority they did it. If they attended on the Lords day their daily works and labours, they were invited thereunto neither by the authorities of Chriſt, nor his holy Apoſtles, nor the lawful practiſe of the Church (which reſtrained Chriſtians from thoſe works.) And I believe no body of a ſound mind will impoſe as a law on other mens ſhoulders, a certain ſingular cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, confirmed by no law, or authority, but contrary to the general practice of the whole Church: eſpecially when <hi>Hierom</hi> himſelf, and other grave Fathers do conclude that nothing but the works of piety, or of ſome emergent neceſſity is to be done on that day, as formerly from their writings hath been obſerved.

                  <p>Laſtly, I'le only add this, What if thoſe ſilly women believed it to be a work of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by the example of <hi>Dorcas?</hi>

                     <hi>Hierom</hi> to <hi>Euagrius,</hi> while he was ſhewing what difference there was between a Biſhop, Elder, and Deacon, <hi>he would not have the cuſtom</hi> (in ſome ſort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his opinion) <hi>of one City</hi> (namely <hi>Rome</hi>) <hi>to be brought out againſt him, for,</hi> he being judge, <hi>the authority of the world was greater than the Citie's.</hi> And ſo I muſt ſay here. If an indulgence for them had grown into uſe with the reſt of the Church, or had been ſupported by reaſon, or any authority; then the ſentence of this (though Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial) Council had been of ſome weight: but in this their cuſtome being rejected of the Church up and down diſperſed, is not to be obtruded as a law upon all.</p>
                  <p>Then ſecondly, the Biſhops being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated in that Council, purpoſed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate (as they ſpeak) the Jewiſh obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath. And they yield theſe things, leſt they ſhould rather ſeem to ſet up a Jewiſh inſtitution, than Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: and the very words of the Canon do intimate, that the people were perſwaded that theſe things ought not to be done. I'le
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:66018:137"/>
add nothing of the corrupting that place (which <hi>Binius</hi> judges to be depraved) only let others judge what authority is to be given to it: it ſuffices us, that the Fathers with one conſent do interdict all Chriſtians earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affairs, and worldly works on Lords days, although ſome, abounding in their ſenſe, do ſeem to think otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, that I may put an end to this Chapter, two things now remain to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the Emperours Laws, made about the Lords Day, which, according to ſome, do mightily prejudice its ſolemnity: the firſt of theſe is conſidered in their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, and the ſecond in ſome certain tranſactions to be done on the Lords day: and ſince both of theſe are a civil office, ſome think that certain worldly things for that cauſe were to be done on that day, which were not works of piety. To add ſomewhat of both theſe offices, will not be far from our purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>I could alſo name another cauſe, aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fragments <hi>Conc. Toletan.</hi> Some

thought that they did a thing very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, and profitable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to their own ſouls, if in the Church of ſome Saint, in the preſence of the Biſhop, or the Prieſts there ſtanding, or the noble Laity, before the horn of the Altar of that Church, ſend out their ſervants free by a charter of abſolution and freedom from all bonds of ſervitude: But theſe ſuperſtitious Manumiſſions for reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the ſoul, as they ſpeak, were obſerved about the four hundredth year after Chriſt: but that formerly mentioned by <hi>Zonaras, Sozomen,</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> was the true cauſe why firſt the pious Emperours lookt to that theſe Manumiſſions were performed on the Lords day: which we do not ſee hindred the Lords ſolemnity.</p>
                  <p>As Manumiſſions do not obſcure this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, ſo certain tranſactions are lawful on the Lords day. Nor can this hinder it, that <hi>Leo,</hi> a moſt earneſt defender of the Lords feſtival, <hi>did indulge thoſe that were at odds</hi>

But all theſe things were granted by the Emperour, not for any worldly end, but for renewing their loſt friendſhip, which could not obſcure the honour of the feſtival, on which the things that pertained to peace and concord were permitted; for they then, as it were leaving their gift before the Altar, went their way, that they firſt might be reconciled to one another, and then come and offer their gift;<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 24.</note> which reconciliation could not be made without mention of their bargains and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, upon whoſe account they were at difference.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:66018:143"/>
gave thanks on that day to God, and relaxed their faſting, and abſtained from every right that might inferr any ſorrow. They were ſtirred up to this alſo by the pranks of Hereticks, who denied the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt; amongſt whom the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> acted with a Diabolical ſpirit, and ſtudying to diffuſe this errour, that they might extinguiſh the joy of Chriſtians for the ſaving Reſurrection of Chriſt, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Faſts on the Lords day to their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers: whoſe errours, and others which held the ſame, that the Orthodox might prevent, they have lookt to it, that on overy Lords day the Faſt ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed.</p>
                  <p>But although we reject not the Canons ſet out by the Church in deteſtation of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, yet we affirm, that proviſion was made in them about this matter, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Fathers, and not by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Otherwiſe St. <hi>Austin</hi> had miſſed it,<note place="margin">Ep. 86.</note> when he ſaid, <hi>It is not defined by our Lords command, or of the Apoſtles, on what dayes we ought not, and on what to fast.</hi> And if this had been a true Apoſtolical ordinance, it had been lawful for the Church to faſt on the Lords day, when no occaſion was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But <hi>Hierom</hi> thinks otherwiſe, while he<note place="margin">a Ep. ad Lucin.</note> wiſheth that we might faſt at every ſeaſon
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:66018:143"/>
(he excepts not the Lords day) and ſayes, that <hi>Paul,</hi> and the faithful with him, faſted on the Lords day, yet doth he not accuſe them of the <hi>Manichean</hi> Hereſie. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we read not that the aforeſaid Canons were ordained by the Apoſtles, therefore they are grown out of uſe in the Church: becauſe, like as the impious madneſs of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, adulterating the Chriſtian faith, hath given the Church occaſion to ordain divers ceremonies in the external worſhip of God, by which they might both extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh their poiſon, and better confirm the minds of Chriſtians in the truth once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which, as before thoſe Herefies did put up the head, were not in uſe; ſo thoſe being extinct, they grew into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe again.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, whatever we meet with in the ancients, of prohibiting Faſts on the Lords day, doth not at all enervate my opinion of avoiding ſurfeit on that day, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with the graveſt ſayings of the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Fathers; neither do they make any thing againſt me: to faſt and ſurfeit do differ far enough: between which extremes, a third thing is given; namely, a ſober and moderate dinner: the uſe whereof, none will deny to Chriſtians on the Lords day, unleſs any think with <hi>Urbicus,</hi>

that he would make a ſtable of the Church<note place="margin">Idem.</note> of <hi>Millain,</hi> and would try how the Clergy could fight.

                  <p>Laſtly, if it were granted that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did entreat Count <hi>Arbogaſtes</hi> at a Feaſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will any believe it, who conſiders the auſtere life of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> chaſtizing his body with that diſcipline (as <hi>Paulinus ibidem</hi>) that he obſerved a daily Faſt, that he would diſtain himſelf with feaſts on the Lords day, which hindred the exerciſes of Religion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publick or private? Nay, truly.

On the other ſide, <hi>Morton</hi> cryes out, and that juſtly, <hi>What (the foul ill!) what a ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this, that wants</hi> Well, <hi>without which, no action can be acceptable to God?</hi> So theſe mens ſanctifying of this day, (while they grant the Lords day muſt be ſanctified, but labour not to ſanctifie it <hi>Well</hi>) is rather to be reckoned a profanation, than ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. Alas! Are theſe fruits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming ſo long a preaching of the holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? while men do on the Lords day ſo profuſely ſerve the pleaſures of the fleſh. The primitive Chriſtians, whoſe ſouls are now in reſt, celebrated not ſo the Lords day, who made conſcience of intermitting its ſolemnity upon any occaſion.</p>
                  <p>If on holy dayes we muſt abſtain from law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and neceſſary labours, muſt we therefore attend upon unlawful, vain, and unhoneſt
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:66018:148"/>
works? God forbid. <hi>The women of the</hi> Jews <hi>had better on the Sabbath day ſpin, than dance on their New Moons,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> judgeth. And on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. <hi>It is better to dig, than dance on the Sabbath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe things are not ſo to be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if St. <hi>Austin</hi> had commended the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of gainful labour on that day: but that grave Father doth praiſe the ſcope of thoſe men rather, who do apply their juſt and lawful labour, than their unlawful va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities: as otherwhere he relates of <hi>Socrates,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra rel. c. 2.</note> that ſwore by fleſh, a ſtone, or any thing that was at hand to ſwear by: not that he approved <hi>Socrates</hi>'s fact, but by this means he would inſtruct his hearers, that although neither be agreeable to reaſon, yet it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to transferr Gods honour to Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, than to the works of mens hands. So, although we muſt not attend on the Lords day, on labour undertaken for gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, but only on Divine worſhip; yet the good Father judged it better on that day, to employ our pains about labours lawful on other dayes, than about vanities, alwayes unlawful, and ſeverely condemned of God; although neither will very well agree with the ſolemnity of that day.</p>
                  <p>If any one till his ground on the Lords day, he violates the holy reſt, but if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

And if there be any that think, that dancing be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and modeſt, they are at their liberty for me to abound in their own ſenſe: at leaſt, with <hi>Octavius,</hi> that good defender of the Chriſtian Religion, and other lights of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Chriſtianity, it ſeems meet for me to repute them as obſcene, and evil pleaſures. Laſtly, let the patrons of thoſe dances, which they call ſober, bring forth any teſtimony out of approved Authors, whereby any dances on the Lords Dayes can be defended, and then we will believe them, that ſuch dances were not prohibited by the Fathers: which, till it be done, we will with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients ſay, we ought not to lead dances, or effeminate our ears with pipes and harps. The ancients curſed thoſe kinds of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:66018:154"/>
which then were in uſe. If the things which at this day are highly eſteemed by the world, and are reckoned as ſober, had in their age put up the head, doubtleſs they would have condemned them, with the ſame zeal, and holy fervour of ſpirit, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the <hi>Lords ſolemnity,</hi> and which hindred the ſanctification thereof.

                  <p>The Lords day ſolemnities, wherewith they honoured this day, are the duties that appertain to godlineſs: whereof ſome were of a publick, others of a private right: thoſe were to be performed by every Church, in the publick aſſemblies, and theſe of the faithful members of the Church, when they were returned home, the publick aſſembly being ended. This place therefore requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that ſomething be added about the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meetings of the Church, being held on the Lords dayes. In deſcribing whereof, we will firſt teach, that they were in uſe with the Church of God, even from the Apoſtles age. Secondly, we will enquire what was done in them by the Church. Thirdly, we will add ſomething of the places wherein they were held.</p>
                  <p>Although the ancients (as we have ſeen<note place="margin">Publick aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies on the L. Day.</note> in the former book, ch. 5.) did deſtinate
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:66018:157"/>
the whole Lords day, or the firſt day of the week, to the exerciſes of Divine Worſhip; yet did they hold their publick aſſemblies at certain hours, and what time remained beſides, they ſpent it alſo privately in holy duties. Whence we may eaſily obſerve, that there was a ſolemn, and religious obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords day, both publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: the publick was performed in the publick conventions of the Church; and that Chriſtians, in what part of the world ſoever they lived, ſo often as they could for perſecution, were wont to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place, to handle the duties of piety, is ſo clear from divers places of the New Teſtament, that it wanteth no teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Theſe aſſemblies could not be held without a ſtated time every week, and a fit place: now we find that the Lords day was deſtined to keep them on, and that while the Apoſtles were living, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſcharging the miniſtry committed to them of the Lord. For, on no day was there wont to be a more ſolemn and frequented convention of the people in the Church, to hear Sermons, and partake of the holy Communion, than on the Lords day: and this we have proved in the two firſt chapters of the precedent book, to be a very ancient cuſtome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:66018:157"/>The Church therefore, as ſaith <hi>Iſychius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In <hi>Lev.</hi> l. c. c. 9. They met oftener in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Church</note>

Yet this muſt be marked of him that obſerves the meetings of the Church, that there is a rehearſal made of more meetings which were kept by the later, than the former Church, on the Lords day, by Hiſtorians and others that treat of them: not becauſe the former Church, if it could, for the daily perſecutions it met with, did not ſo often hold their meeting; eſpecially whenas we ſee that the firſt Chriſtians did ſharply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend (in Book 1. ch. 5.) about ſanctifying the whole day: but becauſe it being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred with the cruel flames of perſecutions, did meet as often as occaſion did occurr: but the following Chriſtians were at liberty to meet oftner under the Chriſtian Emperours; and therefore we read, that they met twice<note place="margin">The Church met twice on the Lords day.</note> upon the Lords day: in the former meeting whereof, they begun the day, and with the other they ended the day; and upon that reaſon, they afterwards called the one their <hi>Matins,</hi> and the other their <hi>Veſpers.</hi> But what, and how many hours were ſpent at both of theſe conventions, is not well
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:66018:158"/>
known: becauſe there was not the ſame manner of meeting every where, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the neceſſity and profit of the Church, they held their meetings on the night and day.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle taught the <hi>Epheſians</hi> both<note place="margin">Meetings in the night.</note> night and day, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32.

The <hi>Corinthians</hi> met in the evening, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. for about ſupper time, or after, they were gathered together. But, as I ſaid, neceſſity commanded their night-meetings: becauſe the Chriſtians being moved with the fear of Tyrants, could not ſafely meet on the day time.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtians of the following age, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their night-meetings, (as alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things, out of which an huge heap of ſuperſtitious rites flowed, by which the clear face of truth breaking out of darkneſs, was filthily darkened) called them <hi>Vigils;</hi>

The Conſtitutions of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which are held ancient by all, do make mention of them. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as we<note place="margin">Ep. 63.</note> have ſeen, took it heavily, that morning Suppers were deſpiſed of ſome delicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that would not ſmell the ſavour of Wine, but not evening Suppers: <hi>they,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>offered in the morning water only, yet when they came to Supper, they offered a mix'd cup:</hi> whereupon the learned <hi>Goular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> judiciouſly acknowledgeth, that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius</hi> doth confeſs, that ſome in <hi>Cyprians</hi> age, were wont to offer twice a day: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>

                        </gap>amelius</hi> doth corruptly referr this to private Maſſes in uſe amongſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. In the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> (which was held before the firſt Council of <hi>Nice</hi>) there is mention made as well of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as morning Liturgy, (the Fathers ſpeak of the publick ſervice in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meeting.) <hi>Hilary</hi> acknowledges for a<note place="margin">In Pſ. 64.</note> great ſign of mercy, the pleaſures (while <hi>the day begins in Prayers to God, and ends in</hi> his <hi>Praiſes</hi>) of Matins, and Evening-ſervice in
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:66018:161"/>
the Church. Divers Treatiſes alſo of the Fathers, in the afternoon, which we ſhall afterwards mention, will teach us, that the Church met in the Evening. But the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, as we ſaid, met oftener on the night time in that age which abounded with Perſecutions, and being hindred by the wicked deviſes of the adverſaries, could ſeldome keep a meeting on the day time, as <hi>Baſil.</hi> Ep. 63. <hi>Tertull. de Fuga, ult. cap.</hi> teach us. Thence therefore, I think, it came to paſs, that we meet with ſeldome mention of a two-fold meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt the Chriſtians of the former Church.</p>
                  <p>And theſe things do teſtifie, that the Church of Chriſt kept publick meetings, to thoſe that ſhut not their eyes againſt the truth. But ſince ſundry in our age do ſo eaſily bite with the tooth of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, that ſcarce any thing can be written (though never ſo elaborate, and ſtudiouſly compoſed, which at firſt by the envy of malevolent perſons, may not be depraved, and at laſt contemned: therefore, I onely add this, leſt perhaps ſome might object, that thoſe things which I have obſerved concerning aſſemblies, are to be applied not only to meetings kept on Sabbath dayes, of which I ſhall ſpeak
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:66018:161"/>
hereafter, but alſo to thoſe which were kept on other dayes, beſides the Lords dayes, which I deny not. I at leaſt wiſe affirm this: if they had it in their mind to meet on other dayes after noon, for Religions ſake; much more are they to be thought to have done it on the Lords day, which was ſet apart for this end. And divers fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited teſtimonies do make mention of meetings being held on that day. Laſtly, what is ſaid to be done in the meetings which were kept on other dayes, we read that the ſame was done in the Lords Dayes meetings: although all things which were done every where in theſe, were not done in thoſe meetings: as hath been obſerved in the firſt Book, and third Chapter.</p>

                     <hi>There was devout Prayer, devout read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Word, and hearing of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:66018:162"/>
All things, that I may ſpeak brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were devout, which are ſaid or done in the Churches of God according to his Law. And all theſe things may be referred to the Miniſtry of the Word, publick invocation of Gods name, and adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> So it is evident to us, out of the Holy Scripture, and more pure Chriſtianity, in what things the offices of almoſt all the worſhip of God were performed. Theſe are reckoned up, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 40. although the order in which they were performed be not declared. St. <hi>Paul</hi> being brought to <hi>Troas,</hi> ſome peculiar things fell out, in the deſcription whereof, St. <hi>Luke</hi> is very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently converſant; and above all, amongſt the reſt, an example of a Church-meeting, with all its circumſtances, is recorded, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. In which convention, <hi>Paul</hi> firſt preached, which exerciſe he continued till mid-night, and when that was ended, then the Lords Supper was performed. And we muſt ſuppoſe, that the Apoſtles never preached the Word, or adminiſtred the Sacraments, without ſolemn invocation of God.</p>
                  <p>When the Apoſtles were dead, theſe ſame things were obſerved by the following Church, on the Lords day, which, by and by, I will in brief ſhew. Therefore, not
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:66018:163"/>
without reaſon, have I concluded the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick offices of piety on that day to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed under theſe three.</p>
                  <p>In deſcribing whereof, firſt, that Divine office of piety doth occurr, <hi>The Miniſtry of the Word</hi> (a word familiar enough to our age) without which, the things of Religion cannot happily be diſpatched. Neither were other duties which tended to piety, done without it in the ancient Church. Therefore, in delineating the publick offices of piety, we will firſt ſpeak of it. Now under the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Word to be had on the Lords Day, are underſtood both the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, and the explaining thereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as often as the Church was gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Reading of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> together, the Holy Scriptures were read. In deſcribing of which argument, I will point at three things; namely, firſt, I will ſhew what Scriptures were read in the Church-aſſembly; ſecondly, whoſe office it was to do this; thirdly, I will add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the place out of which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were read in the Church-aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
                  <p>It is evident out of divers authors, that thoſe Scriptures were read, <note n="*" place="margin">Tert. ad ux. l. 2. c. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>by whoſe read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith was nouriſhed.</hi> And that is thought by divers men of great name, in imitation
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:66018:163"/>
of the <hi>Jews:</hi> by whom, it was an ordinary thing to read <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets in the<note place="margin">What Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture was read in the Apoſtles age.</note> Synagogues, every Sabbath day, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 15. and 15. 21. This cuſtome of the <hi>Jews,</hi> omitting ceremonials, was not onely profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Apoſtles, who upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion every where preached Chriſt in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, out of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 15. and 17. 2, 3. but alſo was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Apoſtles to Chriſtians, as often as the Church met: namely, that the writings of the old Prophets ſhould be read and expounded by the modern Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 29. <hi>Origen</hi> alſo witneſſeth (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be deceived in giving the cauſe, for which this was enjoyned the Church, of the Apoſtles) that the Apoſtles ordained, that the books of Jewiſh Hiſtories ſhould be read in Churches by the Diſciples of Chriſt. So he, <hi>initio Hom.</hi> 15. in <hi>Joſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, there be ſome that gather out of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 18. where the Apoſtle ſaith of <hi>Luke, With</hi> Titus <hi>we have ſent our brother, whoſe praiſe is in the Goſpel, throughout all the Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> that not only the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, were wont to be read, while the Apoſtles were alive, but alſo of the Evangeliſts, about the Hiſtory and Sermons of Chriſt. Where, according to them, we may not unfitly obſerve, that even
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:66018:164"/>
at that time the Goſpel of <hi>Luke</hi> was wont to be read in Churches. <hi>Paul</hi> is not afraid to adjure the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that when that Epiſtle to them was finiſhed, <hi>it ſhould be read to all the holy brethren, 1 Theſ.</hi> 5. 27. and he requires the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that they read the Epiſtle written from <hi>Laodicea:</hi> and that they ſhould cauſe that which he ſent unto them, to be read in the Church of the <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceans, Col.</hi> 4. 16. And <hi>Euſebius,</hi> out of <hi>Clement,</hi> relates, that <hi>Peter</hi> ordained, that the Goſpel of <hi>Mark</hi> was to be read in Churches. So <hi>Euſeb.

                  </p>
                  <p>After the Apoſtles death, the writings, not only of the Prophets and Evangeliſts, but of the Apoſtles themſelves, were read in the Church-aſſemblies, as I have ſaid from 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. and <hi>Col.</hi> 4.</p>

                  <p>Theſe things ſhew, that the Scriptures both of the Old and New Teſtaments were read, and in the fifty ninth Canon of the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> it is ordained, that only the Canonical books ſhould be read; and in the ſixtieth Canon, they reckon up the names and order of Canonical Books of both Teſtaments.

                     <note place="margin">l. 4. c. 23.</note> reports, that <hi>Clements</hi> Epiſtle <hi>ad Corinth.</hi> was read on the Lords day. <hi>Hierom.</hi> in <hi>Cat. Script.

And ſuch humane writings as were read in the Church, are to be underſtood chiefly of the Pſalms and Songs which were devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of them, to praiſe God by. <hi>Euſebius</hi> mentions theſe, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 28. and <hi>lib.</hi> 2. 17. Afterwards, through the Devils ſubtilty, tares ſprung up in the Church, and under
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:66018:165"/>
pretence of theſe writings, Hereticks ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their falſe Doctrines, which the Fathers in <hi>Trull.</hi> Can. 2. obſerve, in the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aſcribed to <hi>Clement,</hi> to which, ſome things ſorged, and ſome things repugnant to Faith, are annexed: which evil, that the Fathers might feaſonably prevent, they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ordained, that no Books ſhould be read in the publick Church-aſſembly, but the Holy Scriptures: much leſs, that it ever ſhould be ſafe through them, that many dreams which they babled out with a raſh attempt, like old wife's dotages) of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talking men, ſhould be read among the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, as afterwards, by uſe, it fell out; becauſe, as we have ſeen, they ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that nothing but the Scriptures ſhould be read in Churches.</p>
                  <p>Now for the order, according to whoſe rule, all reading of the Scriptures among the ancients was diſpoſed, we meet with a few things to be obſerved out of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. Whether, namely, in the primitive Church, there were ſelected parts of the Scriptures which they read; or (as it was familiar with the <hi>Jews</hi> on their Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes) they read the Scripture in order, as the Lords dayes returned, till they had finiſhed that work; this, I ſay, is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known: onely what parts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:66018:166"/>
they read, they explained the ſame for the peoples uſe, as the neceſſity of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times did require. <hi>Tertul. apo.</hi> c. 39. <hi>Ambr.</hi> l. 5. ep. 33.</p>
                  <p>But afterwards it doth appear, that there was an order obſerved in reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> mentions the order obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by himſelf, in handling his Lectures upon Scripture, in <hi>prooemio Epiſtolae Johannis.</hi> And he addeth, <note n="a" place="margin">Tract. 6. in Joh.</note> 
                     <hi>that the book of the Acts of the Apoſtles was every year read at an anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſolemnity, after the Lords Paſſion.</hi> He reports alſo, that <hi>Pſ.</hi> 21. <hi>was wont to be read every year, in the laſt week before the Paſſion-day of Christ, all the people being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive.</hi> Tract. 13. in <hi>Joh.</hi> Moreover alſo, when there were divers Feaſts conſtituted in the Church, ſome certain and peculiar leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Scripture were read every Feaſt-day, <hi>which were annually ſo carefully obſerved, that no others could be more.</hi> Aug. <hi>in prooem. Epiſt. Jo.</hi> The ſame appears from a Sermon of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> againſt thoſe that only met upon Feaſt-dayes: who thinks it unſeaſonable at the ſolemnity of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> to continue the Text formerly begun on, and omit the commemoration of the benefits conſerred on the Church at that time; and after <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost</hi> he proſecutes the Text he was on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:66018:166"/>I will add no more teſtimonies for reading leſſons out of the Holy Scripture, in the Church-aſſembly, in a caſe that is plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, leſt by repeating many things, I cauſe wearineſs in the <hi>Reader.</hi> I will now relate the ſecond thing which I intended, for the candid Readers ſake; namely, foraſmuch as the ancients judged the H.

For this end, the Church being aſſembled, the Holy Scriptures (from whence the knowledge of Divine things flowes) were diſtinctly read: after the reading whereof, followed their explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This was uſed in the Church while the Apoſtle was alive. While he preſcribes the

The Biſhops work was eſpecially to interpret the Holy Scriptures, when the Church was gathered together: and therefore I think their power was of the Ancients ſignified in the name <hi>Cathedra,</hi> (becauſe chiefly it conſiſted in teaching.) <hi>Optatus</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">l. 2.</note> ſaith, the firſt gift of the Church was <hi>Cathedra,</hi> whereby is ſignified, that the Churches power is inſtructive; and for this cauſe, <hi>Aug.</hi>

                  <p>The Biſhops duty therefore is, to inſtruct the people commended to their care: and <hi>Hierom</hi> thinks <note n="c" place="margin">Adv.

                  <p>Since therefore the principal duty of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops is terminated in Doctrine, (to which, by neceſſity of office they are obliged, and without which, although they otherwiſe live a pious life, they are not to be adorned with the title of Biſhops) their firſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal charge was, to interpret the Word of God (the onely ſubject for all doctrine of Miniſters in the Church, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 27.) when the Church was aſſembled for hearing the ſame; that the moſt vigilant Biſhops of old did this with great praiſe, and for the great fruit of the Church, their moſt learned Treatiſes, which are extant among their works do teſtifie.</p>

The Treaters did ſometimes ſtand, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſit: after Treating followed Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: after thoſe were ended, a Pſalm was ſung to [praiſe] God.</p>

                  <p>THeſe are they to whom the expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture was committed among the ancients: which things being declared, ſomewhat remains to be ſpoken of the manner which was obſerved by them in ther Expoſitions.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, when they were to treat out of Scripture, they ſaluted the people.

But afterwards it was

uſual with the Biſhops to ſalute the people in another manner than the Presbyters; which was prohibited in Conc. <hi>Bracarenſi</hi>

                  <p>This ſalutation being premiſed, whether without further prayer to God, they ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Treating, is doubted by ſome. But if the Love-Feaſts in uſe among Chriſtians, were not performed without the office of Prayer; (for before they ſate down, <hi>they</hi>

But this I will advertiſe the Reader of, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of Antiquity hath ſo careleſly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this part of holy things, that there is but a very little which at this day we can find delivered in the Records of the ancients, about this matter. And neither is it to be wondred at, nor is it unuſual. There are in this age divers Sermons of very learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, publiſhed, which are not uttered but with Prayer to God firſt made, and yet none of thoſe Prayers are prefixed to the printed Copies. We may conjecture the ſame of the Ancients Treatiſes, without any injury
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:66018:174"/>
to the truth: which, doubtleſs, the pious Fathers never entred upon without Prayers to God firſt premiſed; which thing I will now manifeſt by ſome teſtimonies.</p>
                  <p>The godly Prayer of a certain holy man is extant in <note n="†" place="margin">Hom. 10. in Coloſſ.</note> 
                     <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi> I know, ſaith St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> a certain godly man that prayed thus; Before theſe words, he ſaid nothing, namely, <hi>We give thanks to thee for all thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, which have been conferred on us unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy wretches, from the firſt to this preſent day; for thoſe we know, and thoſe we know not: for thoſe that are manifeſt, and thoſe that are not manifeſt: for what have been done in work or word: for what have been done voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and unvoluntarily: for all things that have been made for us unworthy creatures, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, for recreations, for Hell, for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the Kingdom of Heaven. We pray thee preſerve our ſoul holy, having a pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and to make our end worthy thy cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency. Thou that haſt ſo loved us, as to give us thy onely begotten ſon; vouchſafe us to be worthy thy love. Give us wiſdom in thy word, and in thy fear. O onely begotten Chriſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire us with thy fortitude. Then that haſt given for us thy onely begotten, and ſent forth thy Holy Spirit for the remiſſion of our ſins; if we have willingly, or againſt our will ſinned, pardon it, and impute it not to us. Remember
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:66018:175"/>
all them that call upon thy name in truth. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member all that wiſh us well and ill. For we are all of us men.</hi> And then having added a Prayer of the faithful, as it were for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain concluſion and winding up for all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he having made this Prayer, here he ended. And thus he.</p>
                  <p>The aforeſaid Prayer was rehearſed in <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi>'s preſence, but where, or when, it is not evident out of the fore-cited place. It ſeems to me, without prejudicing others, to have been recited by one that was entring upon a Treating out of the Word of God; eſpecially ſince he calls him, by whom it was uſed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> a holy man. And ſecondly, he uſed this Prayer when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to ſpeak: for <hi>before it he ſaid nothing.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſpeaks of his frequent uſing it, when he himſelf was alſo preſent: but Laicks had never liberty to pray fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, when any of the Clergy were by; much leſs when St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> was preſent: who yet confeſſes, that he heard him, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>i.</hi> ſo to pray. Fourthly, the whole form of the Prayer ſhews plain enough, that it was uſed publickly: for whether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foever he give thanks, or petition God in it, he pleads not only his own cauſe, but others, and alwayes ſpeaks in the plural number. Fifthly, he ſeems to ſpeak it with reſpect
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:66018:175"/>
had to the Word; for <hi>he begs for wiſdom in the word.</hi> Laſtly; he ſaid nothing before he uſed it, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. But it is not credible, that the men of that age did in their ordinary diſcourſes burn with ſuch an ardency of zeal towards God, as that they would not begin them without premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Prayer to God. Theſe things perſwade me to believe, that the aforeſaid Prayer was uſed publickly, at the Treating upon the Word: but let the wiſe judge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Baſilius M.</hi> ſhews, that Prayers were wont to be ſaid by the whole aſſembly, after that the Preſident went up into the Pulpit to teach, or expound any thing out of the Scriptures; for he makes this the beginning of his Sermon: <q>I need the Prayers of them that love the Lord, that by the grace of the good God and his Chriſt, the holy and good Spirit may admoniſh and teach us, thoſe things it hath heard from the Lord, and may direct our mind into the way of peace, and into found words to the edifying of faith.</q> 
                     <hi>Baſil. de Baptiſm. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> uſeth the ſame preface, when he begins his fifteenth Sermon, <hi>De verbis Apoſtoli.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">De bono pudicitiae.</note> 
                     <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpoke not only <hi>the words which came from the fountains of the Scripture, but with the words he joyned Prayers, and requeſts to God, that both for himſelf and his auditors
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:66018:176"/>
he might both open the treaſures of his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and alſo that he would give ſtrength to ſupply them with what they ſhould know.</hi> Theſe things ſhew, that the Bleſſed Martyr at his Treating out of the Scripture, did pour out Prayers to God, that what he ſaid might be uſeful both to himſelf and his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; for without Gods mercy, all the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of a Paſtor is in vain. Therefore did <hi>Cyprian</hi> adjoyn Prayer to his Treatiſes, to implore the mercy of God, that what was heard might turn into deeds. Yea, <hi>Auſtin</hi> judges, that Prayer is ſo neceſſary to him that is to treat upon the Scripture, before he begin that work, <note n="*" place="margin">De do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. Chriſtiana l. 4. c. 15. &amp;c. 30.</note> that none, in his opinion, <hi>ought to teach them before he pray, and that at the ſame time, before he let looſe his tongue to preach, he lift up his thirſty ſoul to God, that he may caſt up that which he hath drunk in.</hi> And afterwards, cap. 30. Let him that is to ſpeak to the people, <hi>pray that God would give good words into his mouth,</hi> &amp;c. And what <hi>Auguſtine</hi> required of other Doctors, with great devotion he performed himſelf, in that he earneſtly begged of God, when he ſpoke to the people, <hi>that he</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">De ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, <hi>Serm.</hi> 51.</note> 
                     <hi>might utter what was true, and ſuitable in his Sermon, and what the hearers might underſtand, and what they might believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. When the Prayer was ended, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:66018:176"/>
upon the Treatiſe: and they were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually<note place="margin">Texts of their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes.</note> wont to preach to the hearers out of the Leſſons of Scripture which were then read. <hi>Tertullian</hi>

So ſayes <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> the Preſident inſtructed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with his oration, to imitate thoſe things which were read in the Records of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, <hi>ap.</hi> 2. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the <note n="b" place="margin">L. 5.

                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes they alſo did interpret that place of Scripture, which the people were greatly deſirous ſhould be explained unto them: which the words of <hi>Baſil M.</hi> who<note place="margin">De Baptiſ.</note>

Origen</hi> contra <hi>Celſum, lib.</hi> 3. affirms, that the Chriſtians <hi>expounded the Scriptures as they read them, that they might exhort the people to piety towards God, and unto other virtues.</hi> Ambroſe alſo <hi>accommodated the Scriptures, as they were read, to the preſent uſe and edification of the people, partly, by teaching, and partly, by reproving.</hi> See the beginning of <hi>Serm.</hi> 5. The ſame he does in <hi>lib. 5. Ep.</hi> 33. And <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> confeſſes, that he fulfilled <hi>that charge, by convincing, rebuking, and admoniſhing.</hi>

                  <p>THeſe are the things which are chiefly to be obſerved touching the great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours which the Fathers took in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Treatiſes upon the Holy Scriptures: whom, he that ſhall ſeriouſly obſerve, will
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:66018:179"/>
evidently find, with a ſmall ado, that the pious and laborious Fathers in inſtructing the people, were not of that mind, as if the naked reading of Scripture were ſufficient to inſtruct the Chriſtian people in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them, without undertaking any farther explication of them to the peoples uſe: which divers Treaters of this age are not aſhamed to urge. They that aſſert this, do either not excell in any faculty to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Scriptures, or the Holy Ghoſt hath indued them with no meet gifts to undergo that office, (to which they are wanting, through their careleſneſs) with dexterity, and to the Churches great profit. And that ſuch ſhould ſtand for the bare reading of Scripture, and decline painful treating out of the ſame, I no more wonder at them, <hi>than at the Fox,</hi> (as it is in the fable) <hi>that had his own tayl cut off,</hi> the want of which he thought himſelf truly diſgraced by) <hi>who perſwaded the other Foxes alſo to cut off their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </argument>
                  <p>FOr the fuller diſcovery of theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes out of Holy Scripture, ſomething is in the third place to be added, of the time aſſigned by the ancients to their Treatiſes: touching which, a double queſtion doth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr: firſt, how long their Treatiſes laſted, ſecondly, how often treated they in the week.</p>

and therefore they continued their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons an hour, and ſometimes longer: and that they were not long in their Treatiſes, may be obſerved from <hi>Origen's,</hi> and all the other Fathers (who drew not out their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to any long time with the people) their manner of Treating. For they thought it to be much more adviſed to teach often, than long: and thoſe who Treated out of the Scripture, looked to that, of which once <hi>Hierom</hi> admoniſhed <hi>Auguſtin;</hi> namely,<note n="*" place="margin">Aug.

                     <hi>leſt the Sermon being drawn out too long, could not be understood;</hi> for they knew well enough, <hi>that a ſatiety in a Sermon was no leſs an enemy to the ears, than too much meat to the body,</hi> as <hi>Greg.

                     <p>The ancients Treated every day out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and did not prohibit thoſe that taught others diligently, from that their diligence in teaching.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the ſecond place, it will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to find out, how often we read that this was done by the ancients, within a weeks compaſs, or how often the Fathers were wont to treat out of the Scripture to the people. To which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion I anſwer briefly, and ſay, that they buckled themſelves to this work every day, (as occaſion offered) but eſpecially on Lords Dayes, on which they were not wanting twice to ſuſtain this labour, when they had liberty for perſecution.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this, through ſome mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, may ſeem a thing hard to believe, we will plead with the very teſtimonies of the graveſt authors, and will teach both, by the grace of God, out of their records.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, they uſed to preach to<note place="margin">The anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of Scriptures every day.</note> the people every day, which will appear to him that looks into their Treatiſes. For
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:66018:185"/>
how often do we meet with this phraſe in the beginning of their Treatiſes, <hi>Yeſterday's Sermon?—Ambr. de Sacramentis,</hi> l. 5. c. 1. Alſo l, 3. c. 1. alſo <hi>Serm.</hi> 92. which he begins in the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> thinks it neceſſary that a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>ſhould preach every day;</hi> and he ſhews the fruit of this diligence, <hi>that by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in teaching, the auditors minds might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Sermon.</hi> Chryſ. <hi>de ſacerdotio, lib.</hi> 6. And what burden the grave Father impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon other mens ſhoulders in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, yet he declined it not himſelf through a Phariſaical auſterity, though it were hard to be born, which his Sermons ſhew.</p>

                  <p>Hom. 5. ad Populum. <hi>Although I have ſpoken to you of this matter, yeſterday, and the day before yeſterday, yet ſhall I not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to it to day, nor to norrow, nor the next day after to morrow,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe, and many others, that may be obſerved in him, do plainly ſhew, that he performed the office of Treating out of Scripture every day to the people. <hi>Greg.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Auſtin</hi> thus begins his ſecond Sermon in <hi>Pſalm 68.

                     <hi>Cyprian</hi> by his daily Treating out of the Goſpels, endeavoured to encreaſe the ſaith and knowledge of his hearers. <hi>Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> affirms, that <hi>Alexander</hi> comforted the Church daily, with his Divine inſtructions. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> l. 8. c. 5.</p>

                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:66018:186"/>And thus much for the daily labours of the Doctors of the Church, which they ſpent in the explication of Scripture: whoſe diligence was ſo great, over their flocks commended to their charge, to feed them ſaithfully with the bread of life, that they would not abſtain from the continual la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Treating. They became not at that time lookers after their ſecular affairs, <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta cathedra [i.</hi> leaving the chair] (which thing was a grief to <hi>Cyprian, De Lapſis,</hi> ſect. 4.) as afterwards they were; or did they grow too rank with exceſſive ſtipends: but, as their chief charge was bounded in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſo they thought not much to beſtow their moſt diligent labour in this office, though very toylſome: and the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and officiouſly they executed the charge of preaching to the people, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honour had they from all good men, according to the Apoſtles Canon, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. which <hi>Theodoſius junior</hi> did piouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. <hi>Socr. l. 7. c.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>Nor do I remember that I have read any where in the ancients, that any man was interdicted (who being not deprived of the faculty of preaching, by the Church, or was not ſubject to its cenſure) that he ſhould not, ſo often as conveniently he could, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the people committed to him in the

the old path that leadeth ſtraight to the eternal ſalvation of the ſoul, and ſeeking a new one, the premiſes do not pleaſe) ſhall object to me, that from the aforeſaid teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies it is not evident, that the Fathers did undergo thoſe labours, in interpreting and treating out of the Scripture twice on the Lords day, which I ſhould have proved:<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Surely, he that ſhall ſay ſo, will not work me much trouble, nor will he enervate my opinion of the Fathers labours declared in this ſenſe; unleſs he ſhall firſt demonſtrate, that the Church did on all dayes beſides the Lords, keep evening aſſemblies (on which they had theſe Sermons) and that they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to ſanctifie other dayes more than the Lords Dayes; which thing, I ſuppoſe, he will demonſtrate from their grave wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, about the time of later <hi>Lammas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, if on other dayes, on which the Church was permitted to attend on worldly labours, they took pains in ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten interpreting of Scripture, who will be ſo far a ſtranger to right reaſon, as that he ſhould believe, that they would not beſtow ſo much labour for this buſineſs, on the Lords dayes, (on which they, abſtaining from all others, were only intent on Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip)? much rather, and better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

other dayes they Treated twice out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they would, if occaſion ſerved, much oftener give themſelves to this labour on the Lords day. As ſometimes <hi>Siſinnius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Socr. 6. 20.</note> asked, why he would waſh himſelf twice every day in the publick bath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Biſhop? he anſwered, becauſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not waſh thrice. So the ancient Biſhops of the Church were ſeriouſly intent twice on the Lords dayes, on the explication of Scripture. And if they could get any juſt occaſion to do more than this, they would not avoid the labour of doing it the third or fourth time; as may be ſeen by that Sermon in <hi>Auſtin;</hi> when he, whoever he was that was the author of that Sermon, had twice performed the office of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining Scripture, when a new occaſion was offered, (which was an extraordinary one) on the ſame day, he did the ſame the third time.

                  <p>We have formerly ſeen ſome of <hi>Baſils,</hi> both morning and evening Sermons; we read alſo, that he preach'd twice before noon.

                  <p>From both Teſtaments it is evident, that in the publick aſſemblies of the Church, after reading of Scripture, there followed the interpretation of the ſame.

becauſe they had not that which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Sabbath, that is to ſay, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth.</q> The Sabbath therefore according to St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> was given men, that they, ceaſing from worldly buſineſſes, might freely apply their minds to the means by which they might attain ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.

                  <p>Secondly, if the Bible had not been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly<note place="margin">On the Sabbath a Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</note> read, and its ſenſe expounded on Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-dayes, then none beſides the Prieſts and Levites, and ſome others that offered Sacrifices to the Prieſts, had been bound to be preſent on Sabbath dayes, in the place deſtined by God to ſacrifice in: for what need was there, that they ſhould onely be preſent with them that ſacrificed? But the contrary appears from the very Text, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 3. where the ſolemnity of the Sabbath is ſhown. God appoints, that <hi>there ſhall be an holy convocation.</hi> Now if a Convocation were by God required on the Sabbath dayes, then it concerned the people, as well as the Prieſts, to be preſent at the common aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly? which being finiſhed, that ſolemn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction was pronounced by the Prieſt to the people aſſembled. <hi>Num.</hi> 6. 23.</p>

But if they had not inſtructed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Law, then they had beſtowed their chief care upon the leſs principal, the other, which was the principal duty, being neglected. And unleſs the people had been inſtructed in the meaning of the Law, they had wholly been ignorant of the uſe for which the Sacrifices were ordained of God. <hi>But</hi> Aaron <hi>and his ſons were ſeparated from others by God, to teach the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>the ſtatutes of God,</hi> Lev. 10. 11. Which they faithfully performed, both privately (as often as any conſulted them upon any emergent queſtion, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 9, 10.) and publickly, <hi>for they inſtructed all</hi> Iſrael <hi>in the Word of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 3. And that charge did, <hi>ex officio,</hi> lie upon the Levites, as well before, as after the captivity, to be indued with the knowledge of all things, that the Law might be ſought for at their mouth, <hi>M.al.</hi> 2. 7. But when could they with greater fruit draw out the knowledge of Gods Law to the peoples edification, than in the publick aſſembly of the Church,

being gathered together on S. Dayes? ſince <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 21. Mar. 12. 13. Luk. 22. Joh. 5. 7, 8, 18.</note> on other dayes, on which they were to attend their labours, they could not do this. Chriſt when he began his Miniſtry once, did frequently teach in the Temple. Why did the people wait for <hi>Zacharias,</hi> when he was offering Sacrifice, if it were not an uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thing for them to hear ſome ſhort Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 8, 9, 10.</note> and benediction from him, before they went out? Chriſt ſate in the Temple in the midſt of the Doctors, hearing and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them queſtions: which ſhews, that it was the cuſtome of a Doctor to teach the multitude in the Temple. If therefore the Law of God was not on the Sabbath dayes expounded for the peoples uſe, and no other exerciſes of piety but ſacrifices, were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the people, in what thing was the Sabbath ennobled above other dayes? for ſacrifices were offered on other beſides the Sabbath dayes: yea, two Lambs were day by day offered for a continual burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. Therefore the Sabbath was not made remarkable by the only worſhip of Sacrifices, above other dayes, on which they attended ſacrifices: but beſides the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, were ſuperadded the interpreting of the Law, and a ſerious and pious exerciſing themſelves therein, and other duties of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: upon which account, the Sabbath day
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:66018:194"/>
was reckoned more holy than other dayes of the week, and the ninety ſecond Pſalm was for this end written, that the people might ſing it in the Church on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, whereon a holy Convocation was held.</p>

He asks his wife why ſhe would go to the Prophet that day, <hi>ſince it was neither new moon nor Sabbath?</hi> which were the ordinary dayes to conſult God upon, and to hear his word, according to the famous <hi>Junius. Lyra</hi> ſaith alſo the ſame on that place, <hi>He ſpoke this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe men went more frequently on thoſe dayes to the Prophets, to hear Gods word:</hi> becauſe the Prophets were not to attend Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, therefore they that went to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, did it, that they might be inſtructed in the Law and will of God by them: but when could this be better done than on the <hi>Sabbath?</hi> The famous <hi>Cunaeus,</hi> upon the authority of <hi>Rabbi Aben Ezra,</hi> affirms, that Oracles were conſulted on Sabbath dayes. <hi>De Rep. Hebraeorum,</hi> l. 2. c. 24.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if reading of Scriptures, and a clear interpreting of them, had not been preſcribed of God, then Chriſt, and after him his Apoſtles, who were faithfully dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

If therefore, while <hi>Aſaph</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, then were Synagogues long in uſe before the captivity. But for what end were they inſtituted? in which ſacrifices (which it was lawful to offer no where elſe but at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> when the Temple was built) were not offered: but in them was the people inſtructed in the Law of God by the Levites, who were diſperſed up and

                  <p>Which things being conſidered, let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers judge what to ſay of their uncertain conjecture, who contend, that there was no other interpreting of the law, uſed under the former Temple, beſides that which the Prophets, being extraordinarily called, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook. Which opinion, being once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it will not be eaſie to avoid the aforeſaid incommodities, as to any one it will appear, by a more narrow ſearch into them.

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:66018:196"/>
that they uſed to read the Law, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it to the peoples capacity, on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes: otherwiſe neither their words nor deeds had been noted for holineſs: or how elſe could the minds of the <hi>Jews</hi> have been furniſhed piouſly to conceive Prayers on Sabbath dayes, without the explaining of the Scripture? Yea, the Learned <hi>Cunaeus</hi> confeſſes, that the Levites in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues did deliver to the people in the Towns of <hi>Judaea,</hi> the chief knowledge of all Laws, both of Humane and Divine things: and when could the Levites do this with greater profit, than on the Sabbath dayes?

                  <p>But to return to our purpoſe; We find that under the Old Teſtament the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were read and opened in the <hi>Jews</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie, even the Holy Ghoſt being witneſs, although ſome doubt of the period of time, at which their interpretation on Sabbath dayes began.</p>
                  <p>As for the Churches in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, planted by the Apoſtles, they could

not, ſo long as their Peace was diſturbed with a ſtorm of Perſecutions, meet together without very great difficulty: for which cauſe, as we ſaid Chap. 1. they had their meetings ſometime on the night, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the day; neither again was it ſafe for them to hold a meeting all the day.

                  <p>Since therefore in the Jewiſh, Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and other Churches ſucceeding the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, there followed after the reading of the Scriptures, an expoſition of them, it ſeems neceſſarily to follow, that if they had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to meet on Lords dayes, then they uſed to treat twice out of Scripture: of which there is frequent mention in their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.

                     </gap> of the Church, that from the very Apoſtles times, prayers and reading were reckoned both together, which were celebrated both morning and evening. No man therefore can judge it unreaſonable to ſay, that there followed an interpretation of thoſe things which were read: becauſe reading was uſed to inſtruct the people.

Daily exhortations were very needful to the Chriſtians, for to bear the Croſs of the Goſpel patiently. Neither muſt we think that theſe skilful Paſtours who were ſet over the Church by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Apoſtolical men, did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, as often as they could, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the People committed to them in the matters of Faith.

If it were a grief to this vigilant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, that becauſe being hindred by his exile, he could not provoke all who were commended to his inſpection and care, by his holy Exhortations, to piety and patience; certainly, when he was with his people, if he took care that by a Reader the bare reading of the Goſpel was recited to them, although he ſtirred not them up by his Exhortations to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe what they had heard read, he would never in very deed have thought, that he had ſhewed himſelf a faithful Biſhop.

                  <p>But it is a queſtion, whether in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid<note place="margin">Can. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>African</hi> Canons, the Reverend Fathers do ſpeak of ſet Forms of Prayers in publick Liturgies, or of the Prayers which he that was to treat out of Scripture (which was a common thing with Treaters, as Can. 40. we have heard out of the Fathers) did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at that time he came forth to ſpeak at. Some men of great account think, that they meant the former rather than the later; becauſe the cited words of the Canons do ordain what forms of prayer they ſhould uſe, whoſe office it was to perform acts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>when they ſtood at the altar.</hi> So <hi>Conc. Carthag.</hi> where they that were to Treat ſtood not: the Biſhops ſeat who did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Scripture, was in the midſt of the Church, as we have formerly ſhown. This therefore was ordained by the Fathers, leſt as Hereticks increaſed, and ſpread their Heterodox opinions, the Chriſtian people who did not well enough attend their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:66018:204"/>
ſhould be impoſed upon by Hereticks. Canons were eſtabliſhed, becauſe in that age eſpecially, every faction did ſpread abroad certain forms of Prayers and Pſalms, by which, when they were met together, they might allure unto them men that were not well enough exerciſed in the faith, but unwarily embraced their dreams: as Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians report it fell out in <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> age, not long after the aforeſaid Councils were held. <note n="†" place="margin">Soer. l. 6. c. 8. Nic. l. 13. c. 8.</note> That, I ſay, theſe mens endeavours ſhould be prevented, leſt Hereticks ſhould ſpread abroad Forms of Liturgies not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Doctrine received from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; it was ordained, that in publick Liturgies (which were not to be preſcribed by any one man) none ſhould have liberty to uſe any forms of Prayers, but what <hi>were either formerly in uſe</hi> (namely, before the miſts of Heterodoxiſme had obſcured the ſhining face of truth) or had been approved by the moſt judicious brethren; or laſtly, confirmed by the authority of ſome Synod. The very words of the cited Canon do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the <hi>Mileritan</hi> Fathers do ſpeak of ſuch Prayers. Let the place be ſeen, it is extant in the firſt Tome of the Councils, pag. 600.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it appears that this was the cauſe of thoſe Canons, by the condition of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:66018:204"/>
the times in which they were ordained. For at that time the Church was grievouſly ſick of the wounds both of <hi>Arrianiſm</hi> and <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianiſm.</hi> And reaſon it ſelf perſwades not to reſtrain the cited Canons to the Prayers which were conceived by him that Treated to the people. For thoſe were to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved alwayes, as the neceſſity of the Church did require (as formerly <hi>Tertullian</hi> taught us) for which cauſe they could not alwayes be the ſame: but were to be varied <hi>pro re nata,</hi> and as the neceſſity of the people for whom the Treater was to offer the ſacrifice of the lips to God, required.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, if the Canons ſpeak of the Treaters prayers, then this is worthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that the Grave Fathers in thoſe ſanctions did not intend to preſcribe lawes for all and every Treater, in the Prayers he was to conceive: but onely for thoſe who were not well inſtructed in Religion; <hi>for they ſpeak of ſome who name the Father for the ſon, or the ſon for the Father: and who had written out Prayers to themſelves from ſome other.</hi> So <hi>Conc. Carth.</hi> where above they ordain, leſt the leſs exerciſed in Religion ſhould be impoſed upon through the fraud and deceit of others, that they conferr with their wiſer brethren about the Prayers they had written out, before they uttered them to the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="348" facs="tcp:66018:205"/>The ſame is alſo to be ſaid to the <hi>Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> Canon, wherein it is provided, <hi>that nothing be compoſed againſt the Faith, either through ignorance or leſs care.</hi> And yet by thoſe ſanctions the more inſtructed of the brethren are not reſtrained to Forms of Prayer, unleſs they be approved by others. We read that certain prayers were preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great to his Guard,<note place="margin">Euſeb. de vit. Conſt. l. 4. c. 18.</note> which they uſed on the <hi>Lords day;</hi> yet none will thence conclude, that other Chriſtians were to put up no Prayers to God, but what were commanded. The cited Canons are therefore to be underſtood either of Liturgy Prayers, or of the Prayers of the Treater, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit through ignorance to conceive Prayers, and of no others.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in their Prayers conceived after<note place="margin">For what the Church prayed.</note> this manner they prayed to God <hi>for things juſt, honeſt, and meet to be heard.</hi> Arnob. <hi>cont.

                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, theſe Prayers were conceived in<note place="margin">Prayer in a known tongue.</note> a known tongue. <hi>Origen</hi> inſtead of all, will teach us this, who writeth againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> a froward adverſary of the Chriſtian name, <hi>Contr.

                  <p>Seventhly, it will not be far from our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to add ſomething of the poſture of the body in conceiving of prayer.

                     <pb n="360" facs="tcp:66018:211"/>
abrogated that errour, and commanded them to uſe a known tongue, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they that ſung to the Lord in their heart, any otherwiſe ſtir up themſelves by Pſalms, hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs.</hi> Which yet was enjoyned the Church by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Canon, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 19. which do teach, that all the art of ſinging in the Church, ought by the Apoſtles ſentence, to be ordered into the vulgars capacity.</p>

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:66018:212"/>
and with terrour to make confeſſion to thy Creatour, and by this to beg the pardon of ſins.

After the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Council, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved teſtimonies have ſhewed us, that it was an uſual thing for the Chriſtian people to ſing with others in the Church: but as for the place in <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> cited by <hi>Baronius,</hi> it brings no help at all to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the conjecture of <hi>Baronius.</hi> For in that place (of which we have formerly heard in this Chapter) St. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> only blames<note place="margin">Hom. 1. de verb.

                     <q>When all is done, ſaith he, we forbid not jubilation (the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whereto is affirmed by <hi>Baronius,</hi> and his follower <hi>Binius</hi>) but a voice that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing; not the voice of praiſe,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:66018:216"/>
but a rude voice of abſurdity, the vain and raſh throwing up of the hands into the air, ſtamping with the feet, unſeemly and effeminate ſongs, which are the playes of them that ſit idle in the Theatres, and at Horſe-races.</q> Thus <hi>Chryſoſtom:</hi> which is far from the ſenſe for which <hi>Baronius</hi> brought it. Which doth alſo more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, from the end of that Homily, in which he ſpeaks to his hearers, <q>that they would come to God with a calm and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed voice, and not lift up their hands in diſorderly motions, but preſent them to God both together.</q> Which things being well obſerved, with what face can the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> alledge <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> for denying the people a liberty to ſing in the Church?</p>
                  <p>Now from the premiſes it may eaſily be<note place="margin">The Church could not endure broken muſick.</note> obſerved, that the Fathers approved not of that, which they call Broken Muſick, that conſiſts rather in the noiſe of the voice, than the fervour of the ſpirit; as if from ſuch Muſick God neither got any praiſe, or the Church profit.

                  <p>WE have obſerved, that meetings were gathered by the Church, to perform the duties of Religion: and we have ſeen what was done in them. In the third place, ſomething remains to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the places in which theſe meetings were kept. For a place is required where the people of God being gathered together, may exerciſe themſelves in the things that pertain to his publick worſhip. And that ſome places deſigned to Divine Worſhip, are neceſſary, I truſt no body will doubt: for without them, the publick aſſemblies of the Faithful (the uſe of which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhewn) to worſhip God, could not without inconvenience be held.

Some things then remain to be done by Chriſtians after the Church meetings are ended, and theſe are various. Some whereof I will mention for the godlies ſake (who make conſcience of ſanctifying the <hi>Lords Day.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, they that preached the<note place="margin">After the publick Treatiſes followed examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what was beard.</note> Word of God in the publick aſſemblies, when thoſe were ended, they did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times examine the people of what they had heard: Which we read the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents did perform with great induſtry. And for this cauſe, <hi>Proſper, De vita con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 2. contends it is, that Biſhops are called Watchmen. <q>Becauſe they watch the actions of all men, and with an aim of religious curioſity, ſpie out, how every one liveth with his houſhold in his houſe, how with his Citizens in the City: what good men they approve, they confirm by honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; whom they obſerve to be vicious, they amend by reproving them.</q> St. <hi>Proſper</hi> judged it to be the Biſhops du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whom the Lord hath appointed to be the Watchmen of his Church, not onely
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:66018:228"/>
to attend preaching of the Word in the Church aſſembly, but alſo when that was ended, and the people diſmiſſed, diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obſerve the manners and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the people, that they might promote godlineſs, if by any means they could, while they excited thoſe, whom they ſaw to walk according to what they heard in publick, to a farther progreſs in godlineſs, and ſharply admoniſhed thoſe that turned not what they heard into works. Which office, if ever, we believe they did faithfully perform on the Lords Day: which we may ſee in St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> who, when he obſerved any not to be attentive enough to his publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, promiſed, that he would, when he had finiſhed his Treating, <hi>by interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories make tryal, whether they retained what they had heard.</hi> Homil. 4. <hi>in</hi> Hebr. Yea, he tells them, that when the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was diſmiſſed, <hi>he would diſcourſe ſome time with his Auditors about what they had heard;</hi> in the concluſion of <hi>Hom. 6. ad Pop. Antioch.</hi> And elſewhere he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the reaſon of his diligence, <hi>Hom. 9. ad Pop. For,</hi> saith he, <hi>if it be no reproach for a Phyſician to ask his patient how it is with him; neither is it amiſs in us to be ſtill inquiring about our Hearers ſalvation;
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:66018:228"/>
for we being thus advertiſed what to do, and what to leave undone, ſhall apply reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies according to congruous diſcipline.</hi> And this diligence he calls a ſollicitude, not of curioſity, but proviſion: where, by an argument from the leſs to the greater, he illuſtrates the neceſſity of the aforeſaid induſtry. For if a Phyſician, who attends the cure of a frail body, doth diligently enquire of the ſtate of his patients health, after he hath adminiſtred his medicines: why doth it not much more lye upon Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, (to whom the inſpection of ſouls is committed) <hi>ex officio,</hi> to obſerve whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their people lead their life according to what they have heard, after that they have preſcribed unto them wholſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, and exhortations? whereby on every emergent occaſion they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe neceſſary remedies. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<note place="margin">Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of what they heard.</note> confeſſes, that he undertook private labours in teaching ſome of his Hearers, <hi>while he inculcated ſome things to them, who entred communication with him privately.</hi> Thus he ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>Hom. prim. de Lazaro.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It grieved St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to the heart, while he was in exile, that he could not have liberty <hi>to go to every one that was committed to his care, and to exhort them
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:66018:229"/>
cording to the Miniſtry of the Lord and of his Goſpel.</hi> He commends the Presbyters and Deacons, that ſupplied his place, <hi>for ſtrengthening all by their daily exhortations.</hi> Ep. 40. If therefore <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſet upon all that were commended to his care with his exhortations, and commended others that did the like, he thought that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, after the Church-meetings were ended, in which he could not go to them ſeverally, was to be done by him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> in the Life of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 12. mentions his private labours, that he frequently undertook in inſtructing, and exhorting the Catholick people. All theſe vigilant Fathers did not onely propound the Word in Church meetings, but alſo ſhewed us by their own example, that it is privately to be inculcated upon the minds of the Hearers; and their own te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies teach us, that this was done by them daily.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he that ſhall conſult the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers touching the obſervation of the Lords Day, will obſerve, that they did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtir up their hearers to a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meditation and diſcourſing of what they had heard in the publick aſſembly. <hi>Chryſostom</hi> more than once doth, labour
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:66018:229"/>
what he can to perſwade his hearers, <q>that after they are returned home from the Church, friends among themſelves, parents with their children, maſters with their ſervants, meditate and ſtrive how they may do what they are taught.</q> 
                     <hi>Homil.</hi> 5. <hi>ad Pap. Antioch.</hi> which he ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly explains by divers ſimilitudes. <q>Even as, ſaith he, many that depart out of a meadow, do take a Roſe or Violet, or ſome ſuch flower, and carrying it about a while in their fingers, do depart: and others returning home out of an Orchard, do carry the boughs of trees that bear fruit; others again, bring to their kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks, fragments of the table from ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſuppers; ſo alſo thou, when thou depart'ſt, carry back an admonition to thy children, wife, and all thy kindred. For this admonition is of more uſe than a meadow, an orchard, and a table. Theſe roſes never wither, this fruit never falls off, theſe diſhes never are marred.</q> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; <q>Think what a thing it is, ſetting aſide all other things, both publick and private, to be alwayes diſcourſing of Gods Laws, at table, and in the market, and in other Conventicles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>Homil.</hi> 6. <hi>ad Populum.</hi> Where, by an induction of divers ſimilitudes, he declares what Chriſtians
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:66018:230"/>
are to do, after they be returned home from the publick aſſembly; namely, that they conferr at home of what they heard in the Church. In the beginning alſo of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Homil.</hi> on <hi>John,</hi> he requires of his hearers, that they talk not only with one another publickly, but at home, of what they had heard: and when he reproves thoſe that went out of the Church, who did not well remember what they had heard, he preſcribes this remedy for that malady; namely, <hi>that when they are return'd home, they</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hom. 5. in Math.</note> 
                     <hi>read the Holy Scriptures, and call their wife and children together, to confer of thoſe things that were ſpoken.</hi> It's an excellent place which the Reader ſhall find lib. 5. chap. 12.
<q>We wiſh, ſaith <hi>Origen,</hi> that you would<note place="margin">Hom. 9. in Levit.</note> ſtudy what you have heard; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear the Word of God in the Church, but in your houſes be exerciſed, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate in the Law of the Lord day and night: for Chriſt is there, and every where preſent to them that ſeek him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the fore-mentioned teſtimonies, it appears, that the Fathers treated ſeriouſly with their people, to conferr among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<note place="margin">Object.</note> of what they had heard. Now if any one think, that they meant conferring of what they had heard on other dayes than

                     </gap> of the Word heard on other dayes, (which he will not deny they did, that looks into their writings) do they therefore judge that the Word of God which was handled on the Lords Day, muſt be forgotten? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs; eſpecially when elſewhere they counſel their hearers to conferr with thoſe that were abſent, of what they heard in publick, after they were departed from the publick aſſembly.

Chriſtians therefore are on this day principally to think of this eternal reſt, taking an occaſion from the reſt of the Lords Day; although, as I ſaid, it be not properly inſtituted to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie this reſt, as a type of that thing.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Ignatius, Epiſt. ad Magneſ.</hi> delivers of the manner of obſerving the Sabbath, may fitly be applied to the celebration of the Lords Day: He would have every one to keep a Sabbath in a ſpiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>in meditating of the Law, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and releaſing of the body, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the works of God:</hi> which eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do agree to the ſolemnity of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sabbath: on which Chriſtians are to bend their care hither, to recollect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and feed their ſouls with the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts of that eternal reſt (of which the Lords Dayes reſt is an image, according to <hi>Baſil</hi>) in the world to come, by what means they can. Therefore, when the publick meeting was ended, there followed alſo a pious meditation, which very well agreeth to the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:66018:232"/>
of the Lords Day, when the minds of men by hearing of the Word, publick Prayers, and other publick Offices of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion performed on that day, are infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with exceeding love to deſire hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things. And that the Ancients were of that mind, the teſtimonies cited Book 1. Chap. 5. without me ſaying ought, do bear witneſs. For the Fathers, as we have ſeen, do acknowledge, that the Lords Day was dedicated to Divine Worſhip, and judged that nought was to be done on that day by Chriſtians, whether in their aſſemblies, or after they were diſmiſſed from them, but what tended to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſoul. This, <hi>Origen</hi> alone, for all, will manifeſt, <hi>Hom.</hi> 23. <hi>in Num.</hi> who, while he ſhews in what things the obſervation of the Chriſtian Sabbath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, <hi>bids in, among other things, to think of heavenly things, to be careful about the future hope, to have before our eyes the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, and not to look at preſent and viſible things, but at inviſible and future.</hi> Theſe things do ſhew, that pious medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of neceſſity to be had on the Lords Day: by help whereof, the minds of Chriſtians may be carried up from earthly, to heavenly things; to the end;
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:66018:232"/>
that <hi>their converſation may be in heaven, from whence they look for the Saviour,</hi> Phil. 3. 20. even while they live on earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> is earneſt with his hearers, <hi>Hom.</hi> 15. <hi>in Gen.</hi> that they would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what was ſpoken in the Auditory, and that they would weigh all things with themſelves, that what they had heard might ſettle in their thoughts. Nor doth he ask this onely of them, but doth alſo earneſtly requeſt it of God, that not onely while they were preſent in the Auditory, they would remember what he had ſaid, but that they would weigh them at home by themſelves, and in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and whereſoever they did abide. <hi>Hom.</hi> 5. <hi>ad Pop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if a Religious meditation on the Lords Day of what we have heard, be a way to the eternal obſervation of a Sabbath in the Heavens for Chriſtians, (for whom there <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:66018:233"/>
are preſent in the Auditory, but after their their departure thence, where-ever they abide, they be to call to mind what they have heard.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if thoſe vigilant Fathers were earneſt with God, that their Auditors minds might be perſwaded to do this, all which are manifeſt by the cited teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: then, not without cauſe, have we affirmed, that when the publick aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies are ended, Meditation upon what we have heard is of neceſſity required of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we read that Gifts, which<note place="margin">Alms ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</note> afterwards they called Collects, were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on the Lords Day, for the uſe of the poor.

                     <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Ap.</hi> 2. ſaith, that when the Church was met on the Sunday, there was a larger contribution, as their ability would bear, and what they ſo gathered, they committed to him that was the <hi>Praepoſitus,</hi> to be beſtowed for the uſe of all that were poor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> alſo mentions this cuſtome, in <hi>Apol.</hi> and others that flouriſhed after him in the Church. Which is ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that I ſuppoſe none will make doubt of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are ſome of ſundry things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ancients, after the publick aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies were ended in the Church, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their principal pains. Which things, whoever conſiderately weigheth, he will eaſily grant, that the private obſervation of the Lords Day was not unknown to the Fathers; becauſe their hearers were ſometime examined of what they had heard, when the aſſemblies were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the Biſhops admoniſhed them to conferr one among another of thoſe things; and they required them to refreſh their minds with Divine Meditations out of the Word, which they heard in the publick aſſembly; and carefully beſtowed ſeveral things that conduced to the comfort of the poor.</p>

                  <p>And if I have miſtaken any thing here, I do not withdraw my ſelf from the cenſure of the Orthodox Church, but ſubmit my ſelf very willingly to its ſentence.

<pb n="409" facs="tcp:66018:235"/>
that, which was obſerved by men of more ſound judgement, and more congruous to the practiſe of the univerſal Church.</p>
                  <p>If any one blame me, for not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating the Holy practiſe of the Church, in theſe queſtions, more copiouſly, and with more teſtimonies of the Ancients; I hope in this to find pardon from the courteous; ſince I purpoſed to do in this buſineſs, what <hi>Iſychius,</hi> in <hi>Levit.</hi> l. 2. cap. 9. relates of Image-makers and Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: who, when they begin of any thing their art requireth, do at firſt ſet out ſome rough draughts of an Image or picture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely ſhadowed out in its lineaments, which afterwards, in proceſs of the work, are perfected, by adding of the ſeveral parts, and are, as it were, brought to their <gap reason="foreign">

wavering about this queſtion, and am troubled at others that indulge the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the fleſh too much) in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. But I commend in the name of God this office to others, who are well exerciſed in obſerving the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the purer Church, that for the ability granted to them by the Lord, for profiting the Church, they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to bring to light thoſe things which may conduce to the glory of God, in obſerving the ſolemnity of his day. Indeed, I judge, they would in this do a thing very acceptable to God, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Lords Day ſolemnity; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Church, the faithful obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of this ſolemnity, and very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Chriſtian Religion, of which this ſolemnity was alwayes a token.</p>
