            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO
My Esteemed FRIEND
George Raynsford, <abbr>Esq</abbr>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Wou'd not have you surpriz'd with this Address, though I
gave you no warning of it. The Buisiness of this Epistle is
more Vindication than Complement; and when we are to
tell our Grievances 'tis most natural to betake our selves to
a Friend. 'Twas thought perhaps that this unfortunate Off-spring
having been stifled on the <hi>Stage,</hi> shou'd have been buried
in Oblivion; and so it might have happened had it drawn its
Being from me Alone, but it still retains the immortal Spirit of
its first-Father, and will survive in Print, though forbid to
tread the <hi>Stage.</hi> They that have not seen it Acted, by its being
silenc't, must suspect me to have Compil'd a Disloyal or Reflecting
<hi>Play.</hi> But how far distant this was from my Design and Conduct
in the Story will appear to him that reads with half an Eye. To
form any Resemblance between the Times here written of, and the
Present, had been unpardonable Presumption in Me. If the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiters
conceive any such Notion I am not accountable for That.
I fell upon the new-modelling of this Tragedy, (as I had just before
done on the <hi>History of King Lear)</hi> charm'd with the many Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
I discover'd in it, which I knew wou'd become the <hi>Stage;</hi> with
as little design of Satyr on present Transactions, as <hi>Shakespear</hi>
himself that wrote this story before this Age began. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the posture of Affairs in King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's Reign,
how dissolute then the Age, and how corrupt the Court; a Season
that beheld <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Infamy</hi> preferr'd to <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Pow'r,</hi>
exercis'd in Oppressing, Learning and Merit; but why a History
of those Times shou'd be supprest as a Libel upon Ours, is past my
<pb facs="tcp:61959:3"/>
Vnderstanding. 'Tis sure the worst <hi>Complement</hi> that ever was
made to a Prince.</p>
            <q>
               <l>O Rem ridiculam, Cato, &amp; jocasam,</l>
               <l>DignÃ¡mque Auribus, &amp; tuo Cachinno.</l>
               <l>Ride, quicquid amas, Cato, Catullum</l>
               <l>Res est Ridicula, &amp;c.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Our <hi>Shakespear</hi> in this Tragedy, bated none of his Characters
an Ace of the Chronicle: be took care to shew 'em no worse Men
than They were, but represents them never a jot better. His
<hi>Duke of York</hi> after all his buisy pretended Loyalty, is found
false to his Kinsman and Sovereign, and joyn'd with the <hi>Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators.</hi>
His King <hi>Richard</hi> Himself is painted in the worst Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of History. Dissolute, Vnadviseable, devoted to Ease and
Luxury. You find old <hi>Gaunt</hi> speaking of him in this Language
<q>
                  <l>â€”Then there are found</l>
                  <l>Lascivious Meeters, to whose Venom found</l>
                  <l>The open Ear of Youth do's always Listen.</l>
                  <l>Where doth the World thrust forth a Vanity,</l>
                  <l>(So it be New, there's no respect how Vile)</l>
                  <l>That is not quickly buzz'd into his Ear?</l>
                  <l>That all too late comes Counsel to be heard.</l>
               </q>
without the least palliating of his Miscarriages, which I have
done in the new Draft, with such words as These.
<q>
                  <l>Your Sycophants bred from your Child-hood with you,</l>
                  <l>Have such Advantage had to work upon you,</l>
                  <l>That scarce your Failings can be call'd your Faults.</l>
               </q>
His Reply in <hi>Shakespear</hi> to the blunt honest Adviser runs thus.
<q>
                  <l>And Thou a Lunatick Lean-witted-fool, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Now by my Seat's right Royal Majesty,</l>
                  <l>Wer't Thou not Brother to great <hi>Edward</hi>'s Son.</l>
                  <l>The Tongue that runs thus roundly in thy Head</l>
                  <l>Shou'd run thy Head from the unreverent Shoulders.</l>
               </q>
On the contrary (though I have made him express some Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
yet he is neither enrag'd with the good Advice, nor deaf
to it. He answers Thusâ€”</p>
            <q>
               <l>â€”Gentle Unkle;</l>
               <l>Excuse the Sally's of my Youthfull Blood.</l>
               <l>We shall not be unmindfull to redress</l>
               <l>(However difficult) our States Corruptions,</l>
               <l>And purge the Vanities that crowd our Court.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61959:3"/>I have every where given him the Language of an Active, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Prince. Preferring the Good of his Subjects to his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Pleasure. On his <hi>Irish</hi> Expedition, you find him thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak
his Queenâ€”
<q>
                  <l>Though never vacant Swain in silent Bow'rs</l>
                  <l>Cou'd boast a Passion so sincere as Mine,</l>
                  <l>Yet where the Int'rest of the Subject calls</l>
                  <l>We wave the dearest Transports of our Love,</l>
                  <l>Flying from Beauties Arms to rugged War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
Nor cou'd it suffice me to make him speak like a King (who as
Mr. <hi>Rhymer</hi> says in his <hi>Tragedies of the last Age considered,</hi> are
always in PoÃ«try presum'd Heroes) but to <hi>Act so too,</hi> viz. with
<hi>Resolution</hi> and <hi>Justice.</hi> Resolute enough our <hi>Shakespear</hi> (Copying
the History) has made him, for concerning his seizing old <hi>Gaunt</hi>'s
Revennues, he tells the wise Diswaders,
<q>
                  <l>Say what ye will, we seize into our Hands</l>
                  <l>His Plate, his Goods, his Money and his Lands.</l>
               </q>
But where was the Iustice of this Action? This Passage I confess
was so material a Part of the Chronicle (being the very Basis of
<hi>Bullingbrook</hi>'s Vsurpation) that I cou'd not in this new Model so
far transgress Truth as to make no mention of it; yet for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of my Heroe I suppose the foresaid Revennues to be <hi>Borrow'd</hi>
onely for the present Exigence, not <hi>Extorted.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Be Heav'n our Judge, we mean him fair,</l>
               <l>And shortly will with Interest restore</l>
               <l>The Loan our suddain Streights make necessary.</l>
            </q>
            <p>My Design was to engage the pitty of the Audience for him in
his distresses, which I cou'd never have compass'd had I not before
shewn him a Wise, Active and Iust Prince. Detracting Language
(if any where) had been excusable in the Mouths of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators:

very Scene (as I have manag'd it) though it shew the Confederates
to be Villains, yet it flings no Aspersion on my Prince.</p>
            <p>Further, to Vindicate ev'n his <hi>Magnanimity</hi> in Regard of his
Resigning the Crown, I have on purpose inserted an intirely new
Scene between him and his Queen, wherein his Conduct is sufficiently
excus'd by the Malignancy of his Fortune, which argues indeed
Extremity of Distress, but Nothing of Weakness.</p>
            <p>After this account it will be askt why this Play shou'd be supprest,
first in its own Name, and after in Disguise? All that I can answer
to this, is, That it was <hi>Silenc'd on the Third Day.</hi> I confess, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
it wou'd have found Protection from whence it receiv'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition;
and so questionless it wou'd, cou'd I have obtain'd my
Petition to have it perus'd and dealt with according as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
Deserv'd, but a positive Doom of Suppression <hi>without Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
was all that I cou'd procure.</p>
            <p>The Arbitrary Courtiers of the Reign here written, scarcely did
more Violence to the Subjects of their Time, then I have done to
<hi>Truth,</hi> in disguising their foul Practices. Take ev'n the <hi>Richard</hi>
of <hi>Shakespear</hi> and History, you will find him Dissolute, Careless,
and Vnadvisable: peruse my Picture of him and you will say, as
<hi>Aeneas</hi> did of <hi>Hector,</hi> (though the Figure there was alter'd for
the Worse and here for the Better) <hi>Quantum mutatus ab illo!</hi>
And likewise for his chief Ministers of State, I have laid Vertues
to their Charge of which they were not Guilty. Every Scene is
full of Respect to Majesty and the dignity of Courts, not one alter'd
Page but what breaths Loyalty, yet had this Play the hard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to receive its Prohibition from Court.</p>
            <p>For the two days in which it was Acted, the Change of the Scene,
Names of Persons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was a great Disadvantage: many things
were by this means render'd obscure and incoherent that in their
native Dress had appear'd not only proper but gracefull. I call'd
my Persons <hi>Sicilians</hi> but might as well have made 'em Inhabitants
<pb facs="tcp:61959:4"/>
of the <hi>Isle of Pines,</hi> or, World in the <hi>Moon,</hi> for whom an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
are like to have small Concern. Yet I took care from the
Beginning to adorn my Prince with such heroick Vertues, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
made his distrest Scenes of force to draw Tears from the
Spectators; which, how much more touching they would have been
had the Scene been laid at Home, let the Reader judge. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
Comedy I judg'd necessary to help off the heaviness of the
Tale, which Design, Sir, you will not only Pardon, but Approve.
I have heard you commend this Method in Stage writing, though
less agreeable to stricktness of Rule; and I find your Choice confirm'd
by our <hi>Laureat</hi>'s last Piece, who confesses himself to

1. Have I not born Commission with <hi>Watt Tyler</hi> (witness our
luminary lost in that Service) and was I not president at <hi>Iack

Fryers mendicant, that in our Reign wou'd soon have starv'd

the temporal King is absent and Usurpers invade?</p>
                     <p>2. Why, it behoveth thee to take unto thee a good Conscience,
and make thy felf King.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Simon Shuttle,</hi> I never lik't thy Politicks, our meanest Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren

the Governour; therefore as <hi>Bullingbrook</hi> shall approve
himself to our liking, we will fix him upon the last of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
or cast him out amongst the shreds and shavings of
the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>4. But pray Neighbour, what is this same Common-wealth?</p>
                     <p>3. You may see it at <hi>Smithfield</hi> all the Fair-time, 'tis the Butt End
of the Nation.</p>

Man and Wife, the very same thing, only the Common-wealth is
the Common-wealth and the Republick is the Republick.</p>
                     <p>2. What an excellent Spirit of knowledge is here?</p>

their Debts.</p>
                     <p>7. I except against that, I would rather break, than have gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
out of my debt; it gives us priviledg of being Sawcy: how
are we fain to cringe 'till we have got them into our Books? and then I
warrant we can cock up with the best of 'em. I hate mortally to
be paid off, it makes a man such a sneaking Rascal.</p>
                     <p>1. We will have strict and wholsom Lawsâ€”</p>

mark me Boy, I cannot blame thy grieving for <hi>Richard,</hi> because

rather to our Oath, being now his sworn Subjects) I conjure
thee. This I speak, because the King suspects thee, and made
me even now pledge for thy truth and fealty: Bear you well
therefore in this new Spring of Government, lest you be cropt
before your timeâ€”Well, what News from <hi>Oxford,</hi> Boy? Hold
th' intended Triumphs there? 'Tis said our new King will grace

            <l>NOw we expect to hear our rare Blades say</l>
            <l>Dam' me, I see no Sense in this dull Play;</l>
            <l>ThÃ´ much of it our abler Iudges know,</l>
            <l>Was famous Sense 'bove Forty Years ago.</l>
            <l>Sometimes we fail to Please for want of Witt</l>
            <l>Ith' Playâ€”but more for want on't in the Pitt;</l>
            <l>For many a ruin'd PoÃ«ts Work 'twou'd Save,</l>
            <l>Had you but half the Sense you think you have.</l>
            <l>Poets on your Fore-Fathers pam'd dull Plays,</l>
            <l>And shrewdly you revenge it in our Days</l>
            <l>In troth we fare by't as your Tradesmen do,</l>
            <l>For whilst they raise Estates by Cheating You:</l>
            <l>Into Acquaintance with their Wives you fall,</l>
            <l>And get 'em Graceless Sons to spend it All.</l>
            <l>'Tis plain Th'are Yours, Cause All our Arts miscarry,</l>
            <l>For just like You, They'll Damn before they'll. Marry.</l>
            <l>Of honest Terms I now almost Despair,</l>
            <l>Vnless retriev'd by some rich Yeoman's Heir,</l>
            <l>In Grannam's Ribbans and his Own streight Hair!</l>
            <l>What Comforts such a Lover will afford,</l>
            <l>Ioynture, Dear Ioynture, O the Heavenly Word!</l>
            <l>Butâ€”E're of You my Sparks my Leave I take,</l>
            <l>For your Vnkindness past these Pray'rs I makeâ€”</l>
            <l>So very Constant may Your Misses be,</l>
            <l>'Till You grow Cloid for Want of Iealousie!</l>
            <l>Into such Dullness may your PoÃ«ts Tire,</l>
            <l>'Till They shall write such Plays as You Admire:</l>
            <l>May You, instead of Gaming, Whoring, Drinking,</l>
            <l>Be Doom'd to your Aversionâ€”Books and Thinking:</l>
            <l>And for a Last Wishâ€”What I'm sure You'l Call</l>
            <l>The Curse of Cursesâ€”Marriage Take ye All.</l>
