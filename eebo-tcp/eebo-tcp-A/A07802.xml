         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Truth is of such force (most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and dread Soueraigne) that it
hath enforced the professed enemies
of truth (the cursed brood of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
traitorous Iesuits and Iesuited
papists I meane) to testifie the truth
against themselues. The secular Seminarie priests (the
Popes owne deere vassals, who professe the selfesame
<pb facs="tcp:14159:3"/>
religion with the Iesuits, and yeeld the selfe same obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Pope,) tell vs plainly in printed bookes
puplished to the view of the whole world (a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
rare and greatly to bee admired) of such brutish,
barbarous, cruell, villanous, traytorous, and most
bloodie dealing, practised not onely by their deere
brethren the Iesuites, but euen by themselues also,
though not in one or the same degree; that my selfe
doubtlesse could neuer haue giuen credit thereunto, if
their owne selues had not so written, and so testified
against themselues. They affirme constantly, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
printed bookes published to the view of the whole
world, that the Iesuits by treacherous practises and
most bloodie complots, haue long sought for the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ruine and conquest of noble England, and that
their owne hearts and hands had sometime beene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewed
with the same. They affirme against the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits:
First, that they are great lyers. Secondly, that
they are proud men, richly apparelled, furnished with
coaches, and attended on with a great traine of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingmen,
as if they were Barrons or Earles: Yea,
it is constantly auouched, that the Iesuit <hi>Gerard</hi> had
two geldings in a gentlemans stable, at thirtie pounds
a gelding, besides others else where, and horses of
good vse. It is also set downe in print, that a Iesuit
had a girdle and hangers of thirtie pound price. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they trowle vp and downe from good cheere
to good cheere, commaunding their chambers to bee
perfumed, and gentlewomen to pull off their boots.
Fourthly, that they are great statesmen, and that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of state, titles of princes, genealogies of kings,
<pb facs="tcp:14159:3"/>
right of succession, disposing of scepters, with other
matters of like qualitie, are their chiefe studies. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they threaten a conquest, and promise great
preferment to all that will execute their most trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torous
designements. Sixtly, that they are cruell
tyrants, and firebrands of all sedition. Seuenthly,
that they are theeues and murderers, and that the
Iesuit <hi>Percie</hi> stole seuen and twentie pound of the
common money, by the consent of the other his
fellow Iesuits. Eightly, that they haue a mint of
counterfeit miracles, with which they labour to
seduce the world: Yea, that they endeuoured with
a false miracle, to persuade <hi>Sebastian</hi> the late king
of Portugall, to establish a setled law, That from
thence forward none might bee capable of the
crowne of Portugall, except hee were a Iesuit,
or chosen by their societie, as at Rome the Pope
is chosen by the Colledge of Cardinals. Nninthly,
that the Iesuits are right Machiauels, and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
will adhere vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, must depend vpon the
deuil of hell. Tenthly, that the Iesuits are flat cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siners;
and that their religion is nothing else, but an
hotchpotch of <hi>omnigitherum.</hi> And to knit vp all in a
word, that they are the wickedst men vpon earth.</p>
            <p>They confesse against themselues: first, that
<hi>Sanders</hi> a secular priest, was the architect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
both in England and in Ireland. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the same <hi>Sanders</hi> did too much extoll
the rebels, seeing they were executed by the
auncient lawes of our countrey, for high treason.
Thirdly, that the Iesuits came into England by the
<pb facs="tcp:14159:4"/>
instinct of the deuill, and were the chiefest instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all traitorous practises against our late
Soueraine of most happie memorie. Fourthly,
that popish Seminaries are erected for treason. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the Iesuits and the secular priests expected
a chaunge, which now they haue indeed; but
God bee thanked, to their euerlasting woe and
griefe. Sixtly, that the Seminarie priests are sworne
to be traytours against their dread Soueraigne and
natiue countrey. Seuenthly, that all Iesuited pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
must depend vpon the deuill. Eightly, that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie
is inseparably annexed with treason. Ninth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the hearts and hands of the secular priests,
had sometime beene as deepe in treasonable practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as the cursed crew of Iesuits. Tenthly, that
the lawes of the land are iustly made, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Iesuits and themselues; and that they
are not put to death for religion, but for treason.
Eleuenthly, that long hidden treasons are miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
reuealed, God so appointing it to be done.
All these asseuerations to be true, (most dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraine)
I am readie to iustifie out of their owne
printed bookes, euen vpon the perill of my life:
if any of them vpon the like perill, will challenge
mee to haue charged them falsly in that behalfe.
This notwithstandlng, the Iesuits, Seminaries, and
other Iesuited papists, doe still expect a tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to liue as they list, within your Maiesties king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and dominions; that is in plaine English,
to bee rancke traytours as they haue beene. For
this end they neuer cease to buzze into mens
<pb facs="tcp:14159:4"/>
heads and eares (so to withdraw them from their
due allegeance, and to become popish vassals)
that the next parliament, they shall not faile of
their desire. Against this cursed brood, I haue pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
many bookes; but to this day, could I not
receiue answere to any of them all. Neither can
they alledge for their excuse, that they haue not
seene my bookes, or else they would haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the same. For, about a yeere agoe the
masked Iesuit <hi>E. O.</hi> did publish a treatise against
two learned writers of this age,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> Against M. D. Sutcliffe and M. Willet.</note> in which he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
notice to the bookes which I have publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
against them, and their late vpstart Romish
religion; which by piece meale, and by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
hath crept into the Church, as I haue prooued
at large in my former volumes.</p>
            <p>These are the expresse wordes of the masked
Iesuit;<note place="margin">In his Preface to the reader.</note> To these former, I was once determined
to haue adioined a reformed brother of theirs, one
<hi>Thomas Bell,</hi> who hath published certaine bookes
against the Catholicke Church, and vaunteth
mightily, and with insolent words braueth all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries:
but I altered my purpose, partly vpon
other considerations, but especially, because the
confutation of his worthy workes is alreadie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
and to bee published, if it shall bee
thought necessarie.</p>
            <p>Thus doth the Iesuit write. By whose wordes
it is very apparant, cleere, and euident, that they
haue beene many yeeres buzzing about some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
either to all or some one of my bookes;
<pb facs="tcp:14159:5"/>
but neuer yet durst aduenture to frame any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
to any one of the said bookes, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
it to the view of the world. Their silence in
not answering my said bookes, hath reclaimed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a man from their popish faction: and therefore
would they gladly haue the the world to thinke,
that they are in mind to answere my said bookes,
but they seeme to meane nothing lesse in deed:
and why? hee telleth vs forsooth, That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
which hath beene long vndertaken, must
be published, but with this addition, (If it shall be
thought necessarie.) What a iest is this? the Iesuits
and Seminarie priests, haue consulted now for the
space of eight yeeres and aboue, and haue all that
time deuised how to frame some colourable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
at the least, to all or some of the said bookes;
and in the end of the yeere, 1602, haue vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the confutation of my worthy workes (as they
scornefully tearme them;) but for all that cannot
yet tell, whether it be expedient to publish the said
confutation, or no. Are these men the great Statists
of the world? are these men the skilfull Polititians
that must manage all Europe? are these our learned
Diuines? are these they indeed, vpon whose doctrin
and guiding all Lay-papists do depend, and on their
shoulders do hang their soules and saluation? doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
they may preach this goodly sermon to wise
men, but onely noddies and starke fooles will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
them. In regard hereof (most dread Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne)
and because I greatly desire once during my
life, to receiue answere to some part of my labours
<pb facs="tcp:14159:5"/>
published against our English Iesuited papists, that
so wee may valianly fight the combat, my selfe so
hauing occasion to reply vpon their answere, which
would bee to mee <hi>melle &amp; fauo dulcius;</hi> I haue
compiled and couched in a small roome, a fewe
distinct articles: for answere whereunto, I once
againe challenge <hi>Robert Persons</hi> that traitorous Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit;
<hi>George Blackwell</hi> that seditious and late start-vp
archpriest; and all other English Iesuits, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie
priests, and Iesuited papists, whosoeuer
and wheresoeuer, ioyntly and seuerally; daring
them all ioyntly, and euerie one of them seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
to answere either all my bookes, or some
one of them, or these few articles; or at least
to confesse plainely, that they cannot answere,
because I hold and defend the truth. These my
late studies (most gratious Soueraigne) I haue
presumed to dedicate vnto your Maiestie, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation
of your most happie raigne ouer vs;
whom God of his great mercie hath raised vp in
our greatest necessitie, to continue his holy Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
among vs, and to abolish all idolatrie and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
out of his Church. It is not such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
I confesse, as beseemeth your most royall
excellencie; yet such a one, as my small talent
is able to affoord: I most humbly beseech your
Highnesse for to accept it, as our Lord Iesus
Christ did accept the two mytes of the poore
widdow; and withall for to protect and patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
the same, against the traitorous Iesuits and
<pb facs="tcp:14159:6"/>
Iesuited papists within your Maiesties Realmes;
who seeke by might and maine (as I am credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
informed) not onely to impaire my good
fame and name with their malicious tongues, but
also to take away my life with their bloodie
hands. The Almightie blesse your Maiestie with

            <head>THE FIRST ARTICLE,
of the falsely so supposed soueraignetie
of the Bishop of Rome.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou Papists tell vs, that your
Pope, the Bishop of Rome,
is aboue all powers and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
on earth, that he
can depose kings and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
from their royall
thrones, and translate their
empires and regalities at his
good will and pleasure. But
this doctrine is false, absurd,
and nothing els but a meere fable: and consequently,
late Romish religion consisteth of meere falshoods, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and flat leasings.</p>
            <p>The proposition, the Iesuit <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that late Romish
Cardinall,<note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 5. de Rom. pont. ca. 7. col. 824.</note> setteth downe in these words: <hi>Si ergo princeps
aliquis ex oue aut ariete fiat lupus, id est, ex Christiano fiat haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,
poterit pastor ecclesiae eum arcere per excommunicationem, &amp;
simul iubere populo, ne eum sequantur, ac proinde priuare eum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minio
in subditos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore any prince, of a sheepe or ramme become
a wolfe, that is to say, of a Christian be made an heretick;
then the pastors of the Church (the Pope forsooth) may
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14159:8"/>
driue him away by excommunication, and withall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
the people not to obey him, and therfore depriue
him of his dominion ouer his subiects. Thus we see, that
when any prince is not, or ceaseth to be a Papist, for that
(with this Iesuiticall Cardinall and all others of his brood)
is to be an hereticke; then the Pope forsooth may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
such a prince from his royall scepter, and absolue
his subiects from their alleageance to him. This is the
common doctrine of all Iesuited papists, as I haue proued
in my anatomie of Popish tyrannie.</p>
            <p>The assumption is prooued by the flat testimonie of
their famous Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the great,<note place="margin">Gregor. lib. 2. epist. 61. cap. 100</note> in these words: <hi>Ego
quidem iussioni subiectus, eandem legem per diuersas terrarum
partes transmittifeci; &amp; quia lex ipsa omnipotenti deo minime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordat,
ecce, per suggestionis meae paginam, serenissimis dominis
nunciaui; vtrobique ergo quae debui exolui, qui &amp; imperatori obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiam
praebui, &amp; pro deo quod sensi, minimè tacui.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I being your subiect, and at your commaund, haue
caused the same law to be sent through diuerse parts of
the land; and because the law it selfe doth not accord to
Gods will, behold, I haue signified so much vnto your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
by my epistle; and so I haue discharged my dutie
in both respects, as who haue rendered mine obedience
to the emperour, and haue not concealed what I thought
in Gods behalfe.</p>
            <p>These are the words of <hi>Gregorius,</hi> who was himselfe bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Rome <hi>anno</hi> 603. and liued aboue six hundred
yeares after Christ; for which time the Popes liued in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
obedience vnder the emperours, as is euident by
his expresse words alreadie alleaged: For first, Pope <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
freely and willingly acknowledgeth the emperour to
be his soueraigne lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he confesseth himselfe to be the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
subiect.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he graunteth that he oweth loyall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the emperour, and for that respect he thought
himselfe bound in conscience to publish the emperours
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14159:8"/>
law, though in some part it seemed to disagree with Gods
will; and that (forsooth) least he should be found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of disloyaltie toward his prince.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this alleageance he acknowledged to the
emperour <hi>Mauritius,</hi> who liued more than six hundred
yeares after Christs sacred incarnation. During which
tearme of years, the bishops of Rome, now called Popes,
liued in subiection to the emperours of Rome, as other
bishops doe this day to their lawfull kings.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> freeth kings from all lawes made by man,<note place="margin">Ambros. de apologia Dauid, cap. 10. pag. 386.</note>
these are his expresse words: <hi>Rex vtique erat, nullis ipse legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
tenebatur humanis. Neque enim reges vllis ad poenam vocantur
legibus, tuti imperij potestate. Homini ergo non peccauit, cui non
tenebatur obnoxius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was indeed a king, he was subiect to no law of
man: for kings being freed by royall prerogatiues of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
power, are not punishable by the lawes of man.
He therefore sinned not to man, to whom he was not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.

            <p>Seeing I am a king, and haue thee only my iudge ouer
my sinnes, I seeme to sinne onely to thee; that is, I am
subject onely to thee, as to my iudge. For I am lord ouer
all others, and in regard of my power and maiestie, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
pleaseth me, seemeth to be lawfull for me.</p>
            <p>The Popish ordinarie glosse singeth the same song,<note place="margin">Glossa ordin. in Ps. 50.</note>
these are the expresse words: <hi>Rex omnibus superior, tantum

            </p>
            <p>To thee onely haue I sinned; that is to say, to thee on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as to my iudge, and to him that can punish me. For he
had now sinned against <hi>Vrias</hi> and others, whom he caused
to be murthered by that occasion: yet because he was a
king, he had no superior iudge that could punish or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule

the rest. But I hasten to the verdict of a Cardinall of
Rome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hugo Cardinalis</hi> hath these expresse words;<note place="margin">Hugo Card. in Ps. 50.</note> 
               <hi>Tibi soli,
quia non est super me alius quam tu, qui possit punire. Ego enim sum

            </p>
            <p>To thee onely, saith Cardinall <hi>Hugo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> opinion in the sixt article fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, in the first propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and second reason; and note it well, because it is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> because there
is not any aboue me but thy selfe alone, that hath power
to punish me: for I am a king, and so besides thee, there
is none aboue me.</p>
            <p>Thus gentle reader, it is cleere and euident, as well
by the flat testimonie of the auntient fathers, as also of
most famous and renowned Popish writers; that the
Pope or Bishop of Rome is so farre from hauing power
to depose kings and emperours, that he himselfe ought
to be subiect to them, and hath no authoritie at all to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them. VVhat can be more plainely spoken? what
testimonies can be more manifest? what doctrine can
be clearer? for if none but God be superior to the king,
if none but God can iudge the king, if none but God
can punish the king, (all which both auntient fathers
and the Popes owne deare doctors affirme) then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
cannot the Pope depose the king; then can he not
absolue his subiects from their alleageance; then can he
not translate empires and kingdomes, and bestow the
same at his owne pleasure. The good kings, <hi>Iosue, Dauid,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14159:9"/>
Salomon, Iosaphat, Ezechias,</hi> and <hi>Iosias,</hi> knew right well, that
they had authoritie aboue all the priests, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tooke vpon them, not onely to commaund and
controll them, but also to depose and thrust them from
their places and functions, yea euen the high priests
themselues, when their deserts did so require. VVhich
thing is prooued at large in my golden ballance of triall.
Yet here for better satisfaction of the vulgar people, I
will propound a common obiection, that much troubleth
many of them; and that done, frame a plaine and sincere
solution to the same.</p>

               <p>I answere, that many absurd things haue beene affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by Popish parasites, for the aduancement of the

               <p>Thus writeth their owne Popish Frier, affirming that
ignorance and pouertie were the beginning of all lordly
poperie: and no maruell; for by reason of their pouertie
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14159:10"/>
they flattered and sought to please the Pope, and by

               <p>As all power was giuen to Christ in heauen and on

successours (the Bishops of Rome.) As there is no power
but of God, so is there neither any temporall or ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall,
neither imperiall nor regall, but of the Pope; in
whose thigh Christ hath written, the king of kings and
lord of lords; of whose power to dispute, is as it were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge;
to whome no man may say, VVhy doest

               <p>These are the words of this great learned doctor, who

these Antichristian blasphemies within his breast.
Neuerthelesse Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> or (if ye will) Pope <hi>maliface,</hi>
did not only acknowledge them, but with great pleasure
practised the same, as witnesseth the said <hi>Gerson</hi> in these

               </p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight seemeth in a certaine decretall
to haue had this opinion of his owne authoritie. Others
thinke, that the deposition of (<hi>Childericus</hi>) the French
king by Pope <hi>Zacharie,</hi> was grounded in this (Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
and godlesse conceit;) as if forsooth the Pope were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14159:10"/>
he, that could depose princes, and translate their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
               <p>By these authorities it is cleare, that the late Bishops
of Rome haue taken vpon them, not onely to depose
kings, and to translate their kingdomes; but withall haue
challenged more than humane and royall power, euen
that power which is due and proper to God alone. So as
we haue not so much to consider what hath beene done,
as what ought of right to be done. I will therefore for
perspicuitie sake proceed by way of gradation, and set
downe the very steps of the ladder, by which the late bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of Rome, did climbe vp to their vsurped tyrannicall
primacie.</p>
               <p>1 The first step, was the departure of the emperour
<hi>Constantinus</hi> from Rome to Constantinople, at what time
(as the Popes parasites tell vs) the emperour gaue large
gifts to the Pope, euen his whole power, dominion, and
territories, both in Rome, Italie, and all the VVest parts:
for thus is it written by <hi>Gratian</hi> in the Popes own decrees:
<hi>Constantinus imperator coronam &amp; omnem regiam dignitatem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dist. 96. can. Constantinus.</note> 
                  <hi>in
vrbe Romana, &amp; in Italia, &amp; in partibus occidentalibus Apostolico
concessit. Sequitur, decreuimus ita<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> &amp; hoc, vt ipse &amp; successores
eius diademate, viz. corona quam ex capite nostro illi concessimus
ex auro purissime &amp; gemmis pretiosis, vti debeat pro honore B. Petri.
Constantine</hi> the emperour gaue the Pope his crowne
and all royall dignitie in the citie of Rome, and in Italie,
and in all the VVest parts. It followeth a little after in the
next Cannon. VVe therefore haue made also this decree,
that the Pope and his successours shall for the honour of
S. <hi>Peter,</hi> weare the crown of pure gold and pretious stones,
which we haue giuen him from off our owne head. Thus
saith the decree. But <hi>Laurentius Valla, Raphael Voluteranus,
Paulus Catthalanus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 5. de rom. pont. cap. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Nicolaus Cusanus,</hi> and many other popish
writers, repute the same as a fable. Yea our Iesuit <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
seemeth to doubt thereof, and of other like suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
donations, and therefore hath he inuented a soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
remedie for the same. These are his expresse words:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14159:11"/>
Extant Romae authentica instrumenta harum &amp; similium donatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.
Sed etiamsi nihil horum extaret, abunde sufficeret prescriptio
800. annorum. Nam etiam regna &amp; imperia per latrocinium ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisita,
tandem longo tempore flunt legitima.</p>
               <p>There be extant at Rome authenticall instruments of
these and the like gifts. But if there were no such thing,
yet would prescription of 800 yeares be sufficient: for
euen kingdomes &amp; empires gotten by robberie, through
continuance of time become lawfull. Thus writeth our
Iesuit, who hath left nothing vnsaid, that can be said for
poperie.</p>
               <p>The second step, was the fall of the empire in the
VVest. For after the diuision of the empire, it begun dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to decline, and was vtterly dissolued in <hi>Augustulus,</hi> in
the yeare 471.<note place="margin">A. D. 471.</note> of whom was made this epigram; <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus
romanum imperium condidit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ar. Pontac. Burdeg. pag. 93.</note> 
                  <hi>Augustulus labefactauit. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
set vp the empire, but <hi>Augustulus</hi> pulled it downe.
For after <hi>Orestes</hi> his father was slaine (who was neuer em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
but a captain vnder <hi>Nepos</hi>) the said <hi>Augustulus</hi> gaue
vp the diademe, and betooke himselfe to a priuat life.
From this time the empire in the VVest was vacant about
330 yeares. By meanes whereof, the Popes power did dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
increase by little and little, and from step to step.</p>
               <p>The Vissigothes ruled in Spaine, the Abienes in
Guian and Gascoyn, the Frenchmen in the residue of
France, the Vandales in Affricke, the Saxones in Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
the Ostrogothes in Hungarie, the Herules and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilings
in Italie and in the citie of Rome: onely the name
of the empire, remained with <hi>Zenon</hi> in the East. About the
yeare 536.<note place="margin">A. D. 536.</note> 
                  <hi>Totilas</hi> king of the Gothes by force of armes
and famine subdued well neere all Italie, and after long
siege tooke the citie of Rome, and spoyled it with sword
and fire, ouerthrowing the wals and towers euen to the
ground, and vntill <hi>Carolus magnus</hi> the Abiens and Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
possessed all Italie.</p>
               <p>The third step was the voluntarie charter which
<hi>Constantine</hi> the emperour of Constantinople made to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14159:11"/>
Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> the second; <hi>viz.</hi> that whomsoeuer the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
people, and the Romane souldiours should chuse to

of Christ, without any tarrying for any authoritie of
the emperour of Constantinople, or the deputie of Italie,
as the custome and maner was euer before that day. Thus
writeth <hi>Platina,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Platina in vita Benedicti secu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di.</note> who was the Popes owne deere vassale.
This was a very gallant step: for as you see here, the
Popes for the space almost of seuen hundred yeares, <hi>viz.</hi>
vntill this <hi>Bennet</hi> in the yeare 684.<note place="margin">Vide Ar. Pontac. fol. 111. a.</note> acknowledged the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
for their superiours and lords, without whose let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
pattents they could haue no iurisdiction, nor be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
the true Bishops of Rome: but now the Bishops of
Rome by priuiledge graunted from this emperour, wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
their neckes from the emperours subiection. Let
these words of <hi>Platina</hi> be well remembred; because he
being a famous papist, must needs be of good credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them.<note place="margin">A. D. 607.</note> I let passe the petite step, when the emperor
<hi>Phocas</hi> made Rome the head of all churches, which for all
that, is of some moment.</p>
               <p>The fourth step, was the great amitie betweene <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie</hi>
then Bishop of Rome, and <hi>Pipine</hi> gouernour of
France vnder <hi>Childerich</hi> the king: for <hi>Pipine</hi> purposing to
defeat his lord and soueraigne of the kingdome, and to
inuest himselfe therein, sent his embassadours to <hi>Zacharie</hi>
then Bishop of Rome, and his bounden friend, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
this question of him, <hi>viz.</hi> VVhether he were more
worthy to be king, which was king only by name and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
succession; or els he, who bare the whole burthen of
the kingdome alone, &amp; yet lacked the dignitie of a king?
The Pope vnderstanding the parable right well, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
his owne future aduancement likely to ensue
thereupon, answered roundly (I will not say clerkely, but
like a right doctor of the Romish rout) that it was more
rightfull forsooth, that he which tooke the charge of all
things, should be called king.<note place="margin">A. D. 751.</note> Vpon this iudgement so
clerkely yeelded, <hi>Pipine</hi> forthwith presumed to depose
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14159:12"/>
                  <hi>Childerich,</hi> and made himselfe king: that done, saintlesse
(not sackles) <hi>Zacharie</hi> the Bishop of Rome (that antichrists
forerunner might be known)<note place="margin">Geraes. 28. v. 12.</note> assoiled <hi>Pipine</hi> and the other
Frenchmen of their oath of allegeance and fealtie made
to <hi>Childerich,</hi> and confirmed <hi>Pipine</hi> the traitor in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of France. This was indeed a step, not of <hi>Iacobs</hi> lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
nor of <hi>Scala coeli,</hi> but of <hi>Scala inferni, Scala Antichristi,</hi>
and of the ladder of the master deuill of hell. Yet is not
our Iesuit and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (the mouth of all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 5. de Rom pont. cap. 8.</note> and of the Pope himselfe) ashamed to publish the
same as a ground of the popish religion. For these are his
owne words: <hi>Childericum deposuit Zacharias, &amp; in eius locum
Pipinum Caroli magni patrem creari iussit. Cuius causa fuit, quia
propter socordiam Childerici, &amp; religioni &amp; regno in Gallia extrema
ruina imminere videbatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Zacharie</hi> deposed <hi>Childericke,</hi> and commaunded to
place and inuest <hi>Pipine,</hi> father to <hi>Charles</hi> the great, in his
throne: the cause whereof was this; because forsooth
through the slouthfull and negligent gouernment of
<hi>Childericus,</hi> the kingdome and religion in Fraunce seemed
to be in great danger. This is the deepe diuinitie of the
Pope and his clergie, by which we may learne many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
lessons.</p>
               <p>1 First, that the Pope may set vp and pull downe
kings at his pleasure by Iesuiticall doctrine and late Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
religion.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, that the Pope and Iesuites are the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters
and architects of seditions, rebellions, and most
bloudie treasons.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdly, that it is very true which the secular priests
haue written, concerning the traiterous proceedings of
Iesuits and Iesuited papists.</p>
               <p>4 Fourthly, that the Pope commaunded to depose the
Soueraigne, and to inthronize the subiect in his place.</p>
               <p>5 Fiftly, that all this was done, because forsooth the
king did not rule after the Popes fansie and pleasure.
Hereupon I inferre this necessarie correlarie; <hi>viz.</hi> that it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14159:12"/>
behooueth Christian kings to be vigilant, and in due
time to expell all traiterous papists out of their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And if the Bishop of Rome shall send any seditious
popeling into their kingdomes and territories, with his
thunderbolts, buls, and excommunications; then to deale
with the messengers,<note place="margin">A. D. 1294.</note> as king <hi>Philip</hi> the faire dealt with
pope <hi>Boniface</hi> his nuncioes in France; whom he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to prison, and caused the Popes buls to be burnt in
the fire. And as <hi>Charles</hi> the sixt, when <hi>Bennet</hi> the 13. did
interdict his realme,<note place="margin">A. D. 1408.</note> sitting in the throne of iustice in his
high court of parliament the 21 of May, in the yeere
1408. gaue sentence, that the bull should be rent in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and that <hi>Gonsalue</hi> and <hi>Conseleux</hi> the bearer thereof
should be set vpon a pillorie, and publickely traduced in
the pulpit. The storie is set downe at large by the French
papists, in their booke intituled the Iesuites catechisme,
and the same is recorded in my anatomie of Popish
tyrannie.</p>
               <p>The fift step was the decay of the empire in the East
about the yeere 756.<note place="margin">A. D. 756.</note> For when <hi>Aistulphus,</hi> or (as some
write) <hi>Aristulphus</hi> king of the Lombards, besieged the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Rome for the space of three whole moneths, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
an huge tribute of the Romanes; then Pope <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus</hi>
the second, made suite to <hi>Pipinus</hi> king of France to
stand their good master, and to defend the citie from the
furie of the Lombards. King <hi>Pipine</hi> willing to gratifie his
good friend the Bishop of Rome, came with a mightie
armie against <hi>Aistulphus,</hi> and besieged him in Pauie; and
then and there constrained him to appeale to his mercie,
and to yeeld vp the exerchate of Rauenna and Pentapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
into his hands.<note place="margin">Manus manum fricat.</note> This being effected, king <hi>Pipine</hi> (whom
Pope <hi>Zacharie</hi> of a traitour had made king, as is alreadie
prooued) gave vp the gouernment of Italie into the
Popes hands. And the king had reason so to doe: for as
we know, one good turne requires another. So now the
lieutenants of the emperours of Constantinople, ended
their whole power in Italie, who aforetime had their seats
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14159:13"/>
at Rauenna: and now was he taken out of the way, who
(as the Apostle telleth vs) did hinder the comming of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist:<note place="margin">2.
Thess. 2.</note> for Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> in way of gratitude confirmed
the inheritance royall of the kingdome of France to the
said <hi>Pipine</hi> and to his posteritie for euer. Here began a new
progenie of the kings of France: for <hi>Childericus</hi> was the
last king of the stocke of <hi>Meroneus,</hi> who was the first king
Christian of France. This truth is apparant by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of many renowned Chronographers, it cannot
be denied.</p>
               <p>The sixt step,<note place="margin">Bellar. tom. 3. col. 827.</note> was the translation of the Romane
empire from the Greeks to the Frenchmen or Germans,
in the person of magnificall <hi>Charles,</hi> as the Iesuit <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
tearmeth him. The truth is this, as popish Chronogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
doe record and testifie to the world; <hi>viz.</hi> That when
the Romanes had driuen from among them, Pope <hi>Leo</hi>
the third, he appealed to <hi>Charles</hi> then king of France,
who came to Rome, and examined the matter: and in
the end appeased the Romanes, and restored the Pope
to his place and dignitie againe. For this good worke and
kind fauour of the king, the Pope, and people of Rome,
hauing now a long time in mind and affection, reuolted
from the emperour of Constantinople; and seeing a fit
opportunitie offered to accomplish their long wished de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
did with vniforme consent and ioyfull acclamation
proclaime <hi>Charles</hi> the great, the emperour of Rome, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
him the imperiall names of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Augustus,</hi> and
setting the royall diademe vpon his head by the hands of
Pope <hi>Leo.</hi> And for the better credit of mine assertion, I
will here recount the very words of <hi>Sigebertus,</hi> a famous
Chronographer and popish monke,<note place="margin">A. D. 801.</note> who therefore must
needs be of credit with the Pope and all his popelings.
Thus doth he write: <hi>Romani qui ab imperatore Constantinopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litano
iam diu animo desciuerant, nunc accepta occasionis opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
quia mulier excaecato imperatore Constantino filio suo eis impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabat,
vno omnium consensu Carolo regi imperatorias laudes accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,
eumque per manum Leonis papae coronant, Caesarem &amp; Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustum
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14159:13"/>
appellant; Pipinum verò filium eius regem Italiae ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
collandant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Romanes, who a long time had in mind and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
reuolted from the emperour of Constantinople, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now a fit occasion offered them, because a woman did
gouerne them, her sonne the emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> being
made blind, did all with one consent found out imperiall
and royall acclamations to king <hi>Charles,</hi> calling him <hi>Caesar</hi>
and <hi>Augustus,</hi> and crowning him by the hand of <hi>Leo</hi> the
Pope: yea they collaud his son <hi>Pipine</hi> made king of Italie.</p>
               <p>Out of these words I wish the Reader, to obserue these
important points with me.</p>
               <p>1 First, that 800. yeeres after Christs sacred birth, the
Bishops of Rome were subiect to the emperour, as their
owne deere monke <hi>Sigebert</hi> telleth them; and as you haue
heard already, Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> acknowledged his fealtie to
<hi>Mauritius</hi> the emperour, in the yeere 603.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, that the Pope and people of Rome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured
a long time, to shake off the yoke of obedience
to the emperour, and in the yeere 801 put the same in
execution.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdly, that the translation of the empire implied
flat treason, in the Pope and all his Romish Popelings.
For as Fryer <hi>Sigebert</hi> telleth vs, they surrendred vp the
right of their soueraigne to an other man: and hence
commeth it, that the Iesuiticall Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeth
to the law of perscription, affirming titles gotten
by robberie to be lawfull by that meanes. And indeede
by stealth and robberie, it may well beseeme a Iesuite,
to iustifie popish late start vp regalitie.</p>
               <p>4 Fourthly, that the Bishop of Rome is not the true
and lawfull king of Italie: for the papists doe not agree
in their assertions, touching this counterfeit regalitie of
their popes. <hi>Bl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndus</hi> and <hi>Platina</hi> write, that <hi>Pippine</hi> gaue
the exerchate of Rauenna and Pentapolis to <hi>Gregorie;
Regino</hi> referreth the donation to <hi>Steuen;</hi> and <hi>Sigebert</hi> saith
here, that <hi>Pippine</hi> in the yeere 801 had it in his owne pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14159:14"/>
still. Yea, the same <hi>Sigebert</hi> saith further, that in
the yeere 812 the emperour <hi>Charles</hi> imposed the imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
crowne vpon the head of his sonne <hi>Lewis,</hi> and made
<hi>Bernard</hi> sonne of <hi>Pippine</hi> the king of Italie. But doubtlesse
if <hi>Pippine</hi> were king of Italie in the yeere 801 and <hi>Bernard</hi>
king thereof in the yeere 812, I see not how the pope was
then,<note place="margin">A. D. 727.</note> or that is now, any king at all. And therefore wee
may credite <hi>Bellarmine</hi> at leisure, when he telleth vs out of
<hi>Ado,</hi> that king <hi>Pippine</hi> gaue Reuenna and all Pentapolis
to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> but it is well, that S. <hi>Paul</hi>
is become coheire with Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> For by his meanes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bishops must haue as great a share, as the Bishops of
Rome: there the reader must not forget, what frier <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
telleth vs of <hi>Charles</hi> the great,<note place="margin">A. D. 805.</note> after that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronized
in the empire. These are his expresse wordes;
<hi>Carolus imperator &amp;c. Charles</hi> the emperour, when the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
of Constantinople had indignation against him,
for the name of emperour giuen him by the Romanes;
suffered them with great patience and magnanimitie:
And because he was afraid of their mightie power, with
often ambassades hee procured them to bee his deare
friends: yet our Iesuite <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would haue vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that the emperours of Constantinople did freelie
graunt, that the Pope and the Romanes had full right to
translate the empire; but their owne deare friend (as we
see heere,) affirmeth the contrary for a truth. Yea, both
<hi>Bl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndus</hi> and <hi>Platina</hi> affirme very constantly,<note place="margin">Vide Ar. Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iac. fol. 122.</note> that <hi>Charles</hi>
did agree first with the empresse <hi>Irene,</hi> and afterwith the
emperour <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> that he with their fauours might
rule ouer the VVest.</p>
               <p>The seuenth step, was the constitution of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the future emperour.<note place="margin">Vide Phillip. Bergemens. p. 277.</note> For <hi>Gregorie</hi> the fift being
a Germane borne, and a neere kinsman to <hi>Otho</hi> the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
at that time, did by his fauour and free graunt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
seuen electors of the empire for euer.<note place="margin">Antoninus 3. par. tit. 22. cap. 5. §. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of Mentz, the archbishop of Treuerse, the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of Colen, the marques of Brandenburgh, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14159:14"/>
Palatine, the duke of Saxonie, and the king of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.
This goodly constitution was enacted by the Pope
and emperour,<note place="margin">A. D. 994.</note> (being both of them not onely Germanes
but also kinsmen) that the empire might be established
in their posteritie, and their blood thereby aduanced for
euer.</p>
               <p>The eight and highest step of this ladder, did reach
vp euen to the highest heauen, and to the very throne of
our Lord Iesus. For the Pope hauing now enlarged his
soueraigntie, by little and little, from steppe to steppe;
was neither abased nor afraid to challenge the authoritie
and royall right,<note place="margin">A. D. 1294.</note> of both swordes throughout the christian
world: for he made a flat decree for the confirmation
thereof, as is euident by the extrauagant of <hi>Boniface</hi> the
eight, (<hi>vnam sanctam, de maioritate &amp; obedienta</hi>) set downe
in the sixt booke of the decretals.<note place="margin">Dest. 22. can. omnes.</note> And as <hi>Gratianus</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> taught the same doctrine: these are
the expresse wordes, <hi>Christus beato Petro aeternae vitae claui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gero,
terreni simul &amp; caelestis imperij iura commisit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christ committed to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> that beareth the keyes
of eternall life, the right both of earthly and heauenly
empire. And the glosse, which the Popes parasites haue
annexed to this decree,<note place="margin">Gloss. F. caelestis.</note> hath these very wordes; <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum

gladium transtulit imperium:</hi> the Pope hauing both swords,
translated the empire. And <hi>appendix Fuldensis</hi> vnfoldeth
this cursed decree, in these most plaine tearmes:</p>
               <p>Hic Papa (Bonifacius 8.) constitutionem fecerat,<note place="margin">Appendix Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densis.</note> in quae se do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum

requisiuit Philippum regem Franciae, vt a se regnum suum cognos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret,
quod rex facere contempsit.</p>
               <p>This Pope (he speaketh of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight) made a
constitution, in which he affirmed himselfe, to be both
spirituall and temporall lord in the whole world. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14159:15"/>
he would haue had <hi>Philip</hi> king of France, to haue
acknowledged his kingdome from him: which thing the
king scorned to doe.</p>
               <p>Since this ladder was thus framed, the Bishops of Rome
haue tyrannized aboue measure in the world, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vpon them that authoritie which pertaineth to god
alone, they haue disposed of kings and kingdomes, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
royall diademes, tyrannized ouer mens soules, and
troden all sacred soueraigntie vnder foot. For, that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
canons ascribe plaine diuine titles to the Pope, it can
not possibly be denied, because in the Popes owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals,<note place="margin">Gloss. lib. 1. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. tit. 7. cap. 3.</note> I find these expresse wordes; <hi>Sic (Papa) dicitur

So the Pope is said to haue celestiall arbitrement,
and therefore doth he alter the nature of things, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the substantiall parts of one thing to an other; and
so can make of nothing something. Thus the papists
write of their Pope, and he is well pleased therewith. And
yet the truth is, that as man can in some cases at some time
make one thing of an other; so in all cases at all times, to
make some thing of nothing, is proper to God alone.</p>
               <p>The Popes parasites write thus of his power in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall;<note place="margin">Gerso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Pope; in whose thigh Christ hath written, the King of
kings, and Lord of lords. Loe here gentle reader, two
things are proper to God alone; the one, to be King
of kings, and Lord of lords; the other, to be the author
of all power: both which you see here ascribed to the
Pope.</p>
               <p>The Pope himselfe from his owne pen,<note place="margin">Greg. 9. libr. 1. decr. tit. 33. cap. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Gregorie</hi> the

lights, pontificall authoritie, and power royall: that we
may know there is asmuch difference between Popes
and kings, as there is betweene the sunne &amp; the moone.
The glosse setteth downe precisely,<note place="margin">Gloss. ibid.</note> how farre a king is
inferiour to a Pope, that is, to any bishop of Rome, in
these words; <hi>Restat, vt pontificalis dignitas, quadragesies sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

               <p>Now touching the kissing of the Popes feete, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
that some Christian kings and emperours vpon a
blind zeale not grounded in knowledge, humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to the Bishop of Rome, and yeelding vp their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne

that they tooke vpon them to depose the emperors,
to translate their empires, and to dispose at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14159:17"/>
of heauen, for the manner of a true bodie. Lo, this graue
father telleth vs, that Christ as God is euery where; but
yet in respect of his true bodie, he is onely in heauen,
and in some certaine place of heauen. Only in heauen,
because the Scripture saith, That he shall be there till
the worlds end, in some certaine place of heauen, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the nature and veritie of a true bodie indeed. So
then, if he were present as the papists would haue him,
his bodie should lose the nature and veritie of a true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:14159:18"/>
First, where the Apostle telleth vs, that Christ rising
againe from the dead, henceforth dieth no more, because
death hath no more dominion ouer him; the papists tell
vs a contrarie tale, that Christ dieth euery day, nay, a
thousand times a day, in the daily sacrifice of their masse:
for with them all priests (the Pope, Cardinals, and some
others excepted) doe ordinarily say masse euery day, and
three masses vpon euery Christmas day. VVhich being
so, and three hundred Iesuits and seminarie priests being
this day in England and Scotland, as the Iesuites tell vs;
an huge multitude of masses must be said daily in these
realmes, and many times must Christ be put to death, so
farre forth as in them lieth, though they pretend to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him thereby.</p>
               <p>For,<note place="margin">Note this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> as Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> graunteth freely, a sacrifice
implieth intrinsecally, the consumption of the thing that
is sacrificed. I will not auouch any vntruth vpon any
man (gentle reader) these are his owne words: <hi>Sacrificium
enim preter oblationem, requirit mutationem, &amp; consumptionem rei
quae offertur.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beller. de missa, lib. 1. cap. 2. col. 957.</note> For, saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> a sacrifice besides the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
requires an alteration and a consumption of the
thing which is offered.</p>
               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Vbi sup. col. 697.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in another place telleth vs, that the
bodie and bloud of Christ are offered in the masse, <hi>verè &amp;
propriè,</hi> truly and properly, vnder the formes of bread and
wine.</p>
               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Vbi sup. col. 1015.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith in another place, that flesh and
bloud are not fit for meat, <hi>nisi prius animal moriatur,</hi> vnlesse
the beast first die (and be slaine.)</p>
               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Bellar. de missa. lib. 1. cap. vlt.</note> the same <hi>Bellarmine</hi> teacheth the same doctrin,
yet more plainely in another place. Thus doth he write:
<hi>Sacrificium enim verum &amp; reale, veram &amp; realem occisionem exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git,
quando in occisione ponitur essentia sacrificij.</hi> For a true and
reall sacrifice requireth a true and reall killing, seeing
that the essence of the sacrifice consisteth in the killing
thereof.<note place="margin">Hebr. 9. ver. 17, 25, 26, 27, 28.</note> And in very deed, this is that constant doctrine
which S. <hi>Paule</hi> doth inculcate to the Hebrewes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:14159:18"/>
So then, we see it cleare and euident by popish faith
and doctrine, that Iesus Christ our sweet redeemer, must
first be killed, then offered, lastly torne and consumed by
the teeth of the sacrificing masse-priest; or els the popish
masse cannot be perfect, as their most perfect doctor tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs.</p>
               <p>For confirmation of this popish doctrine, it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
position and generally receiued axiome in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
church, that by vertue of their consecratorie words,
Christs bodie is put apart from his bloud, and his bloud
apart from his bodie; and so Christ is there slaine by force
of their consecration, though he still liue indeed, because
the priests words haue not so much force as they imagin.
You shall heare <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne words;<note place="margin">Bellar. de missa, lib. 1. cap. 12. col. 1015. a.</note> 
                  <hi>Nam inprimis ideo
in coena seorsim consecratur corpus, &amp; seorsim sanguis, vt intelliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
presentiam corporis &amp; sanguinis in coena, esse ad modum occisi
&amp; mortui corporis.</hi> For first, therfore is the bodie consecrate
apart in the supper, and the bloud asunder, that we may
vnderstand the presence of the bodie and bloud in the
supper, to be there after the manner of a bodie slaine and
dead. These are his words, and this which he thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth,
is the constant doctrine of the Popish Church.
VVhereupon it followeth of necessitie, that if any papist
should haue said masse, <hi>in triduo mortis Christi,</hi> during Christs
death; then Christs bodie by vertue there of should haue
been dead in one place, and his bloud in another place:
for otherwise, Christ should haue been both quicke and
dead at once, which implieth contradiction. <hi>Aquinas</hi>
graunteth this illation, these are his words: <hi>Ideo si in illo tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duo
mortis fuisset hoc sacramentum celebratum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aquin. 3. p. q. 76. ar. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>non fuisset ibi ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Christi.</hi> Therefore during Christs death, if this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had been celebrated, the soule of Christ should not
haue been in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if this popish kind of doctrine were true,
these absurdities and grosse impieties must perforce fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
hereupon, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ the night before he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
was both sitting at the table, and borne in his own
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14159:19"/>
hands, both liuing and dead, both visible and inuisible,
both long and short, both broad and narrow, both light
and heauie; that he was a sacrifice for our sinnes, before
he died for our sinnes; that his sacrifice was either vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the former oblation in his last supper, or els that it
was needlesse in his bitter immolation vpon the altar of
the crosse.<note place="margin">Hebr. 9. v. 27.</note> For as the Apostle telleth vs, Christ was not to
offer himselfe often, as the high priest did, but once to the
destruction of sinne, by the sacrifice of himselfe. These
are his words, as the papists (our English Rhemists I
meane) haue put them downe; and as it is appointed to
men to die once, and after this the iudgement: so also
Christ was offered once, to exhaust the sinnes of many.
Loe, Christ died but once; and that one oblation was
sufficient to take away all sinnes in the world. The word
(exhaust) which the Rhemists vse, doth significantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
so much. But the words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in another place
are most manifest, and doe plainely conuince this truth:
In the which will (saith S. <hi>Paule</hi>) we are made holy,<note place="margin">Hebr. 10. v. 10.</note> euen
by the offering of the bodie of Iesus Christ once for all.
Againe thus: But this man,<note place="margin">ibid. v. 12.</note> after he hath offered one sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for sinnes, is set downe for euer on the right hand
of God.<note place="margin">ibid. v. 14.</note> Againe in these words: For with one offering
hath he made perfect for euer them that are sanctified.
Loe, gentle reader, Christ, saith Christs apostle, made but
one oblation; Christ, say the papists, hath made many,
and still maketh moe oblations. Christ, saith Christs Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
died but once on the crosse; Christ, say the papists,
dieth euery day in the masse. Christ, saith Christ apostle,
made perfect, finished, and consummated mans redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with one onely sacrifice. Christ, say the papists, doth
perfect and consummate his, with the daily sacrifice of the
masse. Now, whether Christs apostle, or our papists be of
better credit, let the indifferent reader iudge.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the cup is the new testament in my bloud
saith Christ,<note place="margin">Luke, 22. v. 20.</note> which is shed for you. But a testament is not
of force without the death of the testator,<note place="margin">Hebr. 9. v. 17.</note> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14159:19"/>
vs. And consequently either Christs bodie was not
really offered in his supper, or at least it was a sacrifice of
no force, value, or efficacie at all; for that it was not yet
ratified by the death of the testator. Hereupon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of necessitie,<note place="margin">Luke 22. v. 20.</note> that when Christ saith in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> This
cup is the new testament in my bloud:<note place="margin">Math. 26. v. 28.</note> and in S. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
This is my bloud of the new Testament: the sence is all
one, most plaine, and cleare, <hi>viz.</hi> that the cup is a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the bloud of Christ, and of the new Testament
confirmed thereby; but indeed is no more really the
bloud of Christ it selfe, than it is really the new testament
it selfe. For the expresse mention of remission of sinnes,
is referred to the bloud of Christ shed vpon the crosse,
and not to the sacrament of his bloud; seeing his bloud
was not shed in his supper, but in his bitter passion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Apostle saith flatly, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
there is not henceforth any oblation for sinne.<note place="margin">Hebr. 10. 18.</note> But if Saint
<hi>Paule</hi> say truly, that there is no oblation for sinne, after
Christs death on the crosse; then doubtlesse the papists
must needs say falsely, that they haue a daily propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
sacrifice in their popish masse. Neither will it serue
their turne to answere, that it is the selfesame sacrifice of
the crosse, but offered in another manner; for if that
were true, then should their masse-sacrifice be of infinit
value: which for all that, no papist dareth auouch. Nay,
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith in plaine tearmes: <hi>Valor sacrificij missae finitus
est.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bellar. de missa, lib. 2. cap. 4. col. 1076.</note> The value or worth of the masse, is finit, not infinit.
And yet, if the value of the masse be not infinit, then
doubtlesse, that sacrifice cannot be the sonne of God, for
he is of infinit power, of infinit maiestie, of infinit value.
Yea, whosoeuer denieth Christs bodie and bloud, subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
in the person of God by hypostaticall vnion, to be
of infinit value, he is become a flat Arrian, beleeuing
Christ to be pure man, and not God. And consequently,
the papists, howsoeuer they thinke or speake of their
masse, yet in making it a sacrifice, they must perforce be
blasphemous against the sonne of God. Again, <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:14159:20"/>
confesseth against himselfe vnawares, and against an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of popish faith, That their popish masse is not <hi>verè &amp;
propriè,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bellar. de missa, lib. 2. cap 4. col. 1076.</note> truly and properly propitiarie: <hi>Quod Christus nunc
immortalis, nec mereri, nec satisfacere potest.</hi> Because, saith
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> Christ now being immortall, can neither merit
nor satisfie. But I am well assured, that their holy late
councell of Trent teacheth otherwise. These are the
words: <hi>Et quoniam in diuino hoc sacrificio, quod in missa peragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conc. trid. sess. 6. can. 2. die 17. sep.</note> 
                  <hi>idem ille Christus continetur, &amp; incruentè immolatur, qui in ara
crucis semel seipsum cruentè obtulit, docet sanctasynodus sacrificium
istud verè propitiatorium esse.</hi> And because in this diuine sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
which is made in the masse, that same Christ is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and offered vnbloudily, who on the altar of the
crosse once offered himselfe bloudily, the holy councell
teacheth it to be a propitiatorie sacrifice truly &amp; indeed.
Loe, how the papists say and vnsay: one while it is truly
a propitiatorie sacrifice; another while it cannot truly be
so called. VVell, the Pope hath allowed <hi>Bellarmines</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and he hath also allowed the Councell; and yet
wise men can see how they flatly disagree, and that in the

               <p>Fiftly, the Popes owne decrees doe seale vp this truth
against the Pope, these are his words: <hi>Sicut ergo coelestis pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis

is the flesh of Christ, is after it manner called the bodie of
Christ, when indeed it is the sacrament of Christs bodie, of
that bodie which is visible, which is palpable, mortall, and
nailed on the crosse: and that oblation of flesh which is
made by the hands of the priest, is called Christs passion,
death, crucifixion, not in the truth of the thing, but in a
mysterie, which signifieth the thing: so the sacrament of
faith, by which baptisme is vnderstood, is faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:14159:20"/>
Thus saith the text. Let vs now heare their own glosse
vpon the same text, these are the expresse words: <hi>Coeleste
sacramentum quod verè representat Christi carnem, dicitur corpus
Christi, sed improprie, vnde dicitur suo modo, sed non rei veritate, sed
significate mysterio: vt sit sensus, vocatur Christi corpus, id est,
significatur.</hi> The heauenly sacrament which representeth
Christs flesh truly, is called the bodie of Christ, but vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
wherefore it is said, <hi>suo modo,</hi> after it manner, but not
in the truth of the thing, but in the mysterie of the thing
signified: that this may be the sence, it is called Christs
bodie, that is to say, it signifieth his bodie.</p>
               <p>Out of these golden words, deliuered as God would
haue it by the pens of papists, to the confusion of all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
I note first, that the holy and blessed bread of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist
or Lords supper, is called the bodie of Christ. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that it is also called the passion &amp; death of Christ.
Thirdly, that it is not Christs bodie truly, properly, and in
the truth of the thing. Fourthly, that it is Christs body, as
the sacrament of baptisme is faith. Fifthly, that it is not
Christs bodie in truth, but in signification. Sixtly, that it is
only called Christs bodie, because it is the sacrament of his
body; as baptisme is called faith, being only the sacrament
of faith. Seuenthly, that it is Christs bodie, <hi>impropriè, suo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,

of the thing, signified: which words must be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
and marked. Lastly, that it is said negatiuely,
<hi>non rei veritate:</hi> it is not Christs bodie, in truth, in deed, or in
the veritie of the thing. These words are the very vpshot
of the controuersie, they can admit no solution. For if
Christs bodie were in the sacrament really and substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
with bodie, flesh, bloud, sinews, bones, and quantitie,
as the papists say and beleeue; then doubtlesse he should
be there <hi>in rei veritate,</hi> in the truth of the thing, euen in that
true bodie which was borne of the blessed virgin, the true
mother of true God and true man. Answere papists, if ye
can, or els come home, and yeeld to the truth for shame.</p>

               <p>POpish decrees tell vs a long tale of one <hi>Berengarius,</hi>
sometime deacon of a church in Gaunt, who held a
doctrine surely grounded vpon the holy scriptures,
but wholie opposite to the late popish faith; <hi>viz.</hi> That the
bread and wine in the holy Eucharist,<note place="margin">De consecrat. dist. 2. can. Ego Berengarius.</note> after Christs words
vttered, which they call consecration; are onely the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and not the true bodie and blood of our Lord
Iesus Christ; and that they cannot sensuallie or sensibly,
(for so their owne word <hi>sensualiter</hi> signifieth) bee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
or broken with the hands of the priests, or torne with
the teeth of the faithfull. For this opinion so setled vpon
Gods word, as all the cursed Romish brood, are not able
in truth to gainesay the same; Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> with his Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
synod, did so cruelly proceed against the sillie dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
as he must needs either abiure and renounce the
truth, or else betake himselfe to be burnt with popish fire
and faggot out of hand. In regard whereof, the poore
deacon ouercome with humane frailtie, yeelded at least
in shew of wordes, to their most wicked, cruell, and very
barbarous, or rather villanous suggestion. Then the
Pope and Councell set downe the forme of words, which
he should pronounce, the summe whereof I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
alleaged: who as list may read the words at large, in
the place quoted in the margent. I omit the wordes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are long and tedious: onely I wish the reader
to obserue seriously with me, (for this reason can neuer
be answered till the worlds end) that it is an article of
popish faith, (oh horrible blasphemie) That the true and
reall body of the sonne of God, which was borne of the
vigin <hi>Marie,</hi> and sitteth at the right hand of God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
omnipotent and all sufficient, is torne in pieces with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14159:21"/>
the teeth of the faithfull, and broken asunder with the
hands of the priest, in their idolatrous masse. For these
are the words of the popish synod; <hi>Manibus sacerdotum
frangi, &amp; fidelium dentibus atteri.</hi> Which wordes are so
fully farced with blasphemie, and repugnant to the truth,
that neither <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> nor the popish glosse, nor <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>
can tell how to shuffle vp the same, but with
shame inough, they passe it ouer as they can. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
who is as it were the Popes owne mouth, writeth in this
manner;<note place="margin">Bellar. de con. lib. 2. cap. 8. d.</note> 
                  <hi>Respondeo, nunquam fuisse quaestionem, an Christi corpus
vere vt est in se, frangeretur manibus, &amp; dentibus tereretur; certum
enim est, &amp; semper fuit, Christi corpus incorruptibile nunc existens,
non posse frangi &amp; teri, nisi in signo siue sacramento: ita vt dicatur
frangi ac teri, cum signum eius, id est, species panis frangitur, &amp;
teritur.</hi> I answere (saith the Iesuite) that question was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
made, if the body of Christ as it is in it selfe, were true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
broken with hands, and torne with teeth; for it is and
and euer was certaine and sure, that Christs bodie being
now incorruptible, cannot be broken and torne, saue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a signe or sacrament; so as it may be said to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and torne, when the signe thereof, that is to say, the
forme of bread is broken and torne.</p>
               <p>Out of these words I note first, that by the Popes owne
doctrine, (for the Iesuites doctrine is the doctrine of the
Pope, seeing the Pope hath approoued it,) Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
cannot be broken or torne, truely and indeede. I
note secondly, that the Pope and his Councell decreed
the contrarie doctrine, and that as an article of popish
faith; when they compelled <hi>Berengarius,</hi> to confesse it
with his mouth, and to beleeue it with his heart, and did
also publish the same, <hi>per vrbes Italiae, Germaniae, &amp; Galliae,</hi>
through the cities of Italie, France, and Germanie: for so
saith the decree, <hi>Ego Berengarius.</hi> I note thirdly, that it is
truely said, Christs bodie is broken; because the forme
of the bread is broken, as popish doctrine teacheth vs.
For we see here, that this is all that the papists can say
for themselues: and vpon this strong foundation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14159:22"/>
bulwarke, I inferre this golden and euident co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollarie;
<hi>viz.</hi> That if it be true to say, Christs bodie is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and torne, because the signe of his bodie is broken
and torne; then truely may wee say, and truelie doe we
say, that Christs bodie is in the Eucharist, because the
signe of his bodie is there, because the sacrament of his
bodie is there, because the representation of his bodie is
there. And much more truly might Christ himselfe say,
This is my bodie, when he gaue the signe and sacrament
of his bodie. I note fourthly, that it is the constant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the church of England (which also many other
reformed churches approoue therein) that Christs bodie
is receiued, broken, torne, and consumed with mouth and
teeth, figuratiuely, significantly, mystically, sacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And consequently, if the papists would be iudged by
this doctrine, which by the pen of the Iesuit <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
they here deliuer, the controuersie would soone be at an
end. But I must needs tell the reader, what the Popes
owne glosse teacheth vs:<note place="margin">Gloss. de Cons. dist. 2. cap. ego Berengarius.</note> it is singular and worthie to be
noted, these are the words: <hi>Nisi sane intelligas verba Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garij,
in maiorem incides haeresim, quam ipse habuit; &amp; ideo om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
referas species ipsas, nam de corpore Christi partes non faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
Vnlesse thou vnderstand the words of <hi>Berengarius</hi>
soundly, thou shalt fall into a greater heresie than he
had; and therefore thou must referre all things to the
formes, for of Christs bodie we make no parts. Marke
these words, gentle reader, for they are important: They
teach vs plainly, that it is a most dangerous thing to relie
vpon popish decrees, euen then when they pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the church, and to condemne heresies.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Austen</hi> confirmeth the doctrine, which the Pope
compelled <hi>Bellengarius</hi> to abiure,<note place="margin">August. in Ioan. tract. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>9.</note> and that in many places
of his workes; one onely assertion I will now set downe.
These are his words: <hi>Illi manducabant panem dominum; ille,
panem domini contra dominum.</hi> They (the other Apostles) are
the bread, that was the Lord, he (<hi>Iudas</hi>) ate (not our Lord,
but) the bread of our Lord, against our Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:14159:22"/>
Note these words, gentle reader, and marke them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously.
S. <hi>Austen</hi> telleth vs, that the bread which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Apostles ate, was our Lord; yet that which <hi>Iudas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
was but the bread of the Lord. This assertion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth
the papists. For, if our Lord and maker be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent really,
in flesh, bloud, and bone, vnder the accidents
of bread; and that so long as the same accidents remaine
vncorrupt, as the popish faith holdeth: then doubtlesse
<hi>Iudas</hi> should haue receiued his redeemer; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perforce <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
should also haue receiued <hi>pane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Iudas</hi> could
not by any possibilitie haue barely receiued <hi>panem domini,</hi>
which yet S. <hi>Austen</hi> affirmeth most constantly. For first,
if it were true, that after popish supposed consecration,
the substance of bread were transubstantiated into Christs
naturall bodie, as it truly consisteth of flesh, bloud, and
bone: and againe, if it were also true, that the selfesame
bodie remained vnder the forme of bread, vntill it were
corrupted, then let all the papists in England, with the
best aduise of all their adherents and brother papists els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
in Europe, tell me how <hi>Iudas</hi> could receiue (<hi>panem
domini</hi>) the bread of our Lord, and not (<hi>panem dominum</hi>)
the bread which is the Lord, as S. <hi>Austen</hi> plainely auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
that is, how <hi>Iudas</hi> could receiue the forme, with the
flesh, bloud, and bones, of Christs organicall and naturall
bodie hidden vnder the same; and for all that, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
Christ himselfe, and <hi>panem dominum,</hi> as the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
did. Let them I say tell me this, and I herewith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to subscribe, and neuer henceforth to write against
them or any part of their popish doctrine. If they will
not this doe, because they cannot (for if they can doe it,
all the world must thinke they will doe it, for their owne
credit and the credit of their cause) then doubtlesse, if the
feare of God be before their eyes, they will acknowledge
the truth, and with open mouth confesse the same. <hi>Corde

               <p>FIrst, the papists tell vs, that Christs bodie in their
masse, is the selfesame bodie that was nailed on the
crosse. And withall they tell vs, that it is a figure of
the same bodie. That it is a flat contradiction, their owne
deare Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> shall tell them: These are his
words:<note place="margin">Bellar. de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist. lib. 1. cap. 3. col. 474.</note> 
                  <hi>Figurae necessario, inferiores esse debent rebus figuratis.</hi>
Figures of necessitie must be inferiour to the things figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by them. And this doctrine is most true indeed, as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> discourseth to the Hebrewes.<note place="margin">Hebr. 10.</note> Now would I know
of the papists, if they can say ought for the life of their
masse, how Christs bodie in the masse being the selfesame
bodie <hi>numero,</hi> as they teach and beleeue, can be inferiour
to Christs bodie on the crosse; how it can be both inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and superiour to it selfe; how it can be both of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and lesser value than Christs body on the crosse, being
euer the selfesame bodie on the crosse.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the papists tell vs, that Christs naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
is contained in a little round cake, or vnder the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and forme of bread. Now would I know of the same
papists, how the bigger can be contained of the lesser,
how a bushell can be couched in a pecke, how a great oxe
can be closed vp in a little calues bellie. For all these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
euident contradiction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Bellar. de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist. lib. 1. cap. 2. col. 472.</note> the papists tell vs, that Christs bodie is truly
broken. For these are the Iesuit <hi>Bellarmines</hi> words: <hi>Deni<expan>
                        <am>

in concilio Romano sub Nicolao 2. compulsus est Berengarius confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri,
Christi corpus sensualiter sacerdotum manibus tangi &amp; frangi.</hi>
Finally, in a councell at Rome vnder Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi>
the second, <hi>Berengarius</hi> was compelled to confesse, that
Christs bodie is sensuallie touched and broken with the
priests hands.</p>
               <p>Now would I know, how it can be true, that Christs
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14159:23"/>
bodie is broken, and also true, that it is not broken, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the same bodie at the same time. Let all papists
answere, and tell me if they can, how it implieth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
For to say, that not the bodie but the accident
of bread is broken, is too too childish and friuolous. The
reason is euident, because <hi>Berengarius</hi> (ô cruell impietie)
was compelled to confesse, that Christs bodie was sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
broken.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the papists tell vs, that the pronouncing of
these words by a priest (This is my bodie) do make Christs
bodie present in their masse, and also in other places: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
(marke well gentle reader what I say) that if a
popish priest come into a great market place, where
there is great store of wheat bread, though a thousand or
moe loaues in number, and there looking on the bread,
shall pronounce the said words, with intention to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate,
then forthwith euery loafe is God almightie, and
the people must adore the same. Triall hereof was once
made <hi>de facto</hi> in Italie, as my selfe being in Rome, heard
from the mouth of a Iesuit. For, as the Iesuit reported, a
priest being degraded and designed to die, as he passed in
the street by a bakers house, beheld a great quantitie of
wheat bread, and recited these words (<hi>Hoc est corpus meum</hi>)
and told the people, that he had consecrated the said
bread.<note place="margin">This is a great wonderment, and extreame popish sollie.</note> VVhereupon consultation was had out of hand
among the learned, and sentence giuen, that euery loafe
was God almightie: and the bread was caried away with
great solemnitie, reuerence, and such adoration as was
due to the sonne of the euerliuing God. Now would I
know, when the priest hath pronounced three of the said
words, <hi>viz. (hoc est corpus.)</hi> what is become of the bread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. For if they answere, that it is Christs bodie: then
will it follow to their shame, that one of the words of
their consecration is of no force; which to die for it, the
papists may not admit. If they say, that a part of Christs
bodie is then wrought really, by vertue of the said words,
then will it follow to their greater shame, that Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14159:24"/>
is really torne in pieces, by force of their bloodie and
most cruell masse. If they say, that nought is indeed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
vntill the last sillable of the last word be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
then will it follow to their confusion, that of foure
words wherein consisteth their whole consecration, three
are of no vertue, force, or efficacie, but stand as cyphers
to fill vp the place, and to make a shew of that which is
not.</p>
               <p>Fiftlie, <hi>Durandus</hi> telleth vs, that onely the forme of
bread is chaunged, and that the matter of bread remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
still in the Eucharist. <hi>Rupertus</hi> the popish Abbot hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
that the bread is vnited hypostaticallie to the son of
God. <hi>Caietanus, Henricus,</hi> and <hi>Capreolus,</hi> are of another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
<hi>Iohanncs Parisiensis</hi> held also that the bread was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpted,
but in a different manner from the opinion of
<hi>Rupertus.</hi> Another opinion, affirmeth the annihilation of
the bread: but the Iesuit <hi>Bellarmine</hi> holdeth with their
Councell of Trent, that the bread is transubstantiated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the bodie of Christ.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, the papists tell vs, that when the priest is at
masse, then all spectators must adore that which he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
ouer his head, and constantly beleeue it to be their
maker and redeemer of the world: and if any hold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
opinion, or teach the contrarie doctrine, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
must be burnt with fire and faggot for his paines. But
yet for all this the popish faith telleth vs, that if either the
priest want intention to consecrate, (which often chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,
or at least may chaunce, by reason of wandering
imaginations) or of purpose meaneth not to consecrate,
or of negligence omitteth, or miscalleth any word of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration;
then by popish doctrine, faith, and religion, the
thing adored for God almightie, is but pure bakers
bread; and consequently, the adorers there of become
idolaters, worshipping a piece of bread for the euerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, the papists tell vs, that many priests are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
at once to pronounce the words of consecration,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14159:24"/>
in the Romish Church Lateran when they are made
priests. But they cannot tell vs, how many gods, or how
many times God is made in one and the same piece or
cake of bread, in and at that masse of the newlie made
priests. For they are all appointed to consecrate, they
doe all pronounce the wordes, they are all bounden to
haue intention, and they all haue the fit and requisite
matter to worke vpon: but when the principall actor and
chiefe agent, to wit, the bishop, is at the last syllable; then
some of the rest be in the middest, some toward the end,
some in one place, some in an other, neuer one iumping
with other in that instant, in which they should their
bread-god make. For of this dreadfull mysterie, there
are three solemne dissonant opinions.<note place="margin">Ioseph. Angl. in 4. s. pag. 180.</note> Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi>
holdeth, that they all doe consecrate: <hi>Durandus</hi> auouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that that priest onely consecrateth, which with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
speed first commeth to the end: but Cardinall <hi>Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi>
hath a different consideration. Now would I know,
how these so different popish opinions, in a matter
of so great importance, can be reconciled
and salued from contradiction. Answere
papists if you can, or else relent
and yeeld to the truth
for shame.

               <hi>Augustinus de Ancona,</hi> in that
booke which he dedicated to Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the twelft of that
name, singeth the same song, and affirmeth the Pope to
haue the same power. These are his expresse words; (<hi>Papa</hi>)
<hi>tanquam vicarius Dei filij caelestis imperatoris, iurisdictionem habet
vniuersalem super omniaregna &amp; imperia.</hi> The Pope, as he that
is the vicar of the sonne of God the heauenly emperour,

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:14159:26"/>
Many other papists haue the like testimonies, but they
are needlesse, seeing the Pope is a sufficient witnes against
himselfe, hauing often reduced their assertions to actuall
execution. For the Pope hath often by his wicked and
execrable dispensations taken vpon him to dissolue that
matrimonie which is firme and stable by Christs owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
The former part is prooued by their learned ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonist
<hi>Martinus Nauarrus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nauar. in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char. cap. 22. par. 21.</note> in these expresse wordes: <hi>Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur
(matrimonium) ante consummationem, per dispensationem pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae
iusta de causa factam.</hi> Matrimonie is dissolued before
consummation, by the Popes dispensation vpon iust cause
graunted. Now to prooue that the Pope may this doe,
<hi>Nauarre</hi> taketh it for a good ground, that the Pope hath
practised the same. Thus doth he write: <hi>Quorum opinio adeo
obseruatur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nauar. vbi sup.</note> 
               <hi>quod etiam ter vel quater ad petitiones consilio meo ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam

dissoluerant quaedam matrimonia omnino clandestina
nondum consummata, in remedium animarum alioquin probabiliter
periturarum.</hi> VVhose opinion (he speaketh of the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists)
is so obserued, that three or foure times before my
comming to Rome, vpon petitions made by mine aduise,
Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> the third, and Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, with their
dispensations dissolued certaine secret matrimonies not
yet consummate, for the safegard of souls, which by like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood
would otherwise haue perished.</p>
            <p>And another famous popish Canonist <hi>Couarruvias</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,<note place="margin">Couar.
to. 1. cap. 7. par. 4. n. 13. col. 1</note> that Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> the fourth and <hi>Iulius</hi> the third dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
in like manner. These are his words: <hi>Necme latet
Paulum quartum summum ecclesiae pontificem, anno 1558. hac vsum
fuisse dispensatione quibusdam excausis, quas iustissimas esse idem
summus ecclesiae praesul existimauit. Idem Paulo ante Iulius tertius
fecerat in eodem matrimonio, cum ecclesiae vniuersali praesiderit.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
am I ignorant, that the Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth put this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
in practise, for certaine causes which the same
Pope thought to be most iust. <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, when he
was Pope, in the like case graunted the like dispensation.
Thus we see the former part of mine assertion to be most
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14159:27"/>
sufficiently prooued, <hi>viz.</hi> that Pope taketh vpon him
to dissolue lawfull and perfect matrimony. Now for proofe
of the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> that wedlocke before consummation or
copulation, is firme and perfect, and cannot be dissolued
by the power of man: Christs owne words are a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ground.<note place="margin">Matth. 19. v. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Quod deus coniunxit, homo non separet.</hi> That which
God hath conioyned, let not man put asunder. And in
another place Christ hath these words:<note place="margin">Luke, 16. v. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Omnis qui dimittit
vxorem suam, &amp; alteram ducit, moechatur.</hi> Euery one that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth
adulterie.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paule</hi> vpon the same argument deliuereth the like
doctrine in these words:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. v. 10.</note> 
               <hi>His autem qui matrimonio iuncti sunt,
precipio non ego sed dominus, vxorem à viro non discedere; quod si
discesserit, manere innuptam, aut viro suo reconciliari, &amp; vir vxorem
non dimittat.</hi> Those that are married commaund not I,
but the Lord, that the wife depart not from her husband:
but if she shall depart, then to abide vnmarried, or to be
reconciled to her husband.</p>
            <p>Thus saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and thus saith Christ himselfe, that
man and wife ioyned by Christ, must abide during life to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
or liue vnmarried, and not be seuered by the
Popes dispensation.</p>
            <p>And it will not helpe the Pope to say as the Iesuit <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
doth, and others with him, That Christ only spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<hi>de matrimonio consummato,</hi> and that <hi>matrimonium ratum,</hi>
with which the Pope dispenseth, is not <hi>de iure diuino.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For first, if <hi>matrimonium ratum</hi> were not <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> the
greatest popish doctors would not denie the Popes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
therein.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Christ speaketh absolutely, and maketh no
mention of copulation or popish consummation at all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, matrimonie with papists is a diuine sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and consequently, it both is perfect without car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
copulation, and also indispensable by the power of
man.<note place="margin">Canus de locis, lib. 8. ca. p. 246.</note> For as their owne famous doctor <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> saith:
<hi>Sanctus spiritus &amp; sacramenti gratia, per coitum non datur.</hi> The
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14159:27"/>
holy ghost and the grace of sacrament is not giuen by
copulation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it followeth hereupon, that matrimonie is
not fully perfect in the popish church, because copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
followeth a good while after.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, because it is absurd to say, that it beginneth to
be a sacrament by carnall copulation, and was not a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
by the priests action.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, it followeth hereupon, that there was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
matrimonie betweene <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> for their matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
was in the state of innocencie, and before all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
copulation.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, because if matrimonie be not <hi>de iure diuino,</hi>
euen before copulation, there is no cause why both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
agreeing together, may not release the bargaine, and
quite dissolue the contract. For as the law saith, <hi>Quisque
potest suo iuri cedere.</hi> Euery man may yeeld vp his right:
which thing, all, as well Canonists as Diuines, admit for
good in <hi>sponsalibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eightly, it followeth hereupon,<note place="margin">Matth. 1.</note> that the marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the blessed virgin and S. <hi>Ioseph,</hi> was not perfect
matrimonie: for there doubtlesse wanted carnall copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
but the angell of God feared not to call her <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi>
wife.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> hath these words: <hi>Non enim defloratio virginita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
facit coniugium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ambros. de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit. virg. cap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>sed pactio coniugalis.</hi> For not the deflouring
of virginitie maketh wedlocke, but the coniugall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Austens</hi> iudgement herein is most cleere and euident.<note place="margin">August. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens. euang. lib. 2. cap. 1. to 4.</note>
These are his words: <hi>Cum igitur ipse narret, non ex concubitu
Ioseph, sed ex Maria virgine natum Christum, vnde eum patrem eius
appellat, nisi quia &amp; virum Mariae rectè intelligimus sine commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
carnis, ipsa copulatione coniugij.</hi> VVhen therefore he
telleth vs, that Christ is not borne of <hi>Iosephs</hi> copulation,
but of the virgine <hi>Marie;</hi> vpon what ground doth he call
him his father, but onely for that we doe rightly conceiue
him to be <hi>Maries</hi> husband without the commixtion of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14159:28"/>
flesh, by the very copulation of wedlocke.</p>
            <p>The same father writing to <hi>Valerius,</hi> discourseth of this
matter at large,<note place="margin">Augustin. de nup<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ijs &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupisc. lib. 1. cap. 11. tom. 7.</note> and among many other notable senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
setteth downe these words: <hi>Quibus vero placuit, ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensu
ab vsu carnalis concupiscentiae in perpetuum continer, absit vt
inter illos vinculum coniugale rumpatur. Secquitar neque enim falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer
ab angelo dictum est ad Ioseph, noli timere, accipere Mariam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iugem
tuam.</hi> They that were content by mutuall consent
to abstaine for euer from the vse of carnall copulation,
God forbid, that betweene them should be dissolued the
bond of wedlocke. For the Angell did not speak deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> when he willed him not to feare to take <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
his wife vnto him.</p>
            <p>Thus we see it cleare, that the pope taketh vpon him
that power and authoritie which is proper to God alone:
for he practically auoucheth (as I haue prooued by his
owne deere doctors) that his dispensations are of force to
vnmarrie and put asunder those persons whom God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
hath ioyned together in holy wedlocke. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise
(as I shall prooue vnto you) he practically hath
taken vpon him to ioyne in wedlocke those persons, to
whom God himselfe hath forbidden marriage. I will omit
knowne examples, and alledge one only not knowne to
many; which as it is rare and notorious, so is it able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
all that heare it, to exclaime against the execrable
practise of the Pope.</p>

of the popish stampe, and by the Pope reported
for a saint) hath these very wordes: <hi>Reperitur tamen papa

matrimonium cum quadam cius germana.</hi> Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
it is knowne, that Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fift did dispense

with his owne naturall and full sister,<note place="margin">Fatetur Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus olim papam dispensando er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasse. lib. 4. sent. dist. 7. q. 4. in fine.</note> of the same

doth import. Behold here, gentle reader, the excellencie

thou mayest find it in my booke of Motiues. But this
here is a sufficient antepast for all our English Iesuits and
Iesuited popelings. None are so ignorant, but they know
that onely God can giue licence to marrie a mans owne

their damnable doctrine in this point.<note place="margin">Lombard. lib. 3. sent. dist. 19.</note> These are

touching our soules, we are redeemed in part, not wholly,
from the sinne, not from the paine, neither wholly from
the sinne or fault. For we are not so redeemed from it,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14159:29"/>
that it be not (in vs) but that it rule not (ouer vs.) Thus
writeth the worshipfull popish master,<note place="margin">Now must the papists per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or els crie fire and faggot for their chiefe master.</note> our reuerend fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Lombard:</hi> out of whose words we may gather with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie
so much as will serue our turne against the papists.
For first he saith we are redeemed in part, but not in the
whole. Secondly, that we are not wholly redeemed from
sinne. Thirdly, he telleth vs how we are redeemed from
sinne, <hi>viz.</hi> that albeit sinne still remaine in vs, yet hath it
not such dominion ouer vs, that it can enforce vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thereunto.
Loe, this doctrine is not mine, but the flat
doctrine of the papists, which I learned of that great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,
who for his learning was surnamed the master of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
and to this day is publickly read in their diuinitie
schooles.</p>
            <p>Touching S. <hi>Paule,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. v. 25.</note> he saith first in this manner: I my
selfe with the mind serue the law of God, but with the
flesh, the law of sinne. Out of these words I note first,
that the Apostle speaketh of the regenerate throughout
this whole chapter, because he nameth himselfe, who was
Gods chosen and elect vessell. For which respect, and the
like expressed in the seuenth chapter to the Romanes,
S. <hi>Austen</hi> changed his opinion, and graunted S. <hi>Paule</hi> to
speake here of the regenerate.<note place="margin">Aug. li. 1. retract cap. 22. p. 23. </note> I note secondly, that the
elect and regenerate doe serue the law of sinne. I note
thirdly, that the best liuers are so farre from meriting <hi>ex
condigno,</hi> grace and glorie, that they deserue in rigour of
iustice, eternall death, because death is the reward of sin.
VVhich for that S. <hi>Austen</hi> could not well digest at the
first, he thought that S. <hi>Paules</hi> words were to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of the reprobate, and not of the elect and godly
sort: but when he had pondered the Apostles discourse
and words more seriously, he changed his opinion. This
is confirmed in the selfesame chapter in these words: But
I see another law in my members, rebelling against the
law of my mind,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. v. 23.</note> and subduing me vnto the law of sinne,
which is in my members. By these words it is euident,
that albeit S. <hi>Paule</hi> were the child of God, yet could he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14159:29"/>
not merite any thing in Gods sight: but rather in rigour
of iustice prouoke Gods heauie displeasure against him:
For where or what could be his merite, who was prisoner
to the law of sinne?<note place="margin">Rom. 7. v. 19.</note> Againe, the same is confirmed in these
words: For I do not the good which I would, but the euill
which I would not, that doe I. Thus saith S. <hi>Paule.</hi> And
doubtlesse, since he did the euill which he would not, he
sinned, though he were regenerate: and in that he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he was guiltie of damnation, because death is the
stipend of sinne.<note place="margin">August. epist. 105. pag. 301.</note> For this cause grauely saith S. <hi>Austen:
Cum deus coronat merita nostra, nihil aliud coronat, quam munera
sua.</hi> VVhen God crowneth our merites, he crowneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els but his owne gifts. Againe, the same is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in these words, For the law is spirituall, but I am car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
sold vnder sinne.<note place="margin">Rom. 7, v. 14.</note> Thus saith S. <hi>Paule</hi> of himselfe. And
yet it is most true, that one vnder the buthen of sinne can
merite nothing saue hell fire and eternall paine. Againe,
the same is confirmed in these words: If I do that I would
not,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. v. 20.</note> then it is not I that doth it, but sinne that dwelleth in
me. Loe S. <hi>Paule</hi> graunteth that to be sinne in himselfe,
which yet himself consenteth not vnto. And that he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of originall concupiscence, which remaineth in the
regenerate after baptisme, it cannot be denied. And it
will not serue the turne, to say as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth, <hi>viz.</hi> that
originall concupiscence remaineth after baptisme, but is
no sinne at all: and, that it is called sinne onely in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
because it prouoketh a man to sinne; as a mans wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is called his hand, because it is written with his hand.
For first, their owne master <hi>Petrus Lombardus</hi> graunteth it
to be sinne, euen as S. <hi>Paule</hi> doth. Secondly, it causeth
man to serue the law of sinne, which seruice can neuer be
but sinne. Thirdly, S. <hi>Paule</hi> saith, he doth that ill which
he would not, and that which he doth hate. All which
must needs be meant of sinne.</p>
            <p>That concupiscence remaining after baptisme, is truly
called sinne, the papists themselues confesse vnawares in a
maine point of doctrine and setled ground of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14159:30"/>
Marke well gentle reader what I shall deliuer in this
behalfe.</p>
            <p>God chose all in Christ that shall be saued before the
foundation of the world: and likewise reprobated al both
negatiuely and positiuely (that I may vse their schoole-tearmes:)
but positiuely, for the foresight of original sinne.
For the proofe hereof, it will suffice to alledge the words
of our papists at Rhemes,<note place="margin">Rhemes test. in Rom. 9. v. 14.</note> in their notes vpon the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.
Thus doe they write: So likewise, God seeing all
mankind, and euery one of the same, in a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
and masse of sinne in and by <hi>Adam,</hi> deliuereth
some and not othersome. These are their own words: and
that which they teach, is the common doctrine of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
church.<note place="margin">Rhem. Rom. 9. v. 11.</note> Againe, the same Rhemists in the chapter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
quoted haue these words: by the same example of
those twins, it is euident also, that neither nations nor
particular persons be elected eternally, or called tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
or preferred to Gods fauour before others by their
owne merits: because God when he made choise and first
loued <hi>Iacob,</hi> and refused <hi>Esau,</hi> respected them both as ill,
and the one no lesse than the other guiltie of damnation
for originall sinne, which was alike in them both. And
therefore where iustly he might haue reprobated both,
he saued of mercie one. This is that strong foundation,
whereon the papists thinke predestination to be built: the
which I willingly doe admit, as which will make good my
positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen against themselues. For seeing as they grant.
That God beholding all in a generall condemnation for
originall sinne,<note place="margin">Marke wel this Dilemma.</note> saueth the elect of mercie, and iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth
to condemne the reprobate for originall sinne: it
followeth of necessity, that either some reprobate shall be

els that concupiscence remaining after baptisme, is sinne
indeed,<note place="margin">Junò per actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, &amp; propria sua peccata quid ni?</note> which is the doctrine I defend. The consequution
and illation is euident. For if originall sinne be truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in baptisme, and be not truly sinne in the baptised,
then can none be iustly damned that are baptised: for how
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14159:30"/>
shal they be iustly condemned, for that which is remitted?
it cannot be. And to graunt that all baptised persons
shalbe saued, is most absurd; neither can I thinke any pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
so senselesse, as to affirme the same. For to name one
for all: their Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, who (as their owne
deere frier <hi>Caranza</hi> saith) entred into the popedome as a
foxe,<note place="margin">Caranza in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma conciliorum. fol. 369.</note> reigned in it as a wolfe, and died in the end as a dog;
is not I trow a saint in heauen; and yet must we thinke he
was baptised, or els a terrible <hi>vae vobis</hi> will fall vpon our
papists.</p>
            <p>Now because the papists vse to boast, that S. <hi>Austen</hi> is
on their side, I will prooue at large, that he defendeth
this my doctrine here deliuered: and that I purpose in

In these wordes, Saint <hi>Austen</hi> expresseth three things
precisely; first, that concupiscence in the regenerate, is
the punishment of sinne; secondly, that it is the cause of

three seuerall reasons for the same: and that he speaketh
of the regenerate, it is euident in this; because he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of that concupiscence, against which the good spirit
striueth. Most impudent therefore are the papists, when
they auouch with open mouth, that Saint <hi>Austen</hi> onely
calleth it sinne, because it is the cause of sinne. And the
gentle reader may here also obserue, that S. <hi>Austen</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
concupiscence of the flesh, with that blindnesse of

selfe same made sinne in the child? to this, this is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere:
that the concupiscence of the flesh is forgiuen in
baptisme, not so that it remaine not, but so that it is not
reputed for sinne. Not any thing therefore remaineth,
which is not forgiuen, seeing that is done which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,

               <p>Saint <hi>Austen</hi> in these wordes sheweth plainely, that
concupiscence remaineth aswell in the baptised parent,
as in the vnbaptised child; yet with this difference, that
it is sinne in the parent, though not for sinne imputed;
but in the child it both is sinne, and is also so reputed. And
the reader must not forget, that Saint <hi>Austen</hi> saith, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Nothing is sinne that remaineth; or thus, No sinne remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth:

As if he had said, sinne indeede remaineth still

Marke well gentle reader, the phrase which Saint <hi>Austen</hi>
here vseth. It is forgiuen that still remaineth, saith Saint
<hi>Austen;</hi> or, not any thing remaineth, which is not forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

remaineth which is sinne, though pardoned and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted

tuas non eas; sed non perficit, quia non implet quod scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

he hath not power to doe good, but that he cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that which is good. For he doth great good, who
doth that which is written; Follow not thy lustes: but he
doth not perfect his well doing, because he doth not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
that which is written, Thou shalt not lust.</p>
               <p>Out of these wordes of Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> I note many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
documents. First, that Saint <hi>Austen</hi> speaketh
these wordes of the regenerate; for they onely can doe
this good, whereof the apostle speaketh. Secondly, that
though the regenerate can doe good, and striue against
lust; yet can they not doe that good so perfectly, but it
is alwayes annexed to sinne, and chayned with it, as with
an heauie yokefellow. Thirdly, that the tenth comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
(marke well my wordes) prohibiteth not onely
actuall lust done with consent, but also originall lust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
without consent; and consequently, that concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence
remaining in the regenerate, is sinne properlie
and formallie. I prooue it, because Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could not
performe this precept, as Saint <hi>Austen</hi> truely and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
obserued: who for all that touching actuall sinne,
was most free and innocent. For he fought mightily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his raging concupiscence, and did in no wise yeeld
thereunto. He was therefore guiltie by reason of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
concupiscence, which abode in him against his will.
Therefore most absurd is the exposition of the Rhemists,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. v. 7.</note>
who beare the reader in hand, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh
not of the habituall concupiscence, or sensuall desire and
inclination to euill, when he forbiddeth to lust. For if
onely the consent of our reason and mind, to obey and to
follow the lusts thereof, were sinne indeede; then should
Saint <hi>Austens</hi> exposition be very childish and too too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
who telleth vs plainely in expresse tearmes, That
S. <hi>Paul</hi> could not fulfill that precept, although he did not
yeeld his consent vnto it, neither did obey or follow the
desires thereof. No, no, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had no such meaning;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14159:32"/>
he named it sinne, as it is indeed. He saith, hee had not
knowne lust to be sinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. v. 7.</note> except the law had said, Thou
shalt not lust. But he could neuer be ignorant, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
with consent was sinne; seeing the verie hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
men did know, and confesse the same. Againe, that
actuall concupiscence which our Rhemists speake of,<note place="margin">Matt. 5. v. 22.</note> is
forbidden in the sixt, seuenth, and eight commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
as Christ himselfe expondeth them. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
the tenth commandement forbiddeth, the very
habituall and sensuall desire, or inclination to sinne, and
the euill fruits thereof; that is, wicked, vicious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious
thoughts, though wee resist and striue against
them. This is the expresse doctrine of Saint <hi>Austen</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
place,<note place="margin">August. de nupt. &amp; concup. lib. 1. cap. 27.</note> which he deliuereth in these words; <hi>Agite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
aliquid concupiscentia carnis, &amp; quando non exhibetur ei vel cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis
assensus, vbi regnet, vel membra velut arma, quibus impleatur
quod iubet: agit autem quid, nisi ipsa desideria mala &amp; turpia?
Non enim si bona &amp; licita essent, eis obedire prohiberet apostolus.</hi>
For concupiscence of the flesh worketh something, euen
when there is not giuen vnto it, either the consent of the
heart,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. v. 12.</note> where it may reigne; or the members as weapons,
which may accomplish what it appointeth. And what
doth it, but the very wicked and filthy desires? For if
they were good and lawfull, the apostle would not forbid
to obey them.</p>
               <p>Marke these wordes gentle reader; for they fortifie
that which is already said, and giue a deadly blow to the
papists: two things are cleered by this testimony of Saint
<hi>Austen,</hi> the one, that concupiscence to which consent is
not giuen, bringeth foorth ill desires: the other, that the
said desires are vnlawfull, and prohibited by the law of
God. And so we haue it euidently prooued, by many
inuinsible reasons; that concupiscence habitued, to
which the regenerate yeeld no consent, but stoutly resist
the same; is so farre from being meritorious, as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
teach, that it is sinne formally, and properly so called.
Neither will it serue their turne, to obiect that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14159:33"/>
in their mouthes, that it is inuoluntarie, and can no
way be auoided, and so no sinne at all. This obiection I
grant, carrieth a maiestie with it; and it seemeth to many
men, to be insoluble. But God willing, I shall make it so
cleere and euident, as euery child may behold with facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the weakenesse, falshood, and absurditie thereof.</p>

concupiscence to bee sinne in the infants vnbaptised, as
in them that are baptised, vpon this their falsly supposed
ground. For it is as vnuoluntarie in the one, as it is in the

confound all papists, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> knoweth not in the
world what he shall answere to the same. And therefore
deceitfully he addeth in his exposition of Saint <hi>Austens</hi>
words, the word (<hi>quodammodo,</hi> after a sort;) which word
neither is in Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> nor yet agreeable to his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

nothing else, but swaruing or declining from the

meaneth, that euery sinne is an obliquitie or defect
from the rule of the law: but not contrarie, that euery
such swaruing from the law, should be properly a sinne,
as the heretikes doe vntruly gather, to proue that concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence
remaining after baptisme is a very sinne, though
we neuer giue our consent vnto it. Thus they write. Out
of whose words, I gather two notable docume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; the one,
that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is a defect and swaruing from the law,
but not properly a sinne: the other, that if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be proued
to be sinne properly, then wil it also follow of necessity by
S. <hi>Iohns</hi> doctrine, that concupiscence in the regenerate is
properly sinne. Let this doctrine be wel marked, as which
is no lesse apparant then important. Now, it only remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
for the victorie, &amp; truth of this article, That I proue
against our papists the Rhemists, that the Greeke word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth signifie sinne properly: behold the proofe.</p>
               <p>A very famous papist and great linguist,<note place="margin">Arias Montan. in 1. Ioan. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Ben. Arias

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:14159:34"/>
is <hi>transgressio legis,</hi> the transgression of the law. Now, that
the transgression of Gods law is properly sinne, none is so
sottish, that he doth not vnderstand it; none so impious,
that he will denie it; none so peeuish, that he will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it. But I proue the same.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> hath these words: <hi>Quid est enim peccatum, nisi

For what is sinne,<note place="margin">Vide Ambros. in 7. cap. ad rom. &amp; in sine huius articuli.</note> but the transgression of Gods law, and

               </p>
               <p>The same S. <hi>Austen</hi> in another place defineth sinne in
this manner.<note place="margin">Aug. cont. Faust. lib. 22. cap. 27. tom. 6. pag. 281.</note> 
                  <hi>Peccatum est dictum, vel factum, vel concupitum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid,
contra legem aternam.</hi> Sinne is a word, deed, thought, or
desire, against the eternall law (of God.) And what the
eternall law is, he sheweth in these words next following
in the same place: <hi>Lex aeterna est ratio diuina vel voluntas Dei,
ordinem naturalem conseruari iubens,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vide Bernard. de aduent. dom. serm. 6. to. 1. p. 16.</note>

law is the reason or will of God, which commaundeth
the naturall order to be obserued, and forbiddeth the
same to be perturbed.</p>
               <p>Thus writeth this auntient, graue, and learned father;
by whose iudgement it is properly sinne, whatsoeuer is
against the will of God. So then, Gods will is that law and
rule, by which euery sinne must be measured and tried.
And consequently, whatsoeuer deflecteth, declineth, or
swarueth from the will of God, the same is most properlie
sinne. The reason hereof is euident, because not to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent
and agreeable to Gods will, is the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecall

that the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now gentle reader, thou hast heard the expresse words
and plaine testimonies, as well of the auntient fathers,
S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> S. <hi>Austen,</hi> and S. <hi>Bede,</hi> as also of the two famous
popish writers, <hi>Carthusianus,</hi> and <hi>Lyranus,</hi> concerning this
great question and most important point of doctrine, in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14159:35"/>
which the very life of poperie doth consist.</p>
               <p>I haue proued first euen by the testimonie of S. <hi>Paule,</hi>
and of S. <hi>Austen,</hi> expounding his words, as also of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> graunting the same, that concupiscence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
after baptisme in the regenerate, is both called
sinne, and is properly sinne indeed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the first motions of concupiscence which
are connaturall to the corrupt man, and can no way be
auoided, are flatly forbidden by this commaundement,
<hi>Thou shalt not couet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that though the said rebellious motions be
inuoluntarie in the worke; yet are they voluntarie in the
originall: which is sufficient saith S. <hi>Austen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, that Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> not able truly to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
S. <hi>Austens</hi> words, hath in his explication added de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully,
this word (<hi>quodammodo</hi>) after a sort: VVhich word
cannot be found in S. <hi>Austen,</hi> neither is it agreeable to his
meaning. But such beggerly shifts and sillie euasions are
the props and staies of late Romish religion.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that by S. <hi>Iohns</hi> doctrine euery deflection from
the eternall law, is properly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and consequently, it is
properly sinne.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> S. <hi>Austen,</hi> and S. <hi>Bede,</hi> doe all
three affirme constantly and with vniforme assent, that
sinne is nothing els but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and a transgression of the
law of God.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, that by the flat doctrine not only of Saint
<hi>Bede,</hi> but also of two famous popish writers (whose autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
is euer most forcible against papists) <hi>Dionysius Carthus.</hi>
and <hi>Nicholaus Lyranus,</hi> iniquitie is a mortall sinne, because
it is against the eternall law, which is equitie it selfe, and
the will of God.</p>
               <p>Eightly, that our papists of Rhemes do confute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnawares, while they tell vs, that euery sinne is a
declining and swaruing from Gods law: but withal denie,
that euery such swaruing from Gods law, is properly sinne.
For, seeing Gods law is nothing els but his will, as is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14159:36"/>
proued, the papists must either confesse, that to swarue
and decline from Gods will is properly sinne; or els, that
to decline and swarue from Gods will, is consonant and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to his will: which to hold, is not onely most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
but withall implieth flat contradiction.</p>
               <p>Against this discourse of originall concupiscence in the
regenerate, nothing in truth can be alledged for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.
Yet,<note place="margin">Rhemists in 1. John 3.</note> to take away all wrangling, I will truly put
downe the vpshot of our Rhemists, and frame my answer
to the same. Thus doe they write, Though in the 5. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
verse 17. the Apostle turne the speech, affirming eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
iniquitie to be sinne; yet there the Greeke word is not
the same as before, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. By which it is plaine,
that there he meaneth by iniquitie, mans actuall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
transgression, which must needs be a sinne. These are
their words, to which I answere in this wise.</p>
               <p>First, that though the Greeke word be different, yet is
it equiualent, and so the sence all one. This to be so, S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten</hi>
will testifie with me in these words: <hi>Nemo dicat, aliud est
peccatum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August. in epist. Ioan. tract 4. tom. 9. pag. 412.</note>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> aliud iniquitas. Nemo dicat, ego peccator homo sum,
sed iniquus non sum. Omnis qui facit peccatum, &amp; iniquitatem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit.</hi>
Let no man say, sinne is one thing, and iniquitie ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing. Let no man say, I am a sinfull man, but not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous.
For euery one that committeth sinne, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
also iniquitie. Thus writeth S. <hi>Austen,</hi> and what he
saith, the same say <hi>Beda</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius.</hi> VVho as we see
here, doth plainely and expressely affirme, sinne and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
to be all one. So that whatsoeuer is sinne, must also
be iniquitie; and whatsoeuer is iniquitie, the same likewise
must be sinne. Neither is it to the purpose to iterate their
vsuall song, because, as is alreadie prooued, Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi>
telleth them in another place, that this sinne is committed
against the will of man.<note place="margin">Ambros in 7 cap. ad Roman. p. 205</note> These are his words: <hi>Numquid
quia inuitum hominem dicit peccare, immunis debet videri à crimine;
quia hoc agit quod non vult, pressus vi potestatis? Non vtique. Ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius
enim vitio &amp; desidia haec caepta sunt. Quia enim mancipauit se
per assensum peccato, iure illius dominatur.</hi> Is therefore a man
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14159:36"/>
cleere and free from sinne, because he saith man sinneth
against his will? because he doth that which he would not
doe, being pressed with the violence of power? No truly:
for these things began through his fault and negligence.
For seeing he consented to be a slaue vnto sinne, sinne by
right hath dominion ouer him. Loe, a man is guiltie of
sinne, yea euen of that sinne which he doth against his
will, and cannot auoid the same, that is, of originall concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence.
And S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> yeeldeth a reason hereof, because
this impossibilitie came of mans default. And this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
case of infants, as is alreadie said. Let the reader here
obserue seriously with me,<note place="margin">Inuoluntarie in the act, yet voluntarie in the cause.</note> that S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> calleth this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoluntarie
concupiscence, <hi>crimen,</hi> a crime or mortall sinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that S. <hi>Bede</hi> affirmeth not only all to be sinne
which is iniquitie; but also reputeth the very corruption of
innocencie, which commeth of infirmitie, to be sinne in
Gods sight. These are his expresse words: <hi>Omnes qui pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
praeuaricationis rei sunt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beda vbi supr.</note> 
                  <hi>hoc est, non solum illi qui data sibi scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae

quam in protoplasto omnes accepimus, siue infirmitate, siue negligentia
siue etiam ignorantia corrumpunt.</hi> All that sinne, are guiltie of
preuarication or transgression of the law; that is, not only
they which contemne the precepts of the written law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them, but they also, which either of infirmitie, or of
negligence, or of ignorance, corrupt the innocencie of the
law of Nature, which we all receiue in the Protoplast
(<hi>Adam.</hi>)</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in another place iumpeth with <hi>Bede</hi> in these
words:<note place="margin">Ambros. in 7 cap ad Roman. p. 203</note> 
                  <hi>Non discreuit concupiscentiam hanc à peccato, sed miscuit,

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> concupiscentiam prohibet, quae propte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea
quod oblectamento est, non putabatur esse peccatum.</hi> He hath
not discerned this concupiscence from sinne, but hath
coupled it with sinne, signifying thereby, that when there
was not so much as any suspition, that this thing was not
lawfull before God, I knew, saith he, that it is sinne. Vnder
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14159:37"/>
his own person, he pleadeth as it were the generall cause.
The law therefore forbiddeth concupiscence, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it delighteth, seemeth not to be sinne. Thus writeth
S. <hi>Ambrose;</hi> whose words cannot possibly be vnderstood of
any other concupiscence, than of that which is inuolunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and originall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that their owne vulgar Latine text, (which
the late councell of Trent preferreth before both the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
and the Greeke, and commandeth all papists to vse
it as authenticall, and none other) hath the word (<hi>iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi>)

                  </gap>. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iniquitie:
these are the expresse words; <hi>omnis iniquitas pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum
est:</hi> All iniquitie is sinne. Loe, their owne transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(to which all papists are tied as a Beare to a stake)
doth flatlie confound them all, and saith plainelie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely,
That euerie iniquitie is a sinne. And yet the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
of Rhemes bluntishly and impudently defend the
contrarie, crying out with open mouthes, That some ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
is not sinne. The truth is this, that they are driuen
to a <hi>non plus,</hi> and cannot tell in the world what to say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this doctrine of concupiscence in the regenerate.
For both <gap reason="foreign">

Iesuited brotherhood; the flat testimonie of their saint

beleeue, and approue, and may not in any case refuse or
denie the same:<note place="margin">Aquinas. 1. 2. q. 74. art. 3. 3.</note> these are his expresse words; <hi>Dicendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quod
illud quod homo facit sine deliberatione rationisnon perfectè ipse facit;
quia nihil operatur ibi id quod est principale in homine, vnde non est
perfectè actus humanus, &amp; per consequens non potest esse perfectè
actus virtutis vel peccati, sed aliquid imperfectum ingenere horum.
Vnde talis motus sensualitatis rationem perueniens, est peccatum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niale,
quod est quiddam imperfectum in genere peccati.</hi> VVe must
answere, that that which man doth without the delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of reason, he doth it not perfectly, because that which
is the chiefest in man, worketh nothing there: wherefore
it is not perfectly mans act, and consequently it cannot be
perfectly the act of vertue or of sinne, but some vnperfect
thing in this kind. VVhereupon it commeth, that such a
motion of sensualitie preuenting reason, is a veniall sinne,
which is a certaine imperfect thing in the nature of sinne.</p>
               <p>Thus writeth <hi>Aquinas,</hi> out of whose words I note these
important obseruations. First, that this <hi>Aquinas</hi> is a popish
canonized saint. Secondly, that for his great learning he
was surnamed, <hi>Doctor Angelicus,</hi> The Angelicall Doctor.
Thirdly, that Pope <hi>Vrbanus</hi> the fourth, and Pope <hi>Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
the fift, did so admire and reuerence the excellent lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this famous schoole-doctor (who was a learned
clarke indeed) that they confirmed his doctrine for au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall,
and gaue it the first place after the canonicall
Scripture. Fourthly, that this great doctor, so highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
in the Romish church, that no papist may denie
or gainesay that which he hath written, graunteeth freely,
teacheth plainely, and auoucheth constantly, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
motion of sensualitie which goeth before reason
is properly a sinne, though but a veniall sinne, as he tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
it. For it is one thing, to be a sinne perfectly, another
thing, to be a sinne properly. A veniall and little sinne is
as well and as truly a sinne, as a mortall and great sinne, as
the papists tearme them. For he is as truly and properly a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14159:38"/>
theefe that stealeth a lambe or a goose, as he that stealeth
an oxe or a horse, though not a theefe in so high degree.
For mortall and veniall sinnes (as the papists tearm them)
doe onely differ, <hi>Secundum magis &amp; minus,</hi> according to
more and lesse. But in truth, euery sinne is mortall, as I
haue alreadie proued in my booke of Motiues.<note place="margin">Add to this the sixt article, &amp; note it well</note> Answer ô

the professors of Christs Gospell, as
though they were enemies to good
workes: when in deed, they both
thinke, preach, and write, more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly,
more religiously, and more
sincerely, than the papists doe, of and concerning
godlie actions and good workes. In regard hereof,
before I come to the maine point of that, which I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to oppugne in this article: I graunt first of all, that
though good workes neither doe nor can goe before
iustification; yet they euer follow (as the fruits fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the tree) the persons that are freely iustified by
Gods mercie in Christ Iesus, for his merits and condigne
deserts.</p>
            <p>I graunt secondly, that though good workes goe not
before iustification; yet doe they so necessarilie goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saluation, that no man without them can attaine
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14159:38"/>
eternall life, when possibilitie is graunted to doe them.</p>
            <p>I graunt thirdly, that good workes are the true effects
of predestination; by which the children of God make
their saluation sure vnto themselues, and manifest vnto
the world. Yet this notwithstanding, I hold constantlie,
beleeue stedfastly, and affirme Christianlie, that albeit
good workes are the effects of predestination, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
fruits of faith and iustification; yet neither are they
the cause of predestination, nor of iustification, neither
doe they or can they merit <hi>ex condigno,</hi> eternall life or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
I say (merit <hi>ex condigno</hi>) because I willingly graunt
with the auntient writers and holie fathers, that good
workes in a godly sense may be said to merit; that is to
say, to impetrate fauour and reward at Gods hands, for
his mercie and promise sake, who hath promised not to
leaue vnrewarded,<note place="margin">Matt. 10. v. 42. lac. 1. 12.</note> so much as one cup of cold water gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in his name: but they can neuer truly be said to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
for any worthinesse or condigne desert of the works
that are done. Against which last part, I contend with
the papists at this present; and namely, against the late
decree of the late Romish Counsell of Trent,<note place="margin">Concil. Trid. sess. 6. die 13. Ian. can. 32.</note> whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

iustified man, by his good workes which he doth by the
grace of God, and merit of Christ Iesus, whose liuely
member he is, doth not truly merit the increase of grace,
eternall life, and the consequution of the same eternall
life, if he shal depart hence in grace, and also the augment

which whosoeuer will not beleeue stedfastly, must bee

that life eternall cannot be condignely atchieued, by the

to extenuate the cleerenesse of this text, and as it were

He doth not obserue the same order of opposites.
For he saith not, eternall life is the reward of your good
workes; but, eternall life is the gift of God: that he might
shew, that they are not deliuered by their owne strength
or vertues; and that it is not a debt, or a wages, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution

things freely of the gift of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Origen</hi> writeth thus,<note place="margin">Origen. in cap. 6. ad Rom.</note> vpon the same wordes; <hi>Deum verò

By these manifold testimonies of the holy fathers, the
doctrine which I defend, is cleere and euident; <hi>viz.</hi> that
eternall life is the free gift of God, and is not merited or
purchased by desert of man; that eternall life is not a
due debt, a deserued wages, or retribution of mans la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
but proceedeth wholy and solie of the free mercy
and grace of God; that mans workes waighed in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
with the ioyes of heauen, are nothing at all answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
vnto them. To which fathers, I will add the verdict
of <hi>Paulus Burgensis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paulus Burgen. addit. 2 in 6. ca. ad Rom.</note> a verie famous popish Spanish Bishop.
These are his wordes: <hi>Noluit ergo dicere, stipendium iustitiae
vita aeterna: sed maluit dicere, gratia Dei vita aeterna: quia eadem
merita quibus redditur, non a nobis sunt, sed in nobis à Deo facta
sunt per gratiam.</hi> He would not therefore say, eternall life
is the stipend of iustice: but he had rather say, eternall
life is the grace of God: because the same merits to which
it is rendered, are not of our selues, but wrought in our
selues by God through grace.</p>
               <p>The second text of holy scripture, is contained in these
wordes:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. v. 18.</note> I count that the afflictions of this present time,
are not worthy of the future glory which shall be reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

and penalties, that we are able to endure in this
life, are so farre from being meritorious of eternall life,
that they are in no wise comparable to the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theoderetus</hi> doth liuely expresse this verietie, in these
most golden wordes:<note place="margin">Theodor. in cap. 8. ad Rom.</note> 
                  <hi>Superant certamina coronae, non compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur

magnum lucrum speratur. Et propterea non mercedem, sed gloriam

remaine, the labours are not comparable to the rewards:
for the labour is small, but the gaine hoped for, is great.
And therefore the things expected, are not called a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

If one should suffer all kindes of torment, which can bee

vaile is taken out of the way, shalbe reuealed in vs. Marke
well these wordes in this famous popish writer, because
they are most important: for, seeing he was a great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,
his proofe must needes be good against the papists.
Againe, his words are so cleere and manifest, that no eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

tearmes; that all which is possible to be done or endured
in this world, can not be a worthy or condigne merite of
eternall life. No answere in truth, can be made hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,

               </p>
               <p>The third place of holy scripture,<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 5.</note> is contained in
these words: Not by the works of iustice which we haue
done, but according to his mercie he hath saued vs, by
the lauer of regeneration and renouation of the holy
Ghost. These are the Apostles words, euen as our Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
haue alledged them. By which words it is most
cleere and apparant, that we are not onely iustified, but
also saued of meere mercie and the free gift of God. And
consequently, that eternall life hath no merite on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of man. For after saluation once accomplished, all
merite is vaine and needlesse.</p>
               <p>

of the works of righteousnesse which we haue done; that
is, not for our merites which were none at all, because we
were subiect to the afore named sinnes: but according to
his mercie hath he saued vs, from the power of the deuill
and guilt of eternall torment, by the merit of his holy
conuersation and passion. Loe, our saluation commeth

iustice is now of faith, there is no perfect iustice but in the
angels, and scarce in the angels, if they be compared to
God. Yet if there be any perfect iustice of soules and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirits

which God hath created in the holy Angels, iust,
good, by no lapse auerted, by no pride falling, but euer
abiding in the contemplation of the word of God, and
thinking nothing sweet, but him onely which created
them: in them iustice is perfect, but in vs (it is not perfect)
it is onely begun of faith according to the spirit. Thus
saith Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> telling vs very plainely, that there is
no perfect iustice in man: but doubtlesse, where no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
iustice is, there can be no condigne merite of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

               <p>Now, to knit vp this reason with all consents in one, I
will here set downe the flat and plaine report of a famous

to Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift:<note place="margin">Iosephus Angles in 2. lib. s. pag. 103.</note> 
                  <hi>Post humillim am sanctorum pedum

gratiae dei fiunt aeternae vitae digna, &amp; illi aequalia; quae seclusa
illa dei promissione, quae passim in sacris literis reperitur, fuissent tanto
premio prorsus indigna.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Loe, this Frier granteth, that all the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</note> All other holy doctors also, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
after the same manner the naturall value onely of
good workes, and perceiuing that it is exceeding farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the value and iust estimation of eternall life,
said wisely, That our works are not meritorious nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of eternall life. Yet for the couenant and promise
made vnto vs, the good workes of man with the helpe of
Gods grace, are worthy of eternall life, and equall with it;
which for all that, that promise of God which is frequent
in the Scripture, set aside, were altogether vnworthie of
so great reward.</p>
               <p>Thus saith our popish bishop, our holy Frier, euen to
the Pope himselfe, after the humble kissing of his most
holy feet. VVho though he bestirre himselfe more than a
little, to establish the condigne merite of mans workes,
yet doth he in his owne kind of dispute and reasoning; vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
confute and confound himselfe. For first, he graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14159:43"/>
that not onely S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> but all the rest of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fathers with him (marke well, gentle reader) affirme
constantly and vniformely with one voice and assent (a
testimonie almost incredible to proceed from the mouth
of a papist, so deere to the Pope) That good workes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are meritorious nor worthie of eternall life. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he graunteth freely, that the best workes considered in
their owne nature and kind, are vnworthy of eternall life.
Thirdly, he graunteth willingly, and telleth the Pope
roundly (<hi>post deosculationem pedum,</hi> but after the kissing of
his feet) that good workes, euen as they proceed of grace
and assistance of the holyghost,<note place="margin">The papists grant as much as we desire.</note> are for all that altogether
vnworthie of eternall life, if Gods promise and free accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
be set apart. VVhich three points doubtlesse, are
all that we desire to be graunted, concerning the doctrine
of good workes. And consequently, though the papists
neuer cease to impeach, accuse, slaunder, and condemne
vs in this behalfe: yet doe we defend nothing herein (as
is euident to the indifferent reader) but euen that which
their owne best doctors in their printed bookes doe teach
vs; yea, in those very bookes which are dedicate to the
Pope himselfe, and that with the solemne and religious
deosculation of his holy feet. The conceits which bishop
Frier <hi>Ioseph</hi> alledgeth, to make good his imagined condign
merite of workes, are very childish and too too friuolous.
For first, where he saith, that the fathers speake of good
workes, onely in respect of their naturall value, as he tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
it; I answere, that that silly glosse is onely inuented
by him and his fellowes, to saue the life of their beggerly
doctrine, if it would be. For no such thing can be found in
any one of all their bookes. Nay, our Frier bishop confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
himselfe vnawares (of such force is the truth) when he
graunteth, that good workes done in grace are vtterly
vnworthie of heauen, if Gods promise bee set apart.
Where I wish the reader to obserue seriously the word
(<hi>prorsus,</hi> vtterly) which is indeed his owne, and most em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticall

               <p>The same <hi>Bernard</hi> in another place hath these expresse<note place="margin">Bernard. in eam. serm. 67. p. 1003 tom. 1.</note> words: <hi>Deest gratiae, quicquid meritis deput.</hi> 13. <hi>Nolo meritum, quod

It derogateth from grace, whatsoeuer thou ascribest
to merite. I will haue no merite that excludeth grace.
I abhorre whatsoeuer is of mine owne, that I may be mine
owne, vnlesse perchance that is more mine owne which
maketh me mine owne. Grace iustifieth me to my selfe
freely, and so deliuereth me from the bondage of sinne.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Bernard</hi> in another place hath these expresse
words:<note place="margin">Bernard. in cant. set. 68. p. 1006.</note> 
                  <hi>Sic non est, quod iam quaeras quibus meritis speremus bona,
presertim cum audias apud prophetam; non propter vos, sed propterme
ego faciam, dicit dominus. Sufficit admeritum, scire quod non suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciant
merita. Sed vt ad meritum satis est, demeritis non presumere;
sic carere meritis, satis ad iudicium est.</hi> So there is no cause,
that thou shouldest now aske by what merits we hope for
glorie, especially, since thou hearest the prophet say, I
will doe it, saith the Lord, not for your sake, but for mine
owne. It is sufficient to merite, to know that our merites
are not sufficient. But as it is ynough to merite, not to
presume of merites, so to want merites, is ynough to
iudgement.</p>
               <p>Out of the most excellent testimonies of this famous
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14159:44"/>
papist, I note many worthie lessons for the benefit of the
reader. First, that nothing which man can doe or suffer in
this life, is worthie of the ioies of heauen. Secondly, that
heauen is not due to any man for his owne deserts. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that God should doe no man wrong, no, not the best
liuer on earth, if he should debarre him from the ioyes of
heauen. Fourthly, that whatsoeuer is ascribed to mans
merite, the same is derogatorie to Gods grace. Fiftly,
that <hi>Bernard</hi> renounceth all merit, which excludeth grace,
that is to say, all merit of mans workes whatsoeuer: for so
himselfe expoundeth himselfe. Sixtly, that he abhorreth
whatsoeuer is his owne, and so he denieth any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
himselfe to be meritorious, or worthie of eternall life.
Seuenthly, that the most sufficient merit in man, is this,
<hi>viz.</hi> to know and confesse, that our merits are no merits
indeed. Eightly, that to want merits, is ynough for mans
condemnation. VVhich last obseruation doth fitly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
that which I vttered in the beginning of this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
to wit, that the word (merit) in that sence in which the
fathers vse it, is not to be reiected, though in these our
daies it commonly be abused. For to want merits in their
sence (as <hi>Bernard</hi> here declareth euidently) is to haue no
good workes: which good works I affirme willingly, both
with the old and late writers of best account, to be so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
to attaine eternall life, as the vsuall, ordinarie, and
vndoubted means, by which God decreed from eternitie
freely for his owne name sake, to bring his chosen and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to saluation; that without the same, none haue beene,
are, or shall be saued world without end; if, as I said in the
beginning, time be graunted to doe them.</p>

that between God and man there is exceeding great
inequalitie, as which doe differ in infinit; all the good that
man hath, is of God. VVherefore mans iustice receiued
of God, cannot be according to absolute equalitie, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a certaine proportion, to wit, in as much as either wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
according to his condition. Now, man hath the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and condition of his vertue from God; and therefore
mans merit cannot be with God, saue onely according to
the supposall of Gods holy ordinance; so forsooth, that
man may attaine that at Gods hand by his working, as a

and power of working.</hi>

<hi>Aquinas</hi> telleth vs (marke well, for this is a weightie point)
that where there is not perfect equalitie, there can be no
merit properly. Secondly, he graunteth freely, that there
is infinit inequalitie betweene God and man, as euery
child knoweth to be true. Thirdly, he freely confesseth,
that mans iustice is not absolute, but imperfect. Fourthly,
he graunteth willingly, that man doth merit nothing in
Gods sight, saue onely by way of his free acceptation.
Fiftly, he confesseth in like manner, that eternall life is not
properly hire, but as it were hire, <hi>quasi mercedem;</hi> and that,

Et ideo propter tale meritum, cum sit homini simpliciter impossibile,
non est necesse in nobis ponere gratiam, vel charitatem habitualem.</hi>
Such condigne merit is found among men, but is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and man. VVhich hereby is cleere, because
that which is rendered rather of the liberalitie of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
than of debt due to the worke, falleth not vnder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne
merit, properly so called. If any say, that though
God become not our debtor by reason of our worke, yet
is he made our debtor by reason of his promise, which the
Scripture expresseth: that answere is of no force for two
respects. First, because Gods promise in the Scriptures
doth not sound to any bond, but insinuateth the meere
disposition of Gods liberalitie. Secondly, because that
which is giuen, is not giuen for the debt arising of the
worke, but of promise that went before; not that it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
for the condigne merit of the worke, but onely or
principally for his promise sake. And so there is not that
debt of which we speake. So then it is cleere, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne
merit, properly so called, <hi>viz.</hi> for a voluntarie acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for which reward is due of iustice to the worker, so that
if it be not rendered, he to whom it appertaineth to giue
it, doth vniustly, and is simply and properly vniust, is not
betweene God and man. And therefore for such a merit,
seeing it is simply impossible to man, there is no need to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14159:45"/>
put in vs grace or charitie habituall. Thus saith M. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand;</hi>
out of whose words I note first, that condigne merit
cannot be betweene God and man. Secondly, that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life is giuen of Gods free liberalitie, not of any dutie
due to the works that we doe. Thirdly, that God rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs principally for his promise sake, and not for any
thing we either haue done or can doe. Fourthly, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne
merit is so farre aboue mans capacitie, that no man
can by any possibilitie haue it. And consequently, that
late popish doctrine is impossible.</p>

and price proceedeth whollie from the debtour, without
either preuenting or interuenting grace of the creditour;
so as the voluntarie reddition be of that which is equiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and not otherwise due. This is true doctrine which
our frier <hi>Soto</hi> deliuereth to the world: hee teacheth vs
foure things. First, that the satisfaction must proceed
wholie from the debtour. Secondly, that there must be
no preuenting nor interuenting grace of the creditour.
Thirdly, that there must be equiualent restitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that that equiualent reddition must be a worke, which
is otherwise not due. These foure conditions (which our
popish M. <hi>Soto</hi> and <hi>Dominican</hi> frier requireth in euery satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction)
when any papist can find in any one of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14159:46"/>
or satisfactions, I will be their bondman, neither shall
the popes holines be excepted. But to come to this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
vpon this couenant, I am in no feare at all: For the
ethnicke philosopher <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aristo. in 8. ethic. cap. 7.</note> perceiued by the naturall
discourse of right reason, That no man can euer make co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne
compensation to God and his naturall parents.
For which respect,<note place="margin">Aquinas, 12. q. 114. ar. 1. 3. m.</note> 
                  <hi>Aquinas</hi> affirmeth constantly, that God
is not simply and truely said to be debtor to vs, but to
himselfe and to his owne promise, which he freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all our deserts made vnto vs. And their great schoole-doctour
<hi>Iosephus Angles,</hi> after he hath disputed this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of condigne merit too and fro, <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> doth in the
end though vnawares,<note place="margin">Iosephus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, in 2. sent. pag. 107.</note> plainely confesse the selfe same
doctrine, that I now intend to prooue. He telleth vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
that the price of euery thing may be equall to the
value and worth of the same thing, two wayes; first, of
the nature of the thing; secondly, of the pact, couenant
and promise of him that doth promise the same thing:
for saith he, if one penny be the full value answereable to
the labour; yet if a greater reward be promised, which
farre exceedeth the worth &amp; value of the work wrought,
then that reward is also due by couenant. He addeth the
reason thereof; <hi>viz.</hi> because the law of nature teacheth
to keepe promises which farre exceed the value of the
thing. And hereupon this great learned doctour conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
roundly, that though our good workes come farre
short of eternall life, if we respect the worthinesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
yet doe they condignely merit the ioyes of heauen, if
we respect the free promise of Christ Iesus. And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie
of workes, our frier bishop, or bishopfrier, (as you
will) calleth <hi>aequalitas ex promissione tantum,</hi> equalitie of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
onely. Now, I pray thee gentle reader, what childish
wit is not able to penetrat the very bowels of this deepe
diuinitie? and yet is it the maine point and onely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
to which all papists doe and must appeale, in this
weighty and most important question. For example sake,
if thou wouldest wish me to lend thee my cloake, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14159:46"/>
thee from a showre of raine, and promise to giue me
an hundred pounds for the loane; then doubtlesse were it
true to say, that after such loane an hundreth pounds
were due vnto me: yet withall would it be most true also,
that such loane of my cloake were not the condigne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of that hundreth pounds; but that it proceeded prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
of the free gift and promise made vnto me, farre
aboue my merit and desert: neither could my act be any
way rightly tearmed, the condigne merit of that reward.
And yet it is euident, that thus standeth the state of the
question, betweene the condigne merit of mans workes,
and the excellencie of the ioyes of heauen. For I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
graunt, that eternall life is due to the workes of Gods
elect, and that it is as well the crowne of iustice, as of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
but withall I constantly affirme,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. v. 8.</note> that God bestoweth
it on his elect freely for his owne name sake,<note place="margin">Iac. 1. v. 12.</note> and not for
any merit,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. v. 18.</note> worthinesse, or condignitie of their workes.</p>
               <p>For this cause,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. v. 23.</note> their owne deere frier <hi>Ioannes de Combis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 103. v. 4.</note>
teacheth this golden lesson:<note place="margin">Ps. 145. v. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Meritum condigni dicit aequalita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
meriti ad remunerationem:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iac. 2. v. 83.</note> 
                  <hi>dico autem aequalitatem, non arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticam,
sed geometrieam:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joan. de Combis lib. 5. theolog. verit. cap. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>id est, non quantitatis, sed proportionis.
Et hoc patet, quia Deus semper remunerat supra meritum, sicut punit
citra condignum.</hi> Condigne merit doth connotat the
equalitie of merit, to the thing that is merited; I say equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
not arithmeticall, but geometricall, that is, not of
quantitie, but of proportion: And this is euident, because
God euer rewardeth aboue our merits, as he punisheth
lesse than we deserue. Out of these wordes we see two
things cleered: the one, that we deserue greater punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for our sinnes, than God inflicteth vpon vs for the
same: the other, that for our well doing we receiue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reward,
than our workes doe or can deserue. And
consequently, that wee doe not condignely merit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life.</p>
               <p>For this cause saith their famous popish doctour, <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus
de Lyra,</hi> in this maner: <hi>Salus enim aeterna,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lyra in 3. ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>excedit totaliter
facultatem naturae humanae. Propter quod non potest eam attingere,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14159:47"/>
nisi ex largitate diuinae misericordiae.</hi> For eternall life doth farre
surmount and wholly exceed the facultie and power of
mans nature. VVherefore man can no way attaine vnto
it,<note place="margin">Carthus. in 6. cap. ad Rom.</note> but onely by the liberalitie of Gods mercy.</p>
               <p>For this cause saith another popish doctor, <hi>Dionysius
Carthusianuns,</hi> in this maner: <hi>Ex gratia seu per gratiam Dei, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
iustis pro praemio vita aeterna. Non hoc dicitur merita exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo,
sed vt insinuctur, quod principaliter ascribendum sit gratia
Dei, qui etiam premiat vltra condignum.</hi> Eternall life is giuen
for reward to the iust, of grace or through the grace of
God. This is not said to exclude merits, but to insinuate,
that reward must principally bee ascribed to the grace of
God, who rewardeth vs aboue our deserts. Loe, this
great papist laboreth with maine and might, to stablish
popish condigne merit of workes: who affirming more
boldly than wisely, that the elect doe merit eternall life;
telleth vs with one breath, that the reward is aboue our
merits and deserts. And so vnwittingly and vnwillingly
he confuteth himselfe, and refelleth that doctrine, which
he gladly would confirme.</p>
               <p>To conclude, our Iesuit and renowned Cardinall,
frier <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who after mature deliberation and graue
consultation had with all the best learned Iesuits in the
world, and with the Pope himselfe (whose faith iudiciall
cannot faile, say they) saith all that possibly can be said
for the life of poperie, doth with great grauitie and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
sagacitie in the name of all papists, deliuer this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
vnto vs;<note place="margin">Bellarm. de iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. tom. 3. col. 1296. &amp; col. 1298.</note> 
                  <hi>Quod vero attinet ad rem ipsam, Durandi senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
si nihil aliud vellet, nisi merita nostra non esse ex condigno, siue
ex iustitia absolutè, sed tantum ex hypothesi, id est, posita liberali
Dei promissione, non esset reprobanda, sequitur; respondeo, absolutè
non posse hominem á Deo aliquid exigere, cum omnia sint ipsius; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
posita eius voluntate &amp; pacto, quo non vult exigere à nobis
opera nostra gratis, sed mercedem reddere iuxta proportionem operum,
verè possumus ab eo mercedem exigere; quomodo seruus non potest
absolutè a domino suo vllum premium postulare, cum omnia quae
seruus acquirit, domino suo acquirat; tamen si domino placeat do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14159:47"/>
illi opera sua, &amp; pro ijsdem tanquam sibi non debitis mercedem
promittere, iure mercedem pro suis operibus postulabit.</hi> Touching
the matter it selfe, <hi>Durands</hi> opinion, if he had no other
meaning, but that our merits are not absolutely iust and
condigne, but hypothetically in respect of Gods liberall
promise, were not to be reiected: I answere, that man
cannot absolutely exact any thing of God, seeing all
things are Gods owne; neuerthelesse, his will and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
being made, that he will not exact our workes of vs
freely, but will reward them according to their proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
we may truly require hyer of him, like as a bondman
cannot absolutelie require any reward of his lord, seeing
euery thing which the bondman gaineth, is gotten and
gained to his master: yet for all that, if it shall please his
master and lord to bestow his works on him, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
reward for the same, as if they were not due vnto
him, then may the bondseruant iustly demaund reward
for his workes.</p>
               <p>Thus saith the Iesuit <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> and consequently,
this is all that all papists say, or can say, for the life of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
doctrine. Out of whose wordes I note first, that his
brother <hi>Durands</hi> opinion hath put him to his best trumpe.
Secondly, that <hi>Durands</hi> opinion (as is already prooued)
is this; <hi>viz.</hi> that the merit of workes in the best liuer vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth, cannot truly and properly be called <hi>meritum ex
condigno,</hi> condigne merit; but onely merit in way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
and in respect of Gods free mercy, and promise
made vnto man without all deserts. Thirdly, that <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
graunteth this opinion in this sense: For hee saith
plainely, If <hi>Durand</hi> admit merit in respect of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
his opinion cannot be reproued. Fourthly, that our
Iesuit maketh good that doctrine, which I here defend,
as which is the selfe same, that <hi>Durand</hi> holdes. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequenly,
if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his popish fellowes and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
would stand constantly to their owne doctrine, which
they publish in printed bookes; wee and they should
soone agree, and these great controuersies would haue
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14159:48"/>
an end. Fourthly, that man cannot absolutely exact any
thing at Gods hands, because all things are Gods owne.
Fiftly, that in respect of Gods good pleasure and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
frely made to man, we may truely require reward
of God. Yea, my selfe graunt, that we may not onely tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but also iustly require reward at Gods hands, in regard
of his promise freely made vnto vs. But I euer denie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
that any reward is due to our best workes; for any
condigne merit or desert of or in our workes, Gods free
acceptation, mercie, and promise set apart. For as Saint
<hi>Austen</hi> grauely saith;<note place="margin">Aug. lib. 9. confess. cap. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Vae etiam laudabili vitae hominum, si re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mota

vpon earth, if thou examine his life, thy mercy set apart.
Answere ô papists, if ye can; and if ye cannot, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and yeeld vnto the truth for shame. I challenge
you, I prouoke you to the combat; I adiure you all
ioyntlie, and euery one of you seuerally, for the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
of your cause, for the honour of your Pope, and the
life of popish doctrine, which now lieth bleeding,
and wil shortly yeeld vp the Ghost, if some
soueraigne remedie bee not
speedily prouided for
the same.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough it be true, that all sinnes
are not equall, but one greater
than another: and although it be
also true, that in a good and godly
sence, some sinne may be tearmed
mortall, and some veniall; which
yet may more fitly be called, sinnes
regnant, and not regnant: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
most true it is, to the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
confusion of all impenitent papists, that euery sinne
is mortall of it owne nature, and onely veniall by way of
Gods free acceptation and mercie, for his owne name
sake, and merits of his deare sonne our Lord Iesus.</p>
            <p>I prooue it first both briefely and euidently. For Christ
himselfe telleth vs in his holy Gospell,<note place="margin">Matth. 12. v. 3.</note> that we must giue
a straight account of euery idle word in the generall day
of iudgement. And for no other end doubtlesse must this
account be made, but onely, because euery idle word is
flatly against the law of God. This the papists can neuer
denie, it is euident to euery child. And yet must they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
confesse, that idle words be those sinnes which they
call venials. And consequently, they must confesse against
their wils, and against their professed Romish doctrine,
that all sinnes are mortall, that is to say, against the law
of God.</p>
            <p>This doctrine of our Sauiour Christ Iesus is confirmed
by the testimonie of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> his beloued Apostle,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. v. 4.</note> where he
telleth vs, that euery sinne is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, the transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14159:49"/>
of Gods law, as is alreadie prooued at large in the
fourth article of concupiscence. And the Hebrew word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifieth a declining from the right way,
doth plainely confirme the same.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because our popish Rhemists confesse in
plaine tearms,<note place="margin">Rhemists in 1. Joh. 3. v. 4.</note> that euery sinne is a swaruing from the law
of God. For doubtlesse, that which swarueth from the
law, is truly said to be against the law, but not agreeable
to the law.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, because the famous popish Frier and Romish
bishop <hi>Iosephus Angles</hi> teacheth the same doctrine in his
booke dedicated to the Pope himselfe. These are his own
expresse words:<note place="margin">Iosephus Angles in 4. sent. p. 215.</note> 
               <hi>Omne peccatum veniale est alicuius legis trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressio.
Patet, quia omne veniale est contra rectam rationem, &amp; agere

non esse à regula rectae rationis deuiandum.</hi> Euery sinne veniall
is the transgression of some law. This is cleere, because
euery veniall sinne is against right reason; and to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
right reason, is to doe against the law of nature,
which commaundeth vs not to depart or swarue from the
rule of right reason. Loe, euery veniall sinne is against
right reason, and against the law of nature, which is giuen
to euery one in his creation, in his birth or natiuitie.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, because <hi>Durandus,</hi> another famous papist,
confuteth the late receiued popish opinion of <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,</hi>
which the Pope and his Iesuits hold, to wit, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
sinnes are <hi>preter legem, non contra:</hi> Besides the law, but
not against the law.<note place="margin">Duran. in 2. sent. di<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

answere must be made, that euery sinne is against the law
of God, either naturall, or inspired, or deriued from them.
And this opinion of M. <hi>Durand,</hi> is this day commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
in the popish vniuersities and schooles. So saith
Frier <hi>Ioseph,</hi> these are his words:<note place="margin">Jos. Angl. in 2. s. pag. 275.</note> 
               <hi>D. Thomas &amp; eius sectatores
tenent, peccatum veniale non tam esse contra legem, quam preter le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem.
Sequitur; Durandus tamen &amp; alij permulti hanc sententiam
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14159:49"/>
impugnant, affirmantes peccata venialia esse contra mandata. Et
haec opinio modo in scbolis videtur communior.</hi> S. <hi>Thomas</hi> and his
followers hold, that a veniall sinne is not so much against
the law, as besides the law. But <hi>Durand</hi> and many others
impugne this opinion, auouching veniall sinnes to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the commaundements. And this opinion seemeth
now adaies to be more common in the schooles.</p>
            <p>Here I wish the reader to note by the way, out of the
word (<hi>modo,</hi> now adaies) the mutabilitie of Romish religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For in that he saith (<hi>modo,</hi> now adaies) he giueth vs to
vnderstand, that their doctrine is now otherwise than it
was of old and in former ages. A note worthie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.
For the old Romane religion was catholicke,
pure, and sound, and with it doe not I contend: but I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
late Romish faith and doctrine, which the Pope
and his Romish Schoole-men haue brought into the
Church.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, because their canonized martyr <hi>Iohn Fisher,</hi> the
late bishop of Rochester, teacheth the same doctrine so
plainely, as euery child must needs perceiue the truth in
that behalfe.<note place="margin">Roffensis art. 32. a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u. Luth.</note> These are his expresse words: <hi>Quod peccatum
veniale solum ex dei misericordia veniale sit, in hoc tecum sentio.</hi>
That a veniall sinne is onely veniall through the mercie
of God (and not of it owne nature) therein doe I agree
vnto you. Thus saith our bishop. And as he telleth me,
that he agreeth with <hi>Luther</hi> therein: so doe I tell our Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,
that I agree with him, with <hi>Durand, Almaine,</hi> and the
other papists, that teach the same doctrine.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, because <hi>Gerson,</hi> another famous popish writer,
holdeth the same opinion. These are his expresse words:
<hi>Nulla offensa dei est venialis de se,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jo. Gers. de vita spiritual. lect. 1. part. 3. in 1. corol.</note> 
               <hi>nisi tantum modo per respectum
ad diuinam misericordiam, qui non vult de facto quamlibet offensam
imputare ad mortem, cum illud posset iustissimè. Et ita concluditur,
quod peccatum mortale &amp; veniale in esse tali, non distinguuntur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecè
&amp; essentialiter, sed solum per respectum ad diuinam grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
quae peccatum istud imputat ad poenam mortis, &amp; aliud non.</hi> No
offence of God is veniall of it owne nature, but onely in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14159:50"/>
respect of Gods mercie, who will not <hi>de facto imputa,</hi> euery
offence to death, though he might doe it most iustly. And
so I conclude, that mortall and veniall sinnes, as they be
such, are not distinguished intrinse cally and essentially,
but onely in respect of Gods grace, which assigneth one
sinne to the paine or torture of death, and not another.</p>
            <p>Thus writeth this famous popish bishop, who was a
man of high esteeme in the counsell of <hi>Constance.</hi> Whose
onely testimonie (if his words be well marked) is able to
confound the papists, and to strike them dead. For first
he telleth them plainely, that euery sinne is mortall of it
owne nature. Secondly, that no sinne is veniall, saue only
in respect of Gods mercie. Thirdly, that God may most
iustly (<hi>iustissimè</hi>) condeme vs for the least sinne we do. Note
seriously, gentle reader, the word (<hi>iustissimè.</hi>) Fourthly,
that mortall and veniall sinnes are the same intrinse cally
and essentially, and differ but accidentally, that is to say,
they differ in accident, but not in nature; in quantitie, but
not in qualitie; in mercy, but not in deformitie; in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
but not in the obiect; in imputation, but not in enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie;
saue onely, that the one is a greater mortall sinne
than is the other. For (as <hi>Gerson</hi> auoucheth) we may iustly
be damned for the least sinne of all, howsoeuer other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
doe flatter themselues in their cursed deformed

            <p>Seuenthly, because sinne in generall is the transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods law, as S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> defineth it, yea, euery word,
deed, or desire against Gods law, as S. <hi>Austen</hi> describeth it,
Their words are set downe in the fourth article of this
discourse.</p>
            <p>Eightly, because the Iesuit <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vnawares confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the same against himselfe. These are his owne words:

               <hi>omne peccatum esse contra legem dei, non positiuam, sed
aternam, vt Aug. rectè docet. Omnis enim iusta lex, siue à deo, siue
ab bomine detur, ab aterna dei lege deriuatur. Est enim aterna lex,
vt malum sit viol are regulam.</hi> I answere, that euery sinne is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the law of God, not positiue, but eternall, as <hi>Austen</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:14159:50"/>
teacheth rightly. For euery iust law, whether it be given
of God, or of man, is deriued from the eternal law of God.
For the eternall law is, that it is euill to offend against the
rule. These are our Iesuits owne words, which (as euery
child can easily discerne) doe euidently confute himselfe
and his Romish doctrine. For first, vnder euery sinne must
needs be contained their veniall sinnes, or els some sinnes
shall be no sinnes; which implieth flat contradiction. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he tel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth vs, that euery sinne, and consequently
veniall sinnes are against the eternall law of God. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he graunteth, that they are not onely besides the law,
<hi>sed contra legem,</hi> but euen against the law. Fourthly, hence it
is cleere and euident, that the law eternall is the chiefe
and principall law of all other laws, seeing from it all other
lawes are deriued.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, because the papists cannot possibly yeeld any
sound reason, why in the sinnes of theft one shall be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
and another veniall. For example sake, let vs suppose
one at one time to steale so many egs as will make a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
sinne by Romish doctrine; another at another time to
steale so many as will make a venial sinne by the same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
then I demaund of our papists, Why God cannot
iustly condemne the theefe to hell that stealeth but so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
egs; and for all that can iustly condemne him to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
torment, that stealeth but one only egge aboue the
said number. For this must they doe, and a good reason
here of must they yeeld (which I am well assured they can
neuer do) or els confesse euery sinne to be mortall, and so
against their wils to subscribe to mine opinion. Answere
ô papists if ye can; if ye cannot then repent
for shame, and yeeld vnto
the truth.</p>

                  <p>By these manifold texts we may see euidently, that
the holy scriptures are most perfect, and that nothing
may bee taken from them, neither any thing added to
them. But doubtlesse, if all doctrine necessarie for mans

necessitie, many things should be added to them. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
(the mouth of all papists) answereth to these and the
like places, that they are not spoken of the written word
precisely,<note place="margin">Bellarm. tom. 1. col. 183. A. B.</note> but of Gods word generally, which is partly
written, and partly vnwritten. <hi>Non ait, inquit ille, ad verbum
quod scripsi, sed quod ego precipio.</hi> He saith not, (quoth our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite)
to the word which I haue written, but which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
But doublesse, this is a miserable shift, and a very
childish answere. For first, God himselfe wrote his owne
wordes in two tables of stone,<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 22.</note> and then deliuered them
to <hi>Moses.</hi> Yea, after <hi>Moses</hi> had broken the said tables, in
his vehement zeale against Idolatrie;<note place="margin">Deut. 9. 17.</note> God commanded
<hi>Moses</hi> to hew two other tables of stone like to the first, in
which he writ againe the wordes that were in the first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,<note place="margin">Deut. 10. v. 1. 4.</note>
and commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to put them vp in an arke of
wood.<note place="margin">Deut. 1. 5.</note> Secondly, <hi>Moses</hi> expounded the law of God to the
Israelites at large. VVhich large explication of the law,
God himselfe commanded him to write,<note place="margin">Deut. 31. v. 19. 24.</note> and to giue the
same to the Israelites; that they might put it in the side
of the arke of the couenant, and there keepe it for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
against them. Thirdly, God commanded <hi>Iosue</hi> to
keepe and obserue all things, which were written in the

                  <p>These words of our Iesuiticall Cardinall (if they be

our saluation, deliuering the Gospell by word of mouth.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14159:57"/>
Fourthly, that afterward they committed the same to
writing. Fiftly, that the Scripture was written by Gods
owne appointment. Sixtly, that it was written for this
end and purpose, That it might be the pillar and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our faith. Seuenthly, that we may not speake or
thinke any thing of God, which we find not written in
Gods booke. Eightly, that the holy Scripture is perfect,
and containeth all things necessarie for vs to know.
Ninthly, that all such as teach or beleeue any doctrine
not contained in the Scriptures, must drinke of the cup
of eternall woe for their paines. Let vs proceed and see,
what other fathers of later times tell vs.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (who liued about 249 yeares after Christ,<note place="margin">Cyprian ep 74. ad Pompeium. cont. epist. Steph. col. 229.</note>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> aboue 1300 yeares agoe) hath these words: <hi>Vnde ista
traditio? Vtrumne de dominica &amp; euangelica authoritate descendens,
an de Apostolorum mandatis &amp; epistolis veniens? Ea enim facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da
esse quae scripta sunt, deus testatur, &amp; proponit ad Iesum Nave
dicens; Non recedet liber legis huius ex ore tuo, sed meditaberis in eo
die ac nocte, vt obserues facere omnia quae scripta sunt in eo. Si ergo
aut euangelio precipitur, aut in Apostolorum epistolis, aut astibus
continetur, obseruetur diuina haec &amp; sancta traditio.</hi> From whence
came this tradition? Did it descend from the authoritie
of our Lord, or his Gospell? Or came it from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
of the Apostles, or their epistles? For, that those
things must be done which are written, God himselfe doth
witnesse, and propose to Iesus Naue, saying: The booke of
this law shall not depart from thy mouth, but thou shalt
meditate therein night and day, that thou maiest obserue
to doe all things which are written in it. If therefore it
be either commaunded in the Gospell, or be contained in
the Epistles, or in the Acts of the Apostles, let this diuine
and holy tradition be obserued.</p>
               <p>Thus writeth S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> shewing plainely,
that all tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
ought to be examined by the written word, and
nothing to be admitted, which is not contained in the
same, or grounded thereupon. VVhere I note by the
way, for the helpe of the reader, that though <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:14159:57"/>
then bishop of Rome (whom now the papists tearme
Pope and his holinesse) together with the whole natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
synode of all the bishops of Italie, had made a flat
decree touching rebaptization: and though also Pope
<hi>Stephanus</hi> his holinesse had confirmed the same decree,
and commaunded it to be obserued: and thirdly, though
our papists of late daies doe obstinately affirme, that their
Pope cannot erre when he defineth iudicially. Yet this
notwithstanding, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> teacheth and telleth vs plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and roundly,<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 7. hist. cap. 2, 3, 4.</note> that in his time the bishop of Rome had
no such authoritie, as this day he proudly and antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly
taketh vpon him: for he roundly withstood the
decree of Pope <hi>Stephanus,</hi> who then was bishop of Rome,
and both sharpely reprooued him, and contemned his
falsely pretended authoritie. And for all that, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
was euer reputed an holy bishop in his life time, and a
glorious martyr being dead. But, if the bishop of Rome
had beene Christs vicar, and so priuiledged, as our papists
beare the world in hand he is, then doubtlesse S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
must needs haue beene an hereticke, and so reputed and
esteemed in the Church of God. For, if any Christian shall
this day doe or affirme as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did, or publickely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
the Popes falsely pretended prymacie in any place,
countrey, territories, or dominions, where poperie bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the sway, then without all peraduenture he must
be burnt at a stake, with fire and faggot for his paines.</p>

as is sufficient to ouerthrow all poperie for euer, and to
cause all people that haue any care of their saluation, to
renounce the Pope and his abhominable doctrine to
their liues end. For first, our popish bishop telleth vs

plainely, and without all dissimulation, (his mouth being

That in the holy scripture, as in a plentifull storehouse, is
laid vp for vs and our instruction, all knowledge necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
for mans saluation. Againe, the same popish bishop,
Saint, and Martyr, (of papists so esteemed and reputed)
telleth vs roundly, That they must not (because forsooth
they cannot) defend and maintaine their poperie by the
authoritie of the scripture, but by some other way and
meanes, to wit, by mans inuentions and popish vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

Now gentle reader, how can any papist (who is not giuen

against poperie,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. v. 24.</note> freely confessed and published

busily to maintaine their Pope and his popish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
and for all that continue papists still, and bee
carried away headlong into perdition; beleeuing and
obeying that doctrine, which cannot be defended by the
written word of God, which is the store-house of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie

they should be ashamed, to hold and beleeue that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;

But let vs yet heare what other renowned popish

If therefore you will read the scriptures with ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie
of mind, you shall need no other helpe at all. For
Christs word is true, when he saith: Seeke, and ye shall
find; knocke, and it shall be opened vnto you. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
many of you are charged with wiues, children, and
domesticall regiment, and so can not wholy addict your
selues to this studie: yet at the least bee readie to heare
what others haue gathered, and bestow so much diligence
in hearing what is said, as you doe in scraping worldlie
goods together. For albeit it bee a shame to require no
more of you, yet will I be content, if ye doe so much. For,
the cause of infinit euils, is your ignorance in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
From hence springeth the manifold mischiefe of
heresies; from hence, dissolute life; from hence, vaine
and vnprofitable labours. For, euen as they that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued
of this light, cannot goe the right way: so they
that doe not behold the beames of the holy scriptures,
are enforced inconintently to offend in many things, as
walking in farre greater darknesse.</p>
               <p>This is the golden censure of Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> rightly
surnamed the golden mouthed doctour. Out of whose
doctrine, I gather these worthy obseruations: First, that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14159:61"/>
whosoeuer studieth the scriptures seriously, and with
alacritie, shall find therein, and vnderstand so much, as
is necessarie for his saluation. And consequently, that our
disholy father the Pope, debarreth vs of the ordinarie
meanes of our saluation; when he vpon paine of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
inhibiteth vs to read the scriptures in our
vulgar tongue, vnlesse we haue his licence and dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so to doe. And he hath I confesse, some reason thus
to deale: because forsooth poperie would haue a short
reigne, if euery papist might freely read the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and other godly bookes written for their instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But alasse, they are so bewitched with his blessings,
that they thinke they shalbe damned, if they doe but
read this my discourse, or any other opposite to poperie,
not hauing his licence so to doe. But all his priests are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenced;
and so they can pretend no excuse, if they doe
not frame some answere hereunto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it is a very shame, for men charged
with wiues, children, and families; that they doe but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
heare sermons, and doe not withall studie the holy
scriptures; and consequently, that it is much more shame
for others that be more free, not to read them diligently;
and greatest shame of all for a bishop, to approue or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them that will not so doe,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that heresies, dissolute life, and all other euils,
doe proceed of ignorance, and of not reading the holy
scriptures.</p>
               <p>The same Saint <hi>Chysostome</hi> in an other place hath these
wordes.<note place="margin">Chrysost. in 9. ca. genes. hom. 29. to. 1.</note>

               <p>By these testimonies, (to omit many others) we may
perceiue most euidently, how grieuously Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
lamenteth, that the people in his time were so negligent
in reading the holy scripture. VVhat therefore would
that holy father say, if he liued in these our daies, in which
the Pope burneth such scriptures, as the people vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
in their vulgar tongue: In which he commaundeth
all church-seruice to be in straunge and vnknowne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
In which he excommunicateth all say-persons be
they neuer so well learned,<note place="margin">6. decret. lib. 5. cap. quicunque.</note> that reason of matter of faith,
or dispute of his power? VVhat would he say, if he heard
priests pronounce absolution in their popish sacrament
of penance, which neither the penitents, nor the priests
themselues doe often vnderstand? Nay, what would he
say, if he were this day in popish Churches, where they
doe not onely read their Churchseruice in Latine, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
Latine homilies or sermons vnto the vulgar sort; which
yet they tearme an exposition of the scripture: which
maner of proceeding is practised euery festiuall day of
nine lessons, in the time of their mattens? In fine, what
would he say, if he knew the rude vulgar sort, who are
commaunded to heare the Gospell read in Latine, and
withall should see them listening with their eares, least
any word should not be heard, though impossible of
them to be vnderstood? would he not, and might he not
iustly say with the holy Apostle,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. v. 24.</note> that they were mad?
Yes doublesse, it cannot be denied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Origen,</hi> who liued aboue a thousand and three hundred
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14159:62"/>
yeares agoe, doth not onely exhort the people seriously
to read the scriptures, but withall sheweth plainely, that
in his time they were read in the vulgar tongue. These are
his words:<note place="margin">Origen hom. 4. pe super leuit. pro finem.</note> 
                  <hi>Certè, si non omnia possumus, saltem ea quae nunc do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centur
in ecclesia, vel quae recitantur, memoriae commendemus.</hi>
Doubtlesse, if we cannot beare away all things contained
in the scriptures, yet at the least let vs remember those
things which are taught and read in the Church. Loe, in
these golden words he speaketh not onely of sermons,
but also of the Gospels, Epistles, Prayers, Lessons, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
of the Bible. For sermons are contained in the word
(<hi>docentur,</hi> which are preached;) and the rest in the word (<hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citantur,</hi>
which are read or rehearsed:) but certes, if such
things had beene read in a strange and vnknown tongue,
the vulgar sort could not haue committed them to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.
And consequently, to no end or purpose should
<hi>Origen</hi> haue made this exhortation. And the obiection
which is common in the mouthes of our papists, That
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> affirmeth the scriptures to be obscure and hard
to bee vnderstood (notwithstanding the great brags and
insolent vaunts of our Rhemists) is too too foolish,<note place="margin">Rhemist. in 2. Pet. cap. 3.</note>
and of no force at all. For first, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith not, that
the whole scripture is hard to be vnderstood, but some
things in S. <hi>Paules</hi> Epistles. Secondly, he speaketh not
solely and barely of the vnlearned, but of the vnlearned
which are vnstable. Thirdly, he speaketh not generally
of all readers of the scripture, but of those wicked ones,
which depraue not onely S. <hi>Paules</hi> Epistles,<note place="margin">Vide D. Chrysost. in proemio epist. ad Rom. in in<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

scriptures, to their owne perdition. Howbeit, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre
all the godly, who with all humilitie and reuerence
desire to read the scriptures; and to abandon one onely
particular euill, by taking away the good wholly and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally;
may well be resembled to those vnskilfull physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who cannot deliuer their patients from any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
disease, except they take away their liues. But wise
<hi>Salomon</hi> was of another mind,<note place="margin">Prou. 8. v. 8, 9.</note> when he affirmed all the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14159:63"/>
words of wisedome to be open and easie to euery one of
vnderstanding, that is, which haue a desire to the truth,
and are not blinded of the prince of this world. For, as
by the foole, he meaneth euery wicked man: so by a man
of vnderstanding he meaneth euery one that is godly.
Hereupon it is said,<note place="margin">Psal. 25. v. 9.</note> that God reuealeth his secret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
to all that feare him:<note place="margin">Iohn. 7. v. 17.</note> That whosoeuer will do the will
of God,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. v. 31: 32</note> the same shal know his doctrine: That they which
abide in Gods word, shall know the truth:<note place="margin">Matth. 11. v. 25.</note> That God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealeth
his will vnto the simple and vnlearned ones, and
hideth his secrets from the wise and prudent:<note place="margin">Ps. 119. v. 105.</note> That the
whole bodie of the scripture, from the head to the foot
thereof, is tearmed a lanterne to ourfeet, and a light vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our pathes: That Gods word is like a candle, shining in
a darke place, vntill the day dawne, and the day-star arise
in our hearts:<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. v. 19.</note> That the spirituall man doth vnderstand all
things which are necessarie for his saluation:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. v. 15.</note> for so <hi>Lyra</hi>
and <hi>Dionysius Carthusianus,</hi> two great learned papists, doe
expound the place. And consequently, if Gods word be
hidden to any, it is hidden to those that perish, to those
whose vnderstandings the God of this world hath blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. v. 3, 4.</note>
that the light of the Gospell of the glorie of Christ,
should not shine vnto them.</p>

furnish your selues with bibles, the soueraigne medicines
of your soules. If you will haue no other thing, at the
least prouide the new Testament, the Apostle, the Acts,
the Gospell, the continuall and diligent doctors. If any
griefe come, turne thine eye vnto the scripture, as to the
Apothecaries shop full of medicines. From hence receiue
sollace of euill, whether domage, or death, or losse of
worldly goods chance vnto thee. Yea, looke not onely
to the scripture, but volue and reuolue all things contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
therein, and keepe the same in mind. For this is the
cause of all manner of euils, that men are ignorant in the
holy scriptures. Teach your children to sing Psalmes,
which are full of Philosophie.</p>
               <p>Thus writeth this holy father, teaching vs at large,
how necessarie and needfull a thing it is for euery one to
studie and read diligently the holy scriptures. For first, he
telleth vs plainely, that all necessarie points of doctrine
are so plaine and manifest, as one may vnderstand the
same without the preacher. Secondly, that they who are
charged with wiues, children, and worldly affaires, are spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
and more than others, commaunded to read the
scriptures: The reason hereof he yeeldeth in another
place; because the more they are encombered with the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14159:64"/>
cares of the world, the more need they haue to enioy the
helpes of the holy scripture. These are his words: <hi>Quid ais

more thy charge than it is theirs: For they haue not so
great need of the helpe of the scriptures as you haue,
who are tossed in the middest of the waues of worldly
troubles. Thirdly, that all secular persons of both sexes
must furnish themselues with the holy Bible. Fourthly,
that they must not onely read the scriptures barely and
slenderly, but that they must doe the same with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
Fiftly, that the scriptures doe minister comforts

               <p>Out of these wordes of this holy writer, and antient

touched in some places, are plainelie handled in other
places. Thirdly, that the scriptures are obscure in some
places, to exercise our wits, and to cleanse the loathsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

scriptures at home in our houses, &amp; not heare them read

First, that both men and women in his dayes, did studie
and read the scriptures, as diligently and painfully as the
monkes. Secondly, that in his time they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
the happiest people, who could con by heart the
most texts of holy scripture: Wheras amongst the papists
they are deemed most holy, that can by heart no scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

the poyson of their soules. Thirdly, that yong women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but seuen yeeres of age, must be acquainted with the
holy scriptures, &amp; learne by heart the booke of Psalmes.
Fourthly, that from seuen yeeres vpward vntill puberty,

read seriously the bookes of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the Gospels, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,

These are his wordes; <hi>Sint ergo diuinae scipturae semper in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus

world. VVhich two points doubtlesse, are the most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
obscure, hard, and intricate articles, in the whole
course of theologie.</p>
               <p>The Iesuit <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> (a wonderfull thing to be heard,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14159:66"/>
and a most incredible, sauing (that the truth must needes
in time haue the vpper hand) confesseth so much vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
as is able sufficiently to prooue and conclude my
intended scope and proposition.<note place="margin">Bellar. tom 1. ed. 191. lib. 4. de verbo Deiscrip. to. cap. 11. a.</note> These are his expresse
wordes; <hi>His notatis, dico illa omnia scripta esse ab apostolis, quae
sunt omnibus necessariae, &amp; quaeipsipalam omnibus vulgo praedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerant;
alia autem non omnia scripta esse.</hi> These obseruations
being marked, I answere, that all those things were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the Apostles, which are necessarie for all men, and
which the Apostles preached openly to all the vulgar
people; but that all other things were not written. Thus
writeth our skilfull Iesuit, who in the name of all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
(being as it were their mouth) saith all that can be
said, in defence of late Romish religion. Out of whose
words I note first, that all thing necessarie for all men and
all women, old men, yoong men, maids, and babes, rich
and poore, noble and ignoble, are set downe and contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the holy scriptures. Secondly, that all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the written word, are necessarie for all people.
Thirdly, that those things which are not contained in the
written word, were neuer preached openly to all people,
but secretly to some few persons in secret corners; perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
to our Iesuits and Iesuited popelings, sauing that
their sect was not then hatched, as which is not yet eighty
yeeres old. Fourthly, that those things which are not
contained in the scriptures and written word, are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
for all people, but onely for Iesuits and papists, to
bring them to perdition. Fiftly, that seeing on the one
side, all things needfull for all men and all women, for
yong and old, rich and poore, noble and ignoble, are
contained in the scriptures; and seeing withall on the
other side, that all things in the written word are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
for all people, (marke well what I say, gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for I build my worke vpon that foundation which
the Iesuit hath laid) it followeth by necessarie conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quution,
that all people ought seriously to read the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14159:66"/>
scripture: as also that they may safely contemne all
vnwritten traditions, as nothing needfull or pertaining
to them. But let vs heare our Cardinall Iesuit once again
speake for himselfe and for the honour of this holy father
the Pope.<note place="margin">Bellar. de verbo dei, lib. 3. cap. 2. tom. 1. col. 129.</note> These are his expresse words: <hi>At in nouo testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento,
quia Christus impleuit figuras &amp; prophetias; etsi multi non
intelligant sententias scripturarum, intelligunt tamen ipsa mysteria
redemptionis, etiam rustici &amp; mulieres.</hi> But in the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because Christ hath fulfilled the figures and the
prophesies; although many doe not vnderstand the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of the scriptures, yet doe they vnderstand the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of our redemption, euen the common countrey
fellowes and the very women.</p>
               <p>Thus writeth our Iesuit, affirming, that euen women
and the very rustickes of the countrey, doe vnderstand
the scriptures, so farre forth as pertaineth to the mysteries
of their redemption: and I pray you, why then doth the
Pope debarre them from the reading thereof? VVhat
more knowledge is needfull ouer and besides the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of mans redemption? It is all the knowledge which
Saint <hi>Paule</hi> desired to haue:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. v. 2.</note> who (as he saith of himselfe)
esteemed not to know any thing among them, saue Iesus
Christ, &amp; him crucified. I therfore conclude by our Iesuits
owne free graunt, that it behooueth all men and women,
children and maids, diligently to read the holy scriptures,
seeing they may vnderstand therein all the mysteries of
their redemption, <hi>viz.</hi> all knowledge necessarie for their
saluation. VVhich knowledge is so necessarie, as nothing
can be more.<note place="margin">Deut. 11. v. 18, 19, 20.</note> Ye (saith God by the mouth of his seruant
<hi>Moses</hi>) shall lay vp these my words in your heart and in

ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and vpon thy gates. But our papists obiect against vs,
that when the fathers exhort all men and women to read
the scriptures,<note place="margin">Rheme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in prefatio, sect. 15.</note> they speake as pulpit-men agreeably to
their audience, and the peoples default; but not as tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
in the schoole, making exact and generall rules to
be obserued in all places and times. To which I answere
first, that the truth must be spoken as well in the pulpit as
in the schoole. Secondly, that the doctrine in pulpit is
and ought to be as exact, absolute, and necessarie, as the
doctrine in schoole: The sole and onely difference is or
ought to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the pulpit hath euer the pricke
of exhortation annexed, which the schoole wanteth. For
the preacher may not speake at randon in the pulpit, but
euen there must he haue the girdle of truth about his
loynes. Thirdly, that holy <hi>Dauid</hi> regarded no such popish
distinction,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. v. 9.</note> when asking, whereby a yong man shal clense
his waies? he answereth thus: By studie, meditation, and
keeping of the law of God. Neither the godly men in
Berhaea,<note place="margin">Act. 17. v. 11.</note> when they daily searched the scriptures, euen to
examine the doctrine of the Apostles by them. Our papists
obiect likewise,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. v. 12.</note> that S. <hi>Paule</hi> will haue women to liue in
silence, and not to chat and prattle of the scriptures.
I answere, that though S. <hi>Paule</hi> will not permit women to
teach publickely before men; yet doth he neither forbid
them to read the scriptures, nor yet to teach priuately,
when due circumstances doe occurre. For the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle<note place="margin">Tit. 2. v. 3.</note>
elswhere commaundeth mothers to teach godly
things to their children. So <hi>Salomon,</hi> the wisest child that
euer was among the sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> one Christ euer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
confesseth plainely and humbly, what doctrine his
mother <hi>Bethsheba</hi> taught him.<note place="margin">Prou. 31. v. 1.</note> So <hi>Priscilla,</hi> wife to <hi>Aquila</hi> the

was throughly instructed in the scriptures by his
mother <hi>Eunice,</hi> and by his grandmother <hi>Lois.</hi> By which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
example it is euident and cleare to euery one, that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14159:67"/>
neither mothers must forbeare to teach, nor yet young
babes forbeare to learne the holy scriptures.</p>

               <head>The third Proposition.</head>
               <p>Traditions must be examined by the holy scriptures,
which is the true touchstone of veritie; and then onely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
when they are found to be consonant to the same.
For proofe of this proposition, the very name or word
(Canonicall) is of it selfe sufficient. For (Canon) is a Greek
word, which signifieth a rule, and there upon those bookes
are called the Canonicall scriptures, which are the rule of
our faith. And consequently, whatsoeuer is not consonant
to the scriptures, the same ought to be reiected, as perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and swaruing from the rule of our faith. For this
cause doth the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> send vs to the law,<note place="margin">Esae. 8. v. 20.</note> and to the
testimonie, there to trie the truth. For this cause doth the
Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> exhort the people euer to be mindfull<note place="margin">Mal. 4. 4.</note>
of the law of <hi>Moses.</hi> For this cause doth the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
tell vs, That Gods word is a lanterne to our feet.<note place="margin">Psal. 119. v. 105</note> For
this cause saith S. <hi>Peter,</hi> That Gods word is a light shining
in darke places,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. v. 19.</note> vntill the day-starre arise in our hearts.
For this cause did Christ himselfe exhort the Iewes to<note place="margin">Iohn 5. v. 39.</note>
reade seriously the holy scriptures. For this cause said
Christ, That the Pharisies erred,<note place="margin">Matt. 22. v. 29.</note> because they knew not
the scriptures.<note place="margin">Act. 17 v. 11.</note> For this cause did the men at Berhaea trie
the truth of S. <hi>Paules</hi> doctrine by the scriptures. For this
cause doth S. <hi>Iohn</hi> exhort vs not to beleeue euery spirit,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 4. v. 1.</note>
but to trie the spirits, if they be of God. For this cause
doth S. <hi>Paule</hi> pronounce him accursed that preacheth any

and S. <hi>Basill</hi> doe expound that place of the written word.<note place="margin">Aug cont. literas Pet l. li. 3. cap. 6. tom. 7.</note>
And the truth thereof is alreadie prooued, because the
Apostles taught no needfull doctrine, which they did not
after commit to writing.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> would not yeeld to <hi>Stephanus</hi> then bishop of
Rome, in the controuersie concerning rebaptization; but
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14159:68"/>
sharpely reprooued him for leaning to tradition,<note place="margin">Cyprian epist. ad Pompeium. 74.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
of him, by what scripture he could prooue his
tradition. For, in his daies it was not ynough to alleadge
tradition for the proofe of any doctrine. And much lesse
was it a rule in Saint <hi>Cyprians</hi> time to follow the bishop of
Romes definitiue sentence, in matters of faith and doctrin.
Though our sottish and blind papists in these latter dayes
doe admit and reuerence his sentence, euen as the holy
Gospell. See S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> words in the first proposition.</p>
               <p>VVhen the Arrians would not admit the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>)
because it was not found in the scriptures, the fathers of
the counsell did not then alleadge traditions for proofe
thereof; neither did they say, that many things must be
beleeued which are not written: but they answered sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
That though that word were not expressely written,
yet was it virtually and effectually contained in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
This assertion is euident by the testimonie of Saint
<hi>Athanasius,</hi>

How can it but be absurd, that in money matters

must learne and know such things, by diligent reading of

I doe not thinke it sure and certaine, although all

                  <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> another learned schoole-doctor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned

                  <hi>Fatemur non audiendos esse sacerdotes, nisi docuerint

eare or hearken to the priests, except they shall teach vs
according to Gods law.</p>
               <p>Loe, the papists affirme plainely, that no doctrine is
sound, or to be receiued, but that onely which is tried to
be true by Gods word. Neither may we beleeue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
of any popish priest, vnlesse it be agreeable to Gods
law. Now doubtlesse, if the Pope will be tried and iudged
by this doctrine, which his best doctors haue published to

we shall soone agree in all controuersies of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And certes, this their doctrine is so certaine and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the Iesuit <hi>Bellarmine</hi> singeth the same song with

that all bishops seuerally may erre, and sometime doe
erre, and doe so disagree among themselues, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Thus you see euen by the Iesuits verdict, that in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Church, all their bishops doe so erre, and sometimes
so dissent one from another, that no papist can tell indeed
which of them it is best to follow. To which doctrine I
will very willingly subscribe, aduising this Iesuit and all
other Iesuited papists to remember well this doctrine, and
not to hang their soules henceforth vpon their iarring and
doting popish fathers; whom (as their deere Iesuit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed
Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> telleth them) they may not
safely follow. And least the Iesuit or some for him shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
me or say in his defence, That albeit all popish bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
may erre seuerally, and dissent among themselues,
as is alreadie said; yet can they not erre, when they are
called together in a synode or counsell, and the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the Pope. This is all doubtlesse that posibly
can be said in defence of popish doctrine: And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,

The other, that the East Churches did neuer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

all that he cannot commit his authoritie. This conclusion
must needs seeme strange to a great many; but I will
confirme it with the testimonie of such a worthie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed
papist, that all whosoeuer shall once heare or
read it, cannot but giue credit to the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> is the man, from whose pen I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it; the case is euident,<note place="margin">Canus lib. 5. de authoritat. cone. cap. 5. pag. 102.</note> these are his words: <hi>Decreta quae
à legato contra sedis Apostolicae traditionem approbantur, non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
Romanae ecclesiae authoritatem; nec aliter se habent, quam si à

quam in confirmandis &amp; fratribus &amp; dogmatibus Petrus habet, in

shall approoue against the tradition of the Church of
Rome, haue no authoritie from the Church of Rome;
neither are they of any more force, than if they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

The sound authoritie which <hi>Peter</hi> hath in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
his brethren and decrees, he cannot transferre vnto
his legates. These are the expresse words of <hi>Canus,</hi> that
worthie bishop, and strong pillar of popish doctrine. Out
of whose words I note first, that decrees of counsels be of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14159:70"/>
no force, when they haue not the consent of the Popes
legates. Secondly, that the decrees of counsels, euen
when they haue the consent of the legates, are of no force
at all, if the legates shall agree to any thing which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Popes mind. Thirdly, that the Pope cannot
translate or giue his authoritie vnto the legates. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
that the Pope abuseth the whole world shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
when he calleth together all bishops in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
world, to decide and determine controuersies in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and for all that, will approoue nothing that they
doe or decree, vnlesse it be agreeable to that which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

               <p>Generall popish counsels in these our daies are euen

prayed, much, consulted grauely, deliberated maturely,

neither others, nor yet themselues can tell, what

               <p>No bishop can in these our dayes haue voices in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
but such as will first sweare obedience to the Pope,
and promise to defend his cannon law. This conclusion
though it containe grosse absurdities, yet is it so cleare, as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14159:71"/>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that Iesuitical Cardinall cannot denie the same,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de conc. lib. 1. cap. vit.</note>
These be his wordes. <hi>Istud iuramentum non tollit episcoporum

ea quae secundum Deum &amp; sacros canones iubere potest: sed not iurant

                     </gap> posituros eum, si
haereticum esse conuincant.</hi> This oath taketh not away the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of bishops, which in councels is necessarie. For they
sweare that they will be obedient to the Pope; which is
to be vnderstood, so long as he is Pope, and while he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
those things, which he may commaund agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God, and to the holy cannons; but they sweare
not, that they will not speake what they thinke in the
councell, or that they will not depose the Pope if they
prooue him to be an heretique.</p>
               <p>Thus writeth <hi>Bellarminus,</hi> whose onely testimonie is
most sufficient in all popish affaires: as who is the Popes
sworne and tenderly beloued vassall, and whose bookes
are dedicated to the Pope himselfe. Out of his wordes I
note first, that all clergie men admitted to giue voyces in
councels, are sworne simply wholy to obey the Popes
constitutions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the said persons are sworne to beleeue,
that the Pope cannot erre in his iudiciall decrees of faith
and manners; that no councels are of force, without the
Popes confirmation; that councels confirmed by him,
are aproued by the holy Ghost; that he can excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
and depose, all emperours, and empresses, all
Kings and Queenes, all bishops and archbishops in the
Christian world; that he can by his pardons deliuer all
soules out of purgatorie, and goe himselfe to the deuill.
For all these and a thousand like things, are strictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
in his canons, and consequently in their most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
oath.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that they are sworne to admit his decrees,
who (as they freely grant) may for al that be an heretique.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:14159:72"/>
Fourthly, that they are sworne to reuerence and obey
his iudgement in all matters of faith, whom they may
iudge and depose for heresie.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that their fundamentall article, by which they
make the Pope iudge ouer all controuersies; is quite
ouerthrowne, and turned vpside downe, in this <hi>Bellarminus</hi>
his explication. For when he saith (VVhile he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
&amp;c.) he graunteth euery bishop freedome to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and iudge, when the Pope commaundeth things
agreeable to God and the canons. VVhich libertie, if the
papists would constantly performe, all true Christians
and perfect Catholikes, would soone agree with them.
For none that beleeue aright, will denie obedience to the
Pope, when he preacheth, teacheth, or commaundeth
any thing which is agreeable to God and holy canons. But
good Christians finding his canons to be disholy, and his
decrees to be against God; doe thinke as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here
teacheth them, that they are not bound to obey him.
And that the reader may fully vnderstand the abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the oath which all popish bishops sweare vnto the

or papall soueraigntie, and the rules of the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
so God me helpe, and the holy Gospel.</p>
               <p>Loe here gentle reader, open and flat rebellion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and by euangelicall oath confirmed, of subiects
against their soueraignes. For, the bishops of euery coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14159:72"/>
are the subiects of the kings of the same countreys;
and yet doe they sweare to defend the Popes vsurped iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
and most bloodie tyrannie, against their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
dread soueraignes. For they sweare to defend the
Popes vsurped authoritie, against all people, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
VVhich his diabolicall vsurped primacy, (as I
haue prooued at large else where) extendeth it selfe to
the translation of empires, kingdomes, and regalities.</p>
               <p>These conclusions being well marked and remembred,
the answere to the mightie obiection, which is as the
foundation of poperie, will be plaine and easie, <hi>viz.</hi> that
popish bishops may as well erre, when they are assembled
together in a generall councell, as when they preach,
teach, or write asunder. For first, the Pope himselfe will
not shew his face in any councell, because the emperour
must sit aboue him, as is euident by the first conclusion.
Seconly, when the Pope sendeth his legates to councels
to supplie his place, he doth but delude the world by that
fact; seeing he cannot impart his authoritie vnto them,
as by the second conclusion is apparant. Thirdly, popish
councels and synodes in these after ages, are flexible as
a nose of waxe, and as vncertaine as the weathercocke,
as is clearely proued in the third conclusion. Fourthly,
no bishops of late ages can haue voyces in popish coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
but such as will first sweare obedience to the Pope,
and promise by oath to defend his vsurped power, and
most execrable canon law, as by the fourth conclusion
will appeare. Fiftly, that decree is true and iust, which is
concluded by the gerater part of the bishops there assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
and yet the Pope sitting at Rome in his chaire, will
reiect such decrees at his good pleasure, and define the
sentence of fewer voyces to be of force. This obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is euidently confirmed, by the due proofes of the
third conclusion. Sixtly the decrees of councels must
needs be obeyed, as the papists tell vs; and yet the Pope
may reiect them, and disanull them at his pleasure, euen
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14159:73"/>
dreaming in his chaire at home, or riding abroad on his
white palfrey. This to be so is euident to euery one, that
shall seriously peruse the third conclusion. Yea, our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
of Rhemes in their commentary vpon the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Rhemes
test. in act. 15.</note> tell vs plainely and roundly; that the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of councels is needlesse, because the Popes iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alone is infalliable. VVherefore they ad this clause
to salue the Popes proceedings, That councels are called
not for necessitie sake, but for the better contentation of
the weake. I therefore conclude against the popish sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
bulwarke, that seeing all bishops may erre seueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as the Iesuit <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath taught vs; and seeing also
that the constitutions in popish councels are nothing else
in deed, but the bare decrees of one onely bishop, as is
alreadie prooued; it followeth of necessite, and cannot
be denied, that all bishops in the popish Church may erre
egregiously; and that as well iointly as seuerally, as is to
be seene at large in my Golden ballance of triall: to which
treatise I referre the reader for better satisfaction, both
touching the Popes double person, and concerning his
priuate and publike errors, In the <hi>interim,</hi> I must needs
tell the papists; that a generall councell is aboue the
Pope; that a generall councell hath power to depose the
Pope; that a generall councell did <hi>de facto</hi> depose <hi>Iohn</hi> the
12 long sithence, and <hi>Iohn</hi> the 13 of that name; as I haue
prooued at large by sound popish testimonie, in my Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie
of popish tyrannie. And thus haue I prooued, that
the sole and onely scripture inspired from heauen, is the
infalliable rule of truth; and that all traditions must bee
examined by the same, and then addmitted when they
be consonant thereunto, not otherwise: howsoeuer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie
be pretended in that behalfe.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="proposition">
               <head>The fourth Proposition.</head>
               <p>Popish vnwritten traditions are so vncertaine and
doubtfull,<note place="margin">Ratio. prima.</note> that the best learned papists are at great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:14159:73"/>
about them, and cannot possibly be accorded
therein. For the proofe of this proposition, it were ynough
to call to mind that great and endlesse strife, which was in
the Church about 1400 yeeres sithence, betweene <hi>Victor</hi>
then Bishop of Rome and the bishops of Asia. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
was among them, concerning the keeping of
Easter. Tradition apostolicall was alledged earnestly, and
both sides did stoutly defend the same.</p>
               <p>The same tradition was in controuersie afore <hi>Polycarpus</hi>
the bishop of Smyrna,<note place="margin">Euseb. li. 5. hist. cap. 23. &amp; cap. 24. per totum.</note> and <hi>Anicetus</hi> the Bishop of Rome.
But neither could <hi>Polycarpe</hi> perswade <hi>Anicetus,</hi> nor <hi>Anicetus</hi>
perswade <hi>Polycarpus;</hi> albeit they both agreed as deere
friends. The storie is set done at large, by <hi>Eusebius</hi> a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
father and most famous historiographer. But <hi>Victor</hi>
the Bishop of Rome dealt so furiously in that controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
that <hi>Ireneus</hi> and other bishops of Gallia, did sharply
reprooue him for the same. VVhat need more bee said
for the varietie and vncertaintie of traditious: For first,
the bishops that thought and taught thus diuersly of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dions,
did all of them liue within 200 yeeres after Christ;
at which time the Church was in in good estate, and stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with very few or no corruptions at all. Secondly, the
one side doubtlesse, must needs be seduced with false and
vnsound traditions: For apostolicall doctrine was vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
and constant, and could not possible bee contrarie
to it selfe. Thirdly, Saint <hi>Policarpe, Polycrates,</hi> and the other
bishops, did in those dayes make no more reckoning of
the bishop of Romes opinion, than they did of another
mans. Fourthly, they all were so farre from acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the bishop of Rome, to be the supreme head of the
Church, and that he could not erre; that they all with
vniforme assent affirmed him to defend a grosse errour,
and to hold a false opinion; that they all reputed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
his equals, touching gouernment ecclesiasticall:
that they all verie sharpely reprooued him, and with
might and maine withstood his proceedings. VVhereas
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14159:74"/>
this day, if any bishops, magistrates, or other potentates
in the world, (where poperie beareth the sway) should
doe the like; they might all roundly be excommunicated,
and not onely deposed from their iurisdiction, but also be
burnt with fire an faggot for their paines. Fiftly, if Saint
<hi>Polycarpe</hi> had cause in his time, being the flourishing age of
the Church, to doubt of romish traditions; much more
doubtlesse haue wee cause, at this day to stand in doubt
thereof; in these doolefull dayes I say, in which iniquitie
hath gotten the vpper hand; in which the bishops of
Rome haue brought an huge multitude of errors into the
Church, and seduced a great part of the Christian world.</p>
               <p>Another controuersie touching traditions,<note place="margin">Ratio secunda. Chrisost. hom. 47. in mat. col. 405.</note> is for and
about the keeping of Lent. For albeit Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> tel
vs plainely, that Christ did not commaund vs to imitate
his fast, but to learne of him to be humble and meeke in
heart; yet doe the papists this day <hi>mordicus</hi> defend it, to be
an apostolicall tradition; yea, many of them are so blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and besotted with vnsauorie traditions and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
illusions, that they deeme it a greater sinne to eat
flesh in Lent, than to commit adulterie, murder, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie.</p>

                  <hi>Socrates</hi> in like manner reporteth hystorically, that they

no liuing thing; othersome of liuing things, ate onely
fish;<note place="margin">Histor. tripart. lib. 9. cap. 38.</note> some together with fish, did eat also birds; but some
ate only bread, and others at night ate all kind of meates
without difference. Yea, he telleth vs in the same place,
that the Romans fast three weekes before Easter, besides
the Sabboth and the Lords day. And that the Illyrians and
Alexandrians do fast six weekes, and yet do they all tearm
their fasts Lent. By which testimonies euery man may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> a very auntient father, affirmeth out of
Apostolicall tradition;<note place="margin">Ratio quarta. Irenae. lib. 2. cap. 39.</note> that Christ was fortie yeeres old,
when he suffered his bitter passion. <hi>Papias</hi> another father,

yeeres after the generall resurrection.<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 3. cap. vlt. Andrad. de trad. lib. 2. p. 126</note> 
                  <hi>Basilius</hi> another holy

the altar and the temple, was father to <hi>S. Iohn</hi> the

to hold; and yet did these fathers receiue them by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall
so supposed tradition, as their own famous doctor
<hi>Andradius</hi> graunteth willingly.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, popish tradition telleth vs,<note place="margin">Ratio quinta.</note> that all the bishops
of Rome one after another haue taught succesiuely the
selfesame doctrine with S. <hi>Peter.</hi> Howbeit their own deere
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14159:75"/>
doctor and religious frier <hi>Nicholaus de Lyra,</hi> auoucheth
plainely, roundly, and boldly, to the whole world, that
many bishops of Rome haue fallen away from the faith,
and become flat Apostataes. And least this my narration
be thought strange vnto many, that our holy fathers the
Popes should be Atheists or Apostataes, and that their
own deare brethren, in high esteeme among them, would
neuer so write of them; I will deale plainely in this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
point, and after my wonted manner set downe his
owne expresse words.<note place="margin">Lyranus in cap. 16. mat.</note> Thus doth he write: <hi>Ex quo patet,
quod ecclesia non consistit in hominibus ratione potestatis vel dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
ecclesiasticae vel secularis; quia multi principes, et summi pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
et alij inscriores, inuenti sunt a side apostatasse. Propter quod
ecclesia consistit in illis personis, in quibus est notitia vera, et confessio
fidei et veritatis.</hi> VVhereby it is euident, that the Church
doth not consist in men by reason of power or dignitie,
either ecclesiasticall or secular; because many princes and
Popes, and others of the inferiour sort, are found to
haue beene apostataes, and to haue swarued wholie from
faith. For which cause, the Church consisteth in those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
in whom, there is true knowledge, and confession
of the faith and of the truth.</p>
               <p>Thus writeth this learned papist (whom their owne so
supposed martyr sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> called a great clearke, as
he was indeed) whose words are well worthie to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen
in marble with golden letters. For by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is cleare and euident, that not they who sit in
S. <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, are euer the true and lawfull successors of
S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but they only and solely that confesse and preach
S. <hi>Peters</hi> faith and doctrine: as also that their receiued
maxime (<hi>vbi Papa, ibi Roma; vbi Roma, ibi ecclesia catholica</hi>) is
false, vaine, and friuolous. VVe therefore this day im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
nothing in popish proceedings, but the selfesame
indeed, which famous popish doctors reproued afore our
time, and that in their publicke writings published free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the whole world. VVhich thing, whosoeuer will seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14159:75"/>
ponder as my selfe haue done, that man must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
detest and abhorre all popish superstitious trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
But of this argument I haue discoursed at large in my
booke of Motiues.</p>
               <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">Ratio sexta.</note> popish tradition telleth vs, that the blessed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<hi>Marie,</hi> the true mother of true God and true man,
was conceiued without originall sinne, and that the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Rome did for that end ordaine a feastiuall day of
her conception, to be kept vpon the eight of December.
But by your leaue,<note place="margin">Aquinas p. 3. q. 14. art. 3. ad primum. Bernard. epist. 174. p. 207.</note> 
                  <hi>Aquinas</hi> their owne Angelicall Doctor
affirmeth resolutely, that she was conceiued in originall
sinne. Yea, their other holy doctor and deare frier <hi>Bernard</hi>
doth very sharpely reprooue the Cathedrall Church of
Lyons, because they obserued the feastiuitie of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the blessed virgine; and the calleth that their

the sister of superstition, and the daughtet of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie.
That done, he addeth these words: <hi>Hoc non est vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem

to the virgine,<note place="margin">A. D. 1475.</note> but to take honour from her. Yet Pope

               <p>Seuenthly,<note place="margin">Ratio sept.</note> popish tradition telleth <hi>vs,</hi> that the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Constantine,</hi> worthily surnamed the Great, was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

               <p>Eightly,<note place="margin">Ratio octaua.</note> popish tradition hath brought flat idolatrie
into the Church, teaching to adore them as saints and
Gods friends, who were known heretickes, and professed
enemies to God and his Church. This to be so, their owne

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14159:76"/>
are to be obserued seriously: first, the vncertainetie of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written

to the same. Now, it remaineth for the better contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the reader, to make answere to such obiections in
defence of popish traditions, as the papists haue euer in
their mouths, and boast of them, as if they were insoluble.</p>

               <p>VVe doe not know, which bookes of the scripture

traditions of the Church: And yet is this a matter

               <div type="answer">
                  <head>The answere.</head>
                  <p>This is that mightie obiection, wherein the papists glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and boast beyond all measure; and say more rashly
than wisely, that it can neuer be truly answered. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shall desire the gentle reader to ponder well my
words, and then to iudge of the matter, as right reason
shall prescribe. My answere is this. First, there is great ods
betweene the primitiue Church and the Church of late
daies.<note place="margin">Durand. in 3. s. d. 24 quaest. 1.</note> VVhich to be so, the famous popish doctor <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
will contest with me. For the Apostles (as <hi>Durand</hi> saith
wisely) heard Christs doctrine, saw Christs myracles, and
were replenished with the holy ghost; and consequently,
they must needs be fit witnesses of all that Christ did and
taught. But these adiuncts cannot be rightly ascribed to
the late bishops of Rome and their cursed Iesuited brood.
Secondly, the old testament was deliuered by the Iewes,
and confirmed by Christ and his Apostles; and therefore
as the papists admit that tradition, and withall doe reiect
their other manifold vnwritten traditions, which the Iews
in their <hi>Talmud</hi> affirme to be of <hi>Moses;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bellarm. tom. 1. col. 187.</note> euen so doe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
this tradition, and reiect all vnwritten traditions
contrarie to the same. Thirdly, the bookes of the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
are but an exposition of the law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;<note place="margin">Vide Aug. tom. 6. pag. 184.</note>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:14159:76"/>
as I haue alreadie prooued in the first proposition
of this present article: And consequently, it may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
and tried by the same;<note place="margin">Act. 17. v. 11.</note> as the godly Bereans tried
S. <hi>Paules</hi> preaching. Fourthly, when we affirme all things
necessarie for our saluation, to be comprised and contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the scriptures; we then speake of them, as they are
acknowledged and agreed vpon, both among the Iewes
for the old Testament, in the which the new is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended;
and ioyntly for the old and new, throughout
the Christian world. And so this tradition is not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but virtually implied in our affirmation. Fiftly, the
scriptures canonicall are discerned from not canonicall
euen of themselues, like as light is discerned from darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
hardnesse from softnesse, and sweetnesse from bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse.<note place="margin">Psal.

ye doe well, vntill the day dawne, and the day-starre arise

should shine vnto them. And the same Apostle elswhere
teacheth vs,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. v. 15.</note> that the spirituall man iudgeth all things.
VVhich text, two famous papists, <hi>Lyranus</hi> and <hi>Carthusianus</hi>
doe expound,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. v. 27.</note> of things partaining to our saluation. S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
is consonant to S. <hi>Paule,</hi> affirming, that the vnction which

Yea, Christ himselfe saith, That his sheepe doe heare his

and therefore doe follow him; then by a necessarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
they can know Christ speaking to them in the

behold here a great sacrament; the sound of our

you is within. Thinke not, that man learneth any
thing of man: we (preachers) may admonish by the
sound of wordes; but if he be not within that teacheth, in
vaine is our sound; how many will goe hence vntaught?
For mine owne part, I haue spoken to all; but to whom
that vnction speaketh not inwardly, whom the holy
Ghost teacheth not within, they goe home vntaught, as
they came. The outward teachings are some helpes and
admonitions; but he sitteth in his chaire in heauen, that
teacheth the heart, The master is within that teacheth,
it is Christ that teacheth, it is his inspiration that instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14159:77"/>
VVhere his inspiration and his vnction is not, there
the outward noise of words is in vaine: Thus writeth this
auntient and learned father, with many moe wordes to
the like effect. By whose doctrine we may learne suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
if nothing else were said: that howsoeuer men
teach, how soeuer <hi>Paul</hi> plant, or <hi>Apollo</hi> water, yet will no
increase follow, vnlesse God giue the same. I therefore
conclude, that we doe not beleeue this booke or that
booke to be canonicall, because this man or that man, or
the Church saith soe; but that the scripture is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; that
it hath in it selfe that dignity, which is worthy to haue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite;
that the declaration of the Church, doth not make
vs beleeue the scripture, but is only an outward helpe to
bring vs thereunto; and that wee therefore indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
the scripture, and this or that booke to be canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
because God doth inwardly teach vs and persuade
our hearts so to beleeue. For certes if wee should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that this or that booke is canonicall scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Church saith so; then should the formall obiect
of our faith, and the vltimate tearme into which our faith
is resolued, be man, and not <hi>prima veritas,</hi> or God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
as <hi>Areopagita</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> teach vs. And it will not
helpe the papists to replie out of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> That he
would not haue beleeued the Gospell, vnlesse the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the Church had mooued him thereunto. For S.
<hi>Austens</hi> wordes are these;<note place="margin">August. contra epistol. Manich. tom. 6. cap. 5. pag. 79.</note> 
                     <hi>Nisi authoritas ecclesiae me commoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.</hi>
I would not haue beleeued the Gospell, if the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the Church had not iointly mooued me therunto.
For wee must note, that there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>mouere</hi> and <hi>commouere. Mouere</hi> is to moue absolutely,
and a part by it selfe; but <hi>commouere</hi> is to moue respectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and together with another thing. So Saint <hi>Austens</hi>
meaning is nothing else indeed but that the authoritie of
the Church did outwardly concurre with the inward
motion of the holy Ghost, to bring him to the faith of the
Gospel. Now, Saint <hi>Austens</hi> meaning is this and and none
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14159:78"/>
other; <hi>viz.</hi> that he maketh much more account of the
vniuersall Church, than of <hi>Manichaeus</hi> and his complices;
because the Church did first moue him to heare the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
preached, and to giue some credit to the same. I say
(some credit) because the Churches authoritie did onely
moue him to beleeue the Gospell, <hi>fide humana, non fide di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uina:</hi>
with humane faith, not with faith diuine. For this
diuine faith, with which we Christians doe beleeue the
Gospell, proceedeth not from the outward teaching of
man, but from the inward instruction of the holy Ghost,
as I haue out of the same <hi>Austen</hi> already prooued. Yea, the
selfe same father declareth in the same chapter, that he
speaketh of himselfe as being a Manichee, not as being
a Christian. What (faith Saint <hi>Austen</hi>) wouldest thou say
to him, that should answere thee, I doe not beleeue it,
but for the authority of the Church? And this sense is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
because S. <hi>Austen</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth in the very same chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that the authoritie of the Gospel is aboue the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie

yoong as to old. In whom also yee are circumcised with
circumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made without hands, by putting off the body
of the flesh subiect to sinne, by the circumcision of Christ:
buried with him in baptisme, in whom yee are also risen
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14159:79"/>
againe through the faith of the operation of God, who
raised him vp from the dead. Thus saith Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> by
whose wordes we may learne sufficiently, that baptisme
did succeed to circumcision, for the same end, vse, and
purpose: <hi>viz.</hi> that by it we may, putting off the bodie of
sinfull flesh, be buried together with Christ, and rise again
with him through faith.</p>
                  <p>The third argument is drawne, from the practise of the
Church.<note place="margin">Mat. 28. v. 19.</note> For the Apostles of our Lord Iesus were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
to baptise all sorts of people withour excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Goe therefore, and teach all nations, baptising them
in the name of the father, and of the sonne, and of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost. Againe, we read in the historie Apostolical, that
the whole house of <hi>Lydia</hi> was baptised,<note place="margin">Act. 16. v. 15.</note> neither yong nor

                  <p>I denie the antecedent, because their faith and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is
this; to be borne of the faithfull, in the vnitie of the
Catholike Church. Againe though they haue not actuall
faith,<note place="margin">Mar. 9 v. 42.</note> yet haue they faith fundamentallie, and by inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In which sense our Lord Iesus doth reckon them
among the faithfull, when he saith in this manner; VVho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
shall offend one of these little ones that beleeue
in me, it is better for him if a milstone were hanged about
his neck, and he were cast into the sea. Infants therefore,
when they are baptized in the Church for faithfull, are
then deemed to beleeue after their manner. VVho, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they haue not faith in act, yet haue they the spirit,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:14159:79"/>
and vertue, or foundation of faith, by Gods operation in
them. Neither ought this thing to seeme strange vnto vs.
For, if the infants of the wicked ones haue infidelitie and
impietie, though not in act yet in inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by nature, as
writers graunt; then truly may it be said, that the infants
of the faithfull haue faith and pietie, though not in act,
yet in inclination by grace. For grace cannot be of lesse

(in popish sense) because it is both em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticall

prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t intend in God to proue the same effectually against

            <p>The Apostle telleth vs in plaine and very expresse
words, That the best liuers vpon earth are sinners. <hi>In multis
enim offendimus omnes.</hi> For we all offend in manie things. But
certes,<note place="margin">Iacob. 3. v. 2.</note> if it be true, as it is most true indeed, (for S. <hi>Iames</hi>
being inspired with the holy Ghost cannot lie) That the
holy Apostles committed many sinnes; then doubtlesse it
is not in euerie ones power, to keepe Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
neither will it helpe the papists to distinguish af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14159:81"/>
their wonted manner, of mortall and veniall sinnes.
For, besides that I haue proued alreadie in the sixt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
that euery sinne is mortall in it owne proper nature;
both the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifieth the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the law; and also the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which
signifieth a declining from the right way, doe eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie
conuince the same. For it can neuer be trulie
said; that hee performeth and keepeth the law, which
transgresseth the law or swarueth from the same. It is the
truth which S. <hi>Paul</hi> alledgeth out of the law;<note place="margin">Gal. 3. v. 10.</note> Cursed is
euerie one that abideth not in all things which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the book of the law, to doe them. It is also the truth,
which S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith;<note place="margin">lac. 2. v. 10.</note> That whosoeuer keepeth the whole
law, and yet faileth in one point, is become guiltie of all.
To which may be added innumerable texts, both of the
old and new testament, that the best liuers vpon earth
doe sinne, and transgresse Gods commaundements.
Holy <hi>Moses</hi> telleth vs in the first booke of his Pentatench,
That when God saw that the wickednes of man was great
on the earth,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. v. 5.</note> &amp; that all the imaginations of the thoughts
of his heart were only euill continually, then it repented
God that he had made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the earth. <hi>Iob</hi> telleth vs, That
God found no stedfastnes in his Saints;<note place="margin">Iob. 15. v. 15. &amp; 35. 5.</note> yea, he saith far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
That the heauens are not cleane in his sight. And
he addeth these wordes; How much more is man ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable
and filthie, which drinketh iniquitie like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The kingly Prophet saith, that in Gods sight, none
that liueth can be iustified.<note place="margin">Psal, 143. v. 2.</note> VVise <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, that no
man living is able truely to say,<note place="margin">Prou. 20. v. 9.</note> he is cleane from sinne.
The same wise man saith in like maner, that the iust man
sinneth many times.<note place="margin">Prou. 24. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Esay</hi> saith, that all our righteousnes
is as filthie clouts.<note place="margin">Esa. 64. 6</note> 
               <hi>Esdras</hi> saith, he was ashamed for his own
sinnes,<note place="margin">Esdr. 9. 6.</note> and for the sinnes of the people, because their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
was growne vp vnto heauen.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. v. 9. 10. 12. 19. 23.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth at
large, that all men are sinners, and that no man is able to
be iustified by his workes. All saith hee, both Iewes and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14159:81"/>
Gentiles are vnder sinne. There is none righteous, no not
one: they haue all gone out of the way; they haue all
beene made altogether vnprofitable: there is none that
doth good, no not one. Now we know, that whatsoeuer
the law saith, it saith to them which are vnder the law, that
euery mouth may be stopped, and all the world be subiect
to the iudgement of God. There is no difference, for all
hane sinned, and are depriued of the glory of God, and
are iustified freely by his grace, through the redemption
that is in Christ Iesus. Againe in another place, he hath
these words:<note place="margin">Rom. 10. v. 3.</note> For they being ignorant of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God, &amp; going about to stablish their owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
haue not submitted themselues to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God: the case is cleere and euident. For as the
Prophet saith,<note place="margin">Psal. 130. v. 3. 4.</note> If God should marke our iniquities, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vs after our deeds, none of vs were able to endure it.</p>

and all thy life, &amp; all thine vnderstanding, of whom thou

which may be vacant, and as it were giue place, to haue
fruition of any other thing.</p>
            <p>The same Saint <hi>Austen</hi> saith againe in another place;
That this commaundement of louing God with all our
heart, cannot be perfecty fulfilled of any man in this life:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14159:82"/>
These are his wordes;<note place="margin">August. de per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect iustit. ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioc. 16. col. 969. tom. 7.</note>

carnalis concupiscentiae, quod vel continendo froenetur, non omnimodo
ex tota anima diligitur Deus. Non enim caro sine anima concupiscit,
quamuis caro concupiscere dicatur, quia carn aliter anima concupiscit.
Tunc erit iustus sine vllo omnino peccato, quia nulla lex erit in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bris

ergo non praeciperetur homini ista perfectio, quamuis cam in hac vita
nemo habeat? Non enim rectè curritur, si quo currendum est nescia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
In which fulnesse of charitie that commaundement
shall bee fulfilled. Thou shalt loue thy Lord thy God,
with all thy heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy
mind. For whiles any part of carnall concupiscence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning,
which may be suppressed by containing, God
so long is not in euery respect loued with all the soule. For
the flesh coueteth not without the soule, albeit the flesh
be sayd to couet, because the soule coueteth carnally.
Then shall the iust bee without any sinne at all, because
there shall be no law in his members rebelling against the
law of his mind, but he shall loue God wholy with all his
heart, with all his soule, and with all his mind, which is the
first &amp; chiefest commandement. VVhy therefore should
not this perfection be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded vnto man, although no
man can haue it in this life? For they cannot run aright,
who know not whither they should run.</p>
            <p>Out of these words of this holy father, and great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
writer, I gather these worthy lessons: First, that by
Gods holy commaundement all men are bound to loue
God, with all their heart, with all their soule, and with all
their mind: Secondly, that whosoeuer suffereth any part
of his life to be vacant, and to haue fruition of any other
thing, cannot fulfill this precept of louing God: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that this precept of loue, cannot be perfectly kept in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14159:82"/>
this life: Fourthly, that originall concupiscence remaining
in the regenerat, is the hinderance and breach of this
commaundement. Fiftly: that this perfection of loue is
lawfully commaunded, albeit none liuing doth or can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vnto it. And consequently, that it is not possible to
any pure mortall man, perfectly to keepe Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aquinas</hi>
the Popes great doctor and canonised saint,
graunteth freely and affirmeth constantly, That the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of louing God with the whole heart, cannot be kept
perfectly in this life. These are his owne expresse words:
<hi>Respondeo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aquinat. 22. q. 44. art. 6. in corp.</note> 
               <hi>quod praceptum aliquod dupliciter potest impleri. Vno
modo perfectè, alio modo imperfectè. Sequitur; intendit Deus per hoc
praeceptum, vt homo Deo totaliter vniatur: quod fiet in patria, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
Deus erit omnia in omnibus, vt dicitur,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp; ideo
plenè &amp; perfectè in patria implebitur hoc praeceptum: In via autem
impletur, sed imperfectè.</hi> I answere, that the precept may be
fulfilled two wayes; one way perfectly, another many
vnperfectly. God intendeth by this precept, to haue man
wholy vnited to himselfe; which shall be effected in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
when God shall be all in all. And therefore this
precept shall be fulfilled perfectly and fully in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
but in the way it is fulfilled vnperfectly. (That is
to say, perfectly in heauen, which is called our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
and vnperfectly on earth, which is tearmed the
way.)</p>
            <p>Out of these golden wordes of the famous schoole-doctour
<hi>Aquinas,</hi> (whose doctrine two Popes haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
for authenticall) I obserue these points of great
importance. First, that God by commaunding all men
to loue him with their whole hearts, did intend to vnite
all men wholy vnto himselfe; so as no part of their loue
should be left vacant, to be bestowed otherwise. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that this precept of louing God as wee are bound,
can be kept perfectly in heauen onely. Thirdly, that it
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14159:83"/>
is not impossible in this life, to keepe Gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
in a godly sense and meaning; because we may
keepe them in some sort and measure, though not in that
high and perfect degree which the law requireth at our
handes. For our great popish doctour (marke well his
wordes) saith plainely and constantly; <hi>In via impletur pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum,
sed imperfectè.</hi> The precept is fulfilled in the way,
(or in this life) but vnperfecty. So that, when the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
triumphing before the victorie, cry out against vs
with open mouths, That we charge God with impietie,
affirming him to haue commaunded to man things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posible:
they may as well and with as much right and
reason, exclaime against their owne deere doctor <hi>Aquinas,</hi>
and consequently against their owne holy fathers the
Popes,<note place="margin">August. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus in epist. ad Pium 5.</note> 
               <hi>Vrbanus</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Innocentus</hi> the fift; who haue
commanded and strictly charged to receiue his doctrine
as sent from heauen, concerning both faith and maners.
For my selfe doe here teach the selfe some doctrine with
<hi>Aquinas,</hi> as his owne expresse wordes very flatly purport.
For my wonted manner is, to confute poperie by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of best approoued popish writers.</p>

               <hi>Quomodo ergo iubenda fuit, quae implenda nullo modo erat? Aut si
placet tibi magis de affestuali datum fuisse mandatum, non inde

by no meanes could be performed? or if thou rather
thinke, that the commaundement was giuen of affectuall
charitie, I will not contend with thee therein; so thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
wilt yeeld vnto me herein, That no man in this life is
able to keepe and performe the same. For who dareth
to challenge that to himselfe, which <hi>Paul</hi> confesseth hee
could neuer attaine vnto? neither for all that was the
commander ignorant, that the weight of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
did surpasse the power and reach of man; but he
deemed it a thing profitable for them, that hereby they
should be admonished of their insufficiencie, and might
know to what end of righteousnesse they ought with
their best indeuours to applie themselues. Therefore by
commaunding things impossible, he made not men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaricatours,
but humble; that euery mouth might bee
stopped, and all the world made subiect vnto God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by the workes of the law, no flesh can be iustified
in his sight. But after that we haue receiued the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
and thereby perceiue our owne want, we must
cry vp to heauen, and God will haue mercie on vs; and
then shall we know, that he hath saued vs, not for the
workes of righteousnesse which we haue done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his owne (free) mercy. Thus writeth their own
deere Abbot <hi>Bernardus:</hi> out of whose wordes, I obserue
many excellent documents. First, that God hath giuen
vs those commaundements, which we cannot possibly
keepe and performe. Secondly, that God knew right wel,
that it is not in our power to keepe his lawes. Thirdly, that
God commanded to vs impossible things, that we might
therby acknowledge our owne insufficiency, &amp; wholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon his fauor, help, &amp; mercy. Fourthly, that we might
hereby know, that our saluation proceedeth of mercie,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14159:84"/>
and not of the workes of righteousnesse which we haue
done, and wherein the papists seeke merit and iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So then, the doctrine which I now teach, is not my
doctrine onely, but the flat doctrnie of Saint <hi>Austen;</hi> yea,
and the selfe same doctrine which the best learned papists
haue taught before me.</p>
            <p>That it is not possible for man, to keepe Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements
perfectly in this life; no other proofe is
needfull, saue onely the Lords Prayer. For in it, the
best liuer vpon earth is taught, to aske forgiuenesse and
pardon for his sinnes: and doubtles where pardon must
be demaunded, there the law is not exactly obserued.
The vsuall practise of all papists,<note place="margin">Nota, quod ne veniale quidem peccaium potest in deum referri. Ergo auertit a fine vltimo. Ergo est peccatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mortale.</note> is consectarie hereunto.
For in their ordinarie and daiely masses, as also in their
quotidian auricular confessions, they confesse three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
times their most grieuous sinnes, in these wordes;
<hi>Mea culpa, mea culpa, me a maxima culpa.</hi> In which publique
daily confession, they must eitheir confesse, that they
deale hypocritically, dissemble damnably, and mocke
God most irreligiously; or els doubtles, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
keepe Gods commaundements, as they beare the
world in hand they do. Now it remaineth, that I answere
to some popish obiections, which the papists deeme and
repute insoluble.</p>

performe and keepe the law. For his whole scope and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

the Gentiles that they had the law, seeing they did
not keepe the same. As if he had said; if ye will be iustified
by the law, ye must performe and keepe the law, which ye
doe not. for not the hearers of the law, but the doers are
iust in Gods sight. I willinglie graunt, and will it not
denie; that if any of you papists can perfectly obserue

                  <p>I answere first, that hee is to bee detested as a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
that affirmeth God to haue commaunded any
thing vnto man, which was either impossible in it selfe
to be done, or to be done of man as man. I say (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
in it selfe) because otherwise, Christ himselfe
could not haue fulfilled the law: which to hold, is
flat blasphemie against the Sonne of God. I say (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to bee done of man, as man;) because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
the Protoplast <hi>Adam</hi> could not haue kept the
law: which to hold, is most absurd, and against all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and learned men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that he is to be detested as a blasphemer,
whosoeuer affirmeth, that any man in particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a true beleeuer, cannot keepe and fulfill Gods
commaundements; in him, of whose fulnesse we haue all
receiued,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 16.</note> and whose righteousnesse is ours, by his free gift

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that Gods commaundements may in
some measure (that is to say, imperfectly) bee kept
euen in this life, of all the regenerate. And this not
my answere, but euen that answere which the famous

as if it were an oracle from Heauen. To Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten</hi>
the same answere is very consonant, as both by the

there be any papists,<note place="margin">Omittatur haec clausula, meo iudicio.</note> whose appetites this answere can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

thing,<note place="margin">This is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma which no papists can auoyd.</note> VVhy infants not baptised before their death,
