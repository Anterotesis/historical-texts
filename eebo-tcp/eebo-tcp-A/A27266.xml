         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Malignant Party of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath for a long time conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in their wicked and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deſigns; inſomuch, that their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie is grown to ſuch a height, that they are not aſhamed to make their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions publikely known to the whole world, as may appear by this inſuing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>Upon the 4. day of this inſtant month of <hi>July,</hi> 1642. the Lord <hi>Strange</hi> came from <hi>Yorke,</hi> and approached neer the
<pb facs="tcp:59364:3"/>
Town of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Armed men, and comming neer the Town he ſent to the Inhabitants thereof to know their minds whether they would agree to the Propoſition which he had ſent them two or three dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the reſtoring of the <hi>Magazine</hi> which were in that Town to his own<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Cuſtody, threatning them, that if they would not, he would ſend ſuch a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that ſhould make them yeeld, and bring them to due ſubjection.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Inhabitants</hi> having received this Meſſage, they reſolved to ſend this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer unto him, which they did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, that for the <hi>Magazine</hi> which was in that Town, they would not reſtore it to him, it being the only ſafeguard and defence they had.</p>
            <p>And they likewiſe Declared, that if his Lordſhip did take any other courſe to ſeize upon it violently, they would loſe their deareſt lives in defence thereof, by reaſon the Country was in ſuch a great diſtraction and perplexity, that they did
<pb facs="tcp:59364:3"/>
not know how ſoon they might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt of all they had, if ſo be they had not Arms to defend themſelves withall. The Lord <hi>Strange</hi> having received this Anſwer, and hearing what their Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Intention were, hee was much perplexed in mind, drawing all his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together, he marched againſt the ſaid town of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and ſhot off 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Muskets againſt them, but the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> ſeeing that he were come, and that Hee were reſolved to take the <hi>Magazine</hi> away by force, underſtanding his full intention by the Meſſengers which came from him, they reſolved every man to fight it out.</p>
            <p>Wherupon each man ſtood upon His own guard, and about 9. of the clocke in the morning on the 5. day of this preſent month, the Lord <hi>Strange</hi> came with his forces againſt the town, and would have entred, but that they kept him out by force, but Captain <hi>Smith</hi> being in the Front, gave a ſierce ſiring againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Mancheſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>After they had ceaſed two or three houres, they began again, each Company ſtriving for the day, and after the ſpace of two hours, they ended the Battell with the Sun of the day, the Lord <hi>Strange</hi> withdrawing his forces about two miles from <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> having loſt as is iuſtly ſuppoſed <hi>27.</hi> men, of the other ſide, <hi>11.</hi> Captain <hi>Band</hi> is very well recovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain praiſed be God.</p>

            <p>This is the beginning of Civill Warre, being the firſt ſtroke that hath bin ſtruck, and the firſt Bullet that hath bin ſhot, but GOD knowes when the ending will be, or when the troubles of this Kingdome will grow to a period.</p>
