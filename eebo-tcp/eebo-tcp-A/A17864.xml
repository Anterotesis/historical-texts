            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T's a matter worthy asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, that not onely vulgar braines, but even the most eminent wits, should suffer themselues to be so easily wonne, by the out-sides of lies, to beare armes against the truth. Albeit the spirit of man, the more excellent a temper it is of, the more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and eager an appetite it hath after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the trut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: by the same instinct loathing ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and especially disdaining to be cheated. So
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7820:4"/>
that even the most artificiall flatterers, insteed of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moring it, would offend it, if it once conceiued it selfe to be but flattered: as on the contrary, if it once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly apprehended the truth, it would stoope to it, how harsh and bitter soever it were. So hard is it but that the compleat representation, the <hi>inside</hi> of a lye will offend vs, and that of the truth affect vs.</p>
            <p>But the cause of our mischiefe is the perversenesse of our passions, which oftentimes so over-heat, and distemper the heart, that out of it, as it were exhaling thick, and black vapours vpon the vnderstanding they either disturb our iudgements, or altogether dull our apprehensions. Neither deale they so well with vs as those piercing smoakes, which bereauing man of his bodily sight, yet leaue him still this vncomfortable priviledge, that as he seeth nothing, so he cannot bee gull'd by any lying apparitions. Whereas when a heart chafed with passion, hath dimmed, yea extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the light of the vnderstanding, yet that takes not from it a presumptuous conceit of its owne cleere sight, and reall comprehension of the truth. Whence it commeth to passe, that man compassed about with thick darknesse, confidently dreameth that he walketh in the Sunne shine, and is strongly conceited that he hath then fast hold of the truth, when he huggeth an absurd, ridiculous fable. This corruption is almost v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall, and like to a generall distemper of all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the body, it's dispersed into all the passages of mans life. In a word, it's the Epidemicall disease of our soules which maketh vs easily induced to beleeue all that for true which we desire should be so, as being
more
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7820:4"/>
sutable to our dispositions, and convenient for the accomplishment, and execution of our desires, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes. Vpon this we invent vnto our selues probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and readily entertaine such as are presented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, to make vs beleeue that matters are so as passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on willeth vs to conceiue them: as on the contrary that which we desire should be false, as thwarting our aymes, crossing and encumbring our enterprises by the like naturall flattery of our selues, we perswade our selues that it is false indeed, or suffer our selues to be easily so perswaded by another.</p>
            <p>The first veine of this corruption may be espied even in the infancy of man. Children are cheered, and delighted, if one tell them that the tale which pleaseth them is true, and they willingly beleeue it how strange, and fabulous soever it otherwise seeme vnto them: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwise they are vexed and discouraged, if one plainely tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it was fained only for pleasure; it will be a hard matter to stick this impression into them. So naturally familiar is the power which passion hath, to darken, and blindfold the vnderstanding.</p>
            <p>After the same manner whosoever loueth with a fit of passion, he will descry many shewes of arguments to encourage his affection, in the discourse of him who extolleth that vpon which he doteth. And as he desireth that that which he loueth shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d bee praise-worthy, beholding it through this clowd, he vieweth it in a shape and colour farre different from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Parents oft-times curb'd by civility from an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expression of their indiscreet affection, yet in themselues giue the lye to those who freely tell them
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7820:5"/>
the truth of their children: for it being a iust cause of extreame griefe vnto vs to be the parents of vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward children, so is it hardly beleeued by vs, so long as there remaineth any probability of the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. He who is desirous to enter into a law-suit will conceiue a pretious esteeme of weake, and frivolous counsell, which perswadeth him that his cause is good: contrariwise he will disesteeme, and bee much displeased with the solidereasons of a sage Counseller, who out of the goodnesse both of his conscience, and skill, certifieth him of the weaknesse of his cause, and disswadeth him from entring into law. All this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from this passion which entangleth his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and hindreth it from a steedy view of those cozening semblances, from an impartiall exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them, and from comparing of them with the truth. Even so some one sick of an ignominious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, against all other Physitians he will willingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue of him who shall iudge him to be sicke indeed, but of an honest disease. Imprinting according to his desire this false conceit into his minde, vnder the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscription of truth: for so a lye is never approued of, but masked with the looks of its opposite. Yea our owne passions varnish it over, or at least hinder vs from tearing of its vaile, for feare least we beholding it with a narrow eye, stripped of the borrowed face of truth, should be affrighted by its vglinesse.</p>

superiours. These respects are able to produce in vs at least this effect, to make vs wish that the religion of those to whom nature, and the civill lawes haue obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vs were the <hi>true.</hi> This desire afterward can it not stagger the iudgement: and this staggering can it not terminat it selfe in a firme resolution to hold our selues fast vnto it: and not to examine whether it be as sound as it is favourable? Because that comming to discerne its imperfections, our conscience will not suffer vs to be any longer at quiet, vntill we change it for a better, even vpon condition of running into inconveniences so cumbersome, and vnwelcome vnto the sense of our nature.</p>
            <p>So then, when the ambitious spirit of man percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it selfe taken vp already on the one side, by a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion propitious to his ambition, and invited on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side by such a one as bindeth him to renounce the honour, and embrace the infamy of the world, shall we doubt of his partiality in the choice? Is it not easie to iudge on which side he will turne the ballance? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely man cannot strip himselfe out of all affection of religion; in the same proportion he doth that, he vnmanneth himselfe, and is at best, but a monster of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in humane shape. Perforce then he is to make profession of some kinde of religion, the profession of irreligion being more infamous then that of a brutish, stupid sensuality. But amongst so many religions when he commeth to the choice of the <hi>True</hi> his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, his particular interests accompany him to the ballance, and there sway all. The truth how soundly soever propounded, how evidently soever manifested,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7820:9"/>
how powerfully soever vrged is not able to make the counterpoise. For this cause S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospell, and wishing the knowledge of it to King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> excepted his bonds: as knowing right well, what a stumbling block the bondes, and crosse of the Gospell are to Potentates.</p>
            <p>Wee are wont to excuse at least, if not to defend a wicked person if favourable, and beneficiall vnto vs, and wee thinke the cariage of a good man to be peeuish, froward, and cruell if hee oppose our ends, &amp; thwart our purposes. Iust so it is with our affection towards religion: if it fauoureth vs, and apply it selfe to our humours we are curious in inventing trickes to adorne it, and artificiall colours to beautifie it. If we doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, or are like to make profession of it vpon good advantagious hire, in this case probabilities are vnto vs so many convincing, &amp; irresistible demonstrations: the grosser and more palpable heresies in it are but pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mistakes: the horrible abuses, and enormities are but such slips as should be borne with in the spirit of meeknesse.

               </gap> the truth of it be so cleere, and evident, that the conscience remaines convinced with it, the soule satisfied, the minde resolued and content. This disquisition, this meditation will be of excellent vse in making way for the discerning in matter of Religion, of truth from errour, superstition from piety, of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse from that which is legitimate, custome from law. For it will furnish vs with proofes, not drawne from the circumstances of the accessory, and that which is meerely accidentall: but such as are grounded vpon the principall, and which result from the nature, &amp; essence of the thing it selfe. Proofes infallible, and inforcing a necessary conclusion, whereas the other either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not at all, or if they doe, the most the conclusion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7820:10"/>
can doe, is to make the cause for which the proofes were produced plausible, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>acious, the contrarie suspected, and odious, being nothing else (if we esteem of them as they are) but likely-hoods of truth, prettie conjectures. Now is it not well knowne that the most plausible, and gracious causes, are not alwaies of their ranke, which being not commended but by their own proper right, haue that for the only ground, &amp; reason not of the favour, but of the justice they demande? And those which by reason either of the ignorance, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of men are suspected, and hated, haue they not oft-times the lawes, and equity on their side? Certes the most pure, and (as I may say) the most innocent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie would be punishable, were it enough to make one guilty, to be thought so.</p>
            <p>But we may proceede farther, and affirme that the suspition of falsity, is a calamitie ordinary to truth. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an vncomely maske, their may be hid an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beauty. Should the diamond lose it's invincible solidity, or the inward fountaine of its bright, and sparkling luster if sometimes it be found so outwardly discoloured, that at the first view, it can hardly be knowne for a diamond?</p>
            <p>In the Courts of Iustice it's ordained that accusers should bring in their inditement of the largest, that the court may be fully informed concerning the accused parties: yet this is not called condemnation, but it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly presupposeth a suspition. Let then preiudices, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and pretences be imployed to the vttermost, to make a religion suspected, so that vpon them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more adoe the accusers ground not its condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7820:10"/>
so that they tarrie vpon tearmes of suspition vntill they proceede orderly to a larger enquiry, and a stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter examination, so that the question be not a whit spared, nor if it be possible, the most vigorous proofe. If a rich diamond suspected of bastardy had sence, it would call for the touchstone, and desire to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a triall. Truth also being suspected, reioiceth and presuming vpon victory, triumpheth already, if shee be put to a serious examination, and her last triall. The decree which imposeth this vpon her, is not against her, but for her, this disgraceth her not but helpeth her to the only meanes by which shee may redeeme her credit. This is that shee most earnestly desireth as bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a passage, and introduction to her glory. It is her affliction to be suspected, but she maketh not that her complaint, this is not the subiect of her grievances, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome hath sweetned this vnto her, and made it tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Her complaint and greife which she cannot so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disgest is that shee seeth her selfe condemned vpon surmises, her cause not being sifted to the bottome, where lieth the maine point of her defence, and where shee hath reserued all her strength. For other wise by reason of by matters in the forme of proceeding, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, appearances, coniectures, she would be quite lost, &amp; ofttimes borne downe by a lie. Is it not too well knowne that by such meanes the better causes are lost? That by such trickes bad causes almost commonly in corrupt times seeke and obtaine the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory?

One thing yet she affectionatly beggeth, that she may not be condemned vnheard. What can the lawes loose here where they haue absolute authority, if she be vouch safed a hearing? Shall not their power be with more credit increased, if they condemne her euen hauing heard her. But if they condemne her without hearing her, beside the hatred of manifest vniustice, they will incurre also the suspicion of a bad conscience, in that they would not heare that which hauing heard they could not haue condemned.</hi>

They auoid both the hearing of our sermons, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our writings: they neither reade, nor meditate vpon the holy scripture. The high esteeme which they haue both of the learning, and honestly of their Doctors, hath preuailed thus farre with them, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7820:11"/>
they haue chosen them for Iudges, in a cause wherein themselues are parties. Parties accused not of a pettie fault, but of a crime, a sacriledge, an impiety in causing the revolt of Israel. If this accusation be false it were an easie and effectuall course to silence it, if they would but lay open to the publick view the weaknes, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencie of the reasons. Why are they so affraid to heare it? why is it a kind of sacriledge amongst them to be busied in so serious, and so holy a meditation? Why is it made a shriving matter to haue but thought of it? Who made these ordinances? Who instituted this so wary a discipline? What was their plot in it? What benefit expect they from it? If the Pope be innocent, why made he this prohibition? Is it the part of innocency, or of guiltines to entreate, yea command that the accusation should not be heard? This manner of proceeding tendes it to iustifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or rather to auoid, and escape iudgement? doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he doth as good as openly confesse that he is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of it. If wee had vsed such a subtile methode in our proceedings, wee shoulde haue afforded iust mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of presumption against our selues, that wee went not that way to worke honestly, <hi>bona fide,</hi> but driuen to it by an ill conscience.</p>
            <p>It's true indeed that in their schooles, and writings they sometimes mention our accusation, but for that they ought the more to be suspected of it. For he who hindreth his accuser from being vnderstood, and taking the accusation out of his mouth, will propose it himselfe, secretly giueth vs leaue to presume, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> hee disguiseth it, that he may the more easily shift it off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:7820:12"/>It's also the common and continuall complaint of those of the Reformed Religion, that their accusation is neuer proposed but mangled, and counterfeit, that their faith is represented by its enemies, out of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall shape. That their Adversaries in their disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against them, doe but quarrell with their owne fictions, and combate with puppets of their owne making. That they represent some prints, and linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our doctrine, but not in their true decencie, and proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, like certaine looking-glasses which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting the visage mishapen, yet after a sort preserue something of the hue and complexion. So they hauing vnder taken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s they say to paint our deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties yet they will not suffer any one to looke vs in the face. What may be thought of the cunning, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of that Painter which would haue vs iudge of his picture without comparing it to the originall? They cite, and reade our bookes in the chaire, as the false accusers of Christ, with their cavilling sophistry, alleaged his words to a contrary sence. But if they deale fairely, and say no more then what is true, why giue they not their people leaue to looke, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at their leasure whether matters are so or no?

But the naturall lazinesse of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maketh this both excusable, &amp; plausible. For to referre the people to our writings seemeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, a token of assurance in their Doctour, this assurance, or rather boldnesse serueth them also
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7820:12"/>
for a note of conscionable dealing, and withall the prohibition of troubling themselues about this matter, easeth them of a labour. They are glad to heare our bookes cited, that they may not seeme so vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as to condemne vs vpon other mens words; they are as glad to be forbid to examine the citations, that they may be discharged of such a trouble. So the lazie merchant relyeth vpon his factour, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Councellor vpon his clarke, so long as the one looketh now and then to some accounts, the other to an extract of the processe, but carelesly, hand over head: and both of them say, the one of his factour, the other of his clerke, that they are sufficient, and conscionable men made both for their Masters profit, and ease, they willingly perswade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues so, that they may sleepe the quietlier.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow albeit these considerations might make the world doubt, whether we were the true Church or no, yet they should not haue made them to condemne vs. The Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus was surnamed the <hi>Nazarene,</hi> this very surname made <hi>Nathanael</hi> to doubt, whether he were the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias or no. <hi>Can any good come out of Nazareth</hi>?

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7820:28"/>
Church, could it be inferred from its diuision, that it was the false? Neither diuision then, nor vnion can be essentiall characters either of the true or false Church. But suppose these markes should bee infallible, what would the Church of Rome get by it? What should wee iudge of her during that long schisme? What may afford her an apology? perhaps a <hi>distinction,</hi> that the division at that time, was in respect of charity, not of faith, and doctrine. But how will this distinction of schisme in faith, and schisme in charity, heale vp the wound, if both of them be equally, pernicious, equally incompatible with the nature of the Church? The Donatists were not diuided from the Catholique Church in faith, at the first, for all that, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of as members cut off from her. Their schisme, indeede, at the length begate heresie; as an inflamed vlcer causeth a feuer. And may wee not avouch, that during the last schisme in the Romane Church, the same case hath happened, when the anti Popes were by one another accounted the forerunners of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christe: rhe followers of both sides reciprocally called by one another the members of Antichrist. What may here be replyed? perhaps, that in the Christian Church in the time of the Apostles, in the Romane Church since, heretickes and schismatickes were not of the true Church, but mingled with it: as darnell amongst wheat, which maketh no part of the wheat: as mutiners in an army which are not of the army. But what? make not they of the reformed religion the same reply when their discord is cast in their dish? confesse they not that their is indeede darnell in their wheat, but yet not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7820:29"/>
of it, that there are in their spirituall army turbulen-mutiners, but not of their army? Now if so soone af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter the publication of the Gospell by the Apostles, when that Iudaisme, and Paganisme were assaulted by such strong forces there sprang euen then schismes, and heresies like fogs at the rising of the sunne.

            <head>CHAP. XIIII. That their is no true vnity in the Church of Rome, and that in the reformed Church, there is no discord of importance.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt to consider this point neerer hand, there is no discord of moment amongst vs; no syncere vnion amongst them: but a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ruine their common aduersaries; as some Princes, which otherwise bare mutual grudges one against another, entertaine neuerthelesse a league against a common enemy. So Herod and Pilate agreed, in putting to death the Lord Iesus, the sauiour of the world.</p>
            <p>Surely it cannot be denied, but that in former ages, the dissentions in the Romish Church were very great. Their mutuall hatred was deadly, witnesse their schisme, witnesse also the great variety of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions amongst those doctours which themselues stile Catholique. who so will see proofe of this, let him only consult the writings of Cardinall Bellarmine, there he shall find diuersities, and contrarities of opinions amongst the Catholique doctours almost about euery point of religion.</p>
            <p>But the Pope being then busied about the establishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his Papall omnipotence his spirituall authority over the temporalty, yea his temporall authority ouer the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7820:30"/>
temporalty, and spiritualty together, tormented not himselfe with those disputes, not so much as to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his authority to appease them. For those schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiles at that time did not a whit preiudice his desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but rather helped them forward. So long as these doctors sharpned their subtilties against themselues, they let him alone in peace, they outvied one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in flattering of him, each side fearing lest he should incline to its opposite. This indifferencie was both acceptable to the disagreeing parties, and beneficiall to the Pope. There were as yet no strangers which might publish the shame of these doings, and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage themselues by these domesticke quarrells of their enemies: they spake therefore at that time freely, and boldly vented their opinions betweene themselues. But since that, the world is well changed, their affaires are no longer at this point. Now it was to be feared, least the discord of the seruants, should ruine the authority of the Master. For this it is, that he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ull it asleepe, that he may bend the entire for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his supports, against the stranger, and common adversary. He was now to looke to it, that they without tooke no advantage of this dissention, &amp; to take away the scandall of it from those that are within. This is that he hath done, but after a sorry manner, as hee could, tyrannically, and by meanes altogether shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Not by a resolution of their doubts, by stating of their questions, by a rationall decision of their contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies; but by his absolute authority imposing silence vpon the parties, by this trick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, smothering the evill, without medling with the root.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:7820:30"/>He that will be better informed concerning this, let him obserue that even at this day (for example) the true followers of Thomas yeeld not to Bellarmine, that their Angelicall Doctor concluded amisse, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>that the image of Christ, and the true Crosse are to be worshipped with the same adoration, that Christ himselfe.</hi> That the Sorbonists will not consent to the Jesuits, <hi>that the Pope should be aboue a Councell, that he may as well depose as excommunicate Kings, that a Tyrant may lawfully be put to death even by a private man.</hi> In the meane while these points are of such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, that if any of them be true, they vnavoidably damne the contrary.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellar. de imag. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 20.21.</note> If the opinion of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bee true, touching the adoration of images, that of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas is pure idolatrie: if the tenet of the Iesuits concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the authority of the Pope be receiuable, that of the Sorbonists is schismaticall and hereticall.</p>
            <p>What will be answered vs here? Doubtlesse that these opinions are but problematicall, and may on both sides indifferently be maintained, so long as the Church hath not giuen her determination of them. This hole indeed they vsually start out at, when for the diversity of opinions which are amongst them, they are pressed not to taxe that fault in others, which is so notorious in themselues, not to vrge those lawes vpon others which they meane to shift off themselues. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse their by-corner reacheth not farre, they cannot runne farre, if one briefly tell them, that the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Church is not effectiue, but declaratiue, that it makes not truth but directeth to it, it makes not heresie, but points it out. Even as the opinion of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7820:31"/>
Physitian makes the disease neither better, nor worse then it is, lesse doth it make it what it is. The diseased party then of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Physitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath decreed nothing, ceaseth not to be sicke and to dye, as well as those who by a true prognosticke were iudged to be in danger of death. Whether the iudgement then of the church be interposed or not, that which deserues to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned is condemnable of it selfe, and in the sequel, makes him that beleeueth it infallibly damnable.</p>
            <p>But let any man tell me, whether there may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined a more compleat and formall schisme, then that which we see in the protestation of the French church against the councell of <hi>Trent:</hi> Yes, they say, but this was but in certaine points. What matters that? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a Councell is a body, and expects either to be wholy receaued, or wholy reiected: not submitting it selfe to iudgement,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. Sledian. comment. l.</hi> 22.</note> that they to whom it speaketh by authority, should goe about to choose, and picke out some of its determinations. But requiring of all an absolute and vniversall obedience by reason of its authority, and the pretended presidence and guidance of the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>After all this, who will not be more astonished, to see that the Pope pronounceth not definitiue sentence vpon these differences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dispatcheth not these difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, determineth not these questions. Is it because he taketh delight, to foster and cherish discord amongst his ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erents? No, this is no time for it. He is so neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assaulted by those without, and so lustily incounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with, that he had need haue good entercourse, &amp; keepe good correspondency with those that are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7820:31"/>
within. Is it then because he fauoureth all sides equally? neither, this is more vnlikely then the other. He loueth his greatnesse to well, he is to iealous of his authority, too zealous for the adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his Papal omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy to beare no more affection to those who imploy their spirits to his bent, for his soueraignty, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to those who crosse it, &amp; skirmish with it. Is it not known, how these are esteemed of, in that they are tearmed <hi>Politikes,</hi> and haue not the name of Catholiques allowed them, but grudgingly. That which holdeth the Pope, from openly condemning some of them, is a feare by alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateing them to diminish his forces. He knoweth, that slippery things wrung to hard slide away the faster: that lines stretched too much snap in sunder.

It is then, a base slander which is cast vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs; that wee confesse our religion is new, that wee denie, which wee stifly affirme, that antiquity is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies on truths side.

New in outward shew, but really Christ and his doctrine, in antiquity surpassed the Pharises, and their leauen; Christianity was by many ages ancienter then Paganisme.

            <p>When one would knowe the antiquity of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of a Colledge, or a soceity, he repaireth no whither, but to the Charter of the foundation. The instrument of the foundation of the Church is the Scripture: if we offer to verifie our antiquity, if we doe verifie it by the date of this instrument: wee proceed ingeniously, and our conclusion is irresistible. Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cease then to reproach vs, that wee haue brought in a new doctrine, vnknowne in the times of the Apostles.

Let vs proue our religion to be true: and afterward let vs consider its antiquity: yea by this meanes wee shall haue proued it; for vertue is ancienter then vice, trueth then lyes, superstition is after religion as sicknesse after health. So wee are ready to verify both the antiquitie of our religion, by its trueth, and the truth of it by its anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie: beginning at the well-head, the times of the Patriarches, Prophets and Apostles; that the processe may be abridged, and speedily ended.</p>

            <p>At the time when the Lord came into the world: when God was manifested in the flesh, and many yeares before that time, what was the state, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward face of the Iewish Church?

            <p>If then any Church in these times after the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner become apostaticall, ought she to haue any more priuile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wee offer to lay open the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the Church of Rome, and the impoison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her teachers.

How many bastardly books haue beene fathered vpon ancient, and famous authors which they would haue reiected as monsters?

            <p>It is then an absurd cavill, to presse vs to shew that no change hath happened in the Church, by quoting the time, by assigning the place, by naming the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it. But we argue rationally, when wee proue
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7820:48"/>
by experience, that there hath beene a change: when we compare the doctrine of the Apostles with that which prevailed in the church afterwards, and cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifest the strange diversity, &amp; repugnancy there is betweene them. When we compare the state of the Romish Church, with that of the church in the first &amp; purest ages, and make the diversitie betweene them visible and palpable? Although, this kinde of proofe being not easie, but to those who haue skill in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, we stand not chiefly vpon it. And although it should faile vs, which yet it doth not, yet therefore there should not be any prescription, or exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Scripture. That which is come vp since, is new in respect of it, though ancient in respect of vs. But here the question is not about the Antiquity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. To which we adde, that if there should bee any thing found as ancient as the Scripture, being not con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formable vnto it, if its antiquity commend it, its falsity condemneth it so much the more, as it is the nature of evill to be the more pernicious, the more ancient it is.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7820:49"/>
is infinite in the invention of new trickes to perplexe a cause, they giue vs here another knot to vntie. God they say hath alwaies had a church on earth, this wee confesse: and that church hath from time to time had her Pastors, here we agree with them too. But then, say they, <hi>Where was your Church before Luther</hi>? What Pastours, what Doctours had it? See here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, how from the ignorance of man, they conclude the not being of the thing. Presuming that we cannot satisfie these demandes, and assuring themselues that we knowe not where our Church hath beene, and by whom it was guided, they take it for a matter already out of question, that therefore our Church was not at all. In which inference there is discovered a notable peece of wrangling; for it being presupposed (which yet is false, as it will appeare by and by) that we knewe not where our church was, and who haue beene our Pastours, since the alteration, and defection hapned in the church of Rome, might it in conscience hence bee concluded, that it was not therefore at all? Would this consequence be admitted, <hi>Thou knowest not such a thing, therefore it is not, or hath not beene.</hi> Yet this is the manner of their argumentation against vs. <hi>You knowe not, say they, where your Church was, nor who were her Pastours, therefore she was not at all.</hi> Vpon this it is, that they triumph and insult over vs, as if wee answering that we knowe not where our Church was, nor what Teachers it had, we should implicitly yeeld in the same answer, that she was not all, or if she were, that shee was destitute of Pastours.</p>
            <p>The like argument once deceaved the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:7820:49"/>

It may not here be replied, that at that time beside the hidden company, God had a flourishing Church in <hi>Iudah</hi>; in as much as it hath often fallen out, that the Church of <hi>Iudah</hi> equalled, yea exceeded <note n="b" place="margin">This hath beene shewed already. c. 18.</note> the church of <hi>Israel</hi> in corruption. So that <hi>then</hi> to behold the face of the church, as it was obvious to humane view, it could not be said, but all lay in desolation.

            <p>It's a necessary consequence, that that which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt if they will needs presse vs further yet, &amp; dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d where our Church was exta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before our separatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that shee was in Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in captivity vnder the kingdome of Antichrist. <hi rend="sup">a</hi> 
               <hi>Come out of Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my people,</hi> it is written in the Revelation: the people of God were then in Babylon, albeit they served not the Gods of Babylon; and which is more, their Teachers were the Teachers of Babylon. If this seeme strange to any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let him call to minde the estate of the Iewish church before our Saviour had begunne his preaching. Might it not at that time haue beene demanded, where the Church of God had beene before, and who were her Pastours? What could one answere to this query? Might it haue beene said, that the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and their adherents, the greater part of the people were the Church? alas they were nothing lesse: they were enemies of Christ and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>his Church the true answer then had beene to say, that the Church was a small number of righteous persons, which groaned vnder the burden of that spirituall tyranny, which lamented the desolation come
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7820:51"/>
vpon them by the corruption of the ancient doctrine and discipline. That the Doctors of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Church were the Pharises, of whom the Lord testified, that they sate in Moses chaire. Now we say the very same thing. That God before the reformation begun in the daies of our fore-fathers had a Church in the midst of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, in the midst of the Popish and Antichristian church: but that this church howsoeuer, was not the multitude of those who had received the <note n="b" place="margin">Apoc. 14 9.</note> marke of the Beast, and worshipped it, but the small <note n="c" place="margin">Apoc. 20.4.</note> company of those which misliked the Roman tyrannie and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, of whom, some from time to time being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, haue beene banished, others cruelly put to death, and slandered to haue beene guilty of horrible and hainous crimes, to make their persons odious to the people, &amp; their memories execrable to posterity: had not God by his providence, maugre the subtiltie and furie of calumnie, preserved the monuments of their faith and pietie even vnto this day. Such were the poore <hi>Waldenses</hi> constrained to wander to &amp; fro, such also were the exiled <hi>Albigenses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning that which is further demanded of vs, who were the Teachers of the Church during that time so full of confusion then when Babel raigned: We answer that questionlesse the holy Ghost alwaies instructed his Church <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 16.13.</note> inwardly, and that outwardly they were the very same which taught publikely, namely the Doctours of the Romish Church. But some man may here say, that by consequent they were true Teachers: to which we answer, that in some sort they were true: as the Scribes and Pharises were both true
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7820:52"/>
Teachers and seducers: true when they sitting in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> chaire, teaching his doctrine, the people receiued wholsome instruction by their Ministery: Seducers when they sitting in their owne chaire, teaching their owne traditions, their owne inventions, they <note n="e" place="margin">1. Cor. 1.18. 2. Cor. 2.15.</note> who p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rished, the people whom <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 11.17.</note> God had not chosen suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the poison which they tempered. Thus it was in the Iewish c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urch before the Lord had begunne to manifest himselfe to the world, otherwise God had not had a Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rch. This being true and evident, it should not be necessary sollicitously to insist vpon a farther answer to the demand, <hi>How this could bee?</hi> When there is an agreement about the thing, it is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity to inquire after the manner of it.</p>
            <p>Yet that we may leaue no scruple behinde, we will tell them after what manner God vseth false Teachers to instruct his people. The Scribes and Pharises pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the word of God, and read it amongst the Iewes before the comming of our Saviour, so much as was necessary to salvation: but they mingled their leaven with it, they thrust in their expositions, glosses, and traditions; the true Church sustained her selfe with the word, and reiected the leauen, the false glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her selfe with the leauen, and let passe the word. What strange matter is there in all this? The sheepe in their pasturage where there are some venomous hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bes, and others convenient for this nature, knowe well how to choose that which is proper for them, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o let alone that which is hurtfull: and shall the sheepe of Christ be vnfurnished of this discretion? They of whom it is said,<note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 10.4.5·</note> that they heare his voice, knowe it,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7820:52"/>
follow it, and fly from the hand of a stranger.</p>
            <p>Who then will wonder any longer, that before the great Reformation which the Lord hath begunne in these latter daies, as it were in the decrepite age of the world, the Church hauing truth propounded vnto her mixed with lyes, hath embraced the truth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected the lyes. Surely this truth hath sounded alwaies in the Church, it hath beene in the mouthes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Doctours, as the benediction was in the mouth of <hi>Balaam.</hi> This truth, <hi>that there is one God, Creatour, and preserver of all things, that the Father, Sonne, and Spirit, distinguished, but not divided, are this God: that the vniverse being created for man, and man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the image of God, he by his sinne hath drawne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himselfe anger and malediction. That the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nne of God hath taken our nature vpon him, and in it hath expiated our offences, that all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se which beleeue in him, which repent in syncerity obtaine mercy. That therefore we ought to loue so mercifull a God, to call vpon him, to giue him thankes.</hi> Thus farre the Scribes and Pharises were in <hi>Moses</hi> chaire, in the chaire of the Prophets, of Christ and his Apostles: thus farre they were to be harkned to. Thus farre the Church did heare them: But whilst they added to this truth their lyes, to this spirituall bread their leauen: then they sate in their owne chaire, they were to be heard no farther; then the true church stopt her eares against them, the false she listned to them.</p>
            <p>Thus we answer to this importunate questixon, <hi>How may this be</hi>?</p>
            <p>By the same reason also, we are not perplexed for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7820:53"/>
an answer, when they aske vs, what is become of our forefathers? This interrogatory proposed by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans to the first Christians, extorted from them an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer odious in the mouthes of children speaking of their parents, that God was marvellous in his waies, but in all likelihood they were damned. Thankes be to God, we are not driuen to such straites. In Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganisme there was nothing which might saue, no word of grace and mercy: in the doctrine published in the church of Rome, there was something to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> chosen, and they who picked it out carefully, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed it to their vse were saued. Why should wee doubt but that many thousands of our fathers did it? God hath knowne how to preserue a church to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the midst of the most horrible Apostacies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions, and desolations, happening vnder the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament since <hi>Malachie.</hi> Should his arme be shortned vnder the new? No, but <note n="h" place="margin">Mal. 3.6.</note>Eternall as he is, he is alwaies like himselfe.</p>
            <p>Now then let the importunate curiosity surcease those questions, framed only to distract the simple: <hi>Where was your Church? Where were your Pastours</hi>? Our church was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and her Teachers for want of better, were the Teachers of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Concerning that which they trouble vs farther with; why therefore we haue not imitated our forefathers exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, why we are come out of <hi>Babylon</hi> if they were saved in it? We will giue reasons for it hereafter<note n="i" place="margin">

            <head>CHAP. XXV. Of the true succession of the Church, what it is, that it dependeth not of succession, either naturall, or Politicke.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow because they mainely oppresse vs, with the preiudice, which they make against vs about <hi>Succession,</hi> which they say is of great moment and pretend moreover, that they haue it, and that we haue it not; that they haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued alwaies, that we are lately come in by the by, crossing their line of succession, let vs consider what strength this pretence for them, &amp; exception against vs may haue.</p>
            <p>Now that the ambiguitie of the word may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle vs, we must knowe what kinde of succession they meane. If it be a naturall succession, from father to sonne, from generation to generation: we say that the succession of the Church dependeth not of such a succession. It was, and is still the prerogatiue of the obstinate Iewes, that they are the successours of the <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 9.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Patriarches and Prophets, in respect of carnall and naturall generation, yet they are farre enough from being the true Church. They haue succeeded their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Ancestors in being men, this succession is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall. They haue not succeeded them in being faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, this succession is spirituall. If they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a politicke succession, in respect of the place and auctority, one succeeding another in order, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7820:54"/>
out interruption, we affirme, that the Church is not fastned to such a succession.</p>
            <p>How often doe the Prophets complaine, that the people of Israell, their kings, and Priestes were all gone out of the way and quite disordered by idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? albeit their kings were successours of good kings, and their Priests of good Priests. The Scribes and Pharises enioyed not they this kind of succession, which we call Politicke? Were they for all that the true Church? yea were they not <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 23.16.17.19.</note> seducers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, corruptors of the Law, sworne and deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Lord and his doctrine. Now against this truth so evident, it is impossible they should reply any thing, but it will be very friuolous. If it be said, that Malachie prophesieth, that <note n="c" place="margin">Mal. 2.7.</note> 
               <hi>the Priests lips shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue knowledge, that the people shall seeke the law at his mouth</hi>: wee answer that in that place, there is not contained a prediction of an after euent, but a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a duty. For indeede presently after the Prophet accuseth the Priest, <hi>for hauing gone out of the way, for causing the people to stumble.</hi> A manifest proofe that these words: <hi>the lips of the Priest shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue knewledge,</hi> haue no other emphasis the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that the lips of the Priest ought to preserue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. There is nothing more freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in Scripture, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to propose a duty in the future tense. Almost all the commandements of God runne in this forme. <hi>Thou shalt haue no other Gods before me, Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any graven image: Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine.</hi> &amp;c. He that should inferre vpon these formes of speech, that these Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements shall never bee broken, would hardly proue himselfe a reasonable creature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:7820:54"/>So the true succession of the Church, is not alwaies ioyned to this politicke succession which of it selfe without the succession of piety, is like to the succession of darknesse to light, of sicknesse to health, of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious aire to a wholesome, of barrennesse to frui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, of a Tyrant to a good Prince. That ought to be accounted the true succession, which is the su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cession of truth. <hi>To haue the same minde and opinion, is to haue succession of the same seate; not to haue the same opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is to be contrary in respect of the seat.

            <p>But what hath the Church of God then no certaine succession on earth? Yea the Lord hath said,<note n="g" place="margin">Esa. 6.13.</note> 
               <hi>that as the substance of the oke and Teyletree is in that which they cast, so the holie seed shall be her substance.</hi> But this succession is not tyed either to the naturall, or to the politicke succession, but it dependeth onely of the free disposition of him, <hi>who turneth riuers into a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and the water springs into drie ground A fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full land into barrennesse, for the wickednesse of them that dwell therein who turneth the wildernesse into a standing water: and drie ground into water springs.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt to come nearer to this matter, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church hath no kind of lawfull suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession; not that of gouernment and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, not that of rites and ceremonies, no not the succession of persons, least of all that of doctrine.</p>

All the Apostles in respect of the power of the keyes, and authority of the Apostleship were equall. If there were any difference betweene them, it was not in respect of their function. For <hi>it</hi> they were all <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 20.21.</note> ioynt tenants immediately to the supreme Apostle, the Prince of Apostles the Lord Iesus.

If the other Apostles in regard of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle-ship, haue not left themselues successours, how should he leaue his iurisdiction ouer them behind him? He had the gift of doeing miracles, to whom hath he particularly bequeathed this faculty? Can the Pope doe any miracles? He was the Apostle of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision: is the Pope the Apostle of the Iewes? These of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Apostles were extraordinary, like that of Moses, which was extinguished in his person, and did not outliue him.

vniversall Bishop, how happened it that at that time he was not vniversally obeyed by the Church? But it is no lesse remarkable, that the Popes which required this acknowledgement from the Councell, sent not men to expostulate with that assembly by authority, much lesse to excommunicate them vpon their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall as schismatickes: as also, that they alleaged no Scripture for the primacie, but onely the Canon of a Councell. Yet they vsed a strange boldnesse, in daring to falsifie the Canons of the Nicene Synode: A fraud yet of which their successours seeme to haue beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed. For in the decrees of the Nicene councell, as we haue received them from them, there is nothing extant which maketh for the primacy: but in them, the other Patriarches are rather equalised to the Bishop of Rome. Lastly, the harsh censure, with which this councell entertained the Pope, which neverthelesse was but provinciall, witnesseth it not, that at that time his authority was new? This being so, seeing that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession must drawe its line from the <hi>first,</hi> and that the first Romane Bishop had not that authority which he hath that now raigneth: it followeth, that there is no succession in the Pope-ship, and by consequent not in the whole state of the Papacie.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXVII. That the Cardinalls, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, Priests, Deacons, Monkes, and Nunnes of the Romish Church, are not of Apostolicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter we haue examined the succession of the supreame degree of authoritie in the church of Rome, come wee now to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour orders, and first to the Cardinalls. Who is so ignorant at this day, as to thinke, or so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent as to affirme, that their institution was in the times of the Apostles: or that their office, such as it is at this day, was in the church a good while after the age of the Apostles. The church increasing, there were created by the principall churches <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Polyd. Virg. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de inven. c.</hi> 19.</note> 
               <hi>Presbyteri Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales,</hi> that is to say, principall, or chiefe Elders. <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coni Cardinales,</hi> principall or chiefe Deacons. Their office was limited within the iurisdiction of the church where they were created; if at Rome, within the iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the church of Rome: if at Carthage, within the iurisdiction of the church of Carthage. Their charge was a superintendency over the common El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and common Deacons. The Cardinalls at this day, haue nothing of it but the name, their charge is quite of another nature, their institution is altogether different. They are now the electours of the Pope, which they were not anciently, except those of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7820:59"/>
of Rome as making a part of the Clergie. Now they take care of the affaires of all those churches, which are obedient to the Pope: anciently their charge was bounded within the circuit of one church alone. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it's true indeed, that by hypocrisie, they beare now adaies certaine titles, which seeme to assigne and to binde them to certaine parishes in Rome; to the end that they may retaine, if not the truth, yet the name of what they were anciently. Anciently their authority allowed them not any degree aboue Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: now they are, as it were, Princes of the bloud in the church, next to the triple crowne. So then the Cardinalls haue no succession deriued from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and by consequence neither the church of Rome, in respect of this part of her policy.</p>
            <p>As for the Patriarchs, there were none of them also in the times of the Apostles, nor a long time after. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we read in the decrees of the Nicene councell,<note n="b" place="margin">Can. 6.</note> that their iurisdiction is called <hi>an ancient custome,</hi> a tearme very different from <hi>an Apostolicall tradition.</hi> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Patriarchs were supreame, and equall to the Bishop of Rome in iurisdiction: he was but their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, albeit he were first in order. All the other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs haue long since renounced the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Roman church: the Pope also will no longer be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted a Patriarch. The Patriarchs which are at this day in the Romish church, are elected by the Pope, who hath no power to choose the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, seeing that at their first institution (which howsoever was not Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call) they were his fellowes in authoritie. So the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs of the Romish church haue no lawfull succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7820:59"/>
their beginning being not not from the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the times of the Apostles, yea not from the primitiue institution of Patriarches.</p>
            <p>The Romish Archbishops and Bishops at this day are nothing like those ancient, primitiue ones, I say not onely in respect of their manners, but also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their authority. Their authority at this day dependeth barely of the Pope: anciently, it was not subiected but to the Companie of Bishops; They might not be deposed, but by the common consent. They were not bound, to runne to Rome for their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; But they gaue their mutuall aduice, one to another, both in the election and deposition of a Bishop. Anciently they had no such authority ouer the magistrate, as they at this day vsurpe. It's worth the observation, to see how matters are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Their authority in respect of the Pope, is become slauish: in respect of the magistrate, tyrannicall This is their comfort, that they haue gotten on the one side, that which they haue lost on the other; so they would haue it, choosing rather to be subiect to one who is far from them, and whose greatnesse depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of theirs, then to many which are neare them, and whose lustre might obscure theirs. In regard of this order therefore, there is no succession in the Church of Rome.</p>
            <p>In the ancient Church there were Elders tearmed <hi>Presbyteri,</hi> from whence came the name of <hi>Prebsters,</hi> Priests, But the Priests of the Romish Church retaine nothing of them, but the name. Their Principall office was to <note n="c." place="margin">1. Tim. 1.89.</note> teach and instruct, where as the Romish
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7820:60"/>
Priests for the most part, are vnlearned idiots, and by consequence are no otherwise successours of those Primitiue ones, then darknesse, pouerty, sicknesse, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed light, wealth, health. Now this default, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excused, by alleaging that it is the fault of the persons; for so it is in Ecclesiasticall functions, that were the incapacity of the person is, the function cannot bee. I call here the incapacity, not simply the fault of the person, but the impossibility of discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the function. The woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which hath no milke, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a nurse, and if she take the office of one who hath vpon her, this cannot be in the qualitie of a nurse, shee cannot be a nurse beyond the name. So he which hath not in some sort the abilities requisite for reaching, he cannot possibly be a teacher; if he suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede one that could and did teach, he succeedeth him not as teacher, but onely in his name. Moreouer, the Principall part of the priests office consisteth now a dayes in mumbling of masse, and in being sacrificers, of which there is no mention in the Primitiue ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Priests.</p>
            <p>In the ancient Church there were <note n="d." place="margin">Act. 6.2.3.</note> Deacons; now there are Deacons, Archdeacons, subdeacons. But what haue these people of the ancient Deacons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the name?

In the flourishing time of the Apostles, there was nothing vsed in baptisme but water: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards there was added Chrisme and since that, salt &amp; spittle.

The channell &amp; pipe as it were of succession here grew faulty, and receaued in this stinking water running athwart. The disguise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they haue put vpon the holy supper, is yet more prodigious, they haue miserably and vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily mangled it: they haue cleft the seale of the King of heauen in the middle, and cast away the one halfe of it.

If the Wolfe hath made no spoile, if that man of sinne hath not taken possession of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, if the watchmen of Israel are not become gluttonous, and drowsie dogges, then our zeale hath beene without knowledge, yea not zeale, but madnes.

            <p>It is as truely, as commonly held, that the divine power is evidently manifested, where the strength of man, by reason of the meanesse of the person, could not come betweene.

               </gap>wned Doctors of the Church, as also in Switzerland, of whom others are descended: Here it is replyed, that if these men, had a true calling, then there is a true calling in their Church, and consequently, they shall be the true Church.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7820:68"/>
To this wee answere, that if there may be a true bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme without the true Church, why may there not be also a true vocation? Is the vocation lesse compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with the false Church then Baptisme, doubtlesse, where is baptisme, there is a power to administer it, and where this power is there is a calling. None can seale, vnlesse he be a Keeper of the seales, no man is so, vnlesse he be called to it. The seales of the Church are the sacraments, no man can seale in the Church, but he who hath commission for it. They acknowledge that our baptisme is effectuall, and rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate it not, what heretickes soever they account vs: wee pay them the like, when wee make that calling sufficient, which our predecessors receiued from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the right of which they haue bequeathed to posterity. To allow then our baptisme, what is it, but to confesse that wee may baptise? and what is this but to confesse that we haue an ordination, a calling to baptise?</p>
            <p>But their reply furnisheth vs with a stronger argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against themselues, when we presse them either to confesse, that they are not the true Church, or to yeeld that the calling receiued amongst them was lawfull. It cannot be concluded, that there where there is a true calling, there is also the true Church. Witnesse the ten tribes revolted, &amp; the Church of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, in the time of the Idolatrous Kings, in the time of our Sauiour Christ, in which the Levites alwaies had their calling, albeit they executed it amisse. But it will be good logicke to argue that where there is no calling, there is no true Church; witnesse the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Pagans and infidels, amongst whome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>here
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7820:69"/>
being true calling, there can bee no true Church. Here they are faine to take sanctuary in another shift, that the calling of the first reformers was nullified by the corruption, and alteration of that doctrine, for the preaching of which it was conferred vpon them. But see they not, that this reply giueth vs as much as wee desire? namely, that setting aside the question, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordination, they accuse vs for hauing altered, and corrupted the doctrine, of which accusation if we purge our selues, why perplexe they vs about out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordination; seeing they yeeld by their reply, that wee haue that, prouided, that wee haue not lost it, by corruption of doctrine: As also on our side, if wee iustifie not our doctrine, we will yeeld to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we haue no lawful calling amongst vs, &amp; that our prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors lost it, assoone as they brought a change into the Church. If they reply here, that the question is not whether our pastors at the beginning of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, altered the doctrine of the Gospell, but, whether they altered that of the Romish Church, for the preach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of which they were sent. To this wee answer, that the teachers in the Roman Church, are called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede to publish the doctrine of the same Church, but vnder the title of <hi>the Gospell of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> This doctrine then being not commended vnto them, but as supposed for Euangelicall, if they come to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer that it is not so, they are no longer bound to teach it, but to teach that doctrine which is correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to that title, vnder which the other was falsly commended vnto them.</p>
            <p>Surely if our doctrine be true, albeit wee had not the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7820:69"/>
ward calling, yet wee were to be heard: if it be false though wee had this externall mission, (as wee haue it) yet wee were not to be hearkned to, but abhorred. Why then come they not directly to this point? why beginne they not with our doctrine? can there bee a better argument against a Phisitian, then to proue that he is vnskilfull, or that he is an impoysoner? or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Lawier, then that he is ignorant and corrupt? or a better meanes to procure credit, to a Physitian, or authority to a Lawyer, then the proofe of their ability and fidelity? what doe degrees and licences, profit a a Phisitian or Lawyer, if they be both witlesse and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest? what doe their not taking of degrees in case of necessity disadvantage them, if otherwise they are skilfull and honest? So it is with the teachers in the Church, if they are of sufficiencie, they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, though they haue no testimoniall of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ordination, and if they haue not this sufficiency be it, that they make it appeare, that they were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly sent, yet this would be but a humane mission, an authority bestowed by ignorant man, which the Lord disalloweth, who sendeth no man whom he hath not endowed with gifts, necessary for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the charge in which he imployeth him. He is not like those <hi>hucksters</hi> of degrees, worthy to be banisht out of commonwealths, who for the most part license those, not whom desert, but whom bribes and by respects commend. So then where this diuine mission hath place, there is also suffciency: where suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is not found, wee may conclude that there is no diuine mission. Now if this sufficiency be found
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7820:70"/>
in our Teachers, if it be not found in the greater part of the Romish pastors; wee shall haue on our side an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and testimony of diuine ordination, they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of an humane; an vncertaine institution, because he that conferreth it, may be either so deceaued by his ignorance, blinded by his affection, or perverted by his malice and wickednesse in such a manner, that he may call him whom God calleth not, and put by him whom God calleth.</p>

be true ministers of the Church, it sufficeth to haue the truth, and purity of doctrine.

            <p>But wee easily wind our selues out of these difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by shewing, that our first reformers had the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling which was at that time ordinary: &amp; that therefore they gaue no example of selfe-intrusion into the Priests office, seeing themselues were priests; nor of vndertaking the execution of a charge without a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, seing they were priuiledged, and licenced to that function which they vndertooke, hauing beene called to be ministers; That no man may take occasion by their example, to be schismaticall, because schisme is a separation made without a lawfull cause, and the separation made by them was most iust, 1 for the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy,</hi> 2 <hi>heresie,</hi> 3 <hi>idolatry,</hi> 4 <hi>cruelty</hi> of the Romish Church. To the verifying of which, we beg that wee may be admitted, because the manifestation of this, is the onely proofe of our innocency. If the Church of Rome be not Apostaticall, hereticall, idolatrous, cruell, if wee make not this accusation good, let vs be condemned for schismatickes in separating from her; for heretickes, seing that our separation, hath beene grounded vpon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariety betweene our doctrine and theirs.</p>
            <p>But because in the former Chapter, wee haue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally reckoned vpon <hi>sufficiency,</hi> and <hi>occasion</hi> to exercise this <hi>sufficiency,</hi> so farre as to thinke these two

circumstances, the notes of divine calling and sending, Let vs suppose (that which was not) that the first which God employed in the worke of reformation, had not an humane, and outward ordination; let vs consider if that therefore, they indiscreetly vndertooke a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of such consequence, and whether the reasons a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

setleth his officers in their places, it sufficeth them for all patents, to be authorised by his commandement. So it is in the Church, God will haue every thing done in order, so farre as it may be obserued, but when confusion hath turned all vpside down, he forbiddeth not, to looke to the maine chance, though it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a methode, but commandeth, to sollicite the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall businesse, the more zealously, because there is lesse possibilitie of compassing it the ordinary way.

            <p>This then is not to giue example to tumultuous persons, or to open a gap to confusion: for he is truely tumultuous who contemneth order, not he who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde it: he who neglecteth it without any good motiue, not he who is constrained to passe over it. It supposeth then, not introduceth a confusion, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the exercise of a function to one who is capable of it, destitute of a humane calling, then when the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is impossible, the exercise of the function necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But whilest the ordinary formalities may bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, and the case is not so vrgent, as to exact an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary proceeding, it would be truely to open a gate to disorder. So it maketh no way for sedition in a citty, or mutinie in a campe, to permit that in case of treason, the citizen should rise against the subordinate Magistrate, the Souldier against his Captaine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other commission, then his owne private mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he cannot haue time for a more formall course.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7820:72"/>
Confusion is only when without this case this licence is permitted. So the first obiection drawne from the inconvenience, which the liberty of not observing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and formes of law when it is possible, draweth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, cannot disadvantage our predecessors, although they were not furnished with an outward calling, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were driuen to such plunges, as gaue them not leaue, safely, to follow the methode of law.</p>
            <p>For the affaires of the Church, being at that passe that heresie, and idolatrie bare the sway, that they which had the outward calling, not only exercised it abusiuely, but which is worse, hauing the authority to conferre it, they bestowed it not vpon those who would and could exercise it aright: keeping backe (as some times the Pharises did) the <hi>key of knowledge, shutting vp heaven gates, neither entring in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, nor suffering any other to get in:</hi> It was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then, albeit, they had no outward calling, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary case, to venture vpon an extraordinary proiect.

Not then one heresie, one sect, a part by it selfe, for there had been already in his time such fallings away, but a revolt which should ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread the face of the Church, so that she might hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be espyed through the thicknes of so horrid a cloud. Now who are those which were to oppose the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues against this revolt?

the fallen away, as the Levits amongst the tenne revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Tribes, or be it that they had it not. But they will say, perhaps we our selues haue made this revolt?

            <p>But there is not the same reason betweene the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours of the Christian Church, and the Priests of the Iewish Church.

            <head>CHAP: XXXV. That the example of Iudges in a Commonwealth is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, to proue, that outward ordination is alwaies necessary in the Church.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is to as little purpose, to produce the example of a Iudge in a Commonwealth, where no man what necessity soeuer there be, what ability soeuer he hath, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to thrust himselfe into that office, without being called to it.</p>
            <p>For besides that wee haue formerly shewed, that in the time of confusion, the King installeth Iudges himselfe, not binding them to passe through the vsuall formes, there is moreouer this difference to bee considered. The exercising of the office of a Iudge, deriueth it's force and efficacy, from his authority, whence it is that the determinations of Iudges, are not executed because they are iust, but because they are sentences, and determinations, bee it that they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7820:74"/>
are giuen iustly, by the wisdome and equity of the iudge, or vniustly by his ignorance, or corruptnesse But the vertue, and power of the Ministeriall function dependeth not of the authority of him that practiseth it; For if he be ignorant, or hereticall, one who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly slighteth his charge, and vilifieth his own fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, an <hi>hucster</hi> of Gods word (as the Apostle speaketh) his authority will not make, that when he hath proclaimed <hi>peace, peace,</hi> there shall be peace by &amp; by, as well as the sentences of Iudges how vniust or silly soeuer they are, faile not for all that to be put in execution. On the other side, if he who exerciseth the function be both of ability and fidelity, though he want the formality of an outward mission, it being impossible for him to obtaine it, and that which he doth without it being necessary, he faileth not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to instruct, exhort, and comfort.</p>
            <p>It fareth with him as with a Phisitian whose autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity giueth not his doses and recipes vertue to worke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in working to heale, but it is his skill &amp; honesty which direct him in choise of such prescriptions as are proper for the cure, which is the fruit of his labour, and the end he proposeth vnto himselfe. Otherwise, euery graduated Phisitian would without any more adoe cure the sicke, if it were the authority of the Doctor and not the vertue of his physicke, which did the cure, the choise and application of which depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of his knowledge, and fidelity. Whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe also, that if the Phisitian be skillfull, and carefull, the want of authority, in his person, hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not, the operation of his doses. From whence
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7820:74"/>
by comparison it may be obserued, why in a Iudge outward authority seemeth to be absolutely, and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply necessary, and why in a Pastour notwithstanding, that authority which dependeth of humane authority is not simply necessary: namely because whatsoeuer a Iudge doeth, he doth by that authority, which is lent him from a superiour, his abilities but enabling him to doe that aright, which his deriued authority, maketh him doe effectually: but in a Pastor, if he be sound in knowledge and conscience, the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his charge doth alwaies it's work, as effectually and compleatly, as if it were backed and graced by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority. It is the good phisick which healeth; the good milke which nourisheth, whether the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian hath taken his degrees or not, whether the nurse were approved of by a Phisitian or no; these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances as they bring nothing to the point, so they take nothing from it. Now the Gospell is a <hi>medicine</hi> (saith the prophet,) <hi>milke</hi> (saith the Apostle,) the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority then of him who applyeth this medicine, who giueth this milke to suck, or drinke, I say the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the commendation of men, can neither augment nor diminish their vertues·</p>
            <p>But some will say, that although that authority which dependeth of outward mission, be not alwaies requisite in pastours, yet at least, this defect ought to be supplied by miracles; &amp; here they call vpon vs for our miracles. But we aske them againe, where are the miracles of Iohn the Baptist, <note n="b" place="margin">Iohn. 10.41.</note> of whom it is written that he neuer did any miracles. As for that, after his conception, he leaped in his mothers wombe at the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7820:75"/>
presence of the blessed virgin Mary bearing in her wombe the Lord of the world, this was not done to authorise &amp; confirme his office in to the execution of which he entered a long time after. When Miracles are done to make some enterprise authentique, they are done either immediately before it, or else they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it while it selfe is in hand: they are done also publiquely, exposed to the view of all, that they may be the lesse suspected for impostures. But to answere precisely, wee say that when the Gospell was first to be planted, Miracles were very necessary, but that being finished, their necessity ceased. The Miracles wrought to authorize the Gospell anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, retaine still, at least amongst Christians, their vertue for that effect. If then wee prooue that wee propose the same Gospell, those ancient miracles are ours. Let them admit vs then to this proofe, in which if wee faile wee will confesse then, that they haue good reason to call vpon vs for miracles, yea &amp; more then this, that wee were not to be beleeued, though wee should doe very strange ones. For wee read, that the coming of Antechrist shall be with signes and wonders, but wee read not that they who oppose him shall worke miracles: so that if wee should make a trade of doing miracles, or as it were stage-shewes of them, this would make vs not more iustified, but suspected.</p>

This argument they frame, from that confession which they thinke they haue extorted from vs, let vs see then what trueth &amp; strength it may haue. First concerning <hi>Baptisme,</hi> they confesse that wee haue it, &amp; that it may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst heretiques: Antiquity beleeued it, &amp; wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it with antiquity. They reiterate not the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme administred by vs, wee reiterate not the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme administred by them: this priuiledge aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not vs against them, why should it aduantage them against vs? The true Circumcision was in the Church of the ten tribes, it was not for all that the true Church: an hereticall Church, shall haue Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, &amp; yet for all that not cease to be a false Church; not in respect of the Baptisme, but of her heresie: not in regard of that which is pure in her &amp; of the Lords institution, but in regard of her rebellion against the Lord, &amp; her owne impurity. That they haue Baptisme then wee graunt, but so wee say haue all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7820:76"/>
so the ten tribes after their apostacy receiued circumcision<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this exception then is friuolous, when they pretend, that wee confesse, that they haue the <hi>Baptisme,</hi> &amp; craftily dissemble that which wee adde, that they haue adulterated, &amp; depraued it as much as in them lies. Concerning the <hi>substance of Christian religion,</hi> wee confesse that it is also amongst them, but not pure, nor separated, not only from chaffe and straw, that is, from <hi>tolerable</hi> abuses, but neither from the venome and poison of false doctrine. Now it is no schisme to forsake a Church wherein is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of religion, if it be accompanied with supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, impiety and sacriledge, as gold and siluer in false coine are mingled with copper aad tinne.

That by faith wee must rely vpon the mercy of God, that by hope wee must expect the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of his promises, by charity loue him.</hi> This is indeed the substance of Christian religion which continueth so farre as the doctrine, and outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of it in the Church of Rome, in this respect wee haue not forsaken her, but these considerations make vs leaue her the title of a Church, to which soe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7820:77"/>
farre wee will alwaies be ioyned. But what is it that hath not beene added to corrupt this truth? what strange doctrines haue beene inuented to obscure it? What heresies? what Idolatry? what grosse sacriledge vent they vnder the protection of this Truth which they professe. These are the causes of our separation from them, if amongst them wee could haue enioyed the substance of true religion, without defiling vs with their superstition, wee had tarried with them still. But in these later times, after the Lord had lifted vp the Standart of his Gospell, and sounded with his Trumpet, <hi>Come out of Babilon my people,</hi> since the Angells haue flowne in the midst of heauen, carrying the euerlasting Gospell, and crying with a lowd voice, <hi>Blessed are they henceforth who dye in the Lord for they rest from their labours, and their works fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them</hi>: not to runne to this standard, not to obey this summons, not to goe whither wee heare this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiting voice call vs, in breife not to come out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,</hi> to goe vp to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is a rebellion against the liuing God, and a manifest contempt of his grace· Before <hi>this,</hi> the faithfull whom God had reserued to himselfe in the Captiuity of <hi>Babilon</hi> as a residue of the election of grace, though they were not separated from the <hi>superstitious,</hi> yet they were from their <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> their groanes, and sighs seruing in steed of protestations against it, because that the Lord had not yet opened them away by which to come out, nor as yet prepared them a place into which they might withdraw themselues. In a word the time preordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God, to put an end to that miserable captiuity
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7820:77"/>
was not yet come. As then it was not a sinne to tarry in Egypt before the Lord had sent Moses, or in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon before the seauenty yeares were expired; But God hauing sent Moses, hauing giuen liberty to his people to come out of Egypt, to come out of Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, to tarry there still had beene manifestly to testify a consent to the superstition of Egypt, and idolatry of Babilon: so before the Lord had sounded vs a loud summons with his trumpet, <hi>Come out of Babilon my people,</hi> he sustained and supported his people in the midst of Babilon; it was not at that time a <hi>sinne,</hi> but a <hi>Captiuity</hi> to abide in it. But for any to abide, or linger in it, after the publishing of this summons, it is a sure testimony, that they liue not in it vnwillingly, but with delight, and that, at least outwardly, they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of her sinnes, and so may iustly partake of her plagues. Now to demand, why God caused not this trumpet to be sounded sooner, is to dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; it were to bring back those ancient questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons propounded to the primitiue Christians, why the Lord Iesus had not brought the light of the Gospell sooner into the Church, to which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul clearely answereth, when he teacheth, that the fullnesse of time was not yet come. Why the Lord called not the Gentils sooner vnto his knowledge? to which the same Apostle answereth noe more, then that God hauing winked at the time of Ignorance, now war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth every man to repent. <note place="margin">Act. 17.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That which the shepheard doth to his sheepe, we are to doe to our selues: so long as there was presented vnto vs no other place of pasturage, then the Romane Church, for want of a better, wee were compelled to make vse of that.

them (saith he) shew an exceeding great patience, weare noe habit, goe naked, not couering any thing but their priuities: of so great perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they are impassible, testifying their patience by brand markes made by burning, by scarres made by launcing; some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eate, and drinke very seldome, others altogether forbeare both; some are so poore, that it's said, they thinke not at all on earthly matters: others neuer speake, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely auoid the company of men, least they should be vrged to speake, one of which sort I saw, not without admiration. Others haue the gifts of vision, others of reuelation: some haue raptures and supernaturall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies, or traunces. And by this meanes, there is no man amongst them which acquireth not some spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall skill and experience, and according to the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of this skill which they professe they are distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by their habits, and manner of being. If there be seene any amongst them wearing feathers on their heads, this noteth that they are giuen to meditations and reuelations. If any of them weare a patcht habit, this is a signe of their pouerty. They which were rings in their eares shew by this that they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missiue in spirit for the frequency of their raptures. If they weare chaines about their neckes and armes, this testifieth the violence and vehemence of their raptures: some of them liue sequestred, others associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: some liue solitary inforrests and desarts, others in citties vsing hospitality.</hi> Where may these be para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leld? who can produce any thing outwardly at least, &amp; in shew, so holie and austere amongst the Christian Monkes.</p>

               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:7820:79"/>What could they answer here, if the Turkes should goe to outbraue them after this fashion, vsing the same pretence against them, which they vse agianst vs? will they say, that this sanctitie is but hypocrisie, that this austerity is but savage barbarousnesse? (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it is no better.) But this is our defence against them, when they goe about to oppresse vs with the preiudice drawne from the consideration of their Monkish holinesse and austeritie. What great matter haue you (say wee) in this respect, which those bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous miscreants the Turkes haue not? nay, which is more what haue yea wherein you are not by them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded? will they answer vs heere, that they haue the Christian faith and Religion? But so wee shall haue vnmasked them of this preiudice, so wee shall force them to come to the triall of doctrine. The monkish life shall not iustifie the religion of the Romish Church, but they must goe quite backward, and iustifie the Monkish life by that religion from whence it borroweth its worth and dignity. So wee shall haue fetcht backe the disputation to its true point, to the examination of the truth; thrusting aside that <hi>by-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,</hi> which advantageth the cause of the Turkes, as mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But let vs draw a little nearer, to this seeming san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and austerity: let vs looke stedfastly vpon it, and see whether it were not painting which deluded our view, whil'st wee stood farther off? whether it be not a cunningly contriued outside, adorning an vgly and prodigious inside. First of all, what kind of pouerty may wee imagine this to be, where no man is in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7820:80"/>
trouble or anxiety to procure himselfe, wherewith to cloath himselfe against the cold, couer himselfe against the heat, replenish himselfe against hunger, to refresh himselfe against thirst, to physicke himselfe against sicknesse? may this be tearmed pouerty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mocking both God and man? If this be pouerty, what is abundance? Nay (say they) but these goods are possessed without appropriation: no man hath any thing to himselfe; be it so, doe they therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any whit the lesse. Enioy wee not all the sunne the glorious lamp of the world? enioy wee not light in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What? are wee therefore poore, destitute of light, or rich, abounding with it? what shall wee say of the aire, and water? are wee in penury of these elements, because wee haue not them enclosed vnto our selues, because wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy them in common? Monkish pouerty then is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall</hi> pouerty, but <hi>reall</hi> abundance.</p>
            <p>But their discipline is rigid and seuere! here wee call the world to witnesse, yea wee appeale vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in this point. Wee will not rub vp the ancient reproches of their gluttony, drunkennesse, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, adultery, sodomie. But let the world iudge, let them speake themselues, whether they obserue this austere discipline? whether those ruddie cheekes, those white fleshie hands, those liuely sparkling eyes, that spritefull vigor of the whole body, testifie a rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous maceratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; taming of the flesh, or whether that iollie plight be not rather an effect of ease, mirth, good cheere, and a compleat entertainment of nature? Yet (forsooth) we must beleeue, that they (<hi>poore

hearts</hi>) fast extreamely, that they lash themselues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully, that they lye vpon the bare, cold, hard ground, that they grate their skinnes with sackcloth. And questionlesse some few of them doe that, which they all professe to doe: But what a great peece of worke is it, if custome at first allaies, at length quite steales away the sense of these miseries. There is an excellent discourse to this purpose, &amp; well worth the observation in the worke which Chrysostome hath left <hi>de sacerdotio,</hi>

            <p>Surely, so it is. Those who are of a more tender and crasie constitution, faint vnder these <hi>austerities,</hi> and either lose their liues amongst them, or else retire out of them by a dispensation: those of a stronger, and and more solide, tough complexion, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goe through stitch with them, and make them tolerable, but in the end find them not onely easie,

but which is more delightsome. It's a matter to bee wondred at, that no man bestowes an admiration vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the patience of the galley slaues, which is so <hi>great</hi> that they sing in the midst of their greuious toyle, <hi>so voluntary</hi> that they oftimes refuse their libertie, and chuse to tarry in the gallies: whereas to see a lazy fellow well couered, to shew his naked feete vpon condition of warming them when he listeth, all are amazed, as if this were some extraordinary exploit quiet surpassing humane strength. Wee daily see poore, drudging laborours toile, and sweat, and with painefull sighes keepe time as it were to their worke: wee see them with a greedy, glad appetite deuoure course bread, nourishing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with such victual's as wee would hardly vouch safe to touch: in a word, wee see them in appearance even to kill themselues with irkesome labour; yet no man won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at it, no man pitties them, because wee all know, that custome hath dulled and blunted in them the sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e &amp; apprehension of wearisomenesse and paine. What then doe wee wonder at? What extraordinary matter is there to be obserued, in the patience of the Monkes, that they must needes be so much admired? Is it because from their labour, their ariseth no profit or commodity to their neighbour? Whereas by the paines of drudging laborours, and toyling mariners, the life of man is comforted, the society of men is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and maintained? What then? shall wee admire a labour in vaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an vnprofitable, fruitlesse toyle, and disesteeme that, which is not onely profitable but also necessary. But by their austerity, they testifie their
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7820:81"/>
patience, very likely; why doe they not till the earth then? why row they not in the galleys? is not there an ample subiect enough for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to shew their patience, and to doe some seruice to the world beside into the bargaine, were it but in putting themselues into the place of many poore slaues whose naturall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties make their seruitude insupportable? Or if that be too much, haue they not a fit opportunity to tame the flesh, in the Vineyards of the next neighbours to their Couents, in the fields at haruest time, at the presse in time of vintage, by this meanes both to ease the poore day-laborers, and to make some recompence for those almes which they get so easily by begging? This would be both to subdue the flesh, and profit the world both together. That other discipline so much talked of, may be iustly suspected, because it hath no regard to the profit of another. He who may with the same paines, tame his flesh, and serue his country is vngratefull, and vncharitable, if being able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this course, he neglecteth it. But the truth is, that they refuse not this kind of exercise, but onely because it is lesse pleasant then their owne.</p>

from it when they list? Why this (I trow) is the Monkes case to. Or is it because they are forced to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that hard kind of life, whereas the Monkes bound themselues to it with vowes voluntarily made. Surely there is no difference betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet, in this respect. Despairing discontents, melancholicke dumps, the feare of parents, the hard dealing of kindred, the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of youth, the desire of avoiding some disgrace, or trouble which is like to come vpon vs if we tarry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the world, are vsually the first motiues, and which giue the first impressions to them who aspire to the Monkish life. When these considerations haue once staggered vs, and set vs a wavering, it is an easie matter afterwards to perswade our selues, that that course of life to which we are now addicted (bee it what it will) is the most compendious path to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the ready way to Paradise. But after that men are once entred into it, and haue engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in it, then some come to discouer the vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their choice, they befoole themselues at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, perceiving those places to be but vncouth pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons within, which while they beheld them without, seemed princely palaces. But now it is too late; they are fast enough in the stockes, and fetters, bolts, barres, double gates, the Goaler and Keepers take away all hope of getting out. So the fishes which tosse &amp; tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble within the nets, seeme to play and sport to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which behold them without. But the desire of being partakes of that sport, hauing once allured them in, they quickly perceiue what is become of them.</p>

               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:7820:82"/>But some man will say, if it be so, how commeth it to passe, that we heare none of them complaine, that we perceiue not any of these votaries, by sighs and moanes, to discouer their repentance and dislike of their profession. Surely it is, because no man proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his owne folly, but every one is most carefull to hide it, especially when it is remedilesse. He who hath beene vnfortunately married, will not discover the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which he findeth in his marriage, if hee can possibly cover them, because it cannot bee done without some shame and disgrace. Discontents of this kinde, doe not evaporate by exposing them to the winde. To this sort of vnfortunate weights, there remaines no comfort, but only to procure their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a reputation of not being.

Let vs see how true this is; what should we thinke of those heauie, blockish spirits thrust into a Monastery by their kindred, because of their vnfitnesse for any thing else, that they might not serue for a reproach to the family of which they are descended: is it likely these creatures would bee more respected not being Monkes? What should we thinke of those poore fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, which if they were out of the Covent, would hardly finde wherewith to sustaine nature, vnlesse they got it by their fingers ends at some base occupation?

Lastly, what should we thinke of those more sublimated wits, and soaring spirits amongst them, to whom the Monastery is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of a Galerie through which they may walke to a Bishopricke, thence climbe to a Cardinalship, and thence ofttimes iump into the Papall throne? Would these haue fared better out of the Monastery? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose all them hit not this marke, could they haue ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med better at it out of the Couent? It was a Pope who before he came to this dignity, vsed out of his austeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a net insteed of a bed, and now seeing the world to wonder at the change which he had made of his net bed into a fether bed, answered, that <hi>he had caught his

            <p>The glory, and applause which <hi>Monsieur du Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chage</hi> hath gotten by his Monasticke profession, haue they not equalled all the honour which he could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from Martiall feats?

The praise also of this humilitie is not of men, but from God, who seeth it in secret and rewardeth it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly. Let it be proued vnto vs then, that the Monks contemne honour, and we will beleeue that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the world. It is not to tread the world vnder foot, not to plead at barre, not to sit in the chaire of state, not to beare armes, not to serue ones King and country, to liue in idlenesse according to the precepts of Epicurus: but not sollicitously to ayme at, not to affe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t that honour which is wont to accompany all these professions.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7820:84"/>
which other men purchase with so much sweat and anxiety.

Yea are they not <hi>all ministring spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heires of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Are they not busie for the preservation of men?

To pray to God, and to serue the world, are these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which cannot stand together? The Patriarchs, Prophets, &amp; Apostles did not they pray? And yet did they not labour day and night for the setting forward of the salvation of men?

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7820:85"/>
of this profession, we shall perceiue it to be quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to true pietie, that it dishonoureth &amp; turneth it vpside downe: and lastly, that the issue of it is to make a man a <hi>theefe,</hi> a <hi>whoremonger,</hi> a <hi>proud Pharisee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First of all, <hi>theft</hi> is manifest and notorious in it. For the profession of Monkes bindeth them not to giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to another, it hindreth the sonne from suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring the father, the daughter from relieuing the necessities of the mother, the rich from possessing that with which they might comfort the poore, the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from taking care of the weale-publike; the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant man from defending his countrie, the lawes, and religion by his valour, yea it hindereth the Divine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preaching: for if some amongst them doe preach, it is not as they are Monkes; That license was anciently granted them in the forme of a dispensation.

But the Monkes

by their vowes quite disenable themselues for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of these offices. Some ancient lawes puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed certaine cowards, which that they might not be pressed for the warre, got their thumbs cut off, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for hauing vsed an inhumane cruelty towards them selues, but also for hauing cosened the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of its due. They then make themselues culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble after the same manner, who wittingly depriue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of those meanes, by which they might giue a helping hand for the reliefe of the common necessities of mans life. We are not placed in this life, neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide we in this world for our selues only, but for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also, every man for his neighbour. It is the law of nature, it's the law of God, it's the precept of the Gospell, <hi>that we should doe good to all, and especially to those of the houshold of faith.</hi> He then who purposely maketh himselfe vnprofitable, willingly violateth this law, shewing himselfe vnnaturall, rebellious against God, full of selfe-loue, seeking that which is his owne, and not the Lord Iesus, any farther then the lips and outward profession.</p>
            <p>But which is yet more intolerable, they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues not only vnprofitable, but also burdensome; they liue vpon other mens labours, they depriue those who are poore indeed of their reliefe, intercepting that which might and ought to be giuen them. They think it a more blessed thing to receiue, then to giue quite contrary to the iudgement of our Saviour. They la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not, and yet they thinke themselues worthie to liue and be maintained, notwithstanding the speech of the Apostle, <hi>he which worketh not, let him not eat.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:7820:86"/>They say that their prayers are their taskes, &amp; their oraisons their businesse. But S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Austin</hi> in his booke <hi>de opere Monach:</hi> where he hath taken vpon him to proue that every Monke which liues vpon almes and gifts is guiltie of theft, hath amply refuted these flim-flamms: shewing that the spirituall service of God, doth not hinder vs <hi>from,</hi> but incourage vs <hi>to</hi> labour. The Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans account him not a true Monke, who is chargeable to others. The Abyssin Monkes follow the same law. And indeed though the Monkish profession be anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent enough in the Church, yet the idlenesse of Monks, and their begging is but new. In S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Austens</hi> time some beganne in fauour of them to alleage the example of the birds of the fields, of whom the Lord saith that they neither sow nor reap.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug. de oper. Monach. c.</hi> 26.</note> But that good father an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth them as they deserued, telling them that hee was of opinion that they might goe as the birds doe, to feed themselues in the fields, without bringing any thing home with them, and that it would bee good if they had wings, that they might be affrighted away like stares [birds] &amp; not be apprehended as theeues.</p>
            <p>Concerning the second point, the Monkish life doth not quench, but nourish, doth not cast water but oyle vpon the fire of concupiscence. An honest liberty of marrying, when one will, if a man be not altogether gracelesse, easily spends and exhales this passion, and suffereth it not to breake out into flames; whereas the constraint by vow, taketh away all hopes of vent, and shutteth it vp within vs. There is no man lesse troubled with hunger, then he who hopes that he may eat whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he pleaseth, he who despaireth of it, betaketh himselfe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7820:86"/>
to his owne flesh, and as the Prophet speaketh, eateth even his owne arme. Now this is not spoken with a purpose to discouer the secrets of the Couent, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue a secret glaunce at that which all the world knoweth of it.</p>
            <p>But what? Can their fastings, and scourgings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them no remedy? Yes if they would in due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion fast continually, if they would fast simply and absolutely; otherwise for him which hath not the gift of continence to fast by starts, and lash himselfe by fits, this is but to stirre his disease insteed of remouing it, and to anger his sore, insteed of healing it? There are diseases which are nourished by gentle, lenitiue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. The <hi>anodins</hi> (such medicines as cast the sicke into a sleep) take away the paine for a time: but they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kill the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out right, or else the paine returneth with the greater violence, as if it had gone backward for a time, that it might come forward with a doubled furie.

and disturbance to him, who hath the gift that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul had, to wit, the gift of continence: so the single life serueth but for an encumbrance and temptation, the danger of which is vnavoidable, and deadly, to him who hath not receiued the gift of containing himselfe. Wee worthily esteeme of the single life of those whome God calleth to it, but wee say that no man is called vnto it, who is forced to burne in it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore then (say they) see wee not this single life more common amongst you? Heere wee could tell them, that they should dispute against our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, not against our manners; that faults in manners ought not to be thrust vpon the doctrine, if the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine condemneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; that our doctrine approueth not their doeings, who being able to containe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are married, vnlesse they are driuen vnto it by some other vrgent necessity. But wee will answere directly, that the gift continence being rare wee are not to wonder if the single life which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth this gift be lesse frequent, but rather to admire the wisdome of the Apostle, who hauing set before vs the conueniences of a single life and the inconueniences of mariage, professeth that it is not to <hi>ensnare</hi> vs. Now if wee are not fitly qualified for a single life, it is vndoubtedly to ensnare our selues, if wee chuse rather to burne in a single life, then to <hi>quench</hi> the fire by marriage.

               </gap> children, by the cares of the world, from sealing the Gospell with his blood? They might all haue liued, and many of them might haue liued in all outward content, either for honours or pleasures, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this, they preferred death before life, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before pleasures, the ignominy &amp; shame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the honour and applause of the world. Let our enemies be our Iudges, is not such a kind of death more admirable then the single life of Monkes? is it not a sure token of a more magnanimous spirit, of a more feruent zeale, of a more fixed hope, of a more vehement loue, of a more liuely faith, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the single life of these Votaries; vnchast for the most part, and chast onely by constraint. But let us returne to our purpose. As the Monkish life tends to make him who addicteth himselfe to it, a <hi>theefe</hi> and a <hi>whoremonger,</hi> vnlesse he hath receiued the gift requisite for a single life: so in the third place, it is a thing which puffeth a man vp with a wonderfull presumption of himselfe. I know the Monkes make great profession of humility, but how can he be humble who thinketh himselfe able, who vndertaketh to merite, and beleeueth that he doth merite? True humility is for a man to thinke himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

these Monkish Saints, beleeue that they doe workes of supererogation, and that they merit for others also. What pride is this, or what blasphemie? God himselfe commandeth vs to loue him with all our heart, with all our mind, with all our strength: They make profession of doing a great deale more then he commandeth vs.</p>
            <p>In what <hi>mood</hi> soeuer God speaketh, it is <hi>impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi> after what fashion soever he speaketh, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but command: see in the meane time the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous pride of these Monkes: There are (say they) some counsells which God giueth, to obey which man is not bound vnlesse himselfe please, his owne vow alone bindeth him to obedience. Who can in conscience thinke thus of the Counsells of God without a proud exaltation of himselfe against him? was this the ayme of the Lord? is this the fruit of his familiar mildnesse? when he commands in counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and counsells in commanding, deales he so courteously with vs to the end that man should mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him for his companion? that he should miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue his commandements, and allow them onely the <hi>faint emphasis</hi> of counsells which a friend giues to a friend without any strongertie of obseruing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The entreaties of our superiours are commandes, if wee either speake, or thinke of them otherwise, wee cease in effect to acknowledge them for our Superiours, we proudly exalt our selues against them. And what may wee then thinke of these professors of humility, who allow not God that in matter of religion, which they owe to men in matter of ciuility. Questionlesse this

proueth them not onely proud, but also both sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious and blasphemous persons.</p>
            <p>These things being so, how commeth it to passe, that such grosse impiety should serue for a pretence to iustify that religion, of the which it maketh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
