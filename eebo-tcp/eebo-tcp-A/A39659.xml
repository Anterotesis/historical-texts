         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Many great men enclose their

is laid in their own conceits,

If the Building emulate the Skies, yet
sin being in the bottom, all will
totter.</p>
            <p>'Tis a fond vanity, to think of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
a destiny that can controll the
Stars, and endure the assaults of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
(as they love to speak) whilst
Providence is not engaged for them,
no not so much as by a bare acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> It is not the vast bulk of
an Estate, nor the best humane securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the World, but the vigilant care
<pb facs="tcp:52858:3"/>
of Divine Providence, that guards
both It, and its Owners from the
stroke of ruine. 'Tis the fear of God
within us, and the Providence of God
round about us, which make the firm
and solid basis of all sanctified and
durable prosperity. It is beyond all
debate, that there is a Providence of
God alwayes enfolding those in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
arms, that bear his Image. The
Impress of that Image upon you, and
the Embraces of those Arms about
you, will advance you higher, and
secure you better, than your Noble
Birth or Estate could ever do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> Providence hath molded
you, <hi>√® melJori luto,</hi> made you both the
Offspring and Head of an Illustrious
Family, planted you in a rich and
pleasant Soyl, caused many Noble
Branches to spring from you, drawn
your life even unto old age, through
the delights and honours of this
world. And now that you have tried
<pb facs="tcp:52858:4"/>
all those things that make the fairest
pretensions to happiness; what have
you found in all these painted beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and false glozing excellencies
which have successively courted you?
Which of them all can you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
self-desirable? Which can you
call <hi>objectum par amori?</hi> What is it to
have the flesh indulged, sense grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
fancy tickled? What have you
found in meats and drinks, in stately
Houses and pleasant Gardens; in Gold
and Silver, in Honour and Applause
to match the Appetite of your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
Soul? Surely <hi>(My Lord)</hi> to turn
from them all with a generous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
as one that knows where to find
better entertainment; is much more
<hi>Noble,</hi> than wholly to immerse, and
lose our Spirits in those sensual fuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as many do, alas, too many in
our dayes!</p>
            <p>We are fallen into the dregs of

entire and devoted servant of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
It was once the wish of a good
man, <hi>optarem id me esse Deo, quod est mihimanus
mea.</hi> This is the most Noble
and Divine life that can be, to live
and act in this world upon Eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.
To look upon our selves and
<pb facs="tcp:52858:5"/>
what we have, as things devoted to
God; not to be content that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
should serve it self of us, (for
so it doth even of those things which
understand nothing of it) but to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
wherein we may serve Providence,
and be instrumental in its hand for
the good of many; this is to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Honourable; <hi>quo magis quis Deo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit,
eo evadit nobilJor, clarJor, divinJor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How much God hath honoured
you in this respect, the World will
understand better, when your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
shall be gathered to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and sleep in the dust, then he
that praiseth, cannot be suspected of
flattery; nor he that is praised, be
moved with vain glory: But the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of God, is infinitely better
than the most glorious Name among
men, before, or after death.</p>
            <p>And as it is most <hi>honourable</hi> to <hi>serve,</hi>
so you will find it most comfortable
to <hi>observe</hi> the wayes of God in his
<pb facs="tcp:52858:5"/>
Providence. To compose our selves
to think of the <hi>Conduct of Providence</hi>
through all the <hi>Stages</hi> of life we have
hitherto passed. To note the results
of its profound Wisdom, the Effects
of its tender Care, the distinguishing
fruits of its special Bounty: To mark
how Providences have gone along
step by step with the Promises, and
both with us, till they have now
brought us near to our Everlasting
Rest, Oh how delectable! how trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
are such Meditations as
these!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> It is the design of this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual,</hi>
to assert the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of
Providence against the <hi>Atheism</hi> of the
times; and to display the Wisdom
and care of the Providence of God in
all the Concerns of that people who
are really his. 'Tis probable, if your
Lordship will stoop to such a vulgar
composure, somewhat may occurr
of a grateful relish to your pious
<pb facs="tcp:52858:6"/>
mind. I confess, It is not accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated,
either in exactness of method,
or elegancy of style, to gratifie the
curious; nor yet is it destitute of what
may please and profit the truly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
            <p>Should I here recite the pleasures
and advantages resulting from an
humble and heedful eying of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Providence, it would look
more like a <hi>Book</hi> in an <hi>Epistle,</hi> than an
<hi>Epistle</hi> in a <hi>Book.</hi> One taste of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
sense will satisfie you better, than
all the accurate descriptions and high
<hi>EncomJums</hi> that the most elegant Pen
can bestow upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> It is not that eminent sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that some persons retain (in civil
respects) above the vulgar, that will
enable them to penetrate the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and relish the sweetness of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
better than others; (for
doubtless many that live immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon Providence for daily bread,
<pb facs="tcp:52858:6"/>
do thereby gain a nearer acquaintance
with it, than those, whose outward
enjoyments flow to them in a more
plentiful and stated course) but those
that excel in grace and experience,
those that walk and converse with
God in all his dispensations towards
them; these are the persons who are
most fully and immediately capable
of these high pleasures of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are two wayes whereby
the blessed God condescends to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
himself to men, His <hi>Word,</hi>
and his <hi>Works.</hi> Of the written
Word we must say, No words like
these were ever written since the beginning of
Time, which can (as one speaks) take life and
root in the Soul, yea, doth it as really as the seed
doth in the ground: and are fitted to be engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
and naturalized there, so as no coalition in
nature can be more real than this, <hi>James</hi> 1. 21.
This is the most transcendent and glorious <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dJum</hi>
of manifestation; <hi>God hath magnifJed
his word above all his name,</hi> Psal. 138. 2.</p>
            <p>However, the manifestations of God by his
Works, whether of <hi>CreatJon</hi> or <hi>Providence</hi> have
their value, and glory: but the prime glory
<pb facs="tcp:52858:8"/>
and excellency of his <hi>ProvidentJal works</hi> consists
in this, that they are the very fulfillings and
real accomplishments of his written word. By
a wise and heedful attendance hereunto, we
might learn that excellent Art, which is (not
unfitly) called by some <hi>ScJentJa architectonica,</hi>
an Art to clear the Mysterious occurrences of
Providence, by reducing them to the written
word, and <hi>there</hi> lodge them as <hi>Effects</hi> in their
proper <hi>Causes.</hi> And doubtless, this is one of
the rarest essayes men could pursue against
<hi>Atheism,</hi> to shew, not only how Providences
concurr in a most obvious tendency to confirm
this great Conclusion, <hi>Thy word is Truth;</hi> but
how it sometimes extorts also the confession of a
<hi>God,</hi> and the truth of his <hi>Word,</hi> from those
very tongues which have boldly denyed it.

observation, <q>When the <hi>GrecJan</hi> Forces hotly
pursued us, (saith he) and we must needs
venture over the great water <hi>Strymon,</hi> then
frozen; but beginning to thaw; when a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

eyes I then saw many of those <hi>Gallants</hi> whom
I had heard before so boldly maintain, <hi>there</hi>
was <hi>no God,</hi> every one upon their knees, with
eyes and hands lifted up, begging hard for
help and mercy, and entreating that the Ice
might hold till they got over.</q> Many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
seals hath Providence forced the very
<pb facs="tcp:52858:8"/>
Enemies of God to set to his Truths, which
greatly tends to our confirmation therein; but
especially, to see how the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi>
of God do enlighten each other; and how
the Scriptures contain all those Events, both
great and small, which are disposed by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in their seasons: And how not only the
Promises of the Word, are in the general faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
fulfilled to the Church in all her Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Distresses; but in particular to every
member of it; they being all furnished by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
with multitudes of Experiences to this
use and end. O how useful are such observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions!</p>
            <p>And as the profit and use, so the delight and
pleasure resulting from the observations of
Providence, is exceeding great. It will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
be a part of our entertainment in <hi>Heaven,</hi>
to view with transporting delight, how the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
and methods were laid to bring us thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and what will be a part of our blessedness
in <hi>Heaven,</hi> may well be allowed to have a prime
ingrediency into our <hi>Heaven</hi> upon Earth<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> To
search for pleasure among the due Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Providence, is to search for water in the
Ocean: for Providence doth not only, ultimately
design to bring you to Heaven, but (as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
thereunto) to bring (by this means)
much of Heaven into your souls in the way
thither.</p>
            <p>How great a pleasure is it to discern how the
<pb facs="tcp:52858:9"/>
most wise God is providentially steering all to the
Port of his own Praise, and his peoples Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
whilst the whole world is busily employed
in managing the Sails, and tugging at the Oars,
with a quite opposite design and purpose? To
see how they <hi>promote</hi> his design by <hi>opposing</hi> it,
and <hi>fulfil</hi> his will by <hi>resisting</hi> it, <hi>enlarge</hi> his
Church by <hi>scattering</hi> it, and make their rest
to come the more sweet to their souls, by make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their condition so restless in the world. This
is pleasant to observe in general: But to record
and note its particular designs upon our selves;
with what profound wisdom, infinite tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and incessant vigilancy it hath managed
all that concerns us from first to last, is ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and transporting.</p>
            <p>O what an History might we compile of our
own Experiences, whilst with a melting heart
me trace the footsteps of Providence all along
the way it hath led us to this day; and set our
Remarques upon its more eminent performances
for us, in the several Stages of our Life!</p>
            <p>Here it <hi>prevented,</hi> and there it <hi>delivered:</hi>
Here it <hi>directed,</hi> and there it <hi>corrected.</hi> In
this it <hi>grJeved,</hi> and in that it <hi>relJeved.</hi> Here
was the <hi>Poison,</hi> and there the <hi>Antidote.</hi> This
Providence <hi>raised</hi> a dismal Cloud, and that
<hi>dispelled</hi> it again. This <hi>straitned,</hi> and that
<hi>enlarged.</hi> Here a <hi>want,</hi> and there a <hi>supply.</hi>
This Relation withered, and that <hi>springing</hi> up
in its room. Words cannot express the high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb facs="tcp:52858:9"/>
and gratifications, a gracious heart may
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ind in such employment as this.</p>
            <p>O what a world of rarities are to be found in
Providence! The blind heedless world makes
nothing of them: they cannot find <hi>one sweet
bit,</hi> where a gracious soul would make <hi>a rich
feast. Plutarch</hi> relates very exactly, how
<hi>Timoleon</hi> was miraculously delivered from the
conspiracy of two Murderers, by their meeting
in the very nick of time a certain person, who
to revenge the death of his Father, killed one of
them, just as they were ready to give <hi>Timoleon</hi>
the fatal blow, though he knew nothing of the
business, and so <hi>Timoleon</hi> escaped the danger.
And what did this wonderful work of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
think you, yield the Relator? Why, though
he were one of the most learned and ingenious
among the <hi>Heathen Sages;</hi> yet all he made of
it, was only this, <hi>The Spectators</hi> (saith he)
<hi>wondered greatly at the Artifice and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
which Fortune uses.</hi> This is all he
could see in it. Had a spiritual and wise Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
had the <hi>dissecting</hi> and <hi>Anatomizing</hi> of
such a work of Providence, what glory would it
have yielded to God! What comfort and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to the Soul! The <hi>Bee</hi> makes a sweeter
meal upon one single flower, than the Ox doth
upon the whole Meadow, where thousands of
them grow.</p>
            <p>O Reader, if thy heart be spiritual and well
stockt with experience, if thou hast recorded the
<pb facs="tcp:52858:10"/>
wayes of Providence towards thee, and wilt but
allow thy self time to reflect upon them; what
a life of pleasure maist thou live! What an
Heaven upon Earth doth this way lead thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to!
I will not here tell thee, what I have met
in this path, lest it should seem to savour of
too much Vanity; <hi>non est religJo ubi omnJa
patent.</hi> There are some delights and enjoyments
in the Christian life, which are and must be
enclosed. But Try it thy self, Taste and
See, and thou wilt need no other inducement;
thine own Experi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>nce will be the most powerful
Oratory to perswade thee to the study and search
of Providence.</p>
            <p>Histories are usually read with delight: when
once the fancy is catcht, a man knows not how
to disengage himself from it. I am greatly
mistaken, if the History of our own lives, if it
were well drawn up, and distinctly perused,
would not be the pleasantest History that ever
we read in our lives.</p>
            <p>The ensuing Treatise is an Essay to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
in which thou wilt find some remarques set
upon Providence, in its passage through the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Stages of our life. But Reader, thou only
art able to compile the History of Providence for
thy self, because the <hi>memorJals</hi> that furnish it,
are only in thine own hands. However, here thou
maist find a pattern, and general Rules to direct
thee in that great and difficult work, which is
the very end, and design of this <hi>Manual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52858:10"/>
I have not had much regard to the dress, and
ornament in which this Discourse is to go
abroad, for I am debtor both to the strong and
weak, the wise and foolish: and in all my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
I have not found, that ever God hath
made much use of laboured periods, Rhetorical
flowers, and Elegancies to improve the power of
Religion in the world: Yea, I have observed,
how Providence hath sometimes rebuked good
men, when upon other Subjects they have too
much affected those pedantick fooleries in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
from them its usual aids, and exposing
them to shame; and much more may it do so,
when it self is the Subject.</p>
            <p>Reader, if thy stomach be nice and squeasie,
and nothing will relish with thee, but what is
spruce and elegant, there are store of such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posures
in the world, upon which thou maist even
surfeit thy curious fancy: mean time there will
be found some that will bless God for what thou
despisest, and make many a sweet meal upon
what thou loathest.</p>
            <p>I will add no more, but my hearty prayers that
Providence will direct this Treatise to such
hands, in such seasons, and so bless and prosper
its design, that God may have glory, thou maist
have benefit, and my self comfort in the success
thereof, who am</p>

<hi>The Lord most high is terrible; he

in this distress, are very considerable.</p>
            <p>(1.) He pleads his reliance upon God, as an
Argument to move mercy. <hi>Be merciful to me, O
God, be merciful unto me, for my soul trusteth in thee;
yea in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge,
until these calamitJes be overpast,</hi> v. 1. This his
trust and dependance on God, though it be not
Argumentative in respect of the dignity of the
<hi>Act;</hi> yet it is so in respect, both of the nature of
the <hi>Object,</hi> a compassionate God, who will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
any that take shelter under his wings; and
in respect of the <hi>Promise,</hi> whereby protection is
assured to them that fly to him for sanctuary, Isa.
26. 3. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind
is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee.</hi> Thus
he encourages himself from the consideration of
that God, to whom he betakes himself.</p>
            <p>(2.) He pleads former experiences of his help
in past distresses, as an Argument encouraging
hope under the present strait, ver. 2. <hi>I will cry
unto God most high, unto God that performeth all
things for me.</hi>

Crying unto God, is an expression that doth not

Truth, that all the results and issues of Providence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52858:14"/>
are profitable and beneficial to the Saints. But the
Supplement in our Translation well receives the
importance of the place, <hi>Who performeth all things.</hi>
And it involves the most strict and proper notion
of <hi>Providence,</hi> which is nothing else but the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of God's gracious purposes, and promises
to his people. And therefore <hi>Vatablus</hi> and <hi>Muis</hi>
supply and fill up the room which the conciseness
of the Original leaves, with <hi>quae promisit,</hi> I will cry
unto God most high, unto God that performeth
<hi>the things which he hath promised.</hi> Payment is the
performance of promises. Grace makes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and Providence the payment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Piscator</hi> fills it with <hi>benignitatem &amp; misericordJam
suam,</hi> unto God that performeth <hi>his kindness and
mercy.</hi> But still it supposes the mercy performed,
to be contained in the promise. Mercy is sweet
in the promise, and much more so in the <hi>providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tJal
performance</hi> of it to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CastalJo</hi>'s Supplement comes nearer to ours, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
mearum Transactorem,</hi> I will cry unto God most
high, unto God <hi>the Transactor of my affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our <hi>English,</hi> making out the sense by an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
particle, is most fully agreeable to the scope
of the Text. For it cannot but be a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to his faith, that God had transacted <hi>all
things,</hi> or performed <hi>all things</hi> for him; this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>
that never failed him in any of the straits
that ever he met with (and his life was a life of
many straits) he might well hope it would not
now fail him, though this were an extraordinary
and matchless one.</p>
            <p>Bring we then our thoughts a little closer to this

               <p>Heathens generally denied Providence, and no

                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> the Prince of Heathen <hi>Philosophers,</hi> could
not by the utmost search of reason, find out the

from Eternity. The <hi>Epicureans</hi> did in a sort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
a God, but yet denied a Providence, and
wholly excluded him from any interest or concern

and one of them speaks it out in broad language.
<hi>Itaque imposuistis cervicibus nostris sempiternum domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
quem dJes &amp; noctes timeremus. Quis enim non
timeat omnJa providentem, &amp; cogitantem, &amp; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvertentem,
&amp; omnJa ad se pertinere putantem,
curJosum &amp; plenum negotii Deum? Vell. apud Cicer. de
Natura Deorum.</hi> They foresaw, that the conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a Providence, would impose an eternal
yoak upon their necks, by making them accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for all they did to an higher Tribunal: and
that they must necessarily pass the time of their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing
here in fear, whilst all their thoughts, words
and wayes were strictly noted and recorded, in
order to an account by an All-seeing and righteous
God: and therefore laboured to perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that was not, which they had no mind
should be. But these Atheistical and foolish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
fall flat before the undeniable evidence of
this so great and clear a truth. Now,</p>
               <p>My business here, is not so much to deal with
professed <hi>Atheists,</hi> who deny the existence of
God; and consequently deride all evidences
brought from Scripture, of the extraordinary
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52858:18"/>
events, that fall out in favour of that people that
are called His: but rather to convince those, that
professedly own all this; yet never having tasted
Religion by experience, suspect at least, that all
these things which we call <hi>specJal providences</hi> to the
Saints, are but <hi>natural events,</hi> or meer <hi>contingencJes:</hi>
and thus whilst they profess to own a God, and
a Providence, (which profession is but the effect
of their education) they do in the mean time live
like <hi>Atheists;</hi> and both think and act, as if there
were no such things: and really I doubt, this is the
case of the far greatest part of the men of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
               <p>But if it were indeed so, that the affairs of the
World in general, and more especially those of
the Saints, were not conducted by divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
but (as they would perswade us) by the
steady course of natural causes: beside which, if
at any time we observe any event to fall out, it's
meerly casual and contingent, or that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from some hidden and secret cause in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
If this indeed were so, let them that are
tempted to believe it, rationally satisfie the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

                  <p>How comes it to pass, that so many signal mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and deliverances have befallen the people of
God, above the power, and against the course of
natural causes: to make way for which, there hath
been a sensible suspension and stop put to the
course of nature? It is most evident, that no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
effect can exceed the power of its natural
cause. Nothing can give to another, more than it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52858:19"/>
hath in it self. And it is as clear, that whatsoever
acts naturally, acts necessarily: Fire burns <hi>adultimum
sui posse</hi> to the uttermost of its power: Waters over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow,
and drown all that they can. Lions and other
rapacious and cruel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>easts, especially when hungry,
tear and devour their prey: And for <hi>Arbitrary</hi>
and rational Agents, they also act according to the
principles and Laws of their natures. A wicked
man when his heart is fully set in him, and his will
stands in a full bent of resolution, will certainly
(if he have power in his hand, and opportunity
to execute his conceived mischief) give it vent,
and perpetrate the wicked devices of his heart:
for having once conceived mischief, and <hi>travailing
in pain with it</hi> (according to the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
he must <hi>bring it forth,</hi> as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 7. 14.
But if any of these inanimate, brutal, or rational
agents, when there is no natural obstacle or <hi>remora,</hi>
have their power suspended, and that when the
effect is near the birth, and the design at the very
article of execution, so that though they would,
yet cannot hurt; to what think you is this to be
assigned and referred? Yet so it hath often been
seen, where Gods interest hath been immediately
concerned in the danger and evil of the event.

coincidencies of Providence, confederating and
agreeing as it were, to meet and unite themselves
to bring about the good of Gods Chosen. There is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52858:20"/>
a like face of things shewing it self in divers
places at that time, when any work for the good
of the Church is come upon the stage of the
world. As when the <hi>MessJah</hi> the capital mercy
came to the <hi>Temple,</hi> then <hi>Simeo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> were
brought thither by Providence, as witnesses to it.
So in Reformation work, when the Images were
pulled down in <hi>Holland,</hi> one and the same spirit of
zeal possessed them in every <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Town,</hi> that
the work was done in a night. He that heedfully
reads the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Joseph</hi>'s advancement to be
the Lord of <hi>Egypt,</hi> may number in that story
twelve remarkable acts or steps of Providence,
by which he ascended to that honour and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
if but one of them had failed, in all likelihood
the Event had done so too: but every one sell
in its order, exactly keeping its own time and
place. So in the Churches deliverance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rom the
plot of <hi>Haman,</hi> we find no less than seven acts
of Providence concurring strangely to produce
it, as if they had all met by appointment and
consent, to break that snare for them: one thing
so aptly suiting with, and making way for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that every heedful observer must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
this cannot be the effect of <hi>casualty,</hi> but
wise <hi>counsel.</hi> Even as in viewing the accurate

                  <p>We find by manifold instances, that there
certainly are strong combinations, and predis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of persons and things, to bring about
some issue and design for the benefit of the
Church, which themselves never thought of:
they hold no intelligence, communicate not
their counsels to each other, yet meet together,
and work together as if they did: which is, as if
ten men should all meet together at one place,
and in one hour, about one and the same busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and that without any fore-appointment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
themselves; can any question, but such a
meeting of means and instruments is certainly,
though secretly over-ruled by some Wise invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Agent?</p>

have been blessed with success to the Church in

Doth God miraculously suspend the power of
natural Causes, as in the <hi>first Demand</hi> was ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
Why, this is no accidental thing, but
what harmonizeth with the word, Isa. 4. 3. 2.

                  <p>Are the most apt and powerful means em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed

                  <p>See you at any time a rub of Providence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the course of good men from falling into
evil, or wicked men from committing evil; how
loudly do such Providences proclaim the truth
and certainty of the Scriptures, which tell us,
<hi>That the way of man is not in himself, neither is it
in him that walks to direct his steps,</hi> Jer. 10. 23. and
that in Prov. 16. 9. <hi>A mans heart deviseth his way,

                  </p>
                  <p>Do you see adequate retributions made to

Why, when you see all the kindness and love
they have shown the Saints returned with an

Overplus into their bosoms; how is it possible,
but you must see the accomplishment of these
Scriptures in such Providences? Isa. 32. 8. 2 Cor.
9. 6. <hi>The liberal soul deviseth liberal things, and
by liberal things he shall stand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when you see the evils men have done, or
intended to do to the Lords people, recoiling
upon themselves; he is perfectly blind, that sees

Our own <hi>Speed,</hi> in his History of <hi>Britain,</hi> tells us,
that <hi>Richard</hi> the First besieged a Castle with his
Army, they offered to surrender, if he would
save their lives; he refuses, and threatens to
hang them all: upon this an <hi>Arbalaster</hi> charged
his Bow with a square Arrow, making first his
prayer to God, that he would direct the shot,
and deliver the Innocent from oppression; it
struck the <hi>King</hi> himself, whereof he dyed, and
they were delivered. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s servant prayed
for success; and see how it was answered, <hi>Gen.
24. 45. Peter</hi> was cast into prison, and prayer
was made for him by the Church, and see the
event, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 5, 6, 7, 12. I could easily add
to these, the wonderful examples of the return
of prayers which was observed in <hi>Luther,</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Winter</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and many more; but I
judge it needless, because most Christians have
a stock of experience of their own, and are well
assured, that many of the Providences that befal
them are, and can be no other than the return
of their prayers.</p>
                  <p>And now who can be dissatisfied in this point,
that wisely considers these things? Must we not
conclude as it is, Job 36. 7. <hi>He withdraweth not
his eye from the Righteous:</hi> and as 2 Chron. 16. 9.
<hi>The eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the
whole earth, to shew himself strong in tho behalf of
them whose heart is perfect towards him.</hi> His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences

Case, or polishing the Casket wherein the rare
Jewel lies. Providence hath not only built the
house, but brought the Inhabitant (I mean the
soul) into the possession of it. A glorious
piece it is, that bears the very Image of God
upon it, being all in all, and all in every part. How
noble are its Faculties and Affections? How

Providence, into nothing beside a demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Soveraign power; except they be
designed as soils, to set off the beauty of other
rare and exquisite pieces, and intended to stand
before your eyes, as Monitors of Gods mercy

                  <p>Look then (but not proudly) upon thy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
and inside, see and admire what Providence
hath done for thee, and how well it hath <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi>
the first service that ever it did for thee
in this world. And yet, this was not all it did
for thee, before thou sawest this world. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
thee, as well as formed thee in the womb:
else thou hadst been as those <hi>Embryo's Job</hi> speaks
of, Job 3. 11, 12. <hi>that never saw the light. Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
go for nothing in the world, and there are
multitudes of them, some that never had a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
soul breathed into them; but only the
rudiments, and rough draught of a body: these
come not into the account of men, but perish as
the Beast doth. Others that dye in, or shortly
after they come out of the Womb: and though
their life was but for a moment; yet that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
entails an Eternity upon them: and had
this been your case, as it is the case of Millions,
then (supposing your salvation) yet had you
been utterly unserviceable to God in the world:
None had been the better for you, nor you the
better for any in the world. You had been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
uncapable of all that good which through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
your life you have either done to others, or
received from others.</p>
                  <p>And if we consider the nature of that obscure
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52858:30"/>
life we lived in tho womb; how small an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(had it been permitted by Providence) had
extinguished our life, like a Bird in the shell? We
cannot therefore but admire the tender care of
Providence over us, and say with the <hi>Psalmist,</hi>
Psal. 139. 13. <hi>Thou hast covered me in my Mothers
womb:</hi> and not only so, but as it is, Psal. 22. 9.
<hi>Thou art he that took me out of my Mothers womb.</hi>
He preserved thee there to the fulness of time,
and when that time was come, brought thee
safely through manifold hazards, into that place
in the world which he from Eternity espied for
thee. Which leads us to the second performance.</p>

to warm your affections with a representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the many and rich benefits you owe to
this one <hi>performance</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> for you.</p>
                  <p>And we will consider it under a double respect

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> This performance of Providence for you, doth

                  <p>But such hath the special care of Providence
towards us been, that our turn to be brought
upon the stage of this World was graciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for better dayes: so that if we had had

<hi>Martyrs</hi> from Popish filthiness; and adorned with
Gospel lights, shining in as great lustre in our
dayes, as ever they did since the <hi>Apostles</hi> dayes.
You might have been born in <hi>England</hi> for many
Ages, and not have found a <hi>ChristJan</hi> in it: yea,
and since <hi>ChristJanity</hi> was here owned, and not
have met a <hi>Protestant</hi> in it. Oh what an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>True,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> they do so; and it is of very sad consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
that it should be so; but yet we cannot

                  <p>Is it not then a special mercy to you to be cast

him;</hi> and so the curse is entail'd from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to generation. To escape this Curse, is a
choice Providence.</p>
                  <p>(2.) But especially take notice, what a stream
of <hi>spiritual blessings</hi> and mercies, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>lows from this
Providence to the Inner man. O it's no common
mercy, to descend from pious Parents<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Some of
us do not only owe our natural life to them, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of our Beings, but our Spiritual and
Eternal life also. It was no small mercy to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi>
to be descended from such Progenitors,
2 <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>m.</hi> 1. 5. nor to. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that he had such
a Mother as <hi>Monica,</hi> who planted in his mind the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52858:36"/>
precepts of life with her Words, watered them
with her Tears, and nourished them with her
Example. We will a little more particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
this mercy, and in so doing, we shall find
manifold mercies contained in it.</p>
                  <p>(1.) What a Mercy was it to us, to have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
that prayed for us before they had us, as
well as in our Infancy, when we could not pray
for our selves? Thus did <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15. 2.
and <hi>Hannah, 1 Sam.</hi> 1. 10, 11. and some here like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are the fruits and returns of their <hi>Parents</hi>
Prayers. This was that holy course they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
all their dayes for you, carrying all your
concerns, especially your Eternal ones before the
Lord with their own; and pouring out their
souls to God so affectionately for you, when their
eye-strings and heart-strings were breaking. Oh
put a value upon such Mercies; for they are
precious. It's a greater Mercy, to descend from
praying Parents, than from the loyns of Nobles.
See <hi>Job</hi>'s pious practice, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                  <p>(2.) What a special Mercy was it to us, to
have the excrescencies of corruption nipt in the
bud by their pious and careful discipline? We
now understand, what a critical and dangerous
season Youth is, the wonderful proclivity of that
Age to every thing that is evil. Why else are
they called Youthful lusts? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 22. When
<hi>David</hi> asketh, <hi>Wherewith shall a young man cleanse
his way?</hi> it's plainly enough implyed in the very
Question, that the way he takes lieth through the
pollutions of the world in his youth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 9.
When you find a <hi>David</hi> praying, that God
would <hi>not remember the sins of his youth,</hi> Psal.
25. 7. and a <hi>Job</hi> bitterly complaining, that God
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52858:36"/>
                     <hi>made him to possess the sins of his youth,</hi> Job 13. 26.
Sure, you cannot but reflect, with a very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
heart, upon those happy means, by which
the corruption of your nature was happily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
or restrained in your Youth.</p>
                  <p>(3.) And how great a Mercy was it, that we
had Parents, who carefully instilled the good
knowledge of God into our souls in our tender
years? How careful was <hi>Abraham</hi> of this duty?
<hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. and <hi>David? 1 Chron.</hi> 28. 9. We
have some of us had Parents, who might say to
us, as the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Gal. 4. 19. <hi>My little Children, of
whom I travail again in birth till Christ be formed in
you.</hi> As they longed for us before they had us,
and rejoyced in us when they had us; so they
could not endure to think, that when they could
have us no more, the Devil should. As they
thought no pains, care or cost too much for our
bodies to feed them, cloath and heal them; so
did they think no prayers, counsels or tears, too
much for our souls, that they might be saved.
They knew a parting time would come betwixt
them and us, and did strive to make it as easie
and comfortable to them as they could, by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us in <hi>Christ,</hi> and within the blessed bond of
his Covenant.</p>
                  <p>They were not glad, that we had Health, and
indifferent whether we had Grace.</p>
                  <p>They as sensibly felt the miseries of our souls
as of our bodies; and nothing was more desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to them, than that they might say in the
great day, Lord, here am I, and the Children
which thou hast given me.</p>
                  <p>(4.) And was it not a special Favour to us, to
have <hi>Parents</hi> that went before us as Patterns of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52858:37"/>
Holiness, and beat the path to Heaven for us by
their Examples? Who could say to us, as Phil.
4. 9. <hi>What things ye have heard and seen in me, that
do;</hi> and as 1 Cor. 11. 1. <hi>Be ye followers of us, as
we are of Christ.</hi> The <hi>Parents</hi> life is the <hi>Childs</hi>
copy. O 'tis no common mercy, to have a fair
copy set before us, especially in the moulding age:
we saw what they did, as well as heard what they
said. It was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s commendation, that he
commanded his Children, and his houshold <hi>after
him,</hi> to keep the way of the Lord. And such
mercies some of us have had also.</p>
                  <p>Ah my friends, let me beg you, that you will
set special remarques upon this Providence, which
so graciously wrought for you: and that your
hearts may be more throughly warmed in the
sense of it, compare your condition with others,
and seriously bethink your selves,</p>
                  <p>(1.) How many Children there be among us,
that are drawn headlong to Hell by their cruel
and ungodly Parents, who teach them to curse
and swear assoon as they can speak? Many fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
there are, wherein little other language is
heard, but what is the Dialect of Hell. These,
like the old logs and small spray, are preparing
for the fire of Hell, where they must burn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Of such Children, that Scripture, <hi>Psal.</hi>
49. 19. will one day be verified, except they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<hi>They shall go to the generatJon of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
where they shall not see light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2.) And how many families are there, though
not so prophane, who yet breed up their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
vainly and sensually, as <hi>Job 21. 11, &amp;c.</hi> take
no care what becomes of their souls, so they can
but provide for their bodies? If they can but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52858:37"/>
teach them to carry their bodies, no matter if
the Devil act their souls: If they can but leave
them Lands or Moneys, they think they have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fully discharged their duties. O what will the
language be, wherewith such Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
shall great each other at the Judgement
Seat, and in Hell for ever?</p>
                  <p>(3.) And how many be there, who are more
<hi>sober,</hi> and yet hate the least appearances of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in their <hi>Children?</hi> who instead of cherishing,
do all that they can to break bruised reeds, and
quench smoaking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>lax, to stifle and strangle the
first appearances, and offers they make towards
Christ? Who had rather accompany them to
their <hi>graves,</hi> than to <hi>Christ,</hi> doing all that in
them lyes, <hi>Herod</hi> like, to kill <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Cradle?</hi>
Ah Sirs, ye little know, what a mercy ye do or
have enjoyed in Godly Parents, and what a good
Lot Providence cast for you in this Concernment
of your bodies and souls.</p>
                  <p>If any shall say, <hi>This was not their case,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                     <hi>they had
little help Heaven-ward from their Parents:</hi> To such
I shall only reply three things.</p>
                  <p>(1.) If you had little furtherance,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> yet own it
as a special Providence, that you had no hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
or, if you had opposition, yet</p>
                  <p>(2.) Admire the Grace of God, in plucking
you out by a wonderful distinguishing hand of
mercy from among them, and keeping alive the
languishing sparks of Grace amidst the floods of
opposition.</p>
                  <p>(3.) And learn from hence, if God give you
a posterity of your own, to be so much the more
strict and careful of relational duties, by how
much you have sensibly felt the want of it in your
selves<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:52858:38"/>
But seeing such a train of blessings, both as to
this life, and that to come, follow upon an holy
education of Children; I will not dismiss the
Point, till I have discharged my duty, in exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Parents and Children to their duties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And first for you that are <hi>Parents,</hi> or to whom
the Education of Children is committed, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you mind, how concerning a duty lies on
you: and that I may effectually press it, consider,</p>
                  <p>(1.) How near the Relation is betwixt you
and your Children, and therefore how much you
are concerned in their happiness or misery. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
but the Scripture account of the dearness of
such Relations, expressed (1.) By longings for
them, as <hi>Gen. 15. 2. Gen.</hi> 30. 1. and (2.) By
our joy when we have them, as Christ expresses
it, <hi>John. 16. 21. (3.)</hi> The high value set on them,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 38. (4.) The sympathie with them in
all their troubles, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 22. and (5.) By our
sorrow at parting, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 35. Now shall all
this be to no purpose? For to what purpose do
we desire them before we have them, rejoice in
them when we have them, value them so highly,
sympathize with them so tenderly, grieve for
their death so excessively; if in the mean time
no care be taken what shall become of them to
Eternity?</p>
                  <p>(2.) How God hath charged you with their
souls, as well as bodies: and this appears by two
sorts of Precepts. (1.) Precepts directly laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 4. (2.) By Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
laid on them to obey you, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 1. which
plainly implies your duty, as well as expresses
theirs.</p>
                  <p>(3.) What shall comfort you at the parting
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52858:38"/>
time, if they dye through your neglect in a Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
condition? Oh this is the cutting considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
My <hi>Child</hi> is in <hi>Hell,</hi> and I did nothing to
prevent it; I helped him thither. Duty dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
is the only root of comfort in that
day.</p>
                  <p>(4.) If you neglect to instruct them in the
way of <hi>Holiness,</hi> will the Devil neglect to instruct
them in the way of <hi>Wickedness?</hi> No, no, if you
will not teach them to <hi>pray,</hi> he will to <hi>curse,
swear</hi> and <hi>lye.</hi> If ground be uncultivated, weeds
will spring.</p>
                  <p>(5.) If the season of their youth be neglected,
how little probability is there of any good fruit
afterwards? that is the Moulding age, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 6.
How few are converted in old age? A twig is
brought to any form, but grown limbs will
not bow.</p>
                  <p>(6.) You are instrumental causes of all their
spiritual misery; and that (1.) By <hi>generatJon,
(2.) ImitatJon,</hi> they lye spiritually dead of the
Plague which you brought home among them,
Psal. 51. 5. <hi>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in
sin did my Mother conceive</hi> (or warm) <hi>me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(7.) There's none in the World so likely as
you<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> to be Instruments of their Eternal good.
You have peculiar advantages that none other
hath; as (1.) The interest you have in their
affections. (2.) Your opportunities to instil the
knowledge of Christ into them, being daily with
them, <hi>Deut. 6. 7. (3.)</hi> Your knowledge of their
tempers: if therefore you neglect, who shall help
them?</p>
                  <p>(8.) The consideration of the great day,

remember that Text, Rev. 20. 12, <hi>&amp;c. I saw the
dead small and great stand before God.</hi> What a
sad thing will it be, to see your dear Children at
Christs left hand? O friends, do your utmost to
prevent this misery. <hi>Knowing the terrors of the
Lord, we perswade men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And you <hi>Children,</hi> especially you that sprang
from religious <hi>Parents,</hi> I beseech you, obey their
Counsels; and tread in the steps of their pious
Examples. To press this, I offer these Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Your disobedience to them, is a resisting
of Gods Authority, Ephes. 6. 1. <hi>Children, obey
your Parents in the Lord:</hi> there's the Command:
your rebellion therefore runs higher than you
think. It is not Man, but God that you disobey;
and for your disobedience God will punish you.
It may be, their tenderness will not suffer them,
or you are grown beyond their correction: all
they can do, is to complain to God; and if so,
he will handle you more severely than they
could do.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Your Sin is greater than the Sin of young
<hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels;</hi> and so will your Account
be also. O better (if a wicked Child) that thou
hadst been the off-spring of Salvage <hi>IndJans,</hi> nay,
of Beasts, than of such Parents. So many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
disobeyed, Hopes and Prayers frustrated,
will turn to sad aggravations.</p>
                  <p>(3.) It's usual with God, to retaliate mens
disobedience to their Parents in kind: Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our own Children shall pay us home for it.
I have read in a grave <hi>Author,</hi> of a wicked
Wretch that drag'd his Father along the house:
the Father begg'd him, not to draw him beyond
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52858:39"/>
such a place: for, said he, I drag'd my Father
no farther. O the sad, but just retributions
of God!</p>
                  <p>And for you, in whose hearts Grace hath been
planted by the blessing of Education, I beseech
you to admire Gods goodness to you in this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi>
Oh what an happy Lot hath God cast
for you! How few Children are partakers of
your mercies?</p>
                  <p>See that you honour such Parents; the tie is
double upon you so to do. Be you the joy of
their hearts, and comfort of their lives, if liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
if not, yet still remember the mercy while
<hi>you</hi> live, and tread in their pious path; that you
and they may both rejoice together in the great
day, and bless God for each other to all Eternity.</p>

shall be with respect to its ordering the Occasions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
and Means of their Conversion.</p>
                  <p>In nothing doth Providence shine forth more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
in this world, than it doth in this perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
for the people of God. How curiously soever
its hand had moulded your bodies, how tenderly
soever it had preserved them, and how bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
soever it had provided for them; if it had
hot also ordered some means or other for your
Conversion, all the former favours and benefits it
had done for you, had signified little. This, O
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52858:40"/>
this is the most excellent benefit you ever receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from its hand. You are more beholden to it
for this, than for all your other mercies. And
in opening this performance of Providence, I
cannot but think your hearts must be deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
This is a subject which every gracious
heart loves to steep its thoughts in. It's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the sweetest History that ever they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated:
they love to think and talk of it. The
Places where, and Instruments by whom this work
was wrought, are exceedingly endeared to them
for the works sake: yea, endeared to that degree,
that for many years after their hearts have melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when they have but passed occasionally by
those places, or but seen the faces of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that were used as Instruments in the hand
of Providence for their good. As no doubt, but
* <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>Beth-el</hi> was ever after that night sweet
to his thoughts:<note place="margin">Gen. 48. 3.</note> so other Saints have had their
<hi>Bethels</hi> as well as he. O blessed Places, Times and
Instrurments! O the deep, the sweet impressions,
never to be razed out of the memory or heart,
that this Providence hath made upon those on
whom it wrought this blessed Effect at years of
discretion, and in a more sensible way!</p>
                  <p>But lest any poor soul should be discouraged
under the display of this Providence, because he
cannot remember the Time, Place, Instruments
and Manner wherein, and by which Conversion-work
was wrought; I will therefore premise this
necessary distinction, to prevent injury to some,
whilst I design benefit to others.</p>
                  <p>Conversion, as to the subjects of it, may be
considered two wayes; either as it is more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
wrought in persons of riper years, who in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52858:40"/>
their youthful daies were more prophane and
vile; or upon persons in their tender years, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whose hearts Grace was more insensibly, and
undiscernably instilled by Gods blessing upon pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Education. In the former sort, the distinct
acts of the Spirit, as <hi>illuminating, convincing,
humbling, drawing</hi> them to <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>sealing</hi> them
are more evident and discernable: in the latter,
more obscure and confused; they can remember,
that God gave them an Esteem and liking of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
persons, Care of duty, and Conscience of sin;
but as to the Time, Place, Instruments and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the work, they can give but a slender ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them: however, if the work be saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wrought in them, there is no reason they
should be troubled, because the Circumstances of
it are not so evident to them, as they are to
others. Let the substance and reality of the
work appear, and there is no reason to afflict
your selves, because of the inevidence of such
Circumstances.</p>
                  <p>But yet where the Circumstances as well as
Substance are clear to a man: when we can call
to remembrance, the Time when, the Place where,
the Instrument by whom that work was wrought,
it must needs be exceeding sweet: and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but yield a fresh delight to the soul every
time they are reflected upon.</p>
                  <p>There are many of the following occasions,
which it may be, we took for <hi>straglers</hi> when
they first befell us: but they proved <hi>scouts</hi> sent
out from the main body of Providence, which
they make way for.</p>
                  <p>Now there be divers things in those Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
that are versant about this work, which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52858:41"/>
are exceeding sweet, and taking; as namely,</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The wonderful strangeness and unaccountable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this work of Providence, in casting us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>est Circumstances about this work. Thus
you find in <hi>Acts 8. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, &amp;c.</hi> the
<hi>Eunuch</hi> at that very instant when he was reading
the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> hath an Interpreter, one
among a thousand, that joins his <hi>CharJot,</hi> just as
his mind was by a fit occasion prepared to receive
the first light of the knowledge of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And how strange was that Change (how far
soever it went) upon <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>SyrJan?</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. That the <hi>SyrJans</hi> in
their incursion should bring away this girl, (likely
her beauty was the inducement,) and shel must
be presented to <hi>Naaman</hi>'s Wife, and relate to
her the power of God that accompanied the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;</hi>
though you find in that particular case
there had never been an instance given before,
<hi>Luke</hi> 4. 27. Doubtless, the whole of this affair
was guided by the signal direction of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                  <p>So for the Conversion of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> it's
observed <hi>John</hi> 4. 4. Christ must needs go that

Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> in his <hi>Real ChristJan, pag.</hi> 97, 98.
tells us of one, who had liv'd many years in a
<hi>Town</hi> where <hi>Christ</hi> had been as clearly, and as
long preached, as in any <hi>Town</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> This
man when he was about seventy six years of age,
went to visit a sick Neighbour. <q>A Christian
friend of mine (saith mine Author) came to
see him also, and finding this old man there;
whom he judged, to be one that lived upon his
own stock: Civility, good Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he
purposely fell into that discourse, to shew how
many persons lived upon their duties, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
came to <hi>Christ.</hi> The old man sitting by
the bed side, heard him; and God was pleased
to convince him, that he was such a person,
who had lived upon himself without Christ to
that day; and would say afterwards, had I
dyed before threescore and sixteen, I had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht,
for I knew not Christ.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The committing of a godly man to <hi>Prison,</hi>
hath been the method of Providence, to save the
soul of a poor Keeper. So <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 16. 27.
was made a <hi>Prisoner,</hi> to make his Keeper a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

been the way of Providence, to find out, and
bring home some lost sheep that were found
there, to Jesus Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 1. 4. The like

A. <hi>Servant</hi> running away from his Master, (like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon no other design but to live an idle life)
yet falling into such places and companies, as
Providence ordered (in a design to him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known)

<hi>Rome;</hi> where by a strange Providence (possibly a

                  <p>Going to hear a Sermon in jest, hath
proved some mens Conversion in earnest. The
above named Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> in the fore-cited
Book, tells us of anotorious <hi>drunkard,</hi> whom the
drunkards called <hi>Father,</hi> that one day would
needs go to hear what <hi>Wilson</hi> said, out of no
other design it seems, but to scoff at that holy
man: but in the prayer before Sermon, his heart
began to thaw; and when he read his Text,
which was John 5. 14. <hi>Sin no more, lest a worse
thing come unto thee:</hi> he could not contain; and in
that Sermon the Lord changed his heart, though
so bitter an Enemy, that the Minister on Lecture-dayes
was afraid to go to Church before his shopdoor.
<hi>Lo, these are parts of his wayes, but how small
a portJon is known of him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The dropping of some grave and weighty
word accidentally in the presence of vain carnal
persons, the death of an Husband, Wife or
Child, a fit of sickness, with a thousand other
such like occasions, have been thus improved by
Providence to the Conversion of souls.</p>
                  <p>And no less remarkable and wonderful are the
designs of Providence in ordering the <hi>removes,</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:52858:44"/>
and governing the <hi>motJons</hi> of Ministers, from
place to place in order unto the Conversion of
souls. Thus oftentimes it carries them to places
where they intended not to go; God having
(unknown to them) some Elect Vessels there,
who must be Called by the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> (a sweet and lovely
pair) when they were travelling through <hi>PhrygJa</hi>
and <hi>GalatJa,</hi> were forbid to preach the Word in
<hi>AsJa,</hi> to which probably their minds inclined,
<hi>Acts</hi> 16. 6. and when they essayed to go into
<hi>BythinJa,</hi> the Spirit suffered them not, <hi>Ver.</hi> 7.
But a man of <hi>MacedonJa (i. e.</hi> an <hi>Angel</hi> in the
shape or habit of a man of that <hi>Countrey</hi>) appeared
to <hi>Paul</hi> in a Vision, and prayed him, saying, <hi>Come
over into</hi> Macedonia, <hi>and help us,</hi> Ver. 9. and there
did God open the heart of <hi>LydJa.</hi>

                  <p>I knew a pious <hi>Minister</hi> now with God, who
falling in his Study upon a very rouzing subject,
intended for his own Congregation, was strongly
moved, when he had finished it, to go to a rude,
vile, prophane people, about five miles off, and
first preach it to them; after many wrestlings
with himself, not being willing to quench any
motion that might be supposed to come from
the Spirit of God, he obeyed, and went to this
people, who had then no Minister of their own,
and few durst come among them. And there did
the Lord, beyond all expectation, open a door,
and several prophane ones received <hi>Christ</hi> in that

a quarter of an hours serious discourse upon this

place, to the astonishment of many spectators.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1673. there came into this <hi>Port</hi> a
Ship of <hi>Poole,</hi> in her return from <hi>Virgini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> in
which Ship was one of that place, a lusty young
man of twenty three years of age, who was <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:52858:45"/>
in the Ship. This person in the voyage
fell into a deep melancholy, which the <hi>Devil</hi>
greatly improved to serve his own design for
the ruine of this poor man; however, it pleased
the Lord to restrain him from any attempts upon
his own life, until he arrived here. But shortly
after his arrival, upon the Lords Day early in
the morning (being in bed with his Brother) he
took a knife prepared for that purpose, and cut
his own throat, and withal leapt out of the bed,
and though the wound was deep and large, yet
thinking it might not soon enough dispatch his
wretched life, desperately thrust it into his st.|mach,
and so lay wallowing in his own blood,
till his <hi>Brother awaking,</hi> made a cry for help:
hereupon a <hi>PhysicJan</hi> and a <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> coming in,
found the wound in his Throat mortal; and all
they could do at present, was only to stitch it
and apply a plaister, with design, rather to enable
him to speak for a little while, than with any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of cure; for before that, he breathed
through the wound, and his voice was inarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate.</p>
                  <p>In this condition I found him that morning,
and apprehending him to be within a few minutes
of Eterity, I laboured to work upon his heart
the sense of his condition, telling him, I had but
little him to do any thing for him, and therefore
desired him to let me know, what his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of his present Condition were:
He told me, he hoped in God for Eternal Life;
I replyed, that I feared his hopes were unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for that the Scripture tells us, <hi>No Murderer
hath eternal life abiding in him,</hi> but this was self-murther,
the grossest of all Murthers: and insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52858:45"/>
upon the aggravation and heinousness of the
fact, I perceived his vain confidence began to
fall, and some meltings of heart appeared in
him. He then began to lament with many tears
his sin and misery, and asked me, if there might
yet be hope for one that had destroyed himself,
and shed his own blood. I replyed, the sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is great, but not unpardonable; and if
the Lord gave him repentancae unto life, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>aith to apply <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> it should be certainly
pardoned to him: and finding him unacquainted
with these things, I opened to him the nature
and necessity of faith and repentance, which he
greedily suckt in, and with great vehemency
cryed to God, that he would work them upon his
soul, and intreated me also to pray with him and
for him, that it might be so. I prayed with him,
and the Lord thawed his heart exceedingly in that
duty: loth he was to part with me; but the
duties of the day necessitating me to leave him, I
briefly summed up what was most necessary in my
parting counsel to him, and took my leave, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
expecting to see him more in this world. But
beyond my own and all mens expectation, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
all that day, and panted most ardently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> no discourses pleased him, but
<hi>Christ</hi> and faith; and in this frame I found him
in the evening. He rejoiced greatly to see me
again, and entreated me to continue my discourses
upon these subjects; and after all told me, Sir,
the Lord hath given me repentance for this sin<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
yea, and for every other sin. I see the Evil of
sin now, so as I never saw it before. O I loath
my self: I am a vile creature in my own eyes.
I do also believe; <hi>Lord help my unbelJef.</hi> I am
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52858:46"/>
heartily willing to take Christ upon his own terms.
One thing only troubles me, I doubt this bloody
sin will not be pardoned. Will Jesus Christ (said
he) apply his blood to me, that have shed my
own blood? I told him, Christ shed his blood
even for them that with wicked hands had shed
the blood of Christ; and that was a sin of deeper
guilt than his. Well, (said he) I will cast my
self upon Christ; let him do by me what he will.
And so I parted with him that night.</p>
                  <p>Next morning the wounds were to be opened;
and then, the opinion of the <hi>Chirurgeons</hi> was, he
would immediately expire.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, at his desire, I came that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and found him in a most serious frame. I
prayed with him, and then the wound in his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
was opened, but by this time the <hi>Ventricle</hi>
it self was swoln out of the <hi>orifice</hi> of the wound,
and lay like a livid discoloured <hi>Tripe</hi> upon his
body, and was also cut through; so that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,

it again into his body, and so stitching up the
skin, left him to the dispose of Providence.</p>
                  <p>But so it was, that both the deep wound in his
throat, and this in his stomach healed: and the
more dangerous wound <hi>sin</hi> had made upon his
<hi>soul,</hi> was, I trust, effectually healed also. I spent
many hours with him in that sickness; and after
his return home, received this account from
Mr. <hi>Samuel Hardy,</hi> a Minister in that Town. Part
whereof I shall transcribe.</p>

                           <hi>I</hi> Was much troubled at the sad Providence in
your Town; but did much rejoice, that he fell
into such hands for his body and soul. You have
taken much pains with him, and I hope to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
I think, if ever a great and through work were
done <hi>such a way,</hi> it is now; and if never the like, I
am perswaded now it is. Never grow weary of
such good works. One such Instance is (methinks)
enough to make you to abound in the work of the Lord

                  <p>O how unsearchable are the wayes of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
in leading men to Christ! Let none be
encouraged by this to sin, that grace may abound.
These are rare and singular Instances of the
mercy of God, and such as no presumptuous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
can expect to find. It's only recited here, to
the honour of Providence, which works for the
recovery of sinners in wayes that we understand
not. O what a fetch hath Providence beyond
our Understandings!</p>
                  <p>And as it orders very strange occasions to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
awaken and rouse souls at first, so it works no less
wonderfully in carrying on the work to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and this it doth two wayes.</p>
                  <p>(1.) By quickning and reviving dying convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and troubles for sin. Souls after their first
awakening, are apt to lose the sense and impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their first troubles for sin; but Providence
is vigilant to prevent it; and doth effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it sometimes, by <hi>directing the Minister</hi> to
some discourse or passage, that shall fall as pat, as
if the case of such a person had been studied by
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52858:47"/>
him, and designedly spoken to. How often have
I found this in the cases of many souls, who have
professed they have stood amazed, to hear the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thoughts of their hearts discovered by the
Preacher, who knew nothing of them! Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by directing them to some proper rousing
Scripture, that suites their present case. And
sometimes by suffering them to fall into some new
sin, which shall awaken all their former troubles
again, and put a new efficacy and activity into
the Conscience. The world is full of Instances in
all these cases, and because most Christians have
experience of these things in themselves, it will
be needless to recite them here. Search but a
few years back, and you may remember, that
according to this Account (at least, in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars)
Providence ordered the matter with you.
Have you not found some rod or other prepared
by Providence, to rouze you out of your securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Why, this is so common a thing with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
that they many times presage an affliction
coming from the frames they find their own
hearts in.</p>
                  <p>(2.) It gives also great assistance to the work of
the Spirit upon the soul, by ordering, supporting,
relieving and cheering means, to prop up and
comfort the soul, when it is over-burthened, and
ready to sink in the deeps of troubles. I remember
Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> gives us one Instance, which fits both
these cases, the <hi>reviving of convictJons,</hi> and <hi>seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
supports in the deeps of troubles.</hi> And it is
of a person that by convictions had been fetcht
off from his wicked companions, and entered
into a reformed course of life; but after this,
through the inticement of his old companions,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52858:47"/>
the subtilty of Satan, and corruption of his own
heart, did again relapse into the wayes of sin.
Then was Providentially brought to his view that
Scripture, <hi>Prov. 1. 24, 25, 26, &amp;c.</hi> this renewed
his trouble; yea, aggravated it to a greater
height than ever; insomuch that he could scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
think (as it seems by the relation) his sin
could be pardoned. But in this plunge, that
Text <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 4. was presented to him, which
sweetly setled him in a sure and glorious
peace.</p>
                  <p>Nor can we here forget that miraculous work
of Providence, in a time of great extremity,
which was wrought for that good <hi>Gentlewoman</hi>
Mrs. <hi>Honeywood,</hi> (and is somewhere mentioned
by the same Author) who under a deep and sad
desertion, refused and put off all comfort, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to despair utterly of the grace and mercy of
God. A worthy Minister being one day with
her, and reasoning against her desperate conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
she took a <hi>Venice-glass</hi> from the Table, and
said, Sir, I am as sure to be damned, as this glass
is to be broken; and therewith threw it forcibly to
the ground; but to the astonishment of both<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
the glass remained whole and sound, which the
Minister taking up with admiration, rebuked her
presumption, and shewed her what a wonder
Providence had wrought for her satisfaction, and
it greatly altered the temper of her mind. O
how unsearchable are his wayes! and his paths
past finding out! Lo, these are part of his wayes;
but how small a portion do we know of him?</p>

ANd now suffer me to expostulate a little
with thy soul Reader, hast thou been duly
sensible of thy obligation to Providence, for this
inestimable favour? O what hath it done for
thee! there are divers kinds of mercies convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to men by the hand of Providence, but none
like this: in all the Treasury of its benefits, none
is found like this. Did it cast thee into the way
of Conversion, and order the means and occasions
of it for thee, when thou little thoughtest of any
such thing? How dear and sweet, should the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of it be to thy soul! Methinks it
should astonish and melt you every time you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon it. Such Mercies should never grow
stale, or look like common things to you: for
do but seriously consider the following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> How <hi>surprizing</hi> the mercy was, which it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
for you in that day. Providence had a
design upon you, for your eternal good, which
you understood not. The time of mercy was
now fully come; the Decree was now ready to
bring forth that mercy, with which it had gone
big from Eternity, and its gracious design must
be executed by the hand of Providence, so far
as concerned the external means and instruments:
and how aptly did it cause all things to fall in
with that design, though you knew not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it? Look over all the before mentioned
Examples, and you shall see the blessed work of
Conversion begun upon those souls, when they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52858:48"/>
minded it no more, than <hi>Saul</hi> did a Kingdom,
that morning he went out to seek his <hi>Fathers
Asses, 1 Sam</hi> 9. 3, 20. Providence might truly
have said to you in that day, as Christ said to
<hi>Peter,</hi> John 13. 7. <hi>What I do thou knowest not now,
but hereafter thou shalt know it. Gods thoughts are
not as our thoughts; but as the Heavens are higher
than the Earth, so are his thoughts higher than ours,
and his wayes than our wayes.</hi> Little did <hi>Zacheus</hi>
think, when he climbed up into the <hi>Sycamore</hi>-tree,
to see <hi>Christ</hi> as he passed that way, what a design
of mercy <hi>Christ</hi> had upon him, who took thence
the occasion of becoming both his <hi>Guest</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vJour,</hi>
Luke 19. 5, 6, 7, 8. And as little did some
of you think, what the aim of Providence was,
when you went (some out of custom, others out
of curiosity, if not worse ends) to hear such
a Sermon. O how stupendious are the wayes of
God!</p>
                  <p>What a distinguishing and seasonable mercy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
was usher'd in by Providence in that day. It
brought you to the means of salvation in a good
hour. At that very nick of time, when the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi>
troubled the Waters, you were brought to
the <hi>Pool;</hi> to allude to that, <hi>John</hi> 5. 4. Now the
accepted day was come, the <hi>Spirit</hi> was in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
or Providence that converted you, and
you were set in the way of it. It may be, you
had heard many hundred Sermons before, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would stick till now, because the hour was
not come. The Lord did, as it were, call in the
Word for such a man, such a woman; and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
said, Lord, here he is, I have brought
him before thee. There were many others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Sermon, that received no such mercy.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52858:49"/>
You your selves had heard many before, but not
to that advantage, as it is said, Luke 4. 27.
<hi>There were many Lepers in Israel in the days of
Elizeus, but to none of them was the Prophet sent,
save unto Naaman the SyrJan.</hi> So there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
poor unconverted souls beside you under the
Word that day, and it may be, to none of them
was salvation sent that day, but to you. O bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Providence, that set you in the way of mercy
at that time!</p>
                  <p>What a weighty and important mercy was
Providentially directed to your souls that day.
There are mercies of all sizes and kinds in the
hands of Providence to dispense to the sons of
men: its left hand is full of blessings, as well as
its right. It hath health and riches, honours
and pleasures, as well as Christ and Salvation to
dispense. The world is full of its <hi>left hand</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;
but the blessings of its <hi>right hand</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuably
precious, and few there be that receive
them. It doth thousands of kind offices for men;
but among them all, this is the chiefest, to lead
and direct them to Christ. For consider,</p>
                  <p>(1.) Of all mercies, this comes through most
and greatest difficulties, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>(2.) This is a spiritual mercy, excelling in
dignity of nature all others, more than <hi>gold</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
the <hi>dirt</hi> under your feet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. One
such gift, is worth thousands of other mercies.</p>
                  <p>(3.) This is a mercy immediately slowing
out of the fountain of Gods <hi>electing love,</hi> a
mercy never dropt into any, but an Elect Vessel,
1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>(4.) This is a mercy, that infallibly secures
Calvation; for as we may argue from Conversion to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52858:49"/>
Election, looking back, so from Conversion to
Salvation, looking forward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
                  <p>(5.) Lastly, This is an Eternal mercy, that
which will stick by you, when Father, Mother,
Wife, Children, Estate, Honours, Health and Life
shall fail thee, <hi>John</hi> 4. 14.</p>
                  <p>O therefore set a special Mark upon that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that set you in the way of this mercy.
It hath performed that for thee, which all the
Ministers on Earth, and Angels in Heaven could
never have performed. This is a Mercy, that
puts weight and value into the smallest Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
that relates to it.</p>

ordinarily furnished by it, for works of mercy
to others, and surely it is more blessed to give,

Arts, meerly to furnish other mens lusts: they
do not only sin in their Imployments; but their
very Imployments are sinful: they trade for Hell,
and are Factors for the Devil. <hi>DemetrJus</hi> and the

<hi>Shrines</hi> for <hi>DJana,</hi> Acts 19. 24, 25. (<hi>i. e.</hi>)
little cases, or boxes with folding leaves, within
which the <hi>Image</hi> of that <hi>Idol</hi> sate enshrined.
These were carried about by the People in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,

by them) meerly to gratifie the pride
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52858:50"/>
and wantonness of a debauched age?</p>
                  <p>Now to have an honest lawful imployment,
wherein you do not dishonour God in benefiting
your selves, is no small mercy.</p>
                  <p>But if it be not only lawful in it self, but
suited to your <hi>genJus</hi> and strength, there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
mercy in it. Some poor Creatures are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in Callings, that eat up their time and
strength, and make their lives very uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

to. There are among us such persons, as on
this account are signally obliged to Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
God hath put them into such a way, as
neither they nor their Parents ever projected. For,
look as the <hi>Flower-de-luce</hi> in the Campass, turns

moving, till it settle to the <hi>North point;</hi> just so it
is in our setlement in the world. A Child is

setles in that way of Imployment which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

That Providence hath a special hand in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is evident both from Scripture assertions,
and the acknowledgements of holy men, who in
that great concernment of their lives, have still
owned, and acknowledged the directing hand of
Providence. Take an instance of both. The
Scripture plainly asserts the dominion of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
over this affair in Prov. 19. 14. <hi>A prudent
Wife is from the Lord:</hi> and Prov. 18. 22. <hi>Whos.
findeth a Wife, findeth a good thing, and obtaineth
favour of the Lord.</hi> So for Children, see Psal.
127. 3. <hi>Lo, Children are an heritage of the Lord;
and the fruit of the Womb is his reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it hath ever been the practice of holy
men, to seek the Lord for direction and counsel,
when they have been upon the change of their
condition. No doubt but <hi>Abraham</hi>'s encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in that case was the fruit of prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi>
24. 7. His pious servant also, who was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in that affair, did both earnestly seek
counsel of God, <hi>Gen,</hi> 24. 12. and thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his gracious Providence in guiding
it, <hi>Ver.</hi> 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:52858:54"/>
The same we may observe in Children, the
fruit of marriage, 1 <hi>Sam. 1. 20. Luke</hi> 1. 13, 14.
Now the Providence of God may be divers wayes
displayed for the engaging of our hearts in love
to the God of our mercies.</p>
                  <p>(1.) There is very much of Providence seen
in appointing the Parties each for other. In this,
the Lord goes oftentimes beyond our thoughts
and projections; yea, and oftentimes crosses
mens desires and designs to their great advantage.
Not what they fancy; but what his infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
judges best, and most beneficial for them
takes place. Hence it is, that probabilities are
so often dashed; and things remote and utterly
improbable are brought about, in very strange
and unaccountable methods of Providence.</p>
                  <p>(2.) There is much of Providence seen in
the harmony and agreeableness of tempers and
dispositions; from whence a very great part of the
tranquillity and comforts of our lives results: or
at least, though natural tempers and educations
did not so much harmonize before, yet they do
so after they come under the Ordinance of God,
Gen. 2. 24. <hi>They two shall be one flesh,</hi> not one
only in respect of Gods <hi>institutJon,</hi> but one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of love and <hi>affectJon,</hi> that those who so
lately were meer strangers to each other, are
now endeared to a degree beyond the nearest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
in blood. <hi>Vbi supra, For this cause shall a
man leave Father and Mother, and shall cleave to
his Wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) But especially, Providence is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in making one instrumental to the eternal
good of the other, I Cor. 7. 16. <hi>How knowest
thou, O Wife, but thou maist save thy Husband? or
<pb facs="tcp:52858:54"/>
how knowest thou, O Man, whether thou shalt save
thy Wife?</hi> Hence is that grave Exhortation to
the Wives of unbelieving Husbands, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. to
win them by their conversation, which should be
to them in stead of an ordinance.</p>
                  <p>Or if both be gracious, then what singular as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
and mutual help is hereby gained to the
furtherance of their Eternal good? Whilst they
live together <hi>as Heirs of the grace of life, I</hi> Pet.
3. 7. O blessed Providence! that directed such
into so intimate relation on Earth, who shall
inherit together the <hi>common SalvatJon</hi> in Heaven!</p>
                  <p>(4.) How much of Providence is seen in
<hi>Children</hi> the fruit of <hi>MarrJage?</hi> To have any Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
in the Earth, and not be left altogether as
a dry tree: To have comfort and joy in them,
is a special Providence, importing a special mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to us. To have the breaches made upon our
Families repaired, is a Providence to be owned
with a thankful heart. When God shall say to a
man, as he speaks in another case to the <hi>Church,</hi>
Isa. 49. 20. <hi>The Children which thou shalt have
after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine
ears, the place is too strait for me,</hi> &amp;c</p>
                  <p>And these Providences will appear more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectingly
sweet and lovely to you, if you but
compare its allotments to you, with what it
hath allotted to many others in the world. For
do but look abroad, and you shall find,</p>
                  <p>(1.) Multitudes unequally yoked, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittering
of their lives, whose Relations are
clogs and hinderances both in Temporals and
Spirituals. Yea, we find an account in Scripture
of gracious persons, a great part of whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in this world hath been split upon this

to the neglect of a known duty, prevail'd upon

his Wife? <hi>Exod. 4. 24, 25. David</hi> had his
scoffing <hi>Michal, 2 Sam.</hi> 6. 20. And patient <hi>Job</hi>
no small addition to all his other afflictions, from
the <hi>Wife</hi> of his bosom, who should have been a
support to him in the day of his trouble,
<hi>Job</hi> 19. 17.</p>
                  <p>No doubt, but God sanctifies such rods to his
Peoples good. If <hi>Socrates</hi> knew how to improve
his affliction in his <hi>Zantippe,</hi> to the increase of
his patience; much more will they who converse
with God under all Providences, whether sweet
or bitter. Nevertheless this must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be a sad stroke upon any person, and
such as maims them upon the working hand, by
unfitting them for duty, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. and cuts off
much of the comfort of life also.</p>
                  <p>(2.) How many are there, who never enjoy
the comfortable fruits of Marriage? but are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
the sight, at least, the enjoyment of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Jer. 22. 30. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, write this
man Childless,</hi> &amp;c. or if they have Children, yet
cannot enjoy them, Hosea 9. 12. <hi>Though they
bring up Children, yet will I bereave them, that there
shall not be a man left;</hi> who only bear for the
grave, and have their expectations raised for a
greater affliction to themselves.</p>
                  <p>(3.) And it is no rare or unusual thing to
see Children and near Relations the greatest
Instruments of affliction to their Parents and
Friends: so that after all their other sorrows
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52858:55"/>
and troubles in the World, nearest Relations
bring up the rear of sorrows (as One speaks)

and they said, nothing.</hi> Can ye not with <hi>Jacob,</hi>
call him, <hi>the God that fed you all your life long?</hi>
Gen. 48. 15. Surely <hi>he hath given bread to them
that fear him, and been ever mindful of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
Psal. 111. 5.</p>
                  <p>To display this Providence, we will consider it
in the following particulars.</p>
                  <p>(1.) The <hi>assiduity</hi> and <hi>constancy</hi> of the care of
Providence for the Saints, Lam. 3. 23. <hi>His mercJes
are new every morning.</hi> It is not the supply of
one or two pressing needs, but all your wants, as
they grow from day to day through all your
dayes, Gen. 48. 15. <hi>The God that fed me all my
life long.</hi> The care of Providence runs parallel
with the line of life. See Isa. 46. 3, 4. <hi>Hearken
unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of
the house of Israel, which are born by me from the
belly, which are carryed from the Womb: and even
to your old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs will I
carry. you: I have made, and I will bear, even I will
carry, and will deliver you.</hi> So that as God bid
<hi>Israel,</hi> Micah 6. 5. <hi>to remember from Shittim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap> unto
Gilgal, that they might know the faithfulness of the
Lord;</hi> so would I perswade thee, Reader, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
the wayes of Providence, from first to last,
throughout thy whole course of this day, that
thou maist see what a God he hath been to
thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:52858:57"/>
(2.) The seasonableness, and opportuneness of
its provisions for them: for so runs the promise,
Isa. 41. 17. <hi>When the poor and needy seek water, and
there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I
the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not
forsake them;</hi> and so hath the performance of it
been. And this hath been made good to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
Saints sometimes in a more <hi>ordinary way,</hi>
God secretly blessing a little, and making it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for us and ours: <hi>Job</hi> tells us of <hi>the secret
of God upon his Tabernacle,</hi> Job 29. 4. (<hi>i. e.</hi>) his
secret blessing is in their <hi>Tabernacles;</hi> by reason
whereof it is that they subsist; but it is in an
unaccountable way that they do so. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in an <hi>extraordinary</hi> way it breaks forth for
their supply. So you find in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14. the Cruse and Barrel sail not.</p>

a memorable Instance of Providence, and it
is this, That towards the end of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth his Reign he went to <hi>London,</hi> where he
quickly spent that little his friends had given
him, or he had acquired by his own diligence, and
began to be in great want. As one day he sate

                     </gap> the
ghastful manner of dying men, every one shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a Spectacle of so much horror: There
came one to him, whom he had never seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and thrust an untold summ of money into
his hand, bidding him, be of good cheer, and
accept that small gift in good part from his
Countrey-man; and that he should make much
of himself, for that within a few dayes new hopes
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52858:57"/>
were at hand, and a more certain condition of
livelihood. Three dayes after the <hi>Dutchess</hi> of
<hi>Richmond</hi> sent for him to live in her house, and
be <hi>Tutor</hi> to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Surrey</hi>'s Children, then
under her care.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Isaac Ambrose <hi>a worthy Divine, whose la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
have made him acceptable to his genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tJon,
in his Epistle to the</hi> Earl of Bedford <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
to his</hi> Last things, <hi>gives a pregnant Instance
in his own case; his words are these;</hi> For mine
own part, (<hi>saith he</hi>) however the Lord hath seen
cause to give me but a poor pittance of outward
things, for which I bless his name; yet in the income
thereof, I have many times observed so much of his
peculiar Providence, that thereby they have been very
much sweetned, and my heart hath been raised to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
his grace. When of late under an hard di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation
(which I judge not meet to mention)
wherein I suffered conscientiously) all streams of wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
supplyes being stopt, the waters of relief for my
self and family did run low<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> I went to bed with
some staggerings and doubtings of the Fountains let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out it self for our refreshing; but e're I did
awake in the morning, a Letter was brought to my
bed side, which was signed by a choice friend
Mr. <hi>Anthony Ash,</hi> which reported some unexpected
breakings out of Gods goodness for my comfort. These
are some of his lines‚ÄîYour God who hath
given you an heart thankfully to record your experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of his goodness, doth renew experiences for
your encouragement. Now I shall report one, which
will raise your spirit toward the God of your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
<hi>Whereupon he sweetly concludes,</hi> One morsel
of Gods provision, especially when it comes in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
and upon prayer, when wants are most, will
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52858:58"/>
be more sweet to a spirituall relish, than all former
enjoyments were.</p>
                  <p>(3.) The Wisdom of Providence in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions.
And this is discovered in two things:
(1.) In proportioning the quantity, not satisfying
our extravagent <hi>wishes,</hi> but answering our real
<hi>needs;</hi> consulting our <hi>wants,</hi> not our <hi>wantonness,</hi>
Phil. 4. 19. <hi>My God shall supply all your wants;</hi>
and this hath exactly suited the wishes of the best
and wisest men, who desired no more at its hand.
So. <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 28. 20. and <hi>Agur, Prov.</hi> 30. 8, 9.
Wise Providence considers our condition as <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims</hi>
and <hi>Strangers,</hi> and so allots the <hi>VJaticum</hi>
provision, that is needful for our passage home.
It knows the mischievous influence of fulness and
redundancy upon most men, though sanctified;
and how apt it is to make them remiss, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful
of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 12. that their hearts, like
the <hi>Moon,</hi> suffers an Eclipse when it is at the
full; and so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ts and orders all to their best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
(2.) Its Wisdom is much discovered in
the manner of dispensing our portion to us. It
many times suffers our wants to pinch hard, and
many scars to arise, out of design to magnifie the
care and love of God in the supply, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 3.
Providence so orders the case, that faith and
prayer coming betwixt our wants and supplies,
the goodness of God may be the more magnified
in our eyes thereby.</p>
                  <p>And now let me beg you to consider the good
hand of Providence, that hath provided for, and
suitably supplyed you and yours all your dayes,
and never failed you hitherto: and labour
to walk suitably to your experiences of such
mercies. In order whereunto, let me press
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52858:58"/>
a few suitable Cautions upon you.</p>
                  <p>Beware, that you forget not the care and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
kindness of Providence which your eyes have seen
in so many fruits and experiences thereof. It
was Gods charge against <hi>Israel,</hi> Psal. 106. 3. <hi>that
they soon forgat his</hi> wondrous <hi>works.</hi> A bad heart
and a slippery memory, deprive men of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of many mercies, and defraud God of the
glory due for them.</p>
                  <p>Do not distrust Providence in future exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Thus they did, Psal. 78. 20. <hi>Behold, he
smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
streams overflowed: can he give bread also? can he
provide flesh for his people?</hi> How unreasonable and
absurd are these queries of unbelief, especially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their eyes had seen the power of God in such
extraordinary effects?</p>
                  <p>Do not murmur and regret under new straits.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
This is a vile temper; and yet how incident to
us, when wants press hard upon us! Ah! did we
but rightly understand what the demerit of sin is,
we would rather admire the bounty of God, than
complain of the strait-handedness of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
And if we did but consider, that there
lyes upon God no obligation of Justice or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to reward any of our duties, it would
cure our murmurs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10.</p>
                  <p>Do not shew the least discontent at the lot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
and portion Providence carves out to you. O
that you would be well pleased and satisfied with
all its appointments. Say as Psal. 16. 6. <hi>The lines
are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a
goodly heritage.</hi> Surely that is best for you, which
Providence hath appointed, and one day you
your selves will judge it so to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:52858:59"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Do not neglect Prayer when straits befall you.
You see it's Providence dispenses all, you live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; therefore apply your selves to God in the
times of need. This is evidently included in the
<hi>Promise,</hi> Isa. 41. 17. as well as expressed in the
Command, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. Remember God, and he
will not forget you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Do not distract your hearts with sinful cares,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 25, 26. Consider <hi>the fowls of the Air,</hi>
(saith Christ) not the fowls at the <hi>Door,</hi> that
are daily fed by hand; but those of the <hi>Air,</hi>
that know not where to have the next meal; and
yet God provides for them. Remember your
relation to Christ, and his engagements by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to you, and by these things work your hearts
to satisfaction and content with all the allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Providence.</p>

is <hi>in their preservatJon from the snares, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tJons
of sin, by its preventing care over them.</hi> That
Providence wards off many a deadly stroke of
Temptation, and puts by many a mortal thrust
which Satan makes at our souls, is a truth as
manifest as the light that shineth. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in that promise, 1 Cor. 10. 13. God will
<hi>with the temptatJon make a way to escape, that ye may
be able to bear it.</hi> Providence gives an out-let
for the souls escape, when it is shut up into the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52858:59"/>
dangerous straits of Temptation. There are
two eminent wayes whereby the force and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of temptation is broken in believers. One
is by the operation of internal grace, Gal. 5. 17.
<hi>The Spirit lusteth against the flesh;</hi> so that ye
cannot do the things that ye would (<hi>i. e.</hi>) Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
gives sin a miscarrying womb after it
hath conceived in the soul. The other way, is
by the external working of Providence; and of
this I am here engaged to speak.</p>
                  <p>The Providence of God is the great <hi>Obex</hi> and
hinderance to a world of sin, which else would
break forth like an overflowing flood from our
corrupt natures. It prevents abundance of sin,
which else wicked men would commit, <hi>Gen.
19.</hi> 11. The <hi>Sodomites</hi> were greedily pursuing
their lusts: God providentially hinders it, by
smiting them blind. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> intends to smite
the <hi>Prophet;</hi> Providence interpos'd, and wither'd
his arm, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 4. Thus you see, when
wicked men have contrived, and are ready to
execute their wickedness, Providence claps on
its manacles, <hi>that their hands cannot perform their
enterprises,</hi> as it is <hi>Job</hi> 5. 12.</p>
                  <p>And so much corruption there remains in
good men, that they would certainly plunge
themselves under much more guilt than they do, if
Providence did not take greater care of them than
they do of themselves: for though they make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of keeping themselves, and daily watch
their hearts and wayes, yet such is the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of sin, that if Providence did not lay blocks
in their way, it would (more frequently than
it doth) entangle and defile them. And this
it doth divers wayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:52858:60"/>
(1.) Sometimes by stirring up others to in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terpose
with seasonable counsels, which effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
disswade them from prosecuting an evil
design. Thus <hi>Abigail</hi> meets <hi>David</hi> in the nick
of time, and disswades him from his evil pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 34.</p>
                  <p>And I find it recorded (as on another account
was noted before) of that holy man Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi>
that being late at night in his Study, he was
strongly moved (though at an unseasonable
hour) to visit a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of his acquaintance;
and not knowing what might be the design of
Providence therein, he obeyed, and went; when
he came to the house, after a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ew knocks at the
door, the <hi>Gentleman</hi> himself came to him, and
askt him, whether he had any business to him:
Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> answered, no: but that he could not be
quiet till he had seen him. O Sir, (reply'd the
<hi>Gentleman,</hi>) you are sent of God at this hour, for
just now (and with that, takes the Halter out
of his pokcet,) I was going to destroy my self.
And thus was the mischief prevented.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Sometimes by hindering the Means and
Instruments, whereby the Evil it self is prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Thus, when good <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> had joyned
himself with that wicked King <hi>AhazJah,</hi> to build
Ships at <hi>EzJon-Gaber</hi> to go to <hi>Tarshish,</hi> God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
the design, by breaking the Ships with a
storm, as you read, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 35, 36, 37.</p>
                  <p>We find also in the Life of Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> written
by Mr. <hi>Bagshaw,</hi> That whilst he was in <hi>Oxford,</hi>
he had familiar acquaintance with Mr. <hi>Anderton,</hi>
a good Scholar, but a strong <hi>Papist,</hi> who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi>'s good parts, and perceiving that
he was in some outward wants, took this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52858:60"/>
and used many arguments to perswade him
to be reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to
go over with him to the <hi>English Seminary,</hi> assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him he should be furnished with all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and have gold enough. Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> being at
that time, poor in mind and purse, accepted the
motion, and a day and place was appointed in
<hi>Lancashire,</hi> where they should meet and take ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and be gone: but Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> came not,
and so he escaped the share.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Sometimes by laying some strong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction

And this is the meaning of <hi>Hosea 2. 6. I will hedge
up her way with thorns.</hi> Thus <hi>Basil</hi> was a long
time exercised with a violent head-ach, which
(as he observed) was used by Providence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Lust. <hi>Paul</hi> had a thorn in the flesh, a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
of Satan sent to busset him: and this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,

pride in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.</p>
                  <p>(4.) Sometimes sin is prevented in the Saints,
by the better information of their minds at the
Sacred <hi>Oracles</hi> of God. Thus, when sinful moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
began to rise in <hi>David</hi>'s mind, from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
of the wicked, and his own afflicted
state, and grew to that height, that he began to
think, all he had done in the way of religion, was
little better than lost labour; he is set right
again, and the temptation dissolved, by going
into the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> where God shewed him how
to take new measures of persons and things; to
judge them by their ends and issues, not their

(5.) And sometimes the Providence of God
prevents the sins of his people, by removing them
out of the way of Temptations by death. In
which sense we may understand that Text, Isa.
57. 1. <hi>The Righteous is taken away from the Evil to
come;</hi> the evil of <hi>Sin</hi> as well as <hi>Sufferings.</hi> When
the Lord sees his people low spirited, and not
able to grapple with strong tryals and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which are drawing on, it is with respect to
them a merciful Providence, to be disbanded by
death, and set out of harms way.</p>
                  <p>Now consider, and admire the Providence of
God, O ye Saints, who hath had more care of
your souls, than ever ye had of them. Had not
the Providence of God thus wrought for you in
a way of prevention, it may be you had this day
been so many <hi>Magor Missabibs.</hi> How was the
heart of <hi>David</hi> melted under that preventing
Providence fore-mentioned in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 34. He
blesses the Lord, the Instrument, and the
Counsel by which his soul was preserved from
sin. Do but seriously bethink your selves of a
few particulars about this case. As,</p>
                  <p>(1.) How your corrupt natures have often
impetuously hurried you on towards sin, so that all
the inherent grace you had, could not withstand
its force, if Providence had not prevented it in
some such method as you have heard, Jam. 1. 14.
<hi>Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his
own lusts, and enticed.</hi> You found your selves but
feathers in the wind of temptation.</p>
                  <p>(2.) How near you have been brought to the
brink of sin, and yet saved by a merciful hand
of Providence. May you not say with him in
Prov. 5. 14. <hi>I was almost in the midst of all evil:</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:52858:61"/>
or as Psal. 73. 2. <hi>My feet were almost gone, my
steps had well nigh slidden.</hi> O merciful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence!
that stept in so opportunely to your
relief.</p>
                  <p>(3.) How many have been suffered to fall by
the hand of Temptations to the reproach of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and wounding of their own Consciences,
to that degree, that they have never recovered
former peace again; but lived in the world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
of comfort to their dying day?</p>
                  <p>(4.) How woful your case had been, if the
Lord had not mercifully saved you from many
thousand temptations, that have assaulted you?
I tell you, you cannot estimate the mercies you
possess by means of such Providences. Are your
names sweet, and your Consciences peaceful, two
mercies as dear to you as your two eyes? Why
surely, you owe them, if not wholly, yet in
great measure, to the aids and assistances Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
hath given you all along the way you have
passed through the dangerous tempting World to
this day.</p>
                  <p>Walk therefore suitably to this Obligation of
Providence also: and see,</p>
                  <p>(1.) That you thankfully own it. Don't
impute your escapes from sin to accidents, or to
your own watchfulness or wisdom.</p>
                  <p>(2.) See that you tempt not Providence on
the other hand, by an irregular relyance upon
its care over you, without taking all due care of
your selves. <hi>Keep your selves in the love of God,</hi>
Jude 21. <hi>Keep your hearts with all diligence,</hi> Prov.
4. 23. Though Providence keep you, yet it is
in the way of your duty.</p>

consideration, The perils into which the best of
men sometimes fall, and the way and means by
which Providence preserves them in those
dangers.</p>
                  <p>There are manifold hazards into which we
are often cast in this World. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
gives us a general account of his dangers, in
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. And how great a wonder is it,
that our life hath not been extinguished in
some of those dangers we have been in? For,</p>

(1.) Have not some of us fallen, and that
often into very dangerous sicknesses and diseases,
in which we have approached to the very brink
of the grave? and have or might have said with

                  <p>(4.) To conclude, how innumerable hazards
and accidents, (the least of which hath cut off
others) hath God carried us all through! I think
I may safely say, your privative and positive
mercies of this kind are more in number than the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52858:63"/>
hairs of your heads. Many thousands of these
dangers we never saw, nor were made particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
sensible of; but though we saw them not,
our God did, and brought us out of <hi>danger,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he brought us into <hi>fear.</hi> Some have been
evident to us, and those so remarkable, that we
cannot think, or speak of them to this day,
but our souls are freshly affected with those
mercies.</p>
                  <p>It is recorded of our famous <hi>Jewell,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Clark's Lives, <hi>p.</hi> 262.</note> that
about the beginning of <hi>Queen Mary</hi>'s Reign, the
Inquisition taking hold of him in <hi>Oxford,</hi> he fled
to <hi>London</hi> by night; but providentially losing
the <hi>Road,</hi> he escaped the <hi>Inquisitors</hi> who pursued
him: however, he fell that night into another
eminent hazard of life, for wandering up and
down in the snow, he fainted, and lay starv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the way, panting and labouring for life,
at which time Mr. <hi>Latimer</hi>'s servant found and
saved him.</p>
                  <p>It were easie to multiply Examples in this
kind, Histories abounding with them; but I
think there are few of us, but are furnisht out
of our own experience abundantly; so that I
shall rather chuse to press home the sense of
these Providences upon you, in order to a suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
return to the God of your mercies for them,
than add more Instances of this kind. To this
purpose, I desire you seriously to weigh the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
particulars.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Consider what you owe to Providence
for your protection, by which your life hath been
protracted unto this day, with the usefulness
and comfort thereof. Look abroad in the world,

Providence never quitted its hand of thee

in every place, and kept thee as its charge.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Consider, how every member which hath
been so tenderly kept, hath nevertheless been an
Instrument of sin against the Lord; and that,
not only in the dayes of your unregeneracy, when
<hi>ye yJelded your members as Instruments of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unto sin,</hi> (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks in <hi>Rom.
6. 13.)</hi> but even since you gave them up in
Covenant unto the Lord, as dedicated Instruments
to his service: and yet how tender hath Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
been over them! You have often provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
him to afflict you in every part, and lay <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
evil upon every member that hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
in <hi>moral</hi> evil; but O how great have
his compassions been towards you, and his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
admirable!</p>
                  <p>(3.) Consider, what is the aim of Providence
in all the tender care it hath manifested for you;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52858:64"/>
why doth it protect you so assiduously, and suffer
no evil to befall you? Is it not that you should
imploy your bodies for God, and cheerfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
your selves to that service he hath called you
to? Doubtless, this is the end and level of these
mercies; for else to what purpose are they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
you? Your bodies are a part of Christs
purchase, as well as your souls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. They
are committed to the charge and Tutelage of
Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. who have performed many
services for them. They are dedicated by
your selves to the Lord, and that upon the
highest account, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. They have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

glory and happiness in the world to come,

yea, cheerfully worn out in his service?
How reasonable is it they should be so? Why
are they so tenderly preserved by God, if they
must not be used for God?</p>

the former particulars; but there is an eminent
favour it bestows on the Saints, which hath not
yet been considered, and indeed is too little
minded by us, and that is, <hi>The Aid and assistance
it gives the people of God in the great work of
MortificatJon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mortification of our sinful affections and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
is the one half of our Sanctification, Rom.
6. 11. <hi>dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's the great Evidence of our Interest in Christ.
See <hi>Gal. 5. 24. Rom.</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>It's our safety in the hour of Temptation.
The corruptions in the world are through lust,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>Our Instrumental fitness for service, depends
much upon it, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 21. John</hi> 15. 2. How
great a service to our souls therefore must that
be, by which this blessed work is carried on up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them?</p>
                  <p>Now there are two Means or Instruments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in this work. The <hi>Spirit,</hi> who effects it
<hi>internally, Rom.</hi> 8. 13. And <hi>Providence,</hi> which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
it <hi>externally.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> indeed is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Agent, upon whose operation, the success
of this work depends; and all the Providences
in the world can never effect it without him.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52858:65"/>
But these are secondary and subordinate means,
which by the blessing of the Spirit upon them,
have a great stroke in the work. How they are
so serviceable to this end and purpose, I shall
open in the following account.</p>
                  <p>(1.) More generally. The most wise God
orders the dispensations of Providence in a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
subordination to the work of his Spirit.
There is a sweet harmony betwixt them in their
distinct workings. They all meet in that one
blessed issue which God hath by the counsel of
his Will directed them to, <hi>Eph. 1. 11. Rom.</hi> 8. 28.
Hence it is, that the Spirit is said to be in, and
order the motions of the wheels of Providence,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 20. and so they move together by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
Now, one great part of the Spirit's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
work, being to destroy sin in the people of
God; see how conformable to his design external
Providences are steer'd and order'd in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
particulars.</p>
                  <p>(1.) There is in all the regenerate a strong
propension and inclination to sin, and in that
lyes a principal part of the power of sin. Of
this <hi>Paul</hi> sadly complains, Rom. 7. 23. <hi>But I see
another law in my members<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> warring against the law
of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the
law of sin, which is in my members:</hi> and every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
daily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>inds it to his grief. O 'tis hard,
'tis hard to forbear those things that grieve God.
God hath made an hedge about us, and fenced
us against sin by his Laws; but there is a prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in nature to break over the hedge, and that
against the very reluctations of the Spirit of God
in us. Now, see in this case, the concurrence
and assistance of Providence, for the prevention
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52858:66"/>
of sin; look, as the Spirit internally resists those
sinful inclinations, so Providence externally layes
barrs and blocks in our way to hinder and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
sin: and this is the meaning of those places
lately cited, <hi>Hosea 2. 6. &amp; 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 7. So <hi>Job</hi>
33. 17, 18, 19. There is many a bodily distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
inflicted on this very score, to be a clog to
prevent sin: Oh bear them patiently upon this
consideration. <hi>Basil</hi> was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>orely grieved with an
inveterate head-ach, he earnestly prayes, it might
be removed; God removed it: but no sooner
was he freed of this clog, but he felt the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
motions of lust; which made him pray for
his head-ach again. So it might be with many of
us, if our clogs were off.</p>
                  <p>A Question may be moved here,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>Whether it be
the genJus and property of a gracJous spirit, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
sin, because of the rod of afflictJon?</hi> They have
surely higher motives and nobler principles than
these. This is the temper of a carnal and sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
spirit.</p>
                  <p>Indeed it is so, when this is the sole or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
restraint from sin: when a man abhorrs not
sin, because of the intrinsick <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>ilth,</hi> but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the troublesome <hi>consequents</hi> and <hi>effects.</hi>
But this is vastly different from the case of the
Saints under sanctified afflictions; for as they
have <hi>high<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>r</hi> motives and <hi>nobler</hi> principles, so
they have <hi>lower</hi> and more <hi>sensible</hi> ones too; and
these are, in their kind and place, very useful to
them. (2.) Besides, you must know, that afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
work in another way upon gracious hearts
to restrain them from sin, or warn them against
sin, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>n they do upon others. It is not so much
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52858:66"/>
the smart of the rod which they feel, as the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of Gods displeasure, which affrights and
scares them, <hi>Job 10. 17. Thous renewest thy wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
against me,</hi> &amp;c. and this is that which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
affects them. See Psal. 6. 1. <hi>O Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in
thy hot displeasure:</hi> and Jer. 10. 24. <hi>O Lord, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
me, but with judgement, not in thine anger, lest
thou bring me to nothing:</hi> and surely this is no low
and common argument.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Notwithstanding this double sence of
Gods command, and preventive afflictions, yet
sin is too hard for the best of men: their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
carry them through all to sin. And when
it is so, not only doth the <hi>Spirit</hi> work internally,
but <hi>Providence</hi> also works externally in order to
their <hi>reductJon.</hi> The wayes of sin are not only
made bitter unto them, by the remorse of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
but by those afflictive rods upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, with which God also follows it; and
in both these respects, I find that place expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Eccles. 10. 8. <hi>Whoso breaketh an hedge, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
shall bite him.</hi> If, as some expound it, the
<hi>hedge</hi> be the <hi>Law</hi> of God, then the <hi>Serpent</hi> is the
<hi>remorse</hi> of Conscience, and the sharp teeth of <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictJon,</hi>
which he shall quickly feel, if he be one
that belongs to God.</p>
                  <p>The design and aim of these afflictive Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
is to purge and cleanse them from that
pollution into which temptations have plunged
them, Isa. 27. 9. <hi>By this shall the iniquity of Jacob be
purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his
sin.</hi> To the same purpose is that place, Psal.
119. 67. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went astray, but
now have I kept thy word.</hi> These afflictions have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52858:67"/>
the same use and end to our souls, that frosty
weather hath upon those clothes that are laid
a bleaching; they alter the hue, and make it
whiter, which seems to be the allusion in those
words, Dan. 11. 35. <hi>And some of them of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
shall fall to try them, and to purge, and to
make them white.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And here it may be querJed,</hi>

                        </gap>.</note> Upon what account
afflictions are said to purge away the iniquities of
the Saints. Is it not unwarrantable, and very disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to Christ, to attribute that to affliction, which
is the peculiar honour of his blood?</p>
                  <p>It is confessed,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> that the blood of Christ is the
only <hi>Lavatory,</hi> or Fountain opened for sin, and
that no afflictions how many, or strong, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
soever they be, can in themselves purge
away the pollution of sin, as we see in wicked
men, who are afflicted and afflicted, and again
afflicted; and yet, nevertheless sinful: and the
Torments of Hell, how extream, universal and
continual soever they are, yet shall never fetch
out the stain of one sin.</p>
                  <p>But yet, this hinders not, but that a sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ied
affliction, may in the efficacy and vertue of <hi>Christs</hi>
blood, produce such blessed effects upon the
soul. Though a <hi>Cross</hi> without a <hi>Christ,</hi> never did
any man good, yet thousands have been beholden
to the <hi>Cross,</hi> as it hath wrought in the vertue of
his death for their good. And this is the case
of those souls that this discourse is concerned
about.</p>
                  <p>(3.) We find the best hearts, if God bestow
any comfortable enjoyment upon them, too ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>
to be over-heated in their affections towards it<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:52858:67"/>
and to be too much taken up with these outward
comforts. This also sheweth the great power
and strength of corruption in the people of God,
and must by some means or other be morti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ied in
them.</p>
                  <p>This was the case of <hi>HezekJah,</hi> his heart was
too much affected with his treasures; so that he
could not hide a vain-glorious temper, as you find
<hi>Isa.</hi> 39. 2. and so good <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 30. 7. he
thought his Mountain, (<hi>i.e.</hi> his Kingdom, and
the splendour and glory of his present state) had
stood so fast, that it should never be moved.</p>
                  <p>The same good man, how did he let out his
heart and affections upon his beautiful Son <hi>Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom?</hi>
as appears by the doleful lamentation he
made at his death, prizing him above his own
life, which was a thousand times more worth
than he.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Jonah,</hi> when God raised up a <hi>Gourd</hi> for
him to shelter him from the Sun, how excessively
was he taken with it, and was exceedingly glad
of it?</p>
                  <p>But will God suffer things to lye thus? Shall

from him? No, this is our corruption,
and God will purge it. And to this end he sends
forth Providence to smite those Creatures, on
which our affections are either inordinately or
excessively let out, or else to turn them into rods,
and smite us by them.</p>

Exchequer? Why, those very <hi>BabylonJans</hi> to whom
he boasted of it, shall empty it, and make a prey
of it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 39. 6.</p>
                  <p>Is <hi>David</hi> hugging himself in a fond conceit of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52858:68"/>
the stability of his Earthly Splendor? Lo, how
soon God beclouds all, <hi>Psal. 30. 7. Is Absalom</hi>
doted on, and crept too far into his good Fathers
heart? this shall be the Son of his sorrow, that
shall seek after his Fathers life.</p>
                  <p>Is <hi>Jonah</hi> so transported with his Gourd? God
will prepare a Worm to smite it, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>How many Husbands, Wives and Children
hath Providence smitten upon this very account?
It might have spared them longer, if they had
been loved more regularly, and moderately.
This hath blasted many an Estate, and hopeful
project; and it is a merciful dispensation for
our good.</p>
                  <p>(4.) The strength of our unmortified Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
shews it self in our pride, and the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vanity of our hearts when we have a name
and esteem among men; when we are applauded
and honoured, when we are admired for any gift
or excellency that is in us, this draws forth the
pride of the heart, and shews the vanity that is in
it. So you read, Prov. 27. 21. <hi>As the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>urnace for<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> gold, so is a man to

                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ornace will discover
what dross is in the metal when it is melted, so
will praise and commendations, discover what
pride is in the heart of him that receives them.
This made a good man say, <hi>He that praises me,
wounds me.</hi> And which is more strange, this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
may be felt in the heart, even when the
last breath is ready to expire. It was the saying
of one of the <hi>German Divines,</hi> when those about
him recounted for his encouragement the many
services he had done for God, <hi>auferte ignem</hi> (saith
he) <hi>adhuc enim paleas habeo. Take away the sire,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52858:68"/>
for there is still the chaff of pride in me.</hi> To
crucifie this corruption Providence takes off
the bridle of restraint from ungodly men, and
sometimes permits them to traduce the names
of Gods servants, as <hi>Shimei</hi> did <hi>David</hi>'s. Yea,
they shall fall into disesteem among their friends,
as <hi>Paul</hi> did among the <hi>CorinthJans;</hi> and all this to
keep down the swelling of their spirits at the
sense of those excellencies that are in them: The
design of these Providences being nothing else,
but to <hi>hide pride from man.</hi> Yea, it deserves a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
remarque, that when some good men have
been engaged in a publick and eminent work,
and have therein, it may be, too much sought
their own applause, God hath withheld usual as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
at such times from them, and caused them
to salter so in their work, that they have come
off with shame and pity at such times, how ready
and presential soever they have been at other
times. It were easie to give divers remarkable
examples to confirm this Observation. But I
pass on.</p>
                  <p>(5.) The corruption of the heart shews it
self, in raising up great expectations to our selves
from the Creature, and projecting abundance of
felicity and contentment from some promising
and hopeful enjoyments we have in the world.
This we find to have been the case of holy <hi>Job</hi> in
the dayes of his prosperity, Job 28. 19. <hi>Then I
said, I shall dye in my nest, I shall multiply my dayes
as the sand.</hi> But how soon were all these expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ions
dasht by a gloomy Providence, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted
him in the Noon-tide of his prosperity:
and all this for his good, to take off his heart
more fully from creature expectations. We
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52858:69"/>
often find, the best men to over-reckon themselves
in worldly things, and over-act their confidences
about them. They that have great and well-grounded
expectations from <hi>Heaven,</hi> may have
too great and ungrounded expectations from the
<hi>Earth.</hi> But when it is so, it's very usual for
Providence to undermine their Earthly hopes,
and convince them by experience how vain they
are. Thus <hi>Haggai</hi> 1. 9. the peoples hearts were
intently set upon prosperous Providences, full
Harvests, and great Increase; whilst in the mean
while no regard was had to the Worship of
God, and the things of his House; therefore
Providence blasts their hopes, and brings them
to little.</p>
                  <p>(6.) Corruption discovers it self in depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon Creature comforts, and sensible props.
Oh how apt are the best men, to lean upon these
things, and stay themselves upon them! Thus
did <hi>Israel</hi> stay themselves upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> as a feeble
man would lean upon his staff; but God suffered
it both to fail them, and wound them, <hi>Ezek. 29.
6,</hi> 7, 8. So for single persons, how apt are they
to depend upon their sensible supports? Thus
we lean on our Relations, and the inward
thoughts of our hearts are, that they shall be to
us so many springs of comfort to refresh us
throughout our lives; but God will shew us by
his Providence our mistake and error in these
things. Thus an Husband is smitten, to draw
the soul of a Wife nearer to God in dependence
upon him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 5. So for Children, we are
apt to say of this or that <hi>Child,</hi> as <hi>Lamech</hi> of
<hi>Noah,</hi> Gen.5. 29. <hi>This same shall comfort us;</hi> but
the wind passes over these slowers and they are
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52858:69"/>
withered, to teach us, that our happiness is not
bound up in these enjoyments. So for our
<hi>Estates,</hi> when the world smiles upon us, and we
have got a warm nest, how do we prophesie of
rest and peace in those acquisitions, minding,
with good <hi>Baruch,</hi> great things for our selves;
but Providence by a particular or general calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
over-turns our projects, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 45. 4, 5. and
all this to reduce our hearts from the Creature, to
God our only rest.</p>
                  <p>(7.) Corruption discovers its strength in
good men, by their <hi>adherence</hi> to things below,
and lothness to go hence. This often proceeds

               <p>HAving proved the Concernments of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God to be conducted by the care of
special Providence, and given Instances in the ten
last named Heads, what influence Providence
hath upon those Interests and concerns of theirs
among the rest; we come in the next place, to
prove it to be the duty of the people of God, to
reflect upon these performances of Providence
for them, at all times; but especially in times of
straits and troubles.</p>
               <p>This I will evidence to be your unquestionable
duty, by the following particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> This is our duty, because God hath expresly
commanded it, and called his people to make
the most serious reflections, and animadversions
upon his works, whether of mercy or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
So when that dreadfullest of all Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
was executed upon his professing people
for their Apostasie from God, and God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
the Symbols of his presence from among
them, the rest are bid to go, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) by their
meditations, (to send at least their thoughts) to
<hi>Shiloh,</hi> and <hi>see what God did to it,</hi> Jer. 7. 12. So
for mercies, God calls us to consider and review
them, Micah 6. 5. <hi>Remember O my people from Shit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim
unto Gilgal, that ye may know the faithfulness of
the Lord: q. d.</hi> if you reflect not upon that signal
Providence, my faithfulness will be covered, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52858:72"/>
your unfaithfulness discovered. So for Gods
works of Providence about the Creatures, we are
called to consider them, that we may prop up
our faith by those considerations for our own
supplies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 28. consider the Fowls and
Lillies.</p>
               <p>It's plain, that this is our duty, because the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
neglect of it is every where in Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as a sin. To be of an heedless inobser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
temper is very displeasing to God; and so
much appears by that Scripture, Isa. 26. 11. <hi>Lord
when thy hand is lifted up they will not see.</hi> Nay, it
is a sin, which God threatens and denounces woe
against in his Word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 28. 4, 5. and <hi>Isa. 5.
12,</hi> 13. Yea, God not only threatens, but smites
men with visible Judgements for this sin, <hi>Job
34.</hi> 26, 27.</p>
               <p>And for this end and purpose it is, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Holy Ghost hath affixed those notes of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the narratives of the works of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in <hi>Scripture:</hi> all which do invite and call
men to a due and deep observation of them. So
in that great and celebrated work of Providence,
in delivering <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>EgyptJan</hi> bondage, you
find a note of <hi>attentJon</hi> twice affixed to it, <hi>Exod.
3.</hi> 2, 9. So when that daring Enemy <hi>Rabsheka</hi>

is a note of <hi>attentJon</hi> prefixt to that Providence,

Saints use to argue to fresh and new ones to
come. So <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 17. 37. <hi>The Lord that
delivered me out of the paw of the Lyon, and out of
the paw of the Bear, he will deliver me out of the
hand of this Philistin.</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 10. <hi>Who

will yet deliver.</hi> If these be forgotten o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Matth. 16. 9. <hi>How is it that ye do not remember<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
neither consider?</hi> This is a <hi>Topick</hi> from which
the Saints have used to draw their Arguments in
prayer for new mercies. As <hi>Moses,</hi> Numb. 14. 19.
when he prayes for continued or new pardon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>
for the people, he argues from what was past,
<hi>As thou hast forgiven them from Egypt until now.</hi>
So the Church, <hi>Isa.</hi> 51. 9, 10. argues for new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
upon the same ground <hi>Moses</hi> pleaded for
new pardons.</p>
               <p>It is a vile slighting of God<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> not to observe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
what of himself he manifests in his Providences.
For in all Providences, especially in some, he
comes nigh to us. He doth so in his Judgements,
Mal. 3. 5. <hi>I will come nigh to you in judgement.</hi>
He comes nigh in mercies also, Psal. 145. 18.
<hi>The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon
him,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, he is said to visit us by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
when he corrects, <hi>Hosea</hi> 9. 7. and when
he saves and delivers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 4. These visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of God preserve our spirits, <hi>Job.</hi> 10. 12.
And it is a wonderful condescension in the great
God to visit us so o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for whom you have any respect. It's the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of the wicked, not to regard Gods favours,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 10. or frowns, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 3.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> In a word<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> men can never order their addresses
to God in prayer, suitable to their conditions,
without due <hi>observatJon</hi> of his Providences. Your
prayers are to be suitable to your conditions:
sometimes we are called to praise, sometimes to
humiliation. In the way of his Judgements you
are to wait for him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 8. to prepare to meet
him, <hi>Zeph. 2. 1, 2. Amos</hi> 4. 12. Now your busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

his Providences towards you, that will pass with
God, for a discharge of this great duty. No,
no, it is another manner of business than the most
of men understand it to be. O that we were but
acquainted with this heavenly spiritual exercise!
how sweet would it make our lives! how light
would it make our burdens! Ah Sirs! you live
estranged from the pleasure of the Christian life,
while you live in the ignorance or neglect of this
duty. Now to lead you up to this heavenly,
sweet and profitable exercise, I will beg your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to the following Directions.</p>

the Providences of God about you from first to

Providence be so ravishing and transporting, what
would many such be, if they were presented to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52858:75"/>
to the view of the soul? If one <hi>Star</hi> be so
beautiful to behold, what is a <hi>ConstellatJon?</hi> Let
your reflections therefore upon the acts and
workings of Providence for you, be full <hi>extensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>intensively.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1.) Let them be as <hi>extensively</hi> full as may be<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
Search backward into all the performances of
Providence throughout your lives. So did <hi>Asaph</hi>
in Psal. 77. 11, 12. <hi>I will remember the works of the
Lord: surely I will remember thy wonders of old: I
will meditate of all thy works, and talk of thy
doings.</hi> He laboured to recover and revive the
ancient Providences of God, mercies many years
past, and suck a fresh sweetness out of them by
new reviews of them. Ah Sirs, let me tell you,
there is not such a pleasant <hi>History</hi> for you to
read in all the world, as the <hi>History</hi> of your own
lives, if you would but sit down, and record to
your selves from the beginning hitherto, what
God hath been to you, and done for you; what
signal manifestations, and out-breakings of his
mercy, faithfulness and love, there have been in
all the conditions you have past through: if your
hearts do not melt before you have gone half
through that History, they are hard hearts indeed.
<hi>My father, the guide of my youth.</hi>

                        </gap> therein,</hi> Psal.
111. 2. Not that I think it feasible to sound the
depth of Providence by our short line, Psal. 77. 19.
<hi>Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and thy footsteps are not known;</hi> but it's our
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52858:75"/>
duty to dive as far as we can; and to admire the
depth, when we cannot touch the bottom. It is
in our viewing Providences, as it was with <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>'s
servant, when he looked out for rain,
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 44. he went out once and viewed
the Heavens, and saw nothing; but the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Prophet</hi>
bids him go again and again, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>and look upon the
face of Heaven seven times; and when he had
done so, what now, saith the <hi>Prophet?</hi> O now,
saith he, <hi>I see a cloud rising like a mans hand;</hi> and
then, keeping his eye upon it intent, he sees the
whole face of Heaven covered with clouds. So
you may look upon some Providences once and
again, and see little or nothing in them; but
look <hi>seven times,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>meditate often</hi> upon it,
and you shall see its increasing glory, like that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
cloud.</p>
                  <p>There are divers things to be distinctly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and valued in one single Providence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you can judge the amount and worth of it:
as (1.) The <hi>seasonableness</hi> of mercy may give it a
very great value. When it shall be timed so
opportunely, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>all out in such a nick, as may
make it a thousand fold more considerable to you
than the same mercy would have been at another
time. Thus when our wants are suffered to
grow to an extremity, and all visible hopes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ail,
then to have relief given in, wonderfully enhances
the price of such a mercy, <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>(2.) The <hi>peculJar care</hi> and kindness of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to us, is a consideration which exceedingly
heightens the mercy in it self, and endears it to
us. So, when in general calamities upon the
world, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap> are exempted by the favour of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
covered under its wings; when God shall
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52858:76"/>
call to us in evil dayes, <hi>Come my people, enter thou
into thy chambers,</hi> as it is in <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 20, 21. When
such <hi>Promises</hi> shall be fulfilled to us in times of
want and famine, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 18, 19. When
others are abandoned and exposed to misery, who
have every way as much, it may be much more
visible security against it; and yet they delivered
up, and we saved: Oh, how endearing are such
Providences! <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>(3.) The <hi>Introductiveness</hi> of a Providence, is
of special regard and consideration, and by no
means to be neglected by us. There are lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Providences, which how slight and trivial so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they may seem in themselves, yet in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
justly challenge the first rank among Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
favours to us; because they usher in a
multitude of other mercies, and draw a blessed
train of happy consequences after them. Such a
Providence was that of <hi>Jesse</hi>'s sending <hi>David</hi> with
provisions to his Brethren that lay encamped in
the Army, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 17. And thus every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
may furnish himself out of his own stock of
Experience, if he will but reflect, and consider,
the Place where he is, the Relations that he hath,
and the Way by which he was led into them.</p>
                  <p>(4.) The <hi>Instruments</hi> imployed by Providence
for you, are of special consideration. And the
finger of God is clearly seen by us when we pursue
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>hat meditation. For,</p>
                  <p>Sometimes great mercies shall be conveyed to
us by very improbable means, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
ones laid aside. A <hi>stranger</hi> shall be stirred
up to do that for you, which your near relations
in nature had no power or will to do for you.
<hi>Jonathan,</hi> a meer stranger to <hi>David,</hi> clave closer
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52858:76"/>
to him, and was more friendly and useful to him,
than his own Brethren, who despised and slighted
him. Ministers have found more kindness and
respect from strangers, than their own people that
are more obliged to them, Mark 6. 4. <hi>A Prophet</hi>
(saith Christ) <hi>is not without honour, save in his
own Countrey, and among his own Kin, and in his
own House.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes by the hands of <hi>EnemJes,</hi> as well as
Strangers, Rev. 12. 16. <hi>The Earth helped the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
God hath bowed the hearts of many
wicked men, to shew great kindness to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Acts</hi> 28. 2.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes God makes use of Instruments for
good to his people, who designed nothing but
evil and mischief to them. Thus <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
were instrumental to his advancement,
in <hi>that very thing,</hi> wherein they designed his
<hi>ruine, Gen.</hi> 50. 20.</p>
                  <p>(5.) The <hi>design</hi> and <hi>scope</hi> of Providence must
not e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ape our through consideration, what the
aim and level of Providence is. And truly this,
of all others, is the most warming and melting
consideration. You have the general account of
the aim of all Providences, in Rom. 8. 28. <hi>And
we know that all things work together for good, to
them that love God.</hi> A thousand friendly hands
are at work for them, to promote and bring about
their happiness. O, this is enough to sweeten
the bitterest Providence to us, that we know it
shall turn to our salvation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
                  <p>(6.) The <hi>respect</hi> and <hi>relatJon</hi> Providence bears
to our <hi>prayers,</hi> is of singular consideration, and
a most taking and sweet meditation. <hi>Prayer</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
Providence, and Providence honours
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52858:77"/>
Prayer. Great notice is taken of this in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<hi>Gen. 24. 45. Dan. 9. 20. Acts</hi> 12. 12. You
have had the <hi>very PetitJons</hi> you <hi>asked</hi> of him. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
have born the very signatures of your
Prayers upon them. O how affectingly sweet
are such mercies!</p>

                  <p>IN all your Observations of Providence, have a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
respect to that Word of God, which is fulfilled
and made good to you thereby.</p>
                  <p>This is a clear truth, that all Providences have
relation to the written Word. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> in
his prayer, acknowledges, that the Promises and
Providences of God went along step by step with
his Father <hi>David</hi> all his dayes; and that his

                        </gap> Kings
8.</hi> 24. So <hi>Joshuah</hi> in like manner acknowledges,
that <hi>not one good thing had failed, of all the good
things which the Lord had spoken,</hi> Jos. 23. 14. He
had carefully observed what relation the <hi>Works</hi> of
God had to his <hi>Word.</hi> He compared them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and found an exact harmony. And so
may you too, if you will compare them as he
did.</p>
                  <p>This I shall the more insist upon, because it
is by some <hi>Interpreters</hi> supposed to be the very
Scope of the Text. For (as was noted in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication)
they supply and fill the sense with
<hi>quae promisit,</hi> the things which he hath promised;
and so read the Text thus, <hi>I will cry unto God
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52858:77"/>
most high, to God who performeth</hi> the things he hath
promised, <hi>for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now though I see no reason to limit the sense
so narrowly, yet it cannot be denyed, but this is
an especial part of its intendment. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in all our reviews of Providence, consider,
what word of God, whether it be of threatning,
caution, counsel, or promise is at any time made
good to us by his Providences. And hereby a
twofold excellent advantage will result to us.</p>
                  <p>(1.) This will greatly confirm to us the truth
of the Scripture, when we shall see its truth so
manifest in the events. Certainly had <hi>Scripture</hi>
no other seal or attestation, this alone would be
an unanswerable Argument of its divinity. When
men shall find in all ages the works of God
wrought so exactly according to this model,
that we may say, As we have read or heard,
so have we seen. O how great a con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>irmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is here before our eyes!</p>
                  <p>(2.) This will abundantly direct and instruct
us in our present duties under all Providences.
We shall know hereby what we have to do, and
how to carry our selves under all changes of
conditions. You can learn the voice and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>rrand
of the <hi>rod</hi> only from the Word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 12. The
Word interprets the works of God. Providences
in themselves, are not a perfect guide. They
often puzzle and entangle our thoughts; but
bring them to the Word, and your duty will be
quickly manifested, as <hi>Psal. 73. 16, 17. Vntil I
went into the Sanctuary, then I understood their end:</hi>
and, not only their <hi>end;</hi> but his own <hi>duty,</hi> to be
quiet in an afflicted condition, and not envy their
prosperity.</p>

                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:52858:78"/>
Well then, bring those Providences you have
past through, or are now under, to the Word;
and you will find your selves surrounded with a
marvellous light; and see the verification of the
Scriptures in them. I shall therefore here appeal
to your consciences, whether you have not
found these Events of Providence falling out
agreeably in all respects with the Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Word tells you, that it is your Wisdom
and Interest, to keep close to its rules, and the
duties it prescribes, that the way of holiness and
obedience, is the wisest way, Deut. 4. 5, 6. <hi>This
is your wisdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, let the events of Providence speak, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be true or not. Certainly it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be so, whether we respect our <hi>present
comfort,</hi> or <hi>future happiness,</hi> both which we may
see daily exposed by departure from duty, and
secured by keeping close to it. Let the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<hi>Swearer,</hi> when by sin they have ruined bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
soul, estate and name, whether it be their
wisdom to walk in those forbidden paths after
their own lusts? Whether they had not better
consulted their own interest and comfort, in
keeping within the bounds and limits of Gods
commands? and they cannot but confess, that
<hi>this their way is their folly. What fruit</hi> (saith the
Apostle) <hi>had ye in those things, whereof you are
now ashamed? for the end of those things is death,</hi>
Rom. 6. 21. Doth not the Providence of God
verifie upon them those threatnings that are
written, in the experience of all ages? <hi>Prov.
23. 29. Prov. 23. 21. Prov. 5. 9. Job 31. 12.
Prov.</hi> 5. 10. all which woes and miseries they

escape, that walk in Gods Statutes. Look upon
the ruined estates and bodies you may every

evidently made good in those sad Providences.</p>
                  <p>The Word tells you, that your departure from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the way of integrity and simplicity, to make
use of sinful policies, shall never profit you,
1 <hi>Sam. 12. 21. Prov.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                  <p>Let the Events of Providence speak to this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so;
ask your own experience, and you shall have
a full confirmation of this truth. Did you ever
leave the way of simplicity and integrity, and
use sinful shifts, to bring about your own designs,
and prosper in that way? Certainly God hath
cursed all the wayes of sin; and whoever finds
them to thrive with them, his people shall not.
<hi>Israel</hi> would not rely upon the Lord, but trust
in the shadow of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and what advantage
had they by this sinful policy? See <hi>Isa. 30. 1, 2,
3, 4, 5. David</hi> used a great deal of sinful policy
to cover his wicked fact; but did it prosper?
See 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 12. It is an excellent note of
<hi>Livy, ConsilJa callida, prim√¢ specJe l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dura, eventu tristJa.</hi> Sinful policies in their first
appearances, are pleasant and promising, in their
management difficult, in their event sad. Some
by sinful wayes have gotten wealth; but that
Scripture hath been verified in their experience,
Prov. 10. 2. <hi>Treasures of wickedness profit nothing.</hi>
Either God hath blown upon it by a secret curse,
that it hath done them no good, or given them
such disquietness in their consciences, that they
have been forced to vomit it up, e're they could
find peace, <hi>Job</hi> 11. 13, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>That which <hi>David</hi> gave in charge to <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:52858:79"/>
hath been found experimentally true by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 12, 13. That the true way to
prosperity, is to keep close to the rule of the
Word. And that the true reason why men
cannot prosper, is their forsaking that rule,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 20.</p>
                  <p>It's true, if God have a purpose to destroy a
man, he may for a time suffer him to succeed and
prosper in his sin, for his greater hardening,
<hi>Job</hi> 12. 6. But it is not so with those whom
the Lord loves; their sinful shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Did you ever lean upon an <hi>EgyptJan</hi> reed,
and it did not break under you, and pierce as

evident in our experience! Whatsoever we have
over-loved, idolized,<note place="margin">‚òû</note> and leaned upon, God hath

30.</hi> 6, 7. O how true and faithful do we find
these sayings of God to be! Who cannot put to

                  </p>
                  <p>The Word assures us, that sin is the Cause and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

an inseparable connection betwixt them, Numb.
32. 23. <hi>Be sure your sin will find you out: (i. e.)</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Enquire now at the mouth of Providence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be indeed so, according to the reports
of the Word. Ask but your own Experiences,
and you shall find, that just so Providence hath
ordered it all along your way. When did you
grow into a secure, vain, carnal frame, but you
found some rouzing, startling Providence sent to
awaken you? When did you wound your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
with guilt, and God did not wound you
for it, in some or other of your beloved enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
Nay, so ordinary is this with God, that

troubles at hand.</p>
                  <p>I do not say, that God never afflicts his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

every sin with a rod; for who then should
stand before him? <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 3. But this I say,
that it's Gods usual way, to visit the sins of his
people with rods of affliction, and this in mercy
to their souls. Upon this account it was, that
the rod of God was upon <hi>David</hi> in a long succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of troubles upon his Kingdom and family,
after that great prevarication of his, 2 <hi>Sam.
12.</hi> 10. And if we would carefully search out the
seeds and principles of those miseries under which
we or ours do groan; we should find them to be
our own turnings aside from the Lord, according
to that <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 19. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 18. Have not all
these cautions, and threatnings of the Word been
exactly fulfilled by Providence in your own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience?
Who can but see the infallible truth of
God in all that he hath threatned! And no less
evident is the truth of the Promises to all that
will observe how Providence makes them good
every day to us; for consider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                     <hi>How great security God hath given to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the Promises, that no man shall lose any
thing by self-denyal for his sake. He hath told
us, Mark</hi> 10. 29, 30. Verily, I say unto you, there
is no man that hath left House, or Brethren, or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or
Lands for my sake, and the Gospels; but he shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an hundred fold now in this time, houses, and
Brethren and Sisters, and Mothers, and Children, and
Lands with persecutions, and in the world to come
Eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Though that vile Apostate <hi>JulJan</hi> derided this
Promise, yet thousands and ten thousands have
experienced it, and do at this day stand ready to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52858:80"/>
set their seal to it. God hath made it good to
his people, not only in <hi>spirituals;</hi> inward joy,
and peace; but even in <hi>Temporals</hi> also: instead
of natural relations who took care for them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
hundreds of <hi>ChristJans</hi> shall stand ready to
assist and help them: So that though they have
left all for <hi>Christ,</hi> yet they may say with the
<hi>Apostle,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 10. <hi>As having nothing, and yet
possessing all things.</hi> O the admirable care and
tenderness of Providence over those that for
Conscience sake have lest all, and cast themselves
upon its immediate care! Are there not at this
day to be found many so provided for, even to
the envy of their Enemies, and their own admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
Who sees not the faithfulness of God
in the Promises, that hath but an heart to trust
God in them!</p>

                  <p>Consult the various Providences of your life
in this point, and I doubt not, but you will find
the truth of these Promises as often confirmed, as
you have been in trouble. Ask your own hearts,
where, or when was it that your God forsook
you, and left you to sink and perish under your
burdens? I doubt not, but most of you have been
at one time or other plunged in difficulties, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
out of which you could see no way of
escape by the eye of reason; yea, such, as it
may be, staggered your faith in the Promise, as
<hi>David</hi>'s was, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 1. when he said, <hi>I shall
one day perish by the hand of Saul. All men are

all, we see him emerge out of that Sea of
trouble, and the Promises made good in every
tittle to him. The like doubtless you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in your own cases. Ask your own souls
the question, and they will satisfie it. Did God
abandon and cast you off in the day of your
straits? certainly you must belye your own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
if you should say so. 'Tis true, there have
been some plunges and difficulties you have met
with, wherein (1.) You could see no way of
escape, but concluded you must perish in them.
(2.) Difficulties that have staggered your faith in
the Promises, and made you doubt, whether the
fountain of All-sufficiency would let out it self
for your relief. (3.) Yea, such difficulties as have
provoked you to murmuring and impatience, and
thereby provoked the Lord to forsake you in
your straits; but yet you see he did not. He hath
either (1.) Strengthened your back to bear, or
(2.) Lightened your burden, or (3.) Opened an
unexpected door of escape, according to that
Promise, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. so that the evil which you
feared, came not upon you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> You read, that the Word of God is the only

                  <p>The Word tells us, that there is no such way <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
to improve our Estates, as to lay them out with
a cheerful liberality for God; and that our with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding

                  <p>Consult Providence now, and you shall find it
in all respects according to the report of the
Word. O how true is the Scripture testimony
herein! There are many thousand Witnesses now
living, that can set their seals to both parts of
this proposition. What men save (as they
count saving) with one hand, Providence scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
by another hand: and what they scatter
abroad with a liberal hand and single eye for
God, is surely repay'd to them or theirs. Never
did any man lose by distributing for God. He
that lends to the poor <hi>foeneratur Domino,</hi> as some

enough thus to acknowledge him in a general
way; but when you receive mercies, take special
notice of the following particulars.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Eye the Care of God for you, 1 Pet. 5. 7.
<hi>He careth for you. Your Father knows you have
need of these things,</hi> Matth. 6. 32. It is but to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint

not your selves about it: you have a Father that

dispensing his mercies to you, how <hi>suitably</hi> they
are ordered to your condition, and how seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably.
When one comfort is cut off and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
another is raised up in its room. Thus

said <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(4.) Eye the Condescension of God, to your
requests for those mercies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 6. This is
the sweetest bit in any enjoyment, in which a
man can sensibly relish the return and answer of
his Prayers, and greatly inflames the souls love to
God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 1.</p>
                  <p>(5.) Eye the Design and end of God in all your
comforts. Know that it is not sent to satisfie the
cravings of your sensual appetite, but to quicken
and enable you for a more cheerful discharge of
your duty, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 47.</p>
                  <p>(6.) Eye the Way and Method in which your
mercies are conveyed to you. They all slow to
you through the blood of <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> of
grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. Mercies derive their
sweetness from the Channel through which they
run to us.</p>
                  <p>(7.) Eye the Distinguishing goodness of God,
in all the comfortable enjoyments of your lives.
How many thousand better than you, are denyed
those Comforts? See <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 37.</p>
                  <p>(8.) Eye them all as comforts appointed to
refresh you in your way to far better and greater
mercies than themselves. The best mercies are
still reserved till last, and all these are introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to better.</p>

115. 3. which is the most conclusive reason and
argument of submission, <hi>Psal.</hi> 46. 10. For if we,
and all we have, proceeded from his Will, how

many years agone since we were not, and when it

we had no liberty of indenting with him, on

abject and miserable among men: and when you
had run through all the miseries of this life, have

There are two sorts of mercies that are seldom

in us to prevent utter ruine, and stop God in
the way of his anger, we know this is the means
to do it, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 12.</p>
                  <p>HOw sad and dismal soever the face of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
be, yet still maintain spiritual joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in God under all. Though there be no herd in

in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>There are two sorts of Comforts, <hi>Natural</hi> and
<hi>Sensitive, Divine</hi> and <hi>Spiritual.</hi> There is a time
when it becomes <hi>ChristJans</hi> to exercise both; so
<hi>Hest.</hi> 9. 22. And there is a time when the former
is to be suspended and laid by, <hi>Psal.</hi> 137. 2. But
there is no season, wherein spiritual joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in God is unseasonable, as appears by those
Scriptures, 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 16. Phil.</hi> 4. 4. This spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
joy or comfort, is nothing else but the cheeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our heart in God, and the sense of our
interest in him, and in his Promises. And it's
sure, that no Providence can render this unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to a Christian. Let us suppose the most
afflicted and calamitous state a Christian can be
incident to, yet,</p>
                  <p>(1.) Why should sad Providences make him
lay by his comforts in God? when as those
are but for a moment, but these eternal, 2 <hi>Cor.
4.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Why should we lay by our joy in God,
upon the account of sad Providences without,
when at the very worst and lowest ebb, the
Saints have infinitely more cause to rejoyce, than
to be cast down? There's more in one of their
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52858:86"/>
mercies to comfort them, than in all their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to deject them. All your losses are but as
the loss of a <hi>farthing</hi> to a <hi>Prince, Rom.</hi> 8. 18.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Why should they be sad, as long as their
God is with them in all their troubles? As <hi>Christ</hi>
said, Matth. 9. 15. <hi>Can the Children of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
be sad, whilest the Bridegroom is with them?</hi>
So say I, Can the soul be sad, whilest God is
with it? Oh methinks, that one Promise, Psal.
91. 15. <hi>I will be with him in trouble,</hi> should bear
you up under all burdens. Let them be cast
down, that have no God in trouble to turn to.</p>
                  <p>(4.) Why should they be sad, as long as no
outward dispensation of Providence, (be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so sad) can be interpreted as a mark or sign
of Gods hatred or Anger, Eccl. 9. 2, 3. <hi>There is
one event to the righteous and wicked.</hi> Indeed, if
it were a signification of the Lords wrath against
a man, it would justifie our dejection; but this
cannot be so: his heart is full of love, whilest
the face of Providence is full of frowns.</p>
                  <p>(5.) Why should we be cast down under sad
Providences, whilst we have so great security,
that even by the hands of these Providences God
will do us good, and all these things shall <hi>turn to
our salvatJon?</hi> Rom. 8. 28. By these God is but
killing your lusts, weaning your hearts from a
vain world, preventing temptations, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
your desires after heaven; this is all the
hurt they shall do you, and shall that sadden us?</p>
                  <p>(6.) Why should we lay by our joy in God,
when as the change of our condition is so nigh?
It's but a little while, and sorrows shall flee away:
you shall never suffer more: <hi>God will wipe away
all tears,</hi> Revel. 7. 17. Well then, you see there's
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52858:86"/>
no reason upon the account of Providence, to
give up your joy and comfort in God. But if you
will maintain it under all Providences, then be
careful</p>
                  <p>(1.) To Clear up your Interest in, and Title
to God. <hi>Faith</hi> may be separated from comfort,
but assurance cannot.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Mortifie your inordinate affections to
earthly things. This makes Providences that
deprive and cross us so heavy. Mortifie your
opinion and affection, and you sensibly lighten
your affliction. It is strong affection that makes
strong affliction.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Dwell much upon the meditation of the
Lords near approach; and then all these things
will seem but trifles to you. <hi>Let your moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

with which the Lord exercises you in this
world,</hi> Gen. 6. 9. <hi>Noah</hi> walked with God, yet
met with as sad Providences in his day, as any
man that ever lived since his time. But alas!
we find most Providences, rather <hi>stops,</hi> than <hi>steps</hi>
in our walk with God. If we be under comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Providences, how sensual, wanton and
worldly do our hearts grow! And if sad Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
befall us, how dedolent or distracted are
we! And this comes to pass partly through the
<hi>narrowness,</hi> but mostly, through the <hi>deceitfulness</hi>
of our spirits. Our hearts are narrow, and know
not how to manage two businesses of such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

frame of spirit is attainable that will enable us to
keep on in an even and steddy course with God,

as most men we read of; yet how spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
the temper of his heart was, that excellent
<hi>Book of Psalms,</hi> (which was mostly composed
amidst those distractions) will acquaint us. The
<hi>Apostles</hi> were cast into as great necessities, and
suffered as hard things, as ever men did; yet
how raised and heavenly their spirits were amidst
all, who sees not? And certainly, if it were not
possible to maintain heavenly-mindedness in such
a state and posture of affairs, God would never
exercise any of his people with such Providences:
he would never give you so much of the world
to lose your hearts in the love of it, or so little
to distract you with the cares of it. If therefore
we were more deeply sanctified, and the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of our hearts heaven-ward more ardent and
vigorous; If we were more mortified to Earthly
things, and could not but keep our due distance
from them; our outward conditions would not
at this rate draw forth and exercise our inward
corruptions, nor would we hazard the loss of so
sweet an enjoyment as our fellowship with God

is, for the sake of any concernment our bodies
have on Earth.</p>

address some considerations proper to both. And

from repining, and charging God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>oolishly, when
Providence crosses them. Let them seriously
consider these four things.</p>
                  <p>(1.) That Hell and Eternal damnation are
the portion of their cup, according to the tenour
of Law, and Gospel threatnings. Whatsoever
therefore is short of this is to be admired as the
fruit of Gods stupendious patience, and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
towards them. Ah poor souls! Know you
not, that you are men and women condemned to
wrath by the plain sentence of the Law? <hi>Mark
16. 16. John 3. 36. 2 Thess.</hi> 1. 6, 7. And if so,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ure there are other matters to exercise your
thoughts, desires, fears and cares about than these.
Alas! if you cannot bear a frown of Providence,
a light cross in these things, how will you bear
the everlasting burnings! A man that is to lose
his head to morrow, is not very solicitous what
bed he lyes on, or how his Table is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>urnisht the
night before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:52858:88"/>
(2.) Consider, though you be condemned
persons, and have no promise to entitle you to
any mercy; yet there are very many mercies in
your possession at this day. Be your condition as
afflictive as it will, is life nothing? especially
considering whither you must sink, when that
thread is cut. Are the necessary supports of life
nothing? Doth not Providence minister to you
these things, though you daily disoblige it, and
provoke God to send you to your own place?
But, above all, is the <hi>Gospel</hi> and precious means
of salvation nothing, by which you yet are in a
capacity of escaping the damnation of Hell? O
what would the damned say, if they were but put
into your condition once more? What, and yet
fret against God, because every thing else suits
not your desires?</p>
                  <p>(3.) Consider, that if ever you be rescued out
of that miserable condition you are in, such cross
Providences, as these you complain of, are the
most probable means to do it. Alas! prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and success is not the way to save, but destroy
you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 32. You must be bound in fetters,
and holden in cords of affliction, if ever your
ear be opened to instruction, <hi>Job</hi> 36. 8, 9, 10.
Wo to you, if you go on smoothly in the way
in which you are, and meet with no crosses.</p>
                  <p>(4.) Lastly, Consider, all your troubles under
which you complain, are pulled down upon your
heads by your own sins. You turn Gods mercies
into sin, and then fret against God, because he
turns your sins into sorrow. Your wayes and
doings procure these things to you. Lay your
hand therefore upon your mouth and say, <hi>Why
doth the living man complain, a man for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52858:88"/>
of his sin,</hi> Lam. 3. 39. But I must turn to
the Lords people, who have least pretences of
all men to be dissatisfied with any of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
and yet are but too frequently sound in
that temper. And to them I shall offer the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
considerations.</p>
                  <p>(1.) <hi>Consider your spiritual mercJes and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
with which the Lord Jesus hath invested you,
and repine at your Lot of Providence if you can.</hi>
One of these mercies alone, hath enough in it to
sweeten all your troubles in this world. When
the Apostle considered them, his heart was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with astonishment; so that he could
not forbear in the midst of all his outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to cry out, <hi>Blessed be the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath abounded to us in all
spiritual blessings,</hi> &amp;c. Eph. 1. 3. Oh, who that
sees such an Inheritance setled upon him in <hi>Christ,</hi>
can ever open his mouth more to repine at his
Lot of Providence!</p>
                  <p>(2.) <hi>Consider your sins, and that will make you
contented with your Lot.</hi> Yea, consider two things
in sin. (1.) What it deserves from God, and
(2.) What it requires to mortifie and purge it in
you. It deserves from God Eternal ruine: the
merit of Hell is in the least vain thought. Every
sin forfeits all the mercies you have; and if so,
rather wonder your mercies are so many, than
that you have no more. Besides, you cannot
doubt, but your corruptions require all the
crosses, wants and troubles that are upon you,
and it may be, a great deal more, to mortifie and
subdue them. Don't you find, after all the rods
that have been upon you, a proud heart still, a
vain and earthly heart still? Oh how many bitter
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52858:89"/>
potions are but necessary to purge out this tough
malignant l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>umour!</p>
                  <p>(3.) <hi>Consider how near you are to the Change of
your conditJon:</hi> have but a little patience, and all
will be as well with you as your hearts can desire.
It is no small comfort to the Saints, that this
world is the worst place that ever they shall be
in: things will better every day with them. If
the <hi>Traveller</hi> have spent all his money, yet it doth
not much trouble him, if he know himself within
a few miles of his own home. If there be no
<hi>Candles</hi> in the house, we do not much matter it,
if we are sure it's almost break of day; for then
there will be no use for them. This is your
case; <hi>your salvatJon is nearer than when you belJeved,</hi>
Rom. 13. 11.</p>
                  <p>I have done with the directive part of this

there be no cause at all for it, <hi>Psal. 31. 12. Lam.
3.</hi> 8. 44. It is not alwayes that the returns of
prayer are dispatcht to us in the same hour they
are asked of God; yet sometimes it falls out so,
<hi>Isa. 65. 24. Dan.</hi> 9. 23. But though the Lord
means to perform to us the mercies we desire<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
yet he will ordinarily exercise our patience to
wait for them; and that for these reasons.</p>
                     <p>(1.) Because <hi>our</hi> time is not the <hi>proper</hi> season
for us to receive our mercies in. Now the <hi>season</hi>
of mercy is a very great circumstance that adds
much to the value of it. God judges not as we
do; we are all in haste, and will have it now,
Numb. 12. 13. <hi>But he is a God of judgement, and
blessed are they that wait for him,</hi> Isa. 30. 18.</p>
                     <p>(2.) Afflictive Providences have not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
that design upon our hearts they were sent
for, when we are so earnest and impatient for a
change of them; and till then the rod must not
be taken off, <hi>Isa.</hi> 10. 12.</p>
                     <p>(3.) The more prayers and searchings of
heart come between our wants and supplies, our
afflictions and reliefs, the sweeter are our reliefs
and supplies thereby made to us, Isa. 25. 9. <hi>This
is our God, we have waited for him, and he will save
us: this is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will
rejoyce and be glad in his salvatJon.</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenses
the delay, and payes us for all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
of our patience.</p>
                     <p>But though there be such weighty reasons for
the stop and delay of refreshing comfortable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences;
yet we cannot bear it, our hands hang
down and we faint, Psal. 69. 3. <hi>I am weary of my
crying, my throat is dry, mine eyes fail while I wait
for my God.</hi> For alas! we judge by sense and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52858:90"/>
and consider not, that Gods <hi>heart</hi> may
be <hi>towards</hi> us<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> whilst the <hi>hand</hi> of his Providence
seems to be <hi>against</hi> us. If things continue at
one rate with us, we think our prayers are lost,
and our hopes perished from the Lord: much
more when things grow worse and worse, and
our darkness and trouble encreases, as usually it
doth just before the break of day and change of
our condition, then we conclude, God is angry
with our prayers. See <hi>Gideon</hi>'s reply, <hi>Judges
6.</hi> 13. This even staggered a <hi>Moses</hi>'s faith, Exod.
5. 22, 23. O what groundless Jealousies and
suspicions of God are found at such times in the
hearts of his own Children! <hi>Job 9. 16, 17. Psal.
77.</hi> 7, 8, 9.</p>
                     <p>But this is our great evil, and to prevent it in
future tryals, I will offer a few proper considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the case.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The delay of your mercies, is really for your
advantage. You read Isa. 30. 18. <hi>The Lord waits
that he may be gracJous.</hi> What is that? Why,
it's nothing else but the time of his preparation
of mercies for you, and your hearts for mercy,
that so you may have it with the greatest advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of comfort. The foolish Child would pluck
the apple while it's green; but when it's ripe,
it drops of its own accord, and is more pleasant
and wholsome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It's a greater mercy, to have an heart willing
to refer all to God, and be at his dispose; than
to enjoy presently the mercy we are most eager
and impatient for. In that God pleases <hi>you,</hi> in
this you please <hi>God.</hi> A mercy may be given yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
as the fruit of common Providence; but such a
temper of heart is the fruit of special grace<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:52858:90"/>
So much as the glorifying of God is better than
the content and pleasure of the creature, so
much is such a frame better, than such a
fruition.</p>
                     <p>Expected mercies are never nearer, than when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the hearts and hopes of Gods people are lowest.
Thus in their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> Ezek. 37. 11. So we have sound it in our
own personal concerns: <hi>at Evening time it shall be
light,</hi> Zach. 14. 7. When we look for increasing
darkness, light<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> arises.</p>
                     <p>Our unfitness for mercy, is the reason why they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
are delayed so long. We put the blocks into the
way of mercy, and then repine, that they make
no more haste to us, Isa. 59. 1, 2. <hi>The Lords hand
is not shortned, but our iniquitJes have separated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Consider, the mercies you wait for, are the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
fruits of pure grace, you deserve them not, nor
can claim them upon any Title of desert; and
therefore have reason to wait for them in a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and thankful frame.</p>
                     <p>Consider, how many <hi>MillJons</hi> of men as good as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
you by nature, are cut off from all hope and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of mercy for ever, and there remains to
them nothing but <hi>a fearful expectatJon of wrath.</hi>
This might have been your case; and therefore
be not of an impatient spirit under the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of mercy.</p>

                     <p>I know, there is nothing in the Word or in the

                  <p>ANd First, Let me offer this, as a moving ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to all gracious souls; <hi>That by this
means you may maintain sweet and sensible commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nJon
with God from day to day.</hi> And what is there
desirable in this world, in comparison therewith!
<hi>Thou Lord hast made me glad through thy works: I

Your hearts may be as sweetly and sensibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresht
by the works of Gods hands, as by the
words of his mouth. <hi>Psal. 104. per totum</hi> is spent
in the consideration of the works of Providence,
which so filled the <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s heart, that, by way
of ejaculation, he expresses the effect of it,
Ver. 34. <hi>My MeditatJon of him shall be sweet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Communion with God properly and strictly

of himself to the soul, and the souls an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
returns to God. This is that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
fellowship we have here with God. Now God
manifests himself to his people by Providences as
well as Ordinances; neither is there any grace in
a sanctified soul hid from the gracious influences
of his Providential manifestations. Sometimes
the Lord manifests his displeasure and anger
against the sins of his people in correcting and
rebuking Providences. His rods have a chiding
voice, Micah 6. 9. <hi>Hear the rod and who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
it.</hi> This discovery of Gods anger kindly
melts and thaws a gracious soul, and produces a
double sweet effect upon it, namely, <hi>repentance</hi>
for sins past, and due <hi>cautJon</hi> against future sins.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52858:93"/>
(1.) It thaws and melts the heart for sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
Thus <hi>David</hi>'s heart was melted for his
sin, when the hand of God was heavy upon him in
affliction, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 4, 5. Thus the <hi>Captive Church,</hi>
upon whom fell the saddest and most dismal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
that ever befell any of Gods people in
any age of the world; see how their hearts are
broken for sin under this severe rebuke, <hi>Lam. 2.
17,</hi> 18, 19. And then, (2. For caution against
sin for the time to come; it's plain, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
of Providence leave that effect also upon
gracious hearts, <hi>Ezra 9. 13, 14. Psal.</hi> 85. 8.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes he cheers and comforts the
hearts of his people with smiling and reviving
Providences, both publick and personal. There
are times of lifting up as well as casting down
by the hand of Providence. The Scene changes,
the aspects of Providence are very cheerful and
encouraging<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> their Winter seems to be over:
they put off their garments of mourning; and
then, Ah, what sweet returns are made to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by gracious souls! Doth God lift them up
by prosperity? they also will lift up their God
by praises. See <hi>Psal. 18. Title,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. So
<hi>Moses</hi> and the people with him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. when
God had delivered them from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> how do
they exalt him in a song of thanksgiving, which
for the elegancy and spirituality of it, is made
an Emblem of the doxologies given to God in
glory by the Saints! <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, whatever effects our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God in any of his Ordinances doth
use to produce upon our hearts, the same we may
observe to follow our conversing with him in
his Providences. For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:52858:93"/>
It is usually found in the experience of all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Saints, that in what Ordinance or duty soever they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ave any sensible communion with God, it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
produces in their spirits a deep abasement
and humiliation from the sense of divine conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scensions
to such vile poor Worms as we are.
Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18. 27. <hi>I am but dust and
ashes.</hi> The same effect follows our converse with
God in his Providences. Thus when God had in
the way of his Providence prospered <hi>Jacob,</hi> how
doth he lay himself at the feet of God, as a man
overwhelmed with the sense of mercy! See Gen.
32. 5, 10. <hi>And Jacob said, I am not worthy of the
least of all thy mercJes, and of all the truth which
thou hast shewed thy servant; for with my staff I
passed over this Jordan, and now am become two
bands.</hi> Thus also it was with <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam.
7. 18. <hi>Who am I, and what is my Fathers house,
that thou hast brought me hitherto!</hi> And I doubt
not, but some of you have found the like frame
of heart upon you, that these holy men here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.
Can you not remember when God lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you up by Providence, how you cast down
your selves before him, and have been viler in
your own eyes than ever! Why, thus do all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
hearts; What am I, that the Lord should
do thus and thus for me! O that ever so great
and holy a God should thus be concerned for so
vile and sinful a Worm!</p>
                  <p>(2.) Doth Communion with God in Ordinances,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
melt the heart into love to God? <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5.

also. Never did any man convers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at some times melted into love to the God of his
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52858:94"/>
mercies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 1. compared with the Title.
When God had delivered him from the hand
of <hi>Saul,</hi> and all his Enemies, he said, <hi>I will love
thee O Lord my strength.</hi> Every man loves the
mercies of God, but a Saint loves the God of his
mercies. The mercies of God, as they are the
fewel of a wicked mans lusts, so they are fewel
to maintain a good mans love to God; not that
their love to God is grounded upon these exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
benefits, Not thine, but thee, O Lord, is the
<hi>motto</hi> of a gracious soul; but yet these things
serve to blow up the flame of love to God in their
hearts, and they find it so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Doth Communion with God set the keenest
edge upon the soul against sin? You see it doth:
and have a pregnant Instance of it in <hi>Moses,</hi> when
he had been with God in the <hi>Mount</hi> for forty
dayes, and had there enjoyed communion with
him; when he came down and saw the <hi>Calf</hi> the
people had made; see what an holy <hi>paroxysm</hi> of
zeal and anger it cast his soul into, <hi>Exod. 32.
19,</hi> 20. Why, the same effect you may discern
to follow the Saints converse with God in his
Providences. What was that which pierced the
heart of <hi>David</hi> with such a deep sense of the
evil of his sin, which is so abundantly manifested
in <hi>Psalm</hi> 51. throughout? Why, if you look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Title you shall find, it was the effect of
what <hi>Nathan</hi> had laid before him: and if you
consult 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9, 10. you shall find, it
was the goodness of God manifested to him in
the several endearing Providences of his life,
which in this he had so evilly requited the Lord
for, that broke his heart to pieces in the sense of
it: and I doubt not, but some of us have some
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52858:94"/>
times found the like effects, by comparing Gods
wayes and our own together.</p>
                  <p>Doth Communion with the Lord enlarge the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
heart for obedience and service? Surely it is as
oyl to the wheels, that makes them run of freely
and nimbly their course. Thus when <hi>IsaJah</hi> had
obtained a special manifestation of God, and the
Lord askt, <hi>whom shall I send?</hi> he presents a ready
soul for the employment, Isa. 6. 8. <hi>Here am I,
Lord, send me.</hi> Why, the very same effect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
sanctified Providences, as you may see in
<hi>Jehosaphat,</hi> 2 Chron. 17. 5, 6. and in <hi>David,</hi> Psal.
116. 12. O when a soul considers what God
hath done for him, he cannot chuse but say, what
shall I return? how shall I answer these engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
                  <p>And thus you see, what sweet Communion a
soul may have with God in the way of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences.
O that you would thus walk with him!
How much of Heaven might be found on Earth
this way! And certainly, it will never repent
the Lord he hath done you good, when his
mercies produce such effects upon your hearts:
he will say of every savour thus improved, It
was well bestowed, and will rejoyce over you to
do you good for ever.</p>

                  <p>A <hi>Great part of the pleasure and delight of the

have pleasure therein: (i. e.)</hi> the study of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is so sweet and pleasant, that it invites
and allures the soul to search and dive into it.
How pleasant is it to a well tempered soul to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
and observe,</p>
                  <p>(1.) The sweet harmony and consent of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Attributes in the issues of Providence! They
may seem sometimes to jarr and clash, to part
with each other, and go contrary wayes: but
they only seem so to do; for in the winding up,
they alwayes meet and embrace each other, Psal.
85. 10. <hi>Mercy and Truth have met together: Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and Peace have kissed each other.</hi> It is
spoken with an immediate reference to that sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Providence of <hi>Israels</hi> deliverance out of the
<hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity, and the sweet effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
wherein the truth and righteousness of God
in the promises, did as it were kiss and embrace
the mercy and peace that was contained in the
performance of them, after they had seemed for
seventy years to be at a great distance from each
other. For it is an allusion to the usual demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of joy and gladness, that two dear friends
are wont to give and receive, after a long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and separation from each other: they no
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52858:95"/>
sooner meet, but they smile, embrace and kiss
each other. Even thus it is here. The word

met us,</hi> and that also is true; for when ever these
blessed Promises and Performances meet and kiss
each other, they are also joyfully embraced and
killed by believing souls. There is, I doubt not,
a mediate reference of this Scripture to the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sJah</hi>
also, and our redemption by him: In him it
is that these divine Attributes which before
seemed to clash and contradict one another in the
business of our salvation, have a sweet agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and accomplishment. Truth and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
do in him meet with Mercy and Peace in

this! and how pleasant to behold! O if with

upon it, and behold the consent of Gods Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
the accomplishment of his Ends, and our
own happiness in the works of Providence. For
this is the very joy of the Angels and Saints in
Heaven, to see Gods Ends wrought out, and his
Attributes glorified in the mercy and peace of
the Church, <hi>Rev. 14. 1, 2, 3. &amp;</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>(2.) And as it's a pleasant sight to see the
harmony of Gods Attributes, so it is exceeding
pleasant to behold the resurrection of our own
prayers and hopes as from the dead. Why, this
you may often see, if you will duly observe the
works of Providence towards you. We hope
and pray for such and such mercies to the Church,
or to our selves; but God delayes the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of our hopes, suspends the answer of
our prayers, and seems to speak to us, as Hab.
2. 3. <hi>For the visJon is yet for an appointed time, but
at the end it shall speak and not lye: though it tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
wait for it, because it will surely come, it will
not tarry:</hi> but we have no patience to wait the
time of the Promise, our hopes languish and dye
in the interim; and we say with the despondent
Church, Lam. 3. 18. <hi>Our hope is perished from the
Lord;</hi> but Oh, how sweet and comfortable is it,
to see these prayers fulfilled, after we have given
up all expectation of them! May we not say of
them, as the Scripture speaks of the restoration
of the Jews, it is even <hi>life from the dead.</hi> This
was <hi>David</hi>'s case, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31. 22. he gave up his
hopes and prayers for lost, yet lived to see the
comfortable and unexpected returns of them.
And this was the case of <hi>Job, chap.</hi> 6. 11. he had
given up all expectation of better dayes, and yet
this man lived to see a resurrection of all his lost
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52858:96"/>
comforts with an advantage. Think how that
change and unexpected turn of Providence affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
his soul: it is with our hopes and prayers as
with our <hi>Alms, Cast thy bread on the waters, for
thou shalt find it after many dayes,</hi> Eccles. 11. 1.
or as it was with <hi>Jacob,</hi> who had given ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hopes of ever seeing his beloved <hi>Joseph</hi> again, but
when a strange and unexpected Providence had
restored that hopeless mercy to him again, Oh
how ravishing and transporting was it? <hi>Gen. 46.
29,</hi> 30.</p>
                  <p>(3.) What a transporting pleasure is it, to
behold great blessings and advantages to us
wrought by Providence, out of those very things
that seemed to threaten our ruine or misery? and
yet by due observing the wayes of Providence,
you may to your singular comfort find it so.
Little did <hi>Joseph</hi> think his transportation into
<hi>Egypt,</hi> had been in order to his advancement
there; yet he lived with joy to see it, and with
a thankful heart to acknowledge it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 5.
Wait and observe, and you shall assuredly find
that Promise, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. working out its way
through all Providences. How many times have
you been made to say as <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 119. 71. <hi>It
is good for me that I have been afflicted.</hi> O what a
difference have we seen betwixt our afflictions at
our first meeting with them, and our parting from
them! We have entertained them with sighs and
tears, but parted from them with joy, blessing
God for them, as the happy Instruments of our
good. Thus our fears and sorrows are turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
praises and songs of thanksgiving.</p>
                  <p>(4.) What unspeakable comfort is it for a
poor soul, that sees nothing but sin and vileness in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52858:97"/>
it self, at the same time to see what an high
esteem and value the great God hath for him!
This may be discerned by a due attendance to
Providence, for there a man sees <hi>goodness and
mercy following</hi> him through all his dayes, as it is
<hi>Psal.</hi> 23. 6. Other men prosecute good, and it
flyes from them, they can never overtake it; but
goodness and mercy follow the people of God,
and they cannot avoid or escape it: it gives them
chase day by day, and finds them out; even when
they sometimes put themselves by sin out of the
way of it. In all the Providences that befall
them, goodness and mercy pursues them. O with
what a mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ing heart do they sometimes reflect
upon these things! <hi>and will not the goodness of
God be discouraged from following me, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all my vile a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>ronts and abuses of it in former
mercJes? Lord, what am I, that mercy should thus
pursue me, when vengeance and wrath pursue others
as good by nature as I am?</hi> It certainly argues
the great esteem God hath of a man, when he
thus follows him with sanctified Providences (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be comforts or crosses) for his good.
And so much is plain, from Job 7. 18. <hi>Lord what
is man, that thou shouldst visit him every morning,
and try him every moment?</hi> Certainly, Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are his treasure, and by this it appears that
they are so, that he withdraws not his eye from
them, <hi>Job</hi> 36. 7. I say not, that Gods favour and
respect to a man, may be concluded singly from
his Providences; but sanctified Providences may
very much clear it to us: and when it doth
so, it cannot but be matter of exceeding great
joy.</p>
                  <p>(5.) To conclude, what is there in all this
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52858:97"/>
world, that can give a soul such joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
as to find himself by every thing set on and
farthered in his way to Heaven! And yet this
may be discerned, by an heedful attendance to
the effects and issues of Providences.</p>
                  <p>How cross soever the Winds and Tides of
Providence at any time seem to us, yet nothing
is more certain, than that they all conspire to
hasten sanctified souls to God, and sit them for
glory.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew, that both his bonds and the
afflictions added to them should turn to, or (as
the word <gap reason="foreign">

salvation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 19. Not that in themselves
they serve to any such purpose; but as they are
over-ruled and determined to such an end, <hi>through
Prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus
Christ.</hi> When <hi>Prayer</hi> the external, and the
<hi>Spirit</hi> the internal means are joyned with them;
then Afflictions themselves become excellent means
to promote salvation. And have we not with
joy observed, how those very things, that sense
and reason tell us are opposite to our happiness,
have been the most blessed Instruments to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote

God, in the supporting, preserving and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Righteous, in all their dangers, fears

himself to spiritual eyes in these Providences, as
clearly, as the Sun manifest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

beams of light, Hab. 3. 3, 4. <hi>His brightness was
as the light, and he had borns coming out of his

spoken of the Lords going forth for his people
in their deliverance from their Enemies: and
then he had horns or rayes and beams of power
and mercy coming out of his hands; by his

hands, are meant his Providential administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and dispensations, and the horns that came
out of them, are nothing else but the glorious
display of his Attributes in those Providences.
How did God make himself known to his people
in that signal deliverance of them out of <hi>Egypt?</hi>
See <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 3. then he was known to them by
his name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> in giving being by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
to the mercies promised.</p>
                  <p>Thus when <hi>Christ</hi> shall give his people the last
and greatest deliverance from <hi>Antichrist,</hi> he shall
shew himself to his people in a vesture dipt in
blood, and his Name shall be called, <hi>The Word of
God,</hi> Rev. 19. 13. His Name was the Word of
God before; but then he was the Word <hi>reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and discovering the promises and truths of
God; now <hi>accomplishing</hi> and fulfilling them.
That his Name is near, his wonderful works de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 75. 1.</p>
                  <p>But more particularly, let us bring it home to
our own experience. It may be, we find our
selves sometimes assaulted with Atheistical
thoughts: we are tempted to think God hath left
all things below to the course and sway of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that our prayers reach him not, as it is <hi>Lam.
3.</hi> 44. that he regards not what evils befall us.
But, tell me Saints, have you not enough at hand
to stop the mouths of all such temptations? O
do but reflect upon your own Experiences, and
solemnly ask your own hearts,</p>
                  <p>(1.) Have you never seen the All-sufficient
God in the provisions he hath made for you and
yours, throughout all the way that you have
gone! Who was it that supplyed to you what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was needful in all your straits? Was it not
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52858:99"/>
the Lord? <hi>'Tis he that hath given bread to them
that fear him, and hath been ever mindful of his
Covenant,</hi> Psal. 111. 5. O do but consider the
constancy, seasonableness, and at sometimes the
extraordinariness of these provisions, and how
they have been given in upon prayer, and shut
your eyes if you can, against the convincing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of that great truth, Job 36. 7. <hi>He withdraweth
not his eye from the Righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2.) Have you not plainly discerned the care
of God in your preservations from so many and
great dangers as you have escaped and been
carried through hitherto? How is it, that you
have over-lived so many mortal dangers, sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
accidents, designs of Enemies to ruine
you? It is I presume, beyond question with you,
that the very finger of God hath been in these
things, and that it is by his care alone, you have
been preserved. When God had so signally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<hi>David</hi> from a dangerous disease and the
plots of Enemies against him, <hi>by this</hi> (saith
he) <hi>I know thou favourest me, because mine enemy
doth not trJumph over me,</hi> Psal. 41. 11. he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from those gracious protections, the care
God had over him.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Have you not plainly discerned the hand
of God, in the returns and accomplishments of
your prayers? Nothing can be more evident than
this, to men of observation, Psal. 34. 4, 5, 6. <hi>I
sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me
from all my fears. They looked unto him and were
lightned, and their faces were not ashamed. This
poor man cryed, and the Lord heard him, and saved
him out of all his troubles.</hi> Parallel to this, runs
the experience of thousands and ten thousands
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52858:100"/>
of Christians this day; they know they have the
petitions they asked of him. The <hi>Mercy</hi> carries
the very impress and stamp of the <hi>Duty</hi> upon
it. So that we can say, This is the <hi>Mercy,</hi> the
very Mercy I have so often <hi>sought</hi> God about.
O how satisfying, and convincing are these
things!</p>
                  <p>(4.) Have you not evidently discerned the
Lords hand, in the guiding and directing of your
paths, to your unforeseen advantage? Things
that you never projected for your selves, have
been brought about beyond all your thoughts.
Many such things are with God; and which of all
the Saints hath not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

verified by clear and undeniable experience? <hi>The
way of man is not in himself.</hi> I presume, if you
will but look over the mercies you possess thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
day, you will find three to one, it may be ten to
one thus wrought by the Lord for you. And
how satisfying beyond all Arguments in the
world are these experiences, That there is a
God to whom his people are exceeding dear, <hi>a
God that performeth all things for them!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(5.) Is it not fully convictive, that there is a
God who takes care of you, in as much as you
have found in all the temptations and difficulties
of your lives his promises still fulfilled, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
performed in all those conditions? I appeal
to your selves, if you have not seen that Promise
made good, Psal. 91. 15. <hi>I will be with him in
trouble;</hi> and that 1 Cor. 10. 13. <hi>God is faithful,
who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you
are able: but will with the temptatJon also make a way
to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi> Have not
these been as clearly made out by Providence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

There never befell <hi>David</hi> in all his troubles, a
greater strait and distress than this; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
his faith had staggered, had not the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of former Providence come in to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
From this <hi>Topick</hi> faith argues, and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
strongly and conclusively. So did <hi>David</hi>'s
faith in many exigencies: when he was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
the <hi>ChampJon</hi> of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> it was from
former Providence that he encouraged himself,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 37. And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> improves
his experiences to the same purpose; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.
9, 10. Indeed the whole Scripture is full of it:
What Christian understands not the exceeding
usefulness of those experiences he hath had to
relieve and enliven? But I shall not satisfie my
self with the common assertion, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more tritc in the lips of professors: but
will labour to shew you, wherein the great use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of our Recorded Experiences, for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
faith labouring under difficulties, consists.
To this purpose, I shall desire the Reader to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
seriously these following particulars.</p>
                  <p>How much advantage those things have upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
our souls, which we have already felt and tasted,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52858:101"/>
beyond those which were never relished by any
former experience? What is Experience? but
the bringing down of the objects of faith to the
dijudication and test of spiritual sense? Now
when any thing hath been once tasted, felt and
judged by a former Experience, it is much more
easily believed and received when it occurrs again.
It's much easier for faith to travel in a path that
is well known to it, having formerly trod it,
than to beat out a new one which it never trod,
nor can see one step before it. Hence it is,
though there be a difficulty in all the acts of faith,
yet scarce in any like the first adventure it makes
upon <hi>Christ;</hi> and the reason lyes here, because in
the <hi>subsequent</hi> acts it hath all its former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
to aid and encourage it; but in the <hi>first
adventure</hi> it hath none at all of its own, it takes a
path which it never knew before.</p>
                  <p>To trust God without any tryal or experience,
is a more noble act of faith; but to trust him
after we have often tryed him, is known to be
more easie. O'tis no small advantage to a soul in
a new plunge and distress, to be able to say, This
is not the first time I have been in these deeps,
and yet emerged out of them! Hence it was, that
<hi>Christ</hi> rub'd up his Disciples memories with what
Providence had formerly wrought for them in a
day of straits, Matth. 16. 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>O ye of
little faith, why reason ye among your selves, because
ye have brought no bread? do ye not yet understand,
neither remember? q. d.</hi> Were yo never under any
strait for bread before now? Is this the first diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
that ever your faith combated with? No,
no, you have felt straits, and experienced the
power and care of God in supplying them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52858:101"/>
now; and therefore I cannot but call you
men of <hi>little faith;</hi> for a very ordinary and small
measure of faith, assisted with so much experience
as you have had, would enable you to trust God.
There is as much difference betwixt believing
before, and after experience, as there is betwixt
swimming with bladders, and our first venture
into the deep waters without them.</p>
                  <p>What a singular encouragement to faith do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
former Experiences yield it, by answering all the
pleas and objections of unbelief drawn from the
<hi>object</hi> of faith? Now there be two things that
unbelief stumbles at in <hi>God:</hi> One is his Power,
the other his Willingness to help.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Unbelief objects the impossibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
in deep distresses, Psal. 78. 19. <hi>Can God fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
a Table in the Wilderness? can be give bread
also? can be provide flesh for his people?</hi> O vile and
unworthy thoughts of God! proceeding from
our measuring the immense and boundless power
of God, by our own line and measure: because
we see not which way relief should come, we
conclude, none is to be expected. But all these
reasonings of Unbelief are vanquisht by a serious
reflection upon our own Experiences: God hath
helped, therefore he can, Isa. 59. 1. <hi>His hand is
not shortned: (i. e.)</hi> he hath as much power and
ability as formerly.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Unbelief objects against the Will of
<hi>God,</hi> and questions, whether he will now be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
though he hath formerly been so. But
after so many experiences of his readiness to
help, what room for doubting remains? Thus
<hi>Paul</hi> reasoned from the experience of what he
had done, to what he would do, 2 Cor. 1. 10.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52858:102"/>
and so did <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 17. 36. Indeed if a man
had never experienced the goodness of God to
him, it were not so heinous a sin to question his
willingness to do him good; but what place is
left after such frequent tryals?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It gives great encouragement to faith, as it
answers the objections of unbelief drawn from
the <hi>subject.</hi> Now these Objections are of two
sorts also.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Such as are drawn from our great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness.
How (saith Unbelief) can so sinful
and vile a creature expect, that ever God should
do this or that for me? 'Tis true, we find he
did great things for <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
&amp;c.</hi> but these were men of eminent holiness,
men that obeyed God, and denyed themselves
for him, and lived more in a day to his glory,
than ever I did all my dayes.</p>
                  <p>Well, but what signifies all this to a soul, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all its sensible vileness and unworthiness hath
tasted the goodness of God as well as they? As
unworthy as I am, God hath been good to me not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding:
his mercy appeared first to me,
when I was worse than I am now, both in <hi>conditJon</hi>
and <hi>dispositJon;</hi> and therefore I will still expect
the continuance of his goodness to me, though
I deserve it not. <hi>If when we were EnemJes we were
reconciled to God by the death of his Son, how much
more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life?</hi>
Rom. 5. 10.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Such as are drawn from the extremity
of our present condition, if troubles or dangers
grow to an height, and we see nothing but
ruine and misery in the eye of reason before us;

                     </gap>
these mercies to us. Thus <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 103. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>(5.) A suitable Retribution for the mercies

                  <p>Thus you see, how all the ingredients to praise,
have respect to Providences. But more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
I will shew you, that as all the ingredients of
praise have respect to Providence, so all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and Arguments obliging and engaging souls
to praise, are found therein also. To this end
consider, how the mercy and goodness of God is
exhibited by Providence, to excite our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:52858:103"/>
(1.) That the goodness and mercy of God is
let out upon his people in his Providences about
them: and this is the very root of praise. It is
not so much the possession that Providence gives
us of such or such comforts, as the goodness and
kindness of God in the dispensing of them, that
engages a gracious soul to praise, Psal. 63. 3. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thy loving kindness is better than life, my lips
shall praise thee.</hi> To give, maintain and preserve
our life, are choice acts of Providences: but to
do all this in a way of grace and loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
this is far better than the gifts themselves:
life is but the shadow of death without it: this is
the mercy that crowns all other mercies, <hi>Psal.</hi>
103. 4. It's this a sanctified soul desires God
would manifest in every Providence about him,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 7. and what is our praising of God else,
but our shewing forth that loving-kindness,
which he sheweth us in his Providences? <hi>Psal.</hi>
92. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>(2.) As the loving-kindness of God manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in Providences, is a motive to praise; so
the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>undeserved</hi> savours of God, dispensed
by the hand of Providence, oblige the soul to
praise. This was the consideration that melted
<hi>David</hi>'s heart into a thankful praising frame,
even the consideration of the free and undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
favours cast in upon him by Providence,
2 Sam. 7. 18. <hi>What am I? O Lord God: and what
is my Fathers house, that thou hast brought me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto?
(i. e.)</hi> raised me by Providence from
a mean condition to all this dignity: <hi>from
following the Ewes, to feed Jacob his people,</hi> Psal.
78. 70, 71. O this is it that engages thankfulness,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:52858:104"/>
(3.) As the freeness of mercies dispensed by
Providence, engageth praise; so the <hi>Multitudes</hi>
of mercies heaped this way upon us, strongly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the soul to thankfulness. Thus <hi>David</hi> comes
before the Lord encompassed with a multitude of
mercies to praise him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 7. We have our
loads of mercies, and that every day, <hi>Psalm</hi>
68. 19. O what a rich heap will the mercies of
one day make, being laid together!</p>
                  <p>(4.) As the multitudes of mercies dispensed
by Providence, oblige to praise; so the <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of Gods mercy manifested in his Providence,
leaves the soul under a strong obligation to thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.
We see what tender resentments the
Lord hath of all our wants, straits and burdens,
Psalm 103. 13. <hi>Like as a Father pitJeth his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
so the Lord pitJeth them that fear him.</hi> He is
full of bowels, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                     </gap> in
<hi>James</hi> 5. 11. signifies. Yea, there are not only
bowels of compassion in our God, but the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of bowels, like those of a Mother to her
sucking child, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 15. He feels all our pains
as if the apple of his eye were touched, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 8.
and all this is discovered to his people in the way
of his Providences with them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 111. 2, 3, 4. O
who of all the Children of God hath not often
found this in his Providences? And who can see
it, and not be filled with thankfulness? All these
are so many bands clapt by Providence upon the
soul, to oblige it to a li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>e of praise. Hence it is,
that the prayers of the Saints are so full of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings
upon these accounts: 'tis sweet to recount
them to the Lord in prayer: to lye at this feet in
an holy astonishment at his gracious condescensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to poor worms.</p>

                  <p>Now there be six things in Providence, that are

any that spent the whole stock and treasure of

Christ: 'tis by vertue of our union with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that we enjoy the sanctified gifts and blessings

to that great mercy <hi>CHRIST, Matth.</hi> 6. 33. they

it is indeed bountiful and open-handed to many
of them; and fills them with Earthly comforts;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52858:105"/>
but not one special sanctified mercy is to be
found among all their enjoyments: these gifts of
Providence do but deceive, defile and destroy
them through their own corruptions, and for

                  <p>The dispensation of all our comforts and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
is by his direction and appointment. It's
true, the <hi>Angels</hi> are employed in the Kingdom

Now what an endearing meditation is this! What

and without it they could have done nothing

as it hath led him all along the way that
he hath gone, and if there be any principle of
gracious tenderness in him, he shall meet with
variety of occasions to excite and draw it forth.
Reader, go back with thy serious thoughts (1.) To
the beginning of the wayes of God with thee, the
mercies that brake out early in thy youth, even
the first born mercies from the womb of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and thou wilt say, What need I go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Here is enough, not only to moves, but
overwhelm my heart. <hi>May I not from this time
cry unto thee, my Father, thou art the guide of my
youth,</hi> Jer. 3. 4. What a critical time is the
time of youth? it's the moulding age; and (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily)
according to the course of those lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Providences, after Providences do steer their
course. What levity, rashness, ignorance and
strong propensions to sin and ruine accompanied
that age? How many being then left to the sway
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:52858:107"/>
of their own lusts, run themselves into those
sins and miseries, which they never recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from to their dying day? These, like the
errors of the first concoction, are rarely rectified
afterwards. Did the Lord guide thee by his
Providence, when but a Child? Did he then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
thee from those follies and miscarriages,
which blast the very blossom, and nip the bud, so
that no good fruit is to be expected afterwards?
Did he then cast thee into such families, or among
such company and acquaintance, as moulded and
formed thy spirit to a better temper? Did he
then direct thee into that way of employment,
wherein thou hast seen so large a train of happy
consequents ever since following thee? And wilt
thou not from henceforth say, <hi>My Father, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
thou art the guide of my youth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or (2.) Let us but bring out thoughts close to
the Providences of after times, and consider how
the several changes and removes of our lives have
been ordered for us: Things we never foresaw
nor designed (but much better for us, than what
we did design) have been all along ordered for
us. <hi>The way of man is not in himself. Gods thoughts
have not been our thoughts, nor his wayes our wayes.</hi>
Among the eminent mercies of thy life, Reader,
how many of them have been meer <hi>surprizals</hi> to
thee? Thy own projects have been thrust aside,
to make way for better things designed by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for thee.</p>
                  <p>Nay, (3.) Do but observe the <hi>Springs</hi> and
<hi>Autumns</hi> of Providence, in what order they have
<hi>flourished</hi> and <hi>faded</hi> with thee, and thou wilt find
thy self over-powered with the sense of Divine
Wisdom and Goodness: when necessity required,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:52858:108"/>
such a friend was stirred up to help thee, such a
place opened to receive thee, such a Relation
raised up or continued to refresh thee: and no
sooner doth Providence deprive thee of any of
them, but either thy need of them ceases, or
some other way is opened to thee. O the depth
of Gods Wisdom and Goodness! O the matchless
tenderness of God to his people!</p>
                  <p>(4.) Compare the dealings of Providence
with you and others, yea, with others that sprang
up with you in the same generation, it may be, in
the same families, and from the same Parents, it
may be in families greater and more flourishing
in the world then yours, and see the difference,
upon many great accounts, it hath made betwixt
you and them. I knew a <hi>ChristJan,</hi> who after
many years separation, was visited by his own
Brother, the very sight of whom, wrought upon
him, much as the sight of <hi>Benjamin</hi> did upon <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
so that he could not refrain to fall upon
his neck, and weep for joy; but after a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ew hours
spent together, finding the spirit of his Brother,
not only estranged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>rom all that's spiritual and
serious, but also very vain and prophane, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
to his chamber, shut the door upon him,
threw himself down at the feet of God, and with
flowing eyes, and a melting heart, admired the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
Grace of God, saying, Was not
<hi>Esau Jacob</hi>'s Brother? O Grace, Grace, astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grace!</p>
                  <p>(5.) Compare the carriage of Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, with your own carriage towards the
Lord; and it must needs melt your hearts to find
so much mercy bestowed, where so much sin hath
been committed. What place did you ever live
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:52858:108"/>
in, where you cannot remember great provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
committed, and manifold mercies notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that, received? O with how many <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandings</hi>
and <hi>neverthelesses,</hi> hath the Lord done
you good in every place! What Relation hath
not been abused by sin; and yet both raised up
and continued by Providence for your comfort?
In every place God that left the marks of his
goodness, and you the remembrances of your
sinfulness: give your selves but leave to think of
these things, and it's strange if your hearts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
not at the remembrance of them.</p>
                  <p>(6.) Or Lastly, Do but compare your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
with your fears, and both with the strange
out-letts and doors of escape Providence hath
opened, and it cannot do less than over power
you with a full sense of divine care and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>There have been dark clouds seen to rise over
you, judgement even at your door, sometimes
threating your life, sometimes your liberty,
sometimes your estates, and sometimes your dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
relations, in whom it may be, your life was
bound up; remember in that day, what faintness
of spirit seized you, what charges of guilt stirring
up fears of the issue within you: You turned to
the Lord in that distress, and hath he not made
a way to escape, and delivered you from all your
fears? <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 4.</p>
                  <p>Oh is your life such a continued throng, such
a distracted hurry, that there is no room to be
found with Christians to sit alone, and think on
these things, and press these marvellous discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of God in his Providences upon their own
hearts? Surely, might these things but lye upon
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52858:109"/>
our hearts, talk with our thoughts by day, and
lodge with us at night; they would even force
their passage down to our very Reins.</p>

the care Providence hath over the Birds of

the one, and clothes the other without any anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
care of theirs; and would have them well
consider those Providences, and reason them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into a calm and sweet composure of spirit
from those considerations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.</p>

                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:52858:109"/>
Two things destroy the peace and tranquillity
of our lives, our <hi>bewailing past disappointments,</hi> or <hi>fearing future ones.</hi> But would we once learn previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and provision to be divine prerogatives, and
take notice how often Providence baffles those
that pretend to it, causing the good they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
(according to their conjectures) coming to
their hand, yet to balk them and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the evil they thought themselves sufficiently
secured from, to invade them. I say, would we
consider how Providence daily baffles these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions

it would greatly conduce to the tranquillity of
our lives.</p>
                  <p>This is a great truth, that there is no face of

with Christians, to compare times with times,

another. The Saints do know what course Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
usually holds, and accordingly with great

prepare some smart rods to correct thee, when
either thy heart hath secretly revolted from God,
and is grown vain, careless and sensual, or when
thy steps have declined, and thou hast turned
aside to the commission of iniquity. And then
when those rods have been sanctified to humble,
reduce and purge thy heart, it's usually observed,
that those sad Providences are then upon the
change, and then the Lord changes the voice of
his Providence towards thee, Jer. 3. 12, 13.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> It is usual with Christians, to argue themselves
into fresh reviving hopes, when the state of things
is most forlorn, by comparing the Providences of
God one with another.</p>
                  <p>(1.) It is a mighty composing meditation,
when we compare the Providences of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the inanimate and irrational Creatures,
with his Providences towards us. Doth he take
care for the very Fowls of the air, for whom no
man provides, as well as those at the door which
we daily feed? Doth he so clothe the very Grass
of the field? hear the young Ravens, when they
cry for meat? and can it be supposed, he should
forget his own people, that are of much more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
than these?</p>
                  <p>(2.) Or if we compare the bounty and care
that Providence hath expressed to the Enemies of
God, how it feeds and clothes and protects them,
even whilst they are fighting against him with his

                  <p>(3.) Or Lastly, It must needs quiet us, when
we consider, what the Lord did for us in the
way of his Providence, when we our selves were
in the state of nature, and enmity against God.
Did he not then look after us, when we knew him
not? provided for us, when we owned him not
in any of his mercies? bestowed thousands of
mercies upon us, when we had no title to Christ
or any one promise? and will he now do less
for us, since we are reconciled and become his
Children?</p>

our sins when we are fallen into them, Isa.
27. 9. <hi>By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be
purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin.</hi>
So <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 33, 34, 35. they are of the same use
that fire and water are for purging and cleansing;
not that they can purge us from sin in their own
vertue and power, for if so, those that have most
afflictions would have most grace also; but it is
in the vertue of Christ's blood, and God's bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
upon afflictive Providences, that they purge
us from sin. A <hi>Cross</hi> without a <hi>Crist</hi> never did
any man good. Now in God's afflictive Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
for sin there are many things that tend to
the purging of it. For</p>
                  <p>(1.) Such rebukes of Providence discover the
displeasure of God against us: the Lord frowns
upon us in those Providences. Our father is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and these are the tokens of it; and nothing
works more to the melting of a gracious hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

than this. Must not the heart of a Child melt
and break whil'st the father is angry. O this is
more bitter to our Spirits than all the smart and
anguish of the affliction can be to our flesh. See
<hi>Psal. 38. 1, 2, 3. O Lord rebuke me not in thy
wrath; neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure: for
thine arrows stick fast in me; and thine band presseth
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:52858:113"/>
me sore. There is no soundness in my flesh because of
thine anger: neither is there any rest in my bones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of my sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2.) By these rebukes of sin, the evil of sin is
discovered more sensibly to us, and we are made
to see more clearly the evil of it in these glasses
of affliction which Providence at such times sets
before us, than formerly we ever saw. <hi>Jer. 2. 19.
Thine own wickedness shall correct thee; and thy back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings
shall reprove thee, know therefore and see that
it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken
the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee,
saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> O the Gall and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
that we taste in it under God's rebukes for
it!</p>
                  <p>(3.) Providence blasts and frustrates all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
projects to the people of God: whoever
thrives in them, they shall not. <hi>Isa. 30. 1, 2, 3,
4,</hi> 5. And this also convinces them of the folly
that is in sin, and makes them cleave to the way
of simplicity and integrity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Holiness is promoted in the soul by cautioning
and warning the soul against sin for time to come.
<hi>Job 34. 31<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> I have born chastisement, I will not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
any more.</hi> O happy Providences, how smart
soever, that make the soul for ever a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>raid of sin!
surely such rods are well bestow'd. This gives
God his end: and if ever we sorrowed after a
godly sort, in the day of our troubles it will
work this carefulness. 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 11. Behold this
self same thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort,
what carefulness it wrought in you,</hi> &amp;c. O if ever
a man have been under a sanctified rod which
hath shewed him the evil of sin, and kindly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him for it; and a temptation should again
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52858:113"/>
sollicite him to the same evil: Why thinks he,
what a madness is it for me to buy repentance
at so dear a rate? Have I not smarted enough
already? You may as well ask me, whether
I will run again into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ire, after I have been
already scorcht in it?</p>
                  <p>To conclude, Providences do greatly improve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
and promote holiness by drawing the Soul into
the presence of God, and giving it the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and occasion of much communion with him.
Comfortable Providences will do this, they will
melt a man's heart in love to the God of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and so pain his bowels that he shall not be
quiet till he have found a place to pour out his
Soul in thankfulness to the Lord. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.
18.</p>
                  <p>Afflictive Providences will drive us to the feet:
of God, and there make us to judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
our selves. And all this hath an excellent
use to destroy sin, and promote holiness in the
Soul.</p>

                     <hi>Josh.</hi> 24. And I cannot but think it a
sweet close to the life of any Christian: It must
needs sweeten a death-bed to recount there the
several remarkable passages of God's care and
love to us from our beginning to that day: to
reflect upon the mercies that went along with us
all the way, when we are come to the end of it.
O Christians, treasure up these instances for such
a time as that is; that you may go out of the
world blessing God for <hi>all the goodness and truth</hi>
he hath performed to you all your life long.
Now the meditations of these things must needs
be of great use in that day, if you consider the

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The time of Death is the time when Souls
are usually most violently assaulted by Satan with
horrid temptations and black suggestions. We
may say of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>

Serpent, <hi>nunquam nisi morJens, producitur in

perswade the Saints, that God loves them not,
hath no care nor regard for them, nor their cryes;
though they pray for ease and cry for sparing
mercy, they see none comes. He handles them
with as much roughness and severity as other
men; yea, many of the vilest and most dissolute
wretches endure less torments, and are more
gently handled than they. <hi>Psal. 73. 4. there are no

to that moment? In this case his saith is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
assisted by thousands of experiences which
back and encourage it, and will not suffer the
soul to give up so easily a truth which he
hath so often sensibly felt and tasted. I am
sure (saith he) God hath had a tender fatherly
care of me ever since I became his: he never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me yet in any former strait; and I cannot
believe he will do so now. I know his love is like
himself, unchangeable. <hi>Job. 13. 1. having loved
his own which were in the world he loved them unto

                  <p>At death the Saints are engaged in the last, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
one of the most eminent works of faith, even the
committing themselves into the hands of God,
when we are lanching forth into that vast Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and entring into that new state which will make
so great a change upon us in a moment. In this
Christ sets us a pattern, <hi>Luke 23. 46. Father into
thy hands I commend my spirit;</hi> and having said
thus he gave up the Ghost. So <hi>Stephen</hi> at his
death, <hi>Lord Jesus, receive my spirit, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
fell asleep, Act.</hi> 7. 59.</p>
                  <p>There be two signal and remarkable acts of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52858:115"/>
faith, both exceedingly difficult, <hi>viz.</hi> its first
act, and its last. The first is a great venture
that it makes of it self upon Christ: and the last
is a great venture too, to cast it self into the
Ocean of Eternity upon the credit of a Promise.
But yet I know the first adventure of the Soul
upon Christ is much more difficult than the last
adventure upon death; and that which makes it
so is in great measure, the manifold recorded ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences
that the Soul hath been gathering up
from the day of its espousals to Christ unto its
dying which is (in a sense) its marriage day.
Oh with what encouragement may a Soul throw
himself into the arms of that God with whom he
hath so long conversed and walked in this world!
Whose visits have been sweet and frequent, with
whom the soul hath contracted so intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
in this world; whom it hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
all its affairs to formerly, and still <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ound
him a faithful God; and now hath no reason to
doubt, but it shall find him so in this last distress
and exigence also.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> At death the people of God receive the last
mercies that ever they shall receive in this world
by the hand of Providence, and are immediately
to make up their Accounts with God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>or all the

What can be more suitable therefore to a dying
person, than to recount with himself the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of his whole life, the manifold receipts of
favour for which he is to reckon with God spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily:
and how shall this be done without a due and
serious observation and recording of them now? I
know there are thousands of mercies forgotten by
the best of Christians: a memory of brass cannot
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52858:115"/>
contain them: And I know also that Jesus Christ
must make up the Account for us, or it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pass with God; yet it is our duty to keep the
Accounts of our own mercies, and how they have
been improv'd by us, for we are Stewards, and
then are to give an Account of our Stewardship.</p>
                  <p>At death we owe an Account also to men,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
and stand obliged (if there be opportunity for it) to
make known to them that survive us what we
have seen and found of God in this world, that
we may leave a testimony for God with men,
and bring up a good report upon his ways. Thus
dying <hi>Jacob</hi> when <hi>Joseph</hi> was come to take his last
farewell of him in this world, strengthened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and sate upon the bed, and related to him
the eminent appearances of God to him, and the
places where, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 2, 3. as also an account
of his afflictions, <hi>Verse</hi> 7. So <hi>Joshua</hi> in his last
speech to the people makes it his business to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
and clear the truth of the Promises, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
to them how the Providence of God had
fulfill'd the same to a tittle in his day. <hi>Josh. 23.
14. And behold</hi> (saith he) <hi>this day I am going the
way of all the earth, and ye know in all your hearts,
and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed
of all the good things which the Lord your God spake
concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and
not one thing hath failed thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And certainly 'tis of great importance to the
world, to understand the Judgements, and hear
of the Experiences of dying men. They of all
men are presumed to be most wise and most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
Besides, this is the last opportunity that
ever we shall have in this world to speak for
God. O then what a sweet thing would it be
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52858:116"/>
to close up our lives with an honourable Account
of the ways of God! to go out of the world bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him for all the mercies and truth which he hath
here performed to us! how would this encourage
weak Christians, and convince the Atheistical
world, that verily there is a reality and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
in the ways and people of God!</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> At death we begin the <hi>Angelical life</hi> of praise
and thanksgiving. We then enter upon that
everlasting sweet employment; and as I doubt
not but the Providences in which we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this world will be a part of that Song
which we shall sing in Heaven, so certainly it will
become us to tune our hearts and tongues for it
whil'st we are here, and especially when we are
ready to enter upon that blessed state. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let it be your daily meditation and study
what God hath been to you, and done for
you, from the beginning of his way hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have spread before you some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
to this blessed work. Oh that you

to say, that whoever finds a careful and a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
heart to record and treasure up the daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences
of God's mercy to him, shall never
want new mercies to record to his dying day.
It was said of <hi>ClaudJan</hi> that he wanted matter sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

Nothing (saith he) should be grievous
and bitter to a Christian, but to provoke
the displeasure of God. Avoid that, and no
affliction or trouble whatever can cast down such
a prudent Soul; but even as a spark is easily
extinguish'd in the Sea, so will the favour of God
extinguish those troubles. It is with such a Soul
(saith he) as it is with the Heavens; we think
the Heavens suffer when they are over-spread
with clouds, and the Sun suffers when it is eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
but there is no such thing, they suffer not
when they seem to suffer. <hi>Tranquillus Deus,
tranquillat omnJa.</hi> Every thing is well, and shall
be well, when all is well betwixt us and God.

that all that concerns them is in the hands of

                  <head>First Case.</head>
                  <p>HOw may a Christian discover the will of God
and his own duty under dark and doubtful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences?</p>
                  <p>In order to the clearing of this Case, we are
to consider, what is meant by the will of God;
what by those doubtful Providences, that make
the discovery of his will difficult, and what rules
are to be observed for the clearing up of Gods
will to our selves under such difficult and puzzling
Providences.</p>
                  <p>As to the Will of God, it falls under a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
consideration, of his <hi>secret</hi> and <hi>revealed</hi> Will;
this distinction is found in that Scripture, Deut.
29. 29. <hi>The secret things belong unto the Lord our
God, but those things which are revealed belong unto
us,</hi> &amp;c. The first is the rule of his own actions;
the later of ours: and this only is concerned in
the Quere.</p>
                  <p>This Revealed Will of God is either mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
to us in his <hi>Word,</hi> or in his <hi>Works.</hi> The
former is his <hi>commanding</hi> Will, the later his <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting</hi>
or <hi>permitting</hi> Will; the one versant about
good, the other about evil.</p>
                  <p>In these wayes God manifests his Will to men,
but yet with great variety and difference, both
as to the things revealed, the persons to whom
he reveals them, and the degrees of clearness in
which they are revealed.</p>
                  <p>(1.) As to the things revealed, there is great
differenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>: for the great and necessary duties of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:52858:120"/>
Religion are revealed to us in the Word, with
greatest perspicuity and evidence. About these
there can be no hesitation; but things of a lower
nature and lesser concern are left more obscure.</p>
                  <p>(2.) As to the persons to whom God reveals
his Will, there is great difference; some are
strong men, others babes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1. Some have
senses exercised, others are of weak and dull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
and we know every thing is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
according to the ability and measure of the
person receiving it. Hence it is, that one mans
way is very plain before him, he knows what he
ought to do: the other is ever and anon at a
loss, bivious and uncertain what to do.</p>
                  <p>(3.) The manner of Gods revealing his Will
to men is also very different. Some have had
special, personal, and peculiar discoveries of it
made to them. So had <hi>Samuel</hi> about the choice
of the person whom he should anoint King,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 15. And so had <hi>David, 1 Sam.</hi> 23. 2,
4, 9, 10, 11, 12. where you find upon his enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God (likely by the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi>)
God told him what was his duty as to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
and what would be the event of it.</p>
                  <p>But now, all are tyed up to the ordinary
standing rule of the written Word, and must
not expect any such extraordinary revelations
from God. The way we now have to know the
Will of God concerning us in difficult cases, is
to search and study the Scriptures, and where we
find no particular rule to guide us in this or that
particular case, there we are to apply general
rules, and govern our selves according to the
Analogy and proportion they bear towards each
other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:52858:120"/>
But now it often falls out, that in such doubtful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
cases we are entangled in our own thoughts, and
put to a loss what course to take. We pray with
<hi>David.</hi> that God would <hi>make his way plain before
us,</hi> Psal. 5. 8. Afraid we are of displeasing God,
and yet doubtful we may do so; whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
this way, or that. And this comes to pass
not only through the difficulty of the case, but
from our own ignorance and inadvertency; and
very frequently from those <hi>Providences</hi> that lye
before us, wherein God seems to hint his mind
to us, this way or that, and whether we may
safely guide our selves by those intimations of
Providence, is doubtful to us.</p>
                  <p>That God doth give men secret hints and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations
of his Will by his Providence, cannot
be doubted; but yet Providences in themselves,
are no stable rule of duty, nor sufficient discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Will of God. We may say of them,
as it is, Job 23. 8, 9. <hi>Behold, I go forward, but he
is not there: and backward, but I cannot perceive
him: an the left hand where he doth work, but I
cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right
hand, that I cannot see him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Providence in it self be allowed to be a su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

discovery of Gods Will to us, then we
shall be forced often times to justifie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the same cause or person, forasmuch as
there is <hi>one event happens to all,</hi> and as it falls out
to the good, so to the wicked, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
if Providence alone were the Rule to judge
any action or design by; then a wicked under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takement
would cease to be so, if it should succeed
well; but sin is sin still, and duty is duty still, what
ever the events and issues of either be.</p>

                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:52858:121"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The safest way therefore to make use of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in such cases is, to consider them as they
follow the commands or promises of the Word,
and not singly and separately in themselves. If
you search the Scriptures with an indifferent and
unbyassed spirit, in a doubtful case, pray for
counsel and direction from the Lord, attend to
the dictates of Conscience. And when you have
done all, shall find the Providences of God falling
out agreeably to the dictates of your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and the best light you can find in the
Word, you may in such cases make use of it as an
encouragement to you, in the way of your duty:
But the most signal demonstrations of Providence
are not to be accepted against a Scripture rule;
no smiles or successes of Providences may in this
case encourage us to proceed; and on the other
side, no frowns or discouragements of Providence
should dishearten us in the way of our duty, how
many soever we should encounter therein. Holy
<hi>Job</hi> could not find the meaning of God in his
Works, yet would he not <hi>go back from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of his lips,</hi> Job 23. 9. The like reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

and cleave to the Word, how many stumbling
blocks soever Providence should permit to be laid
in his way. <hi>I am become</hi> (saith he) <hi>like a bottle

                     </gap>ell him in his way? The <hi>Disciples</hi>
at <hi>Tyre</hi> said to him <hi>by the Spirit</hi> (though in that
they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ollowed their own spirits) <hi>that he should not
go to Jerusalem,</hi> Acts 21. 4.</p>
                  <p>Then at <hi>Cesarea</hi> he met <hi>Agabus</hi> a Prophet, who
told him what should be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him. And after all this, how passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do the Brethren beseech him to decline that
journey? <hi>Ver.</hi> 12, 13. Yet knowing his rule, and
resolving to be faithful to it, he puts by all and
proceeds in his journey.</p>
                  <p>Well then, Providence in concurrence with
the Word may give some encouragement to us
in our way; but no testimony of Providence is to
be accepted against the Word. If Scripture and
Conscience tell you, such a way is sinful, you may
not venture upon it, how many opportunities
and encouragements soever Providence may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to offer themselves to you, for they are
only permitted for your Tryal, not your encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement:
Take this therefore for a sure Rule,
That no Providence can legitimate, or justifie
any moral evil. Nor will it be a plea before
God for any man to say, The Providence of God
gave me encouragement to do it, though the
Word gave me none. If there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(1.) Providences as they follow Promises and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
are Evidences of God's faithfulness in their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment.
When <hi>David</hi> languished under
a disease, and his Enemies began to triumph in
the hopes of his downfall; he prays, <hi>Psal.</hi> 41.
10. that God would be merciful to him, and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52858:122"/>
raise him up; and by that, he saith, <hi>he knew the
Lord favoured him, because his Enemy did not tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over him, ver.</hi> 11. this Providence he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as a token for good, as elsewhere he
calls it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 86. 17. And (2.) Providences give
us loud calls to those duties which the Command
lays upon us, and tell us when we are actually
and presently under the obligation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
as to the performance of them. Thus
when sad Providences befall the Church or our
selves, they call us to humiliation; and let us
know that then the command upon us to humble
our selves at the feet of God is in force upon us,
<hi>Micah 6. 9. The Lords voice cryeth to the City, and
the man of wisdom shall see thy name, hear the rod,
and who hath appointed it.</hi> The Rod hath a voice;
and what doth it speak? Why now is the time
to humble your selves under the mighty hand of
God. This is the day of trouble in which God
hath bid you to call upon him. And <hi>

                        </gap> contra,</hi> when
comfortable Providences refresh us, it now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, this is the time to rejoyce in God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

but not <hi>to always.</hi> It's our duty therefore and
our wisdom to distinguish seasons, and know the
proper duties of every season: and Providence is
an <hi>Index</hi> that points them out to us. Thus of the
first Case.</p>

                  <head>The Second Case.</head>
                  <p>HOw may a Christian be supported in waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God whil'st Providence delays the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the mercies to him for which he hath long
pray'd and waited?</p>
                  <p>Two things are supposed in this Case.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>(1.) That Providence may linger and delay the
performance of those mercies to us that we
have long waited and prayed for.</item>
                     <item>(2.) That during that delay and suspension,
our hearts and hopes may be very low, and
ready to fail.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Providence may long delay the performance of
those mercies we have prayed and waited upon
God for.</p>
                  <p>For the right understanding of this, know that
there is a two-fold term or season fixed for the
performance of mercy to us. One by the Lord
our God, in whose hand times and seasons are,
<hi>Acts</hi> 1. 7. Another by our selves, who raise up
our own expectations of mercies sometimes
meerly through the eagerness of our desires after
them, and sometimes upon uncertain conjectural
grounds and appearances of encouragement that
lye before us.</p>
                  <p>Now nothing can be more precise, certain
and punctual, than is the performance of mercy
at the time and season which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
how long soever it be, or how many obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52858:123"/>
soever lye in the way of it. There was a
time prefixed by God himself for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of that Promise of <hi>Israel's</hi> deliverance out
of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and it's said, <hi>Exod. 12. 41. At the end
of the four hundred and thirty years, even the self same
day it came to pass, that all the host of the Lord went
out of the Land of</hi> Egypt. Compare this with
<hi>Acts</hi> 7. 17. and there you have the ground and
reason why their deliverance was not, nor could
be delayed one day longer, because <hi>the time of
the Promise was now come.</hi> Promises like a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
woman must accomplish their appointed
months, and when they have so done, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
will Midwife the mercies they go big withal
into the world, and not one of them shall miscarry.</p>
                  <p>But for the seasons which are of our own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ixing
and appointment, as God is not tyed to them,
so his Providences are not governed by them:
and hence are our disappointments. <hi>We looked
for peace, but no good came; for a time of health,
and behold trouble, Jer.</hi> 8. 15. And hereupon is it
that we fret at the delays of Providence, and
suspect the faithfulness of God in their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.
<hi>But his thoughts are not our thoughts, Isa.
55. 8. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise as
men count slackness, 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 9. It is slackness if
you reckon by our own rule and measure, but it is
not so, if you reckon and count it by God's. The
Lord doth not compute and reckon his seasons of
working by our <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> You have both
these Rules compared, and the ground of our
mistake detected in that Scripture, <hi>Hab. 2. 3.
The VisJon is yet for an appointed time, but at the
end it shall speak, and not lye: though it tarry, wait
for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:52858:124"/>
God appoints the time: when that appointed
time is come, the expected mercies will not fail:
But in the mean time, <hi>though it tarry</hi> (saith the
Prophet) <hi>wait for it, for it will not tarry.</hi> Tarry,
and not tarry, how shall this be reconciled?
The meaning is, it may tarry much beyond <hi>your
expectatJon,</hi> but not a moment beyond <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> During this delay of Providence, the hearts
and hopes of the people of God may be very
low, and much discouraged. This is too plain
from what the Scriptures have recorded of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and every one of us may find in our own
experiences. We have an instance of this in
<hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 13, 14. in the 13. <hi>verse</hi> you have God's
faithful Promise, that <hi>he will comfort his people,
and have mercy upon his afflicted.</hi> Enough one
would think to raise and comfort their hearts.
But the mercy promised was long in coming,
they waited from year to year, and still the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
pressed them, and was not removed. And
therefore <hi>ver. 14. ZJon said, the Lord hath forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
me and my Lord hath forgotten me,</hi> q. d. It's in
vain to look for such a mercy, God hath no regard
to us, we are out of his heart and mind, he
neither cares for us nor minds what becomes of
us.</p>
                  <p>So it was with <hi>David,</hi> after God had made
him such a Promise, and in the time thereof so
faithfully performed it, that never was mercy
better secured to any man; for they are call'd,
<hi>the sure mercJes of</hi> David, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 3. yet Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
delayed the accomplishment of them so
long, and suffered such difficulties to intervene,
that he even despaires to see the accomplishment
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52858:124"/>
of them, but even concludes God had forgotten
him too, <hi>Psal. 13. 1. How long wilt thou forget me,
O Lord, for ever?</hi> And what he speaks here by way
of <hi>questJon,</hi> he elsewhere turns into a positive
<hi>conclusJon, Psal. 116. 11. All men are Lyars, I shall
one day perish by the hand of</hi> Saul. And the causes
of these despondencies, and sinkings of heart
are partly from our selves, and partly form Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
If we duly examine our own hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, we shall find that these sinkings of heart
are</p>
                  <p>The immediate effects of unbelief. We do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
not depend and rely upon the word with that
full trust and confidence that is due to the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
word of a faithful and unchangeable God.
You may see the ground of this faintness in that
Scripture, <hi>Psal. 27. 13. I had fainted unless I had
belJeved.</hi> Faith is the only Cordial that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
the heart against these faintings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondencies.
Where this is wanting, or is weak,
no wonder our hearts sink at this rate, when dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
are before us.</p>
                  <p>Our judging and measuring things by the rules <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of sense, this is a great cause of our discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
We conclude, According to the Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of things will be their Issues. If <hi>Abraham</hi>
had done so, in that great tryal of his faith, he
had certainly lost his footing; <hi>but against hope,
(i. e.)</hi> against natural probability, <hi>he belJeved
in hope, giving Glory to God,</hi> Rom. 4. 18. If <hi>Paul</hi>
had done so, he had fainted under his tryals,
2. <hi>Cor. 4. 16, 8, we faint not</hi> (saith he)<hi>whil'st
we look not at the things that are seen,</hi> q. d. That
which keeps up our spirits, is our looking off
from things present and visible, and measuring
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52858:125"/>
all by another rule, <hi>viz.</hi> the power and fidelity
of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>irmly engaged in the Promises.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> In all these things <hi>Satan</hi> manages a design up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us. Hence he takes occasions to suggest hard
thoughts of God, and to beat off our Souls from
all confidence in him, and expectations form him.
He is the great make-bate betwixt God and the
Saints. He reports the difficulties and fears that
are in our way with advantage, and labours to
weaken our hands, and discourage our hearts in
waiting upon God. And these suggestions gain
the more credit with us, because they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
and attested by sense and feeling.</p>
                  <p>But here is a desperate design carrying on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
very plausible pretences against our souls.
It concerns us to be watchful now, and maintain
our faith and hope in God. Now blessed is he
that can resign all to God, and quietly wait for
his salvation. To assist the soul in this difficulty,
I shall offer some farther help beside what hath
been formerly given under the <hi>first CautJon,</hi> pag.

And besides this limitation as to the <hi>Object,</hi>
it's limited (as all other promises relating to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals

have so long waited upon God. Spiritual mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are of two sorts; such as belong to the
<hi>Essence,</hi> the very being of the new creature,

and the comfort of the inner man; without
which you cannot live so cheerfully as you
would. The mercies of the former kind are
Absolutely necessary, and therefore put into Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Promises, as you see, Jer. 32. 40. <hi>And
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52858:126"/>
I will make an everlasting Covenant with them, that
I will not turn away from them to do them good,

shall not depart from me.</hi> But for the rest they
are dispensed to us in such measures, and at
such seasons as the Lord sees fit, and many of
his own people live for a long time without
them. The donation and continuation of the
Spirit, to quicken, sanctifie and unite us with
Christ is necessary, but his joyes and comforts
are not so. A Child of light may <hi>walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
Isa. 50. 10. He lives by faith, and not

                  <p>HOw may a Christian discern when a Providence
is sanctified, and comes from the love of God
to him?</p>
                  <p>There are two sorts or kinds of Providences
versant about men in this world, the issues and
events of which are vastly different, yea, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to each other.</p>
                  <p>To some all Providences are over-ruled and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
ordered for good, according to that blessed
Promise, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. not only things that are
good in themselves, as Ordinances, Graces, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Mercies; but things that are evil in
themselves, as Temptations, Afflictions, and
even their Sins and Corruptions shall turn in
the issue to their advantage and benefit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:52858:129"/>
though sin be so <hi>intrinsecally</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> evil in
its own nature, that in it self it be not capable of
sanctification; yet out of this worst of evils God
can work good to his people; and though he
never make sin the <hi>Instrument</hi> of good; yet his
Providence may make it the <hi>occasJon</hi> of good to
his people; so that spiritual benefits may by
the wise over-ruling of Providence be occasioned
to the people of God by it.</p>
                  <p>And so for afflictions of all kinds, the greatest
and sorest of them; they do work in the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Providence a great deal of good to the
Saints, and that not only as the occasions, but as
the Instruments and means of it, <hi>Isa. 27. 9. by
this shall the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged, (i. e.</hi>)
by the instrumentality of this sanctified affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To others nothing is sanctified either as an
Instrument or occasion of any spiritual good;
but as the worst things are ordered to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the Saints, so the best things wicked men
enjoy do them no good. Their Prayers are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 109. 7. The Ordinances are
the savour of Death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. The Grace of

                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore the Events of Providence fall
out so opposite to each other upon the Godly,
and Ungodly; every thing farthering the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

it cannot but be acknowledged a most important
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52858:129"/>
case in which every Soul is deeply concern'd,
whether the Providences under which he is, be
sanctified to him or no?</p>
                  <p>For the clearing of which I shall premise two
necessary Considerations, and then subjoyn the
Rules which will be useful for the determination
of the question.</p>
                  <p>And first, Let it be considered, that we cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
know from the matter of the things before us,
whether they be sanctified or unsanctified to us;
for so consider'd, <hi>all things come alike to all; and
no man knoweth either love or hatred by all the things
that are before him. Eccles.</hi> 9. 1, 2. We cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
the mind and <hi>heart</hi> of God, by the things
he dispenseth with his <hi>hand.</hi> If prosperous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
befall us, we cannot say, Herein is a
sure sign that God loves me; for who have more
of those Providences than the people of his
wrath? <hi>Psal. 73. 7. They have more than their
hearts can wish.</hi> Sure that must be a weak Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for <hi>Heaven,</hi> which accompanies so great
a part of the world to <hi>Hell.</hi> By these things we
may testifie our love to God; but from ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
such enjoyments we cannot get any solid as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of his love to us.</p>
                  <p>And from adverse afflictive Providences we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know his hatred. If afflictions, great afflictions,
many afflictions, long continued afflictions should
set a brand, or fix a Character of Gods hatred
upon the persons on whom they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>all; where then
shall we find Gods people in the world? We
must then seek out the proud vain sensual wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
of the world, who spend their days in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and say these are the men whom God
loves<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:52858:130"/>
Outward things are promiscuously dispensed,
and no man's spiritual estate is discernable by the
view of his temporal. When God draws the
Sword, it may <hi>cut off the righteous</hi> as well as <hi>the
wicked, Ezek.</hi> 21. 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Though the Providences of God <hi>materJally</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
afford no evidence of Gods love to us, yet
the <hi>manner</hi> in which they befall us, and the effects
and fruits they produce in us, do distinguish them
very manifestly; and by them we may discern whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be sanctified Providences, and fruits of
the love of God, or no. But yet these effects
and fruits of Providences by which we discern
their nature, do not always presently appear;
but time must be allowed for the souls exercise
under them. As it is <hi>Heb. 12. 11. Now no afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the present seemeth joyous, but grJevous: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
afterwards it yJeldeth the peaceable fruits
of Righteousness unto them which are exercised
thereby.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The benefit of a <hi>Providence</hi> is discern'd as that
of a <hi>medicine</hi> is, for the present it gripes, and
makes the stomach sick and loathing; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
we find the benefit of it in our recovery of
health and chearfulness. Now the Providences
of God being some of them comfortable, and
others sad and grievous to nature, and the way
to discern the sanctification and blessing of them,
being by the manner in which they come and their
operations upon our spirits; I shall consider
the case as it respects both sorts of Providences,
and shew you what effects of our troubles or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
will speak them to be sanctified and blessed
to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:52858:130"/>
And first for sad and afflictive Providences in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
what kind or degree soever they befall us, we may
warrantably conclude, they are blessings to us,
and come from the love of God, when</p>
                  <p>They come in a proper season, when we have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
need of them, either to prevent some sin we are
falling into, or recover us out of a remiss, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
and careless frame of spirit into which we
are already fallen, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 6. if need be, ye are in
heaviness.</hi> Certainly, it is a good sign that God
designs your good by those troubles which are so
fitted and wisely order'd to ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>k the opportunity.
If you see the Husbandman lopping a tree in the
proper Season, it argues he aims at the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and flourishing of it; but to do the same
thing at <hi>Midsummer</hi> speaks no regard to it, yea,
his design to destroy it.</p>
                  <p>When they are fitted both for <hi>quality</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
to work properly upon our most predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
corruptions, then they look like sanctified
strokes. The Wisdom of God is much seen in
the choice of his rods. It is not any kind of
trouble that will work upon and purge every sin;
but when God chuses for us such afflictions as like
Physick are appropriated to the disease the soul
labours under; this speaks divine care and love.
Thus we may observe,<note place="margin">‚òú</note> it's usual with God to
smite us in those very comforts which stole
away too much of the love and delight of our
souls from God: to cross us in those things from
which we raised up too great expectatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>s of
comfort. These Providences speak the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of God over us, and his care to prevent far
worse evils by these sad but needful strokes.
And so for the degrees of our troubles, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52858:131"/>
strokes are <hi>ordinarily</hi> fitted by the wisdome
of God to the strength and ability of our inherent
grace, <hi>Isa. 17. 8. in measure when it shooteth forth
thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in
the day of the east wind.</hi> It is an <hi>AllusJon</hi> to a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicJan</hi>
who exactly weighs and measures all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
which he mingles in a potion for his
sick patient; that it may be proportionate to his
strength and no more: and so much the next
words intimate, <hi>by this therefore shall the iniquity of</hi>
Jacob <hi>be purged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It is a good sign our troubles are sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ied to
us, when they turn our hearts against sin, and
not against God. There be few great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
which befall men, but they make them
quarrelsome and discontented. Wicked men
quarrel with God, and are filled with discontent
against him. So the Scripture describes them,
<hi>Rev. 16. 9. They were scorched with great heat,
and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power
over these plagues.</hi> But Godly men to whom affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are sanctified, they justifie God, and fall
out with sin, they condemn themselves and give
glory to God, <hi>Dan. 9. 7. O Lord, righteousness
belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusJon of faces,</hi>
&amp;c. And <hi>Lam. 3. 39. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</hi>
Happy afflictions which make the Soul fall out
and quarrel only with sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> It is a sure sign afflicting Providences are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
when they purge the heart from sin, and
leave both heart and life more pure, heavenly,
mortified, and humble than they found them.
Sanctified afflictions are cleansers, they pull
down the pride, refine the earthliness, and purge
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52858:131"/>
out the vanity of the Spirit. So you read, <hi>Dan.
11.</hi> 35. it purifies and makes their Souls white:
Hence it's compar'd to a <hi>furnace</hi> which separates
the dross from the pure metal, <hi>Isa. 48. 10. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I have refined thee, but not with Silver: I have
chosen thee in the furnace of afflictJon.</hi> But for
wicked men, let them be never so long in the
<hi>Furnace,</hi> they lose no dross, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 6. How
many Christians can bear witness to this truth!
After some sharp affliction hath been upon them,
how is the earthliness of their hearts purged!
they see no beauty, taste no more relish in the
world than in the white of an Egg. Oh
how serious, humble, and heavenly are
they, till the impressions made upon them by
afflictions be worn off, and their deceitful lusts
have again entangled them! And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
why we are so often under the discipline of
the rod. Let a Christian (saith a late writer) be
but two or three years without an affliction, and
he is almost good for nothing: he cannot pray,
nor meditate, nor discourse at that rate he was
wont to do: but when a new affliction comes,
now he can find his tongue, and come to his knees
again, and live at another rate.</p>
                  <p>It is a good sign afflictive Providences are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
sanctified to us, when we draw near to God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them and <hi>turn to him that smites us.</hi> A wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man under affliction <hi>revolts more and more, Isa.
1. 5. turns not to him that smites him, Isa.</hi> 9. 13.
but grows worse than before; formality is turned
into stupidity and dedolency.</p>
                  <p>But if God afflict his own people with a sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
rod, it awakens them to a more earnest seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God: it makes them pray more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52858:132"/>
spiritually and fervently than ever. When
<hi>Paul</hi> was buffeted by Satan, he <hi>besought the Lord
thrice, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> We may conclude our afflictions to be san<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and to come from the love of God to us,
when they do not alienate our hearts from God,
but inflame our love to him. This is a sure rule,
Whatever ends in the increase of our love to
God, proceeds from the love of God to us. A
wicked man finds his heart rising against God
when he smites him; but a gracious heart cleaves
the closer to him: he can love, as well as justifie
an afflicting God. <hi>All this is come upon us: yet
have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsly
in thy Covenant<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> our heart is not turned back, neither
have our steps declined from thy way: though thou
hast sore broken us in the place of Dragons, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
us with the shadow of Death, Psal.</hi> 44. 17, 18,
19. Here you have a true account of the temper
and frame of a gracious soul under greatest affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
To be <hi>broken in the place of Dragons and
covered with the shadow of death</hi> imports the most
dismal state of affliction: yet even then a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
heart turns not back (<hi>i. e.</hi>) doth not for all
this abate one drachm of love to God: God
is as good and dear to him in afflictions as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Lastly, We may call our afflictions sanctified
when <hi>divine teachings</hi> accompany them to our
souls, <hi>Psal. 94. 12. Blessed is the man whom thou
chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy law.</hi>
Sanctified afflictions are <hi>eye-salve,</hi> they teach us
sensibly and effectually when the Spirit accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
them; the evil of sin, the vanity of the
creature, the necessity of securing things that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52858:132"/>

                  <p>HOw may we attain unto an evenness and steddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

Aspects of Providence upon us?</p>
                  <p>Three things are supposed in this Case.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That Providence hath various and contrary
Aspects upon the people of God.</item>
                     <item>2. That it is a common thing with them, to
experience great disorders of spirit under
those Changes of Providence.</item>
                     <item>3. That these disorders may be (at least in
a great measure) prevented, by the due
use and application of those rules and helps
that God hath given us in such Cases.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>That Providence hath various, yea, contrary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Aspects upon the people of God, is a case so
plain, that it needs no more than the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning,
to let it in to all our Understandings.
Which of all the people of God have not felt
this truth? Providence rings the changes all the
world over. <hi>He encreaseth the NatJons, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth
them; he enlargeth the NatJons, and strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
them again,</hi> Job 12. 23. The same it doth
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52858:135"/>
with persons, Psal. 102. 10. <hi>Thou hast lifted me
up, and cast me down.</hi> See what a sad Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Providence made upon the Church, Lam.
1. 1, 12. <hi>How doth the City sit solitary that was
full of people! How is she become as a Widow! She
that was great among the NatJons, and Princess
among the Provinces, how is she become tributary!
Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold
and see, if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow,
which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
me in the day of his fJerce anger.</hi> And how
great an Instance was <hi>Joh</hi> of this truth, <hi>Job 29.

have complained with <hi>Naomi,</hi> whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

have said as the people of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> did of her,

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> These Vicissitudes of Providence commonly
cause great disorders of spirit in the best men.
Look as intense <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> try the strength
and soundness of the constitution of our bodies,
so the <hi>alteratJons</hi> made by Providence upon our
conditions, try the strength of our graces; and
too often discover the weakness and corruption
of holy men. <hi>HezekJah</hi> was a good man; but
yet his weakness and corruption was bewrayed
by the alterations Providence made upon his
conditions. When sickness and pains summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to the grave, what bitter complaints and
despondencies are recorded? in <hi>Isa. 38. per tot.</hi>
and when Providence lifted him up again into
a prosperous condition, what ostentation and
vain glory did he discover? <hi>Isa. 39. 2. David</hi>
had more than a common stock of inherent
grace, yet not enough to keep him in an equal
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52858:135"/>
temper of spirit under great alterations, Psal.
30. 6, 7. <hi>In my prosperity I said I shall never be
moved; thou hidest thy face and I was troubled.</hi>
It is not every man can say with <hi>Paul, I know
both how to be abased, and I know how to abound
every where, and in all things I am instructed
both to be full, and to be hungry, both to abound
and to suffer need,</hi> Phil. 4. 12. He is truly rich
in grace, whose riches or poverty neither hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the acting, nor impoverisheth the stock of
his graces.</p>
                  <p>Though the best men be subject to such disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of heart under the changes of Providence;
yet these disorders may in a great measure be
prevented by the due application of such Rules
and helps, as God hath given us in such cases.</p>

are of great use to the people of God, they
cannot live without them. The Earth doth not
more need chastening frosts, and mellowing

Let the best Christian be but a few years without

without me ye can do but little, or without
me ye can do nothing but with great difficulty,
or without me ye can do nothing perfectly;
but without me ye can do nothing at all. And
every Christian hath a witness in his own breast
to attest this truth: for there are cases frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
occurring in the methods of Providence, in
which notwithstanding all their prayers and
desires, all their reasonings and strivings, they
cannot quiet their hearts fully in the dispose;

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52858:141"/>
lowring, this is a natural sign of a foul and rainy
day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 3. and there are as certain signs
of the times, whereby we may discern when
trouble is near, even at the door: And these
forewarnings are given by the Lord to awaken us
to our duties, by which they may either be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
<hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 1, 2. or sanctified and sweetned
to us when they come. These signs and notices
of approaching troubles are gathered <hi>partly</hi> from
the <hi>observatJon</hi> and collation of parallel Scripture
cases and examples, God generally holding one
tenour and steddy course in the administrations
of his Providences in all ages, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 6. partly</hi>
from the <hi>ReflectJons</hi> Christians make upon the
frames and tempers of their own hearts, which
greatly need awakening, humbling and purging
Providences. For let a Christian be but a few
years or months without a rod, and how formal,
earthly, dead and vain, will his heart grow?
And such a temper presages affliction to them
that are beloved of the Lord, as really as the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
or sweating of the stones doth rain. Lastly,
The ordering and disposing of the next causes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a posture and preparation for our trouble,
plainly premonisheth us that trouble is at the
door. Thus when the symptoms of sickness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

our bosome, or our children that are as our own
souls, Providence herein awakens our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of death and doleful separations: so when
enemies combine together and plot the ruine of
our liberties, estates, or lives, and God seemeth to
loose the bridle of restraint upon their necks,
now we cannot but be alarmed with the near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of troubles, especially when at the same
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52858:141"/>
time our conscience shall reflect upon the abuse
and non-improvement of these our threatned
comforts.</p>
                     <p>The case before us supposeth, that these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and fore-runners of affliction, do usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
very much disturb the order and break the
peace of our souls, they put the mind under great
discomposure, the thoughts under much distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and the affections into tumults and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
                     <p>Ah how unwilling are we to surrender to the
Lord the Loan which he lent us! to be disquieted
by troubles when at ease in our enjoyments!
How unwelcome are the messengers of affliction
to the best men! we are ready to say to them as
the Widow to <hi>Elijah, What have I to do with thee,

many mutinies in the soul, whil'st grace like
young <hi>Abijah</hi> is weak handed, and cannot resist

makes upon the season to irritate and assist our

motion, is the more easily moved. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
and hurry of thoughts he undiscernedly
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52858:142"/>
shuffles in his temptations. Sometimes aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the evils which we fear with all the sinking
and overwhelming circumstances imaginable.
Sometimes divining and fore-casting such events
and evils, as (haply) never fall out. Sometimes
repining at the disposes of God as more severe
to us than others. And sometimes reflecting
with very unbelieving and unworthy thoughts
upon the promises of God, and his faithfulness
in them, by all which the affliction is made to
sink deep into the soul before it actually comes.
The thoughts are so disordered, that duty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be duly performed. And the soul is really weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and disabled to bear its tryal when it comes
indeed: just as if a man should be kept waking

shall return again to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or I shall not: If I do,
then I shall see it again, and enjoy the Lord in his
ordinances there. If I do not, then I shall go to
that place where there is no need or use of those
things. And either way it will be well for me, I am
content to refer all to the divine pleasure, and
commit the issue, be it whatever it will be, to the
Lord.</p>
                     <p>And till our hearts come to the like resolve,
we can have no peace within. <hi>Commit thy works
unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established,
Prov.</hi> 16. 3. By works he means not only every
enterprize and business we <hi>undertake,</hi> but every
puzzling, intricate, and doubtful event we <hi>fear.</hi>
These being once committed by an act of faith,
and our wills resigned unto his, besides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
we shall have in the issue, we shall have the
present advantage of a well composed, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Spirit.</p>
                     <p>But this resignation is the difficulty; no doubt
of peace, could we once bring our hearts to that.
And therefore</p>
                     <p>I shall here subjoyn such helps and directions, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

but as for man, yea the wisest among men, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
doth his understanding penetrate the works
and designs of Providence? And how oft are we
forced to retract our rash opinions, and confess
our mistakes? acknowledging that if Providence
had not seen with better eyes than ours, and
looked farther than we did, we had precipitated
our selves into a thousand mischiefs, which by
its wisdom and care we have escaped. It's well
for us that the <hi>seven eyes of Providence</hi> are ever
awake, and looking out for our good. Now if
one creature can and ought to be guided and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by another that is more wise and skilful
than himself, as the <hi>ClJent</hi> by his learned <hi>Counsel,</hi> the

                        <p>It's nothing but our pride and arrogance over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing

                        <p>(1.) There is much sin in so doing: for, all

they other than the immediate issues and fruits
of pride and unbelief? There is not a greater
discovery of pride in the world, than in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests

presumptuous invading of Gods Prerogative, to
dictate to his Providence, and prescribe to his

                        <p>(2.) There is a great deal of vanity in it:
all the thoughtfulness in the world will not make
one hair white or black: all our discontents will

deeper points of self-denyal than this before you, and
shame your selves out of this quarrelling temper with
Providence.</p>
                        <p>You know what a close tryal that Providence
was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that called him from his native
Countrey and Fathers house, to go he knew not
whither; and yet it's said in <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 2. he came
<pb facs="tcp:52858:144"/>
to Gods foot, as readily obeying his call, as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
when his Master knocks for him with his
foot.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Paul</hi>'s voyage to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> had a dismal
aspect upon himself, he could expect nothing
but bonds and prisons, as he tells us, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 23.
and a great tryal it was to the <hi>Saints,</hi> who could
not tell how to give up such a <hi>Minister,</hi> yet he
resigns up his will to Gods, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 22. and so
do they, Acts 21. 14. <hi>The Will of the Lord be done.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But far beyond these, and all other patterns,
what an example hath our dear <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> set
before us in the deepest point of self-denyal
that ever was in the world. When the Father
gave the Cup of sufferings into his hands in the
garden, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 36. a cup of wrath, the wrath
of the great and terrible God, and that without
mixture: the very taste whereof, put Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Agony and astonishment, a sore amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a bloody sweat; and forced from him that
vehement and sad cry, <hi>Father, if it be possible, let
this cup pass;</hi> yet still with submission, <hi>never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
not my will, but thine be done.</hi> O blessed
pattern of obedience, and resignation to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

Will resigned up, and melted into the Will of God.</p>
                        <p>(1.) Such a Spirit hath a continual <hi>Sabbath</hi>
within it self: the thoughts are established, <hi>Prov.
16.</hi> 3. and truly, till a man come to this, he doth
but too much resemble the <hi>Devil,</hi> who is a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Spirit, secking rest, but finding none.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:52858:144"/>
It was an excellent expression of <hi>Luther,</hi> to
one that was much perplexed in his spirit about
the doubtful events of some affairs of his that
were then depending: <hi>Dominus tua omnJa fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cJat,
&amp; tu nihil facJas, sed sis Sabbatum Christi:
(i. e.)</hi> The Lord shall do all for thee, and thou
shalt do nothing, but be the Sabbath of Christ.
It is by this means that the Lord <hi>gives his beloved
sleep,</hi> Psal. 127. 2. he means not the sleep of the
body, but of the Spirit. <hi>Fideles</hi> (saith One
upon that place) <hi>etsi vitam agant laborJosam, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posiris
tamen &amp; tranquillis animis in fidei silentJo
se continent, ac si dormirent: (i. e.)</hi> Though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
live in the midst of many troubles here,
yet with quiet and composed minds they keep
themselves in the silence of faith, as though
they were asleep.</p>
                        <p>(2.) Besides, it fits a mans spirit for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God in all his afflictions, and this
alleviates and sweetens them beyond any thing
in the world.</p>
                        <p>(3.) And surely a man is never nearer the
mercy he desires, or the deliverance he expects,
(as One truly observes) than when his soul is
brought into a submissive temper. <hi>David</hi> was
never nearer the Kingdom, than when he became
as a weaned Child.</p>

leave your eternal concerns in his hands; and

things!</p>
                        <p>Your Profession as Christians, speaks you to
be led by the Spirit, but this practice speaks you
to follow the perverse counsels of your own

that have time and ability for such a work,

            <p>Some say, the Art of <hi>Medicine</hi> was thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

attained his skill, by a Collection of those posted
Experiments and Receipts.</p>
            <p>I am not for posting up all that a Christian

Religion doth not lay all open; but yet
there is a prudent, humble and seasonable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of our Experiences and observations
of Providence, which is exceeding beneficial both
to our selves and our brethren.</p>
            <p>If Christians in reading the Scriptures, would
judiciously collect and record the Providences
they shall meet with there, and (if destitute of
<pb facs="tcp:52858:146"/>
other helps) but add those that have fallen out
in their own time and experience; O what a

would it antidote their souls against the spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

beyond what many other Arguments can do,
that <hi>The Lord he is God, the Lord he is God.</hi>
            </p>

good purpose improved many Scriptural pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of Providence, which seem to lye out of the
road of common observation: Some passages I
have noted out of it, which have been sweet to
me. And O that Christians would every where
set themselves to such work! Providence carries
our lives, liberties and concernments in its hand
every moment. Your bread is in its <hi>Cupboard,</hi>
your money in its <hi>Purse,</hi> your safety in its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding

            <p>(1.) Trust not your slippery memories with
such a multitude of remarkable passages of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
as you have, and shall meet with in
your way to Heaven. It's true, things that
greatly affect us, are not easily forgotten by us;
and yet, how ordinary is it for new impressions

he) never failed me in all my life; for indeed,
I durst never trust it. Written memorials se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
us against that hazard; and besides, makes
them useful to others when we are gone. So
that you carry not away all your treasure to
<pb facs="tcp:52858:146"/>
heaven with you, but leave these choice Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to your surviving friends. Certainly it were
not so great a loss, to lose your Silver, your

which God hath this way given you in

            <p>(2.) Take heed of clasping up those rich

greatest to us: and as time removes us farther
and farther from our former mercies or dangers,
so they lessen in our eyes, just as the Land from
which they sail, doth to <hi>Sea-men.</hi> Know that
your dangers have been as great, and your fears
no less formerly than now. Make it as much
your business, to preserve the sense and value, as
the memory of former Providences, and the fruit
