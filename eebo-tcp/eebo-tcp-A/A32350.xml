         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

leave their way, and become a Chriſtian, by
being baptized. After many reaſonings and
exhortings to it, at length he told him he
would firſt go to <hi>Rome,</hi> as the famouſeſt Seat
of Chriſtians, (that is Popiſh) and having ſeen
them he would tell him what he would do.
The other with all power of wit and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
argued againſt that courſe, beleeving their
proud, pompous, looſe, Atheiſticall manners
would utterly ſhipwrack all the hopes of his

comfort and eaſe of pains, I ſend you (as a ſmall

Tranſlation of Arabick rendred Latin, and by me
interpreted, which of late came unto my hands,
that before of long time has been concealed and
hid. Now it is to be obſerved, that among the
Iewes they make it a grand boaſt and honour, if
a man be skill'd in Arabick learning, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thoſe letters are of much uſe with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Philoſophers, and becauſe in that Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
they more confidently convey their ſecrets,
which they would vail from others, that Tongue
being in acquaintance with few Iews, and fewer
Chriſtians, For which cauſe I judge this Iew (the
Author of this Book, being but a Catachumenus
and novice Chriſtian) writ it in the Arabick,
and not in the Hebrew tongue. However (ſooner
or later) all things that are hid ſhall be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
according to the ſaying of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>In tranſlating this Book the Bible authorities
(brought by the Iew) <hi>I</hi> have writ in their proper
places in Latine, like as they were in the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,
not following our Tranſlation according to
<hi>S. Hierome,</hi> but as this Jew gave them when he
compoſed the Work. This <hi>I</hi> did, that none might

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49435:35"/>
this all that are expert in Arabick will witneſſe

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Deſire (O Maſter) my
conſcience may receive
ſome ſatisfaction by thee,
out of the Teſtimonies of
the Law, the Prophets, and
other Scriptures, about this
point, namely, How it
comes to paſſe that we Jews, our whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
have a generall great ſtroke of God upon
us in this Captivity, which now holds us, and
which we may well call Gods perpetuall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49435:39"/>
wrath, becauſe it findes no end. The Wheel
of time hath now ſpun a thouſand years, and
more, compleatly, ſince that <hi>Titus</hi> firſt led us
Captives. We are not ignorant that our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
worſhipt Idols, and ſlew the Prophets,
and caſt away the Law of God; yet for all
theſe tranſgreſſions, the ſmart of Gods ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
hand did vexe them but with a ſeventy
years Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and when that ſet
term of time was runne out, he was appeaſed
with them, and brought them back into their
own Land again. And at that time, according
to the ſuffrage of the Scripture,<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 12.</note> the anger
of God had then the bittereſt and ſtrongeſt
Ingredients of his wrath mixt with it above
any precedent times reckoned in that holy Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume;
notwithſtanding, as is already ſaid, the
puniſhment of ſo great ſinnes laid upon them
no longer then ſeventy years. But now, O
Maſter, that wrath which at this preſent pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
us, is a ſentence without a period, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in all the Prophets is there any end of
it promiſed. If we would thus ſhift it off,
and ſay, That the wrath in which we are now
deep plunged, is a continuance of that wrath,
which brought the ſeventy years miſery upon
us, ſeeing that ſerved to ſatisfie for the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
ſins of our Fathers; in ſo doing
we ſhould go about to charge God with a Ive,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49435:39"/>
which be farre from us to attempt, knowing
that the true and glorious God did by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſtint that Captivitie, within that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of years. Whereupon ſuch an anſwer
would prove a nullitie, a meer evaſion
and excuſe, not fit to be propounded before
thoſe who have any intellectuals. Further, if
we ſhall go on to ſay, That God in that
tranſmigration made a diviſion of mercy and
juſtice, had pitie on one part of our Jewiſh
generation, ſhewed no pitie to the other part,
and thoſe on whom he had mercy, he brought
backe to re-edifie the Temple,<note place="margin">Ier. 25. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>29.</note> as ſaith the
Prophet <hi>Jeremie:</hi> and if we ſhall ſay, that we
are that unhappy remnant, to which he
ſhewed no mercy, then will the Chriſtians
ſay to us, That becauſe God ſhewed mercy
to them that worſhipt Idols and ſlew the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
therefore he ſhould have mercy on us
alſo that have not ſo ſinned. Beſides, when our
Fathers ſinned, the puniſhment of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
kept within the bounds of certain years,
wherefore then is it, that we, who have not ſo
ſinned, have a puniſhment without bounds and
limits? It is a long and undated puniſhment
in which we lie faſt bound, it is now a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years old, and yet neither in the Law or
Prophets can we finde an end of it, or ſpie any
grave wherein it ſhall be buried. Wherefore
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49435:40"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> O Maſter, laying theſe grounds, that God hath
puniſhed our Fathers for Idolatry and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet-killing,
and in the Scripture their ſinne
and puniſhment are both recorded; ſeeing
God uſes not to puniſh the ſame ſin twice,
then the ſeventy years captivity muſt be the
puniſhment of the foregoing ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Again, it not being uſuall with God to lay
on an univerſall Rod, but where there hath
been an univerſall ſin, it muſt needs follow,
that after that captivity we have generally
committed ſome greater ſin before God, than
either their Idolatry or Prophet-ſlaughter,
weighing and proportioning their 70 years
puniſhment and no more, with our thouſand
years captivity and more, who are ſtill a
wretched diſperſion thorow the the four quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the world. Yet what ever falls out, we
are Gods people, and belong to him. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

becauſe in the Law we neither had nor have
any Faſt, as we have other obſervances;
yea, in like manner we were without Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,

theſe things are nothing worth, whiles Gods

we may be devout in obſerving all our

any of our Works. Greater therefore for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

the wrath of God is greater which is upon us,

               <p>ME thinks, O Maſter, we notably gull
both our ſelves and others, becauſe in
the Books of the Law and the Prophets, we
have the Lords promiſe frequently of freeing
our Nation, and of gathering us together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
from all our ſcatterings. Now theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
lookt into with a well adviſed minde,
it will appear they were all, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 1, Either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49435:43"/>
before, and in the ſeventy years; or, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 2, that
theſe promiſes were totally hindred from ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling,
the ſins of them, to whom they were
made, being an impediment to their impleti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
An inſtance, O Maſter, I give in thoſe few
words ſpoken by <hi>Ezechiel, If ye will do my
judgements, and keep my Commandements, then
Will</hi> I <hi>gather you from the foure corners of the
earth,</hi> I <hi>will lift you up, and bring you thorow
the Sea, yea</hi> I <hi>will make you return unto your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Houſe.</hi> Behold, that which the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
us by <hi>Ezechiel</hi> in theſe words, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places of his Prophecie, it was many
times fulfilled before the ſeventy years capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie,
as all ſuch promiſes of the Lords, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
greater or leſſer contained in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the ſacred Volume, were compleat and
fulfilled, before we fell into this laſt captivity,
which has no bottome, though we have been
more than a thouſand years in it, yet in none
of the Prophets can wee finde it has a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.
And where any promiſe of God treats
of freeing and gathering together, it is not to
be underſtood of this perpetuall bondage, but
of thoſe tribulations and diſperſions before the
ſeventy years, but after them there is not the
leaſt inkling of a promiſe, to gather us from
our ſcattered eſtate. Of neceſſity therefore
we muſt take it to us, that we have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49435:44"/>
that great ſinne ſince the forementioned
years, in which ſin we now are and obſtinately

Our Elders ſinned (before that time) who
came out of Aegypt, the Promiſe therefore

periſht in their ſins in the wilderneſſe.<note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi>

bolted him out from entring the promiſed
Land.<note place="margin">Deut. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Aaron</hi> ſinned, and he bore his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.</note>
                  <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt ſinned, and he broke his
Neck for breaking Gods Command, and his
Poſterity loſt the Prieſthood, though God had
promiſed it them for ever. Such promiſes as
theſe, are to be underſtood with this caution
alwayes, <hi>they ſhall be fulfilled, unleſſe for their
ſins they promerit another reward,</hi> as is plaine in
the Kingdome of <hi>David,</hi> when his Poſterity
after the fleſh fell ſhort of the Scepter, even
as the true and glorious God promiſed <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and his Seed they ſhould poſſeſſe the

of it for their ſins, and the Lord often reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

of it. Now a thouſand years and above are
gone over our heads, and our hopes of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
are vaniſht with them, becauſe we ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
in that ſinn, by which our Land is loſt

a grand one, O Maſter, that all of us with
one Lip conſent to this, that ſince the ſore
Servitude in <hi>Babylon,</hi> it muſt needs be, that we
have ſinned againſt God ſome great ſinne, and
yet none can pick out what this great ſinn is,
for which we have been laden with ſuch a

of the cauſe, and our ſin which hath thus
engulphed us in theſe deep evils, yet what are
we the better? The ſecret ſticks in his owne
breaſt, he doth not declare it to his neighbour.
Or what is himſelf the better for knowing it,
whiles he turns it not to his own profit, for

we do all ſee, that in the foreſaid Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
God remained with our Fathers in his
Prophets, <hi>Ieremie</hi> and others, he gave them
<hi>Salathiel</hi> for a Leader or Captain; they had
both Princes and Prieſts, which went with
them out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> after the time of their
repentance (or doing Penance) was finiſht,
and having got their God appeaſed, they built
<hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the Temple, and other Cities, and

In this our Captivitie all appears
with a ſtranger face, it is manifeſt that both
God and Prophet hath forſaken us, neither of
theſe are with us. Wherefore, O Maſter, this
will I make my task, I will exactly enquire,

is, which hath caſt us into this thouſand years
ſlavery and more, (in which we are cloathed

without our Purifications; yea, in one

and abomination of us with the whole world,
and all men on earth. Yet for all this miſery
that reignes in our eſtate, pride reignes in our

                  <hi>I will turn away,</hi>

One</hi> to be <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the ſon of <hi>Iacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 37.</note> who was
ſold by his Brethren into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and this
would I hold for true alſo, but that the Sacred
Writ makes this ſin of ſelling, the fourth for
number among the ſins, or tranſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Iſrael.
The Chriſtians themſelves (to whom the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of Sacred Volumes ſeems to be delivered &amp;
committed of God) do anſwer to our foreſaid
interpretation, that the ſelling of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> by his
Brethren, is the firſt, and not the fourth of
Iſraels ſins or tranſgreſſions. The ſecond ſin
they make the worſhipping of the Calf in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb.</hi>
The third tranſgreſſion is the ſlaughter
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49435:46"/>
of the Prophets, for which we ſerved as ſlaves
ſeventy years in <hi>Babylon.</hi> But the fourth tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
of Iſrael, <hi>the ſelling of the Righteous,</hi>
this they ſay is plainly meant of JESUS,
who was, according to the very letter, ſold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that aforeſaid tranſmigration. And we, O
Maſter, if we mean to maintain as Authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
our own Doctrine, and ſtop the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
mouthes with a ſufficient anſwer, this of
us muſt be undertaken, and made good, that
divers tranſgreſſions of Iſraels did precede this
of <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſelling, ſo as to make it fall in the
fourth number. Which thing we cannot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
the teſtimony of the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi>
making ſore againſt us, which ſets the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as the firſt tranſgreſſion of the
Children of Iſrael. The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> alſo
expreſſely makes appear, that the fourth ſinne
was the ſelling of the righteous One, for which
we have been Captives, and of which the
Lord with a fearfull Commination ſpeaks, that
he will never bring us backe again into the
Land of Promiſe, ſaying, <hi>And for the fourth</hi> I
<hi>will not tranſlate them, becauſe they ſold the

that for the ſelling the Righteous, the

now more than a thouſand years are paſt and

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49435:48"/>
was put to death; neither did God threaten
us this everlaſting deſtruction till after Chriſts
death. But ſuppoſe we would fain prove, that
before Chriſts death the Deluge of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
had drowned us, this the Chriſtians
with their anſwer will eaſily take away, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That which is but for ſeventy years is not
perpetuall, but before Chriſts death the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
had but a ſeventy years perpetuity,
and after thoſe years were worne out,
wee were carryed backe into our own land of
Promiſe, and were highly both favoured and
honoured of God. Verily, Maſter, my eyes fail
me, nor can I ſpie any evaſion, whereby we
can either ſlip out, or ſlip off that Propheſie,
ſeeing it is proved that 72 weeks and a year a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
which are 433 years, are compleat from
the re-edifying of the Temple, at that term of
time was Jeſus cut off by our Fathers, after
came Prince <hi>Titus</hi> and the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and they
dealt with us according to the tenure of that
Propheſie. Now at this day we lie under the
waves of a thouſand years miſery, and more;
nevertheleſſe though we be under the wrath of
God, yet ſtill we fixe our hopes on him.</p>
               <p>What if we argue thus for our ſelves, That
our Meſſiah will come, though he be not yet
come, and when he comes he will re-eſtate,
and re-poſſeſſe us of our Land of Promiſe,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49435:49"/>
then ſhall our Citie riſe out of her ruines, and
be re-edified, God will beſtow both favour
and honour upon us in our Land, and this
deſolation ſhall not be perpetuall? To this
allegation the Chriſtians will anſwer, that this
Aſſertion muſt bring from us this confeſſion,
that then the Meſſiah is yet to be cut off, that
<hi>Titus</hi> and the <hi>Romanes</hi> are ſtill to come, and
theſe things performed, that there is a worſe
deſolation will enſue it, that has more degrees
of miſery in it than this, in which we have
continued a thouſand years. Wo is me, O
maſter, for us, our excuſes and evaſions are
addle, and want all conſonancy to truth.</p>

ſo far as my eyes ſerve,<note place="margin">Pſa. 97.</note> I can interpret thoſe
<hi>Wells of ſalvation</hi> to bee meant of nothing

water to ſave by Baptiſme, his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in fire, to trie all by judgement; a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

                  <hi>I know that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49435:52"/>
cannot be ſeen with any eye of fleſh.<note place="margin">Eſay 53.</note> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

God, and he alone challenges the name of
that <hi>True Iuſt One,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> of whom that ſaying is, He

                  <note place="margin">Zach. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>neither was guile found in his

This cannot be ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any of the
Prophets, that he is a Righteous Saviour, and
without ſinne; you Maſter know well enough
that both <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
which the Scripture makes plain, in that
none is called the Righteous One, but Chriſt,
and that name is reſerved as onely proper to
him. And this without all doubt is to bee
held,<note place="margin">John 3.</note> that none are ſaved but thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
his firſt comming, and thoſe that beleeve
not, there is no ground for them to hope for
ſalvation at his ſecond comming. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

were worthy of death that beleeved not <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
who was two great degrees below Chriſt,
for <hi>Moſes</hi> was but a temporary Saviour, and a
ſinner, how much more are they worthy of this

of this Righteous One the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi>
ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Eſay 63. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Who is that that commeth from Edom,

the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the yeer
of retribution is come.</hi> O where have we any
hopes in that Righteous One, when we ſee
that he complaines of us to the Angels in
Heaven, and makes knowne to them that he
trod the Winepreſſe alone? Whom as it
that he trod in his wrath but us? who, after
the Battell in his firſt comming, hath thrown
us down, and we lie proſtrate, and trampled

when we with murderous hands ſlew the
Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> wee had laid hands upon this
Prophecie alſo, and quite blotted out this
fair authoritie out of his Booke, that no eye
might ever have beheld or read it againſt us.
And you may obſerve, that which <hi>David</hi> cals
a Battell, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts mighty in Battell,
Eſay</hi> calls a Winepteſſe. Alas for us, O Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,

               <head>CHAP. XIII. He more ſtrongly proves the corporall
Aſcenſion of Chriſt.</head>
               <p>FEar, as a Furie, haunts me, O Maſter, and
poſſeſſes me with this, that thoſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
recited by me out of the Prophets, are
all as points drawn from the Circumference,
and meeting all in that Juſt One, as their
Center, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was ſold for ſilver, as
the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> avouches; That he trod
the Winepreſſe, as <hi>Eſay</hi> averrs; That he was
in battell with our Fathers, as <hi>David</hi> affirms;
That he was caught, as in a Net, by our ſins,
as <hi>Jeremie</hi> alledges; That he was wounded in
his hands, as <hi>Zacharie</hi> aſſerts; That upon his
Veſture they caſt Lotts, as <hi>David</hi> aſſents;
That he aſcended into Heaven, as the ſame
Prophet, and others with an unanimous teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
give up: Which is not compatible,
nor can it ſtand with meer God conſidered
in his Divine Eſſence and nature; for the
Deitie has neither Reſurrection, Exaltation,
Deſcenſion, or Seſſion properly. Out of what
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49435:55"/>
hath been ſaid this muſt iſſue with a neceſſary
conſequence, That this Righteous one is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
come, to whom all the foreſaid things
very aptly agree, and are fitly accommodated
to his corporeall and humane nature, which he
aſſumed. Now becauſe [O Maſter] I know
how hardly this enters into thy beliefe, as
a moſt improbable paradox, that a man ſhould
bodily aſcend into Heaven, ponder theſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
and examples, which we meet with in
Scripture, which underprop and confirm this
truth. In the firſt place I rank the Prophet
<hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 68. 18.</note> who ſaith, <hi>God hath aſcended on high,
he hath led captivitie captive,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 68. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and given gifts
to men.</hi> Again he ſpeaketh of his Aſcenſion,
<hi>Sing unto God, and glorifie his name, make way
for him that aſcendeth from the Weſtern parts, the
Lord is his name.</hi> Again, <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of him
in that Pſalm, which thou haſt in thine heart,
<hi>Sing praiſes to God that aſcends above the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of heavens to the Eaſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 68. 32, 33.</note> After him the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Amos</hi> in like manner ſaith, <hi>It is the Lord
that hath built his Seat on high.</hi> Of him again
the Prophet <hi>David, God is gone up with a
ſhout,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to this Chapter.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord with the ſound of a Trumpet.</hi>
Likewiſe the Prophet <hi>Aſer</hi> in his ſecond
Chapter ſaith, I <hi>ſaw a man deſcending from the
midſt or heart of the Sea, and he came up to
heaven.</hi> But becauſe we want that Prophecie
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49435:55"/>
I omit to write many other things, which that
Prophet hath concerning this.<note place="margin">The words of the firſt Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus the Spanyard.</note> [And yet wee
have that Prophet, but he knew not then, that
he who is <hi>Aggaeus</hi> in Latine, is the ſame with
<hi>Aſer</hi> in the Arabick tongue.] <hi>Moſes</hi> in his
Song ſaith, <hi>I lift up my hand to Heaven.</hi> So
<hi>Eſay, Awake,</hi> or, <hi>Ariſe, ariſe, O Arm of the
Lord. Hannah,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſings,
<hi>The Lord ſhall give ſtrength unto his King, and
exalt the Horn of his Anointed. David</hi> again,
<hi>The Lord aſcended upon the wings of the winde.</hi>
Theſe authorities have I met with in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſerving to prove the corporeall Aſcenſion
of Chriſt into heaven. Many more there are
to this purpoſe, as thou, O Maſter, very well
knoweſt. Now will I annex ſome examples
out of our Law, to follow theſe Authorities,
being a thing ſo convenient for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our belief in the point of Chriſts bodily
aſcent into Heaven. This in the firſt place
muſt be taken into conſideration, that the true
and glorious God hath aſſumed, and tranſlated
to himſelf out of the earth, many holy men
among our forefathers, as the Law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
will witneſſe; and if we doubt not of the
aſcent of theſe, induced to beleeve it for the
ſanctitie of the men, and for the veritie of
Scripture teſtifying it, why do wee doubt of
the aſcent of this Righteous One, both in his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49435:56"/>
Body and Soul, the witneſſe of Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
this more, than the teſtimony of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
confirms it for the other? And may
not this be one reaſon, becauſe the Prophets
ſet him out ſtrugling and fighting in a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Warre of miſeries than others, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with an harder bondage, and ſoret
ſervice of the World than others? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
this, without any exemplification, thou
knoweſt well enough, that <hi>Methuſalem</hi> and
<hi>Henoch,</hi> thoſe righteous men, and <hi>Elias</hi> the
Prophet, were aſſumed by God in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to Heaven, and tranſlated out of this
World. As for <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is a thing out of the
reach of all queſtion and doubt, that he now
is in Heaven both in body and ſoul, as is ſaid
in <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor quotes Deut. 34. but the laſt words are there onely to be found.</note> 
                  <hi>Go up into the Mount this
night, and he went up into the Mount and died
there, and no man knoweth of his ſepulchre unto
this day.</hi> What doth this ſignifie, that his
Sepulchre is unknowne upon earth, ſeeing he
was a Prophet in greatneſſe and holineſſe, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
others, but that thereby we ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that God hath raiſed him up, and
aſſumed him in bodie and ſoul, as he did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
righteous men, and elevated him to that
place, where they are now? Neither need
we puzzle our Brains, with marvelling how it
can ſtand with reaſon, that groſſe and ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49435:56"/>
bodies ſhould ride, and be born upward
on the light and ſubtill Element of Aire; this
we need not queſtion, if we do but call to
minde, how it pleaſed the Almightie Power
to work the like in the Iſraelites egreſſe out
of Aegypt, where the Water, an Element in

                  </gap>aritie and thinneſſe like unto the Aire, did
bear their heavy bodies without ſinking. And
when the Lord gave a ſign of an accepting
welcome to a Sacrifice, the Fire (though an
Element lighter then the reſt) deſcended
from heaven, and, returning up again to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
carryed with it aloft the bodies of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
Beaſts, and Bullocks offered to God.
As for this Righteous One, <hi>Moſes, Elias,</hi> and
other Prophets propheſied of his elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
From the premiſſes I collect, that we

neither hath God at any time left them, and

                  <hi>God

this turning is to be underſtood of beleeving,

fearfull orbe of miſerie, and ſhould have been

knows no end, as we and our Fathers are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in it: But now ſeeing Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
turnes the wheele another way, that the
hearts of the Fathers ſhall be turned to the
Children, what good is there, O good Maſter,
for us to expect, or what glaſſe of hope can
we look in, to ſee a face of comfort? If wee
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49435:66"/>
ſhall go about to affirm, that theſe muſt bee
other Children, not the Apoſtles, of whom
theſe aforeſaid things are meant, then muſt
they be in Captivitie, as well as we, becauſe
they did not follow the way of that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

taught this way ſhould be followed, herein
attaining to the honour, to be named and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

Maſter, ſeeing our Children attained to faith
in God before us, if our hearts were turned to
the Children, then the hearts of the children
ſhould be turned to us alſo, as the moſt high
God ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſay. 51.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall be one people, and one
heart in the glorious and powerfull God.</hi> For
this is to be confeſſed, that we are not to
underſtand it of any other converſion, then of
turning from infidelitie to the faith, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of that Juſt One, who is the Teacher
of ſalvation to all that beleeve in him. As <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>

Now here, O Maſter, I would have you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49435:66"/>

ſhould be at an end, when this Sacrifice of
Bread and Wine would begin, which ſhould

               <p>THe Sting of Fear is faſtned in me, O

afraid leſt God hath ſealed up us and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,

under a Writ of rejection, and hath
accepted the Sacrifice of the Gentiles, as he

Therefore in Gods account, the ſumme
is caſt up thus, the ſacrifice of the Gentiles
is more clean and pure than ours. Further,
God hath not onely taken from us our pure
Offerings, and depriv'd us of all other Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
but withall, he teaches the Chriſtians to
flie from us, and to avoid us, leſt they ſhould
receive ſome ſoyle and defilement from us.
Thus are we ſcourged with a rod, made of the
Twiggs that grew on our own tree; for when
we had a Sacrifice, which God received as pure
and acceptable, then did we ſhun and deteſt
the Gentiles, as ſome matter of abomination.

God declares what the Gentiles Sacrifice is
by <hi>Moſes, Ye ſhall offer to God a Sacrifice of

<hi>the Prieſt, that had any blemiſh, ſhould not

In divers other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
God hath placed his Command, that they
ſhould offer to him bread, and a Sacrifice of
fine Flowre, and that he will accept it; and
ſuch at this day is the Gentiles Sacrifice, even
bread, made of fine Flowre. Of this Sacrifice
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49435:69"/>
of bread mention is made in the Booke of

Gentiles have a mixture of water with their

we not burdened with any inconveniencie, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures affoord an exemplary action
for it, that a Sacrifice of water was not onely
offered to,<note place="margin">1 King. 18.</note> but accepted of the Lord. Three
mightie men drew water from the Well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Gate of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi>

                  </note> which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

It is not therefore contra-Scripturall that
the Gentiles practiſe, in mixing water in their
Sacrifice to God. We read of <hi>Aaron</hi> ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
to God with Bread and Wine, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
with Water, whence we collect, that a
clean &amp; pure offering, (not ſuch as our fleſh of
fat Bullocks) muſt have a concurrence of theſe
three in it, which doubtleſſe contains ſome
myſticall Kernels in it, though the dimm ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of our intellectuall Opticks is not able to
penetrate and ſpie it out. Our Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
as is ſtoried in the Book of Kings, powred
water upon the Sacrifice, on which God ſent
down fire from Heaven, a ſigne of his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49435:69"/>
of that Sacrifice, which had the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
effuſion on it: yea, and the Angel brought
to <hi>Elias</hi> his food, Bread and Water, when he,
in the ſtrength of that food, which impotent
nature cannot reach unto, travelled fortie dayes
together, to <hi>Horeb</hi> the Mount of God. Fairly,
and fitly has <hi>Salomon</hi> the Prophet, in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs
deſcribed this commixed Sacrifice of
Wine and Water, ſaying, <hi>The moſt High wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
hath made ready her ſacrifice, ſhe hath min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
her Wine, ſhe hath furniſhed her Table, ſhee
hath ſent forth her maidens, ſaying, Who ſo is
ſimple, let him come in hither, and they that want
underſtanding, and they ſhall eat of my Bread, and
drink of my mingled Wine.</hi> What is this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(O Maſter) the wiſdom of the moſt High
hath furniſhed, but the Altar? What is this
bread &amp; mingled wine, but the ſacrifice of bread,
Wine, and water which is offered on the altar?
who are theſe without underſtanding, that the
Maidens of Wiſdom are ſent to call in, but the
Gentiles which know not God, whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
have by Preaching called? Wherein this
is further remarkable, that it is called <hi>My
Bread,</hi> and <hi>my VVine,</hi> which ſtrongly intimates
the acceptableneſſe of that Sacrifice unto
God. It alſo imports thus much, that wiſdom
called not our Fathers to this ſo high, and ſo
ſpirituall a Banquet, who were learned and
wiſe in the Law, and wholly taken up with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49435:70"/>
the Legall Sacrifice. But now we have loſt

               <head>CHAP. XXII. He proves the abjection of the Synagogue; and the
election of the Church, by the word of the
Lord to Rebecca.</head>
               <p>NOw new fear falls upon me, O Maſter,
wherein I tremble at that word, which is
written in the 25 Chapter of the firſt book of
our Law, leſt that be meant of the Synagogue
and the Church, which the Lord God ſpeaks
to <hi>Rebecca</hi> the wife of <hi>Iſaac,</hi>

which was great and glorious, with a rich
dowrie of honour, and the knowledge of God
beſtowed upon it. The younger and laſt-born
people, and leſſe in Gods account, were the
Gentiles, drowned in infidelitie and ignorance.
Yet all this notwithſtanding, O Maſter, if
God have ſlain Iſrael, as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> is
plain in it, then was the totall ſubverſion of
the Synagogue, which was the elder, and it
was brought to ſerve the Gentiles, which were
the younger, that the word might be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
which God ſpake to <hi>Rebecca, One people

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. He proveth the ſame thing by the words of
the Prophet Malachie.</head>
               <p>THoſe words of the Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> ſo
often brought, O Maſter, I cannot ſo ſhift
as to rid my memory of them, &amp; thence ſprings
my fear, that God ſhould ſay to the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
<hi>I have no pleaſure in your ſacrifices, for
from the riſing of the Sunne, &amp;c.</hi> For Water,
Wine, and fine Flour, the Elements of the
Gentiles ſacrifice, are clean things of their
own nature, and need none of our cleanſings,
and purifying potions to prepare them, and
make them ready. But our Synagogue muſt of
neceſſitie have continuall imployments, in
waſhing the Fleſh of Sacrifices, and cleanſing
the Entrals of Beaſts, which are to be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed.
Nay, and there muſt be many purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Altar, and place of the ſacrifice, to
make clean from the fatt and blood of other
ſacrifices, otherwiſe it would breed a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
abhorring to ſee them, and meddle with
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49435:72"/>
them. This of Bread, and Wine, and Water,
is a neat and cleanly ſacrifice, ſubject to none
of theſe indecencies, and loathſome turpitude.
For my part, O Maſter, I muſt confeſſe that
Gods meaning is of this ſacrifice in <hi>Salomons
Proverbs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Better is a morſell of bread with love,
then a ſtalled Oxe with hatred.</hi> This Morſell
of love, O Maſter, is that morſell of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
commended to us, <hi>meeknes,</hi> that is, recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and mutuall forgiving of injuries, one to
pardon another; &amp; the fat Ox with hatred, is our
practiſe of eye for eye, &amp; ſecret ſlaying of our
enemies. And from theſe premiſes I draw this
concluſion, that the Churches bread is better
than the Synagogues Oxe, the one being a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of love, the other of hatred, of which
God ſaith, <hi>Better is a morſell, &amp;c.</hi> Another
way God fitly likens the Church to a loving
Hinde,<note place="margin">Pro. 5. 19.</note> by the mouth of <hi>Salomon, Let her be as
the loving Hinde, and pleaſant Roe, let her breaſts
ſatisfie</hi> (or inebriate) <hi>thee at all times, and bee
thou raviſht alwayes with her love.</hi> The Church
is this Hinde ſo beloved of God, of whom it
is written, ſhe is the moſt dearly beloved
Hinde, and hath no equall in nobilitie and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
He adds, O Maſter, <hi>Let her breaſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
thee at all times, and be thou raviſht al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
with her love.</hi> In which words is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a plain ſignificancie of the laſtingneſſe of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49435:73"/>
the Churches ſacrifice for all times, and that
it ſhall abide for ever. Here alſo God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
the Church to a mother, giving ſuck to
Children; and in this that he ſaith, Let her
Breaſts at all times ſatisfie thee, and make thee
drunken, he clearly denotes the matter of the
Sacrament, in one of the Elements, which is
Wine, though in a ſpirituall way. And by
Breaſts he notes the reſt of the ſubſtance of
the Sacrament, that it contains pleaſant nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment,
and is a ſufficient Sacrament, (as the
Mothers Breaſts are ſufficient for the Childe)
which ſacrifice the Church at this preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes,
and is raviſht with it. As for us, our
Synagogue has remained a widow this thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years, quite deprived of her ſacrifice. This
dear reſpect which God bears to the Church,
comes from Chriſt the Lord; His are the
breaſts, from whence run thoſe ſtreamy fluents
of Wine, and from thence flows everlaſting
joy. Here is not a word or title of giving
fleſh, or fat, or blood, the ingredients of our
laborious ahd toilſome ſacrifice. The Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
as a miſerable widow, had another huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
even God himſelf; but now ſhe hath loſt
both her holy houſe, and her holy husband.
The Church on the other ſide, like a ſtraying
Hinde, ranged in the Deſart, and had no huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
yet God has found her, and is become
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49435:73"/>
in ſtead of an husband to her. As the ſtrong

For this is to be applyed to the Gentiles in

darkneſſe and ignorance of God, before the

they were Pagans, and Idolatrous people;
and none of thoſe Nations that have

all the Saracens ſpeak-it for a truth, That
Chriſt, or the Meſſias, had power from God
to work Miracles, to heale every diſeaſe, and
infirmitie, to caſt out Devils, raiſe the dead,
to know the ſecrets of all hearts; yea, they
beleeve all thoſe Miracles to be done by him,
which the Goſpell records of him. This the
Alcoran in the forenamed Chapter expreſſely
teſtifies, That the Meſſias knew, &amp; doth know all
things, yea the very ſectets of hearts. The words
of <hi>Mahomet</hi> are juſt to this purpoſe, who ſaith,
<hi>Eiſe</hi> (that is Jeſus) knew every Book, and all
wiſedome, and the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he
knew what men did eate and drink in their
houſes, and what they laid up in their Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Beſides, they ſay of Chriſt, or the Meſſias,
that whiles he was in the world he deſpiſed
riches, and abandoned all carnall delights, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49435:80"/>
had he any Concubines, which are the
occaſions of ſinne, and a cauſe of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Withall their Alcoran has adopted and
taken into it that ſpeech of the Goſpell, <hi>The
Foxes have holes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 9.</note> 
                  <hi>and the birds of the aire

they carry no authoritie for their ſakes who
ſay them, being Saracens, yet are they conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
(as may appear by our former diſcourſe)
to thoſe things the Prophets foretold, of the
firſt Comming of the Meſſias. They ſay in
their Alcoran, That Eiſe, that is Jeſus, is the
Word of God: and this to be called the
Word of God, is accounted the proper name of
Jeſus Chriſt among the Saracens: in ſo much as
no other man is thus named, but Jeſus onely,
whom in the Arabick tongue they call Eiſe.
This we further finde in their Alcoran, <hi>God
ſaid to Eiſe, I am thy ſufficiency, I will lift
thee up unto my ſelf, and I will purifie thee from
the unbeleevers.</hi> Conſider now, O Maſter, how
the Jewiſh Nation are redacted and brought

at all, but the Chriſtians, whom we hate above
all Nations, they increaſe above all others,
and all our hatred of them is in vaine. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
teſtimony of many witneſſes ſtand up
againſt us: The Chriſtians witneſſe againſt
us, ſo do the Saracens alſo: the Alcoran, and
the Goſpell of Chriſt, which we will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.
Which Alcoran, in my judgement, has
no validitie or ſtrength in it, ſeeing it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
manifeſt contradictions, as thou well
knoweſt, and as it clearly is evident, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
of it were very ignoramuſſes in the
matter both of the old and new Teſtament. But
letting that paſſe, what ſhall wee ſay to the
Goſpell of the Chriſtians, how ſhall we eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
that, laying this down as a preſuppoſed
truth, that Chriſt, or the Meſſias is already
come? The beliefe of this principle contains
nothing in it, that it is contrary to Prophets,
or to our Law; yea, of it we may affirme, that
it is the Lamp, that gives light to all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
manifeſting them, and fulfilling the
promiſes contained in the Law, if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
thoſe promiſes aright to be meant of

of Rabbi Samuel the Iſraelite, born in a Citie
of the Kingdome of Marocco.</head>
               <p>IN the firſt Chapter, and in many other, he
mentions the continuance of their Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie,
from the vaſtation of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to
be in length a thouſand years, and upwards, ſo
that it ſeems the Booke being Tranſlated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the year 1239,<note place="margin">Alſtedius placeth him about the year 1090 in Chronol. Theol. So has the Note be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Book in Micropreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beutico.</note> had been hid and kept
ſecret by the Jews, from comming into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
light ſome 230 years, and above. It may
appear, more then by conjecture, that it was
firſt writ about the thouſand years after the
entrance into their Captivitie, and the Jews
ſeeing it like a lightſome houſe, and full of
Candles, clearly ſhewing Chriſt to be the
Meſſias, and that he was already come, and by
them had been Crucified, they fearing if it
came into open view, it might pluck away
the Jewiſh vail of oppoſition to Chriſt, from
many hearts, as plainly demonſtrating their
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49435:82"/>
ſinne, and the hidden veritie of Chriſt the
Saviour, they put this Candle or Torch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Buſhell, and kept it cloſe many years,
till this Tranſlator lighting upon it, did publiſh
and ſet it on a Candleſtick, that it might give
light to the whole houſe, both of Jews and
Gentiles, in the Roman language, which is
become almoſt oecumenicall, underſtood of
all ſorts. For they thought of this Book, as
their wicked forefathers thought of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
It were good to put him to death, becauſe
by reaſon of him</hi> (being raiſed from the dead
by Chriſt) <hi>many of the Iewes would go away from
them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 12. 10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and beleeve on Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hebrew Doctors inquire earneſtly
what this ſinne ſhould be, few of them have
ſo much fleſh and ſoftneſſe in their heart, as to
yeeld with our <hi>Samuel,</hi> that it was the ſinne
of ſlaying Chriſt, for they invent vaine <hi>effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia's,</hi>
and wayes of avoidance of the thought
of this ſinne. R. <hi>Salomon</hi> runnes back to the
Wilderneſſe, and ſayes, The molten Calfe is
ſtill puniſht, God is yet ſcourging them for
that Idolatry. Hereupon one teaches the Jews,
in every miſery of theirs, to think of it. <hi>No pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
lights on thee O Iſrael, in which there is
not put an Ounce of the molten Calf.</hi> But this ſin
God had pardoned long before Chriſts time.
Others of them do name ſome great ſinnes of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49435:82"/>
ſome Particular men, but looke not at the
great ſinne of the whole Nation. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it to be a ſecret and hidden ſin, which
is not known, that brings all theſe knowne
puniſhments upon them at this day.</p>

the cauſe why Iſrael was deſtroyed by the ſword.</hi>
But <hi>Ficinus</hi> is miſtaken, for he meanes not
honeſtly there, but as a Jew, hating Chriſt
and Chriſtians; his meaning is, That Chriſt
was the Ring-Leader to rebellions and raiſing
of ſeditions, ſtirring up the people to ſhake
off the Romane yoke and Empire, which
brought the Romanes to deſtroy them with

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>IN the ſecond Chapter the Jew reaſons
the caſe, inquiring why they obſerve ſome
Legalities, as Circumciſion, Sabbath, and
others, but omit Sacrificing, Altars, Unction
and Incenſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> He happily gueſſes, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
theſe Legall Rites now, as received not
from God, but from their Fathers that were
under Gods wrath. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 2. That God has given
them no precept now to uſe them; for indeed
the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the place of their worſhip, the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of their Kingdome and Prieſthood, is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
enough to tell them God hath aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
their Legall obſervances, and delights no
more in them, nor in that kinde of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
By this he rightly acknowledges all
their Jewiſh ſervice is againſt the heart of
God, and his command, and is will worſhip; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
not Gods will-worſhip, but mans will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49435:88"/>
3. He takes away a reaſon that might
be given by ſome, why they uſed not Altars,
and Incenſe, becauſe they were ſtrangers, and
under the Government of Kingdomes, and
States, that would not ſuffer them to
have that libertie. But this he anſwers to,
that it is no good reaſon; for Kings
and States that ſuffer them to have Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
and meetings, and communion in a
Jewiſh manner, would permit them this alſo
as well as the former: they who grant a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thing, in all likelihood will not deny them
a leſſer matter. So that the concluſion he
would make, is this, <hi>God in his anger hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft
us of King, Prieſt, Temple, Altars, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
the great things of our Law, therefore he
would have us leave all other our Iewiſh Rites
alſo, becauſe it is manifeſt for our ſinnes he would
have us deprived of all, and beſides turn us to
Chriſt, who hath put an end to all Iudaicall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances.</hi>
Many of the Jews acknowledge,
that Sacrifices and Ceremonies were not to be
perpetuall, but to continue for a time onely,
and by the Meſſias to be abrogated. In their
Talmud they have this to that purpoſe,<note place="margin">Hieron. de S. fide in Hebraeom. l. 1. c. 9. Ex Bereſcit R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>In
the world to come all ſacrifices ſhall be annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
except the ſacrifice of Confeſsion, i. e. of praiſe.</hi>
So the Aegyptian <hi>Moſes</hi> writes, that in the
time of the Meſſias all things ſhall be licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49435:88"/>
which were prohibited: According to
that ſaying, <hi>The Lord looſeth them that are bound
up,</hi> and there cannot be a greater proof than
this, that even <hi>mulier menſtruata</hi> ſhall be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
by God at that time. In the Talmud,
ſpeaking of unclean things, as the Sow, it is
queſtioned, <hi>Why is a Sow called Hazer?</hi> It is
anſwered, <hi>Becauſe God will return it once to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
that is, give them libertie to eat of it;
<hi>Hazire</hi> ſignifying <hi>reverſion</hi> or <hi>returning.</hi>
Wherefore, by the judgement of divers
of their Doctors, they doe at this day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully
in counting any meats unclean by
the old Rule of their Law, ſeeing the Meſſias
was beleeved ſhould ſet theſe very Creatures
at libertie, that they ſhould not be bound up
from free uſe by any Bond of Ceremoniall
uncleanneſſe, as they were heretofore. When
the Vail of the Temple was rent, all Legall
Ceremonies were to be rent alſo.</p>
               <p>The Jews acknowledge they have nothing
to do now with Sacrifices,<note place="margin">The 4. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</note> as their Anceſtors
had, becauſe they are ſcattered from their own
land, and their Temple is deſtroyed, which
was the place deſtined for Sacrifices to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
up to God, yet inſtead of Sacrifices they
will do ſomething, they redeem their Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with words, and comfort themſelves with
this, as if God did accept it as well as any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49435:89"/>
that they read over Gods precepts in
the Law about the kindes and manner of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing,
and ſo they make uſe of, or rather
abuſe thoſe words of the Prophet, <hi>We will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
up to God the calves of our lips;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. Wofgang.</note> Which
were a good Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Capito in Hoſ. 3.</note> if they were good lips,
confeſſing Chriſt, and guided by holy hearts,
onely relying, and truſting in the all-meriting
Sacrifice of Chriſts blood. Their R. <hi>Simeon</hi>
ſaith, they deſpiſed three things, and caſt them
off in that ſpeech,<note place="margin">2 Sa. 20. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>We have no part in David,
nor have we inheritance in the ſonne of Ieſſe:</hi>
1. The Kingdome of Heaven. 2. The houſe
of <hi>David.</hi> 3. The Temple of the Lord. But
the later Jews have caſt off theſe three things
farre more deſpitefully, in caſting off Chriſt;
And having thrown off God and his Temple,
why may he not throw away them and their
ſacrifices?—The concluſion is againſt the
Jews, that they do againſt ground and reaſon
retain ſome part of their Jewiſh ſervice, and
let other parts be loſt; as that of Altars, oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and ſacrifice. If one be good, all is good,
becauſe all is of the ſame root. If God have
aboliſhed ſome, he would have them aboliſh
all; and he grants the Jews are non-pluſt, and
have nothing to ſay in this argument, when it
is urged by the Chriſtians.</p>

the Arabicke Bible, and therefore he would

he may prove himſelf a faithfull interpretour.</p>
               <p>It is a pretie note of R. <hi>Samuel,</hi> that the
firſt Captivitie is called but a <hi>Tranſmigration,</hi>
or <hi>a paſsing over into another Land;</hi> which
ſeems to be a word of hope, that promiſed them
they ſhould come back again. But this laſt is
named by a hopeleſſe name, <hi>a deſolation,</hi> to let

<hi>tranſmigration</hi> or <hi>removing,</hi> may bee ſeene

               <p>A twofold miſery he findes to purſue this
Captivitie more than the other.</p>
               <p>1. In the other they had Prophets in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
to comfort them, <hi>Ezekiel, Haggai, Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie;</hi>

               <p>IN theſe Chapters he proves that Chriſt
ſhall have a double comming; Firſt, in
baſenes and humility; then ſecondly, in Majeſty
and glory. Sometimes onely he teaches Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſpeak more then is intended; as in that

twice, he will have it to mean Chriſts double
Comming: And that of <hi>David, For he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,

the truth is clearer, then that he need theſe

               <p>That Chriſts ſecond comming ſhall be to

he rightly and Orthodoxly holds and

are alſo to be blamed for this, that whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
in Scripture they meet with a terrible
day of the Lord, they preſently apply it to
the day of Judgement: yet he ſees little that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49435:94"/>
ſees not this to be meant of Chriſts firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
whoſe preaching, and pure doctrine of
Goſpell, was terrible to prophane ones, and
Hypocrites, Scribes and Phariſees. Beſides,
it ſignifies the miſery, ſorrow and captivitie,
which ſhould befall the Jews in, and after the
comming of Chriſt, not by Chriſts fault, but
by their impietie and infidelitie, rejecting
Chriſt: ſo as his comming proves terrible to
them.</p>
               <p>In the end of the 11 chapter, he hath two
excellent things concerning Chriſt, wherein
he ſpeaks Chriſtianiſme moſt Chriſtianly, and
bruſhes himſelf clean of the leaſt Jewiſh moat.</p>
               <p>1. He concludes it from Scripture, that
Chriſt, and Chriſt alone, is the True and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
One: All men, beſt of men, were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
but Chriſt was ſinnleſſe. And in this he
preferrs him before <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all other holy
Ones, which no Jew will do, juſt as Chriſt is
preferred in <hi>Hebr. 3.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. He makes diſobedience and infidelitie
in Chriſt, the damning ſin. This he proves as
the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> proves it: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
his words and thoſe of <hi>Hebr. 10. 28, 29.</hi>
and you ſhall ſee ſuch an agreement, as if he
had propoſed thoſe words, and that Text to be
followed, <hi>He that deſpiſed Moſes Law, dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49435:95"/>
it like to that: <hi>If they were worthy of death who
beleeved not Moſes, who was two degrees behinde
Chriſt, he was but a temporary Saviour, and hee
was a ſinner; Of how much ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſuppoſe ye ſhall he be thought worthy, &amp;c.
how much more</hi> (ſaith our <hi>Samuel) are they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of this Iudicatorie of fire, who beleeve not, nay,
who blaſpheme this Chriſt, who is a Righteous One,
and who ſaves eternally.</hi> O that this lightſom beam
of truth had pierced the hearts and breaſts of
all the dark-ſpirited Jews! O that all of them
ſaw with <hi>Samuels</hi> eyes! The Lord perſwade

and Chriſtian Preachers, who common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do apply this place (by a vulgar and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

his Fathers wrath for us?</hi> If it had been meant

that ſuffer treading and preſſing, not he that
treads. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 2. Again, he is ſaid to be glorious in
his apparell, when he comes from treading the
Wine-Preſſe. Now Chriſt in his Paſſion was
either quite naked, as many think; or elſe but
in one part very ſlenderly covered. Now if
his Body, or that mean Cloth were ſprinkled
with his own Blood, this was no very glorious
apparell, for one to appear thus miſerably.
But for Chriſt in his Aſcenſion to appear,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49435:96"/>
and in his Triumph to ſhew himſelfe, with
garments all ſtained with the Blood of his
Enemies, this is glorious raiment indeed. The
triumph of the righteous is,<note place="margin">Pſal. 58. 10</note> they ſhall waſh

his adverſaries. <hi>Mighty to ſave,</hi> that is, <hi>to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

Garments like him that treadeth the Wine-Fatt;

them. <hi>I will tread them in mine anger, and
trample them in my fury.</hi> If it were of Chriſts

I will now take vengeance of mine enemies.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
4. This phraſe of treading as in a Winepreſſe,
is uſed in Scripture elſwhere, to ſhew what
they ſuffer that are trodden, as <hi>Lament. 1. 15.</hi>
Now Chriſt ſaith, He trod, and was not trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.

               <p>THe corporall Aſcenſion of Chriſt he
goes about to prove by thoſe Scriptures,
that ſpeaks of the exaltation and elevation of
God, which he ſaith muſt properly be meant
of Chriſt, according to his humane nature,
becauſe the meer Deitie is ſubject to none of
theſe Sites or Poſtures. That of Pſalm 68
is applyed to the Aſcenſion of Chriſt by S.
<hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> ſo that R. <hi>Samuel</hi> the Jew is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

to follow S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle of the
Gentiles,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> in beleeving and aſſerting the ſame
truth.</p>
               <p>He quotes ſomething out of the Prophet
<hi>Aſer</hi> in his ſecond Chapter,<note place="margin">The 12. Digreſſion</note> but he forbears
the proſecution of it upon this reaſon, becauſe
that Propheſie is loſt, and is not to be found.
The Tranſlatour he brings his judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Prophet <hi>Aſer,</hi> and reproves the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of R. <hi>Samuel,</hi> that he ſhould think the
Prophet <hi>Aſer</hi> to be loſt, when he is not. And
his reaſon is, that the Prophet <hi>Aſer</hi> and <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai</hi>
are all one, onely <hi>Haggai</hi> is the Hebrew
Name, and <hi>Aſer</hi> the Arabicke name of the
ſame Prophet, which R. <hi>Samuel</hi> did not know,
or at leaſt did not call to minde when he writ
ſo. Now it were good to unpire the matter
betwixt <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the Spanyard, and <hi>Samuel</hi>
the Jew, and upon looking into it, the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator
will be found in ſome fault. Suppoſe
there be ſome agreement betwixt <hi>Haggai</hi> and
<hi>Aſer,</hi> in their ſignification. <hi>Haggai</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one that ſolemnizes and keeps a holy, and
joyfull day of ſolemnities, that rejoyces feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vally:
and <hi>Aſer</hi> comming of a Verbe that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
to make bleſſed and happy, which may
accord in this, that the dayes of re-edifying
the Temple, and Jeruſalem, in which times
<hi>Haggai</hi> prophecied, were holy, feſtivall and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49435:100"/>
bleſſed dayes. Though there be ſome ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
muſt there be Identitie? How doth <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus</hi>
know that <hi>Aſer</hi> and <hi>Haggai</hi> in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick
Tongue are the ſame Prophet? This
may be diſproved two wayes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Becauſe
R. <hi>Samuel</hi> writ in Arabick, lived among the
Arabians, and being both a Jewiſh and an Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick
Doctor, he was likely to know as well as
<hi>Alphonſus</hi> the names of Prophets in the Old
Teſtament, both in Hebrew and Arabick. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. If
<hi>Aſer</hi> and <hi>Haggai</hi> be all one, then let the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyard
ſhew us this that he quotes in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
of <hi>Haggai,</hi> of a man aſcending from

He muſt coyn a new Prophecie of <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai,</hi>

ſpeake of this obſcure Prophet <hi>Aſer,</hi> which
cannot be found what he was, yet we may well
conclude for the Authour againſt the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatour,
that theſe words are not to be found

               </p>
               <p>Since theſe Notes I have found ſomething

the thing, but the compariſon accompanying
and illuſtrating the appearance of the man. I
think (pardoning the errour of the Authors
and Tranſlators Quotation, both of the Name,
and the Book, and Chapter) I am the <hi>Oedipus</hi>
of this Riddle. And it may well be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was of this place, for in this book he doth
(beſides this) make uſe of the Apocrypha, as
Chap. 19. he quotes a place out of Jeſus the
ſonne of Syrach, and in chap. 20. he has out
of the ſame Book. Beſides, he is ſubject to
ſome miſtakes, for in that 20 chapter he cals
it <hi>Salomons</hi> writing, when it is the Sonn of
<hi>Syrachs:</hi> and in this 13 chapter he quotes a
place in <hi>Eſay,</hi> when it is in <hi>Ieremie,</hi>—<hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando

               </p>
               <p>Among thoſe were aſſumed into heaven, he
names <hi>Methuſalem,</hi> and takes it for a thing
granted and known among the Jews. But we
muſt beleeve <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſaith, that <hi>Methuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
when he had lived nine hundred ſixty nine

which he had newly ſaid of <hi>Enoch</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">Auguſt. de Civ. D. lib. 15. cap. 11.</note>
The Greeks errour is, that he lived 14
years after the floud, and was with <hi>Noah</hi> in
the Ark, which errour comes out of the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagints
falſe computation. And ſome of the
Jews (it ſeems) are in this errour, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his Father was taken into heaven in his

they that compute and reckon according to
the Hebrew numbring of the years, do agree,
that <hi>Methuſalem</hi> dyed that very year the flood
came. Others think he dyed ſix years before
the floud. He concludes the Chapter with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
the wonderfull birth of Chriſt, born of
a Virgin, without a man, to be a very truth, and

               <p>IN this Chapter, that God hath let the
Jews fall from him by a flatt Apoſtaſie,
is the thing he would leave as a true conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in the concluſion of his Book, drawn
from all the pre-cited Authorities, for them
deeply to weigh and conſider. Two things
I ſpecially minde in his Confeſſion, which
are meer Jewiſh vanities. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 1. The firſt, that
they very earneſtly, though very idlely, do
look for another Meſſias then Jeſus Chriſt,
but all their expectations miſcarry, proving
abortive and uncomfortable. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 2. The ſecond
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49435:107"/>
is, that the Jews in their empty imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
among themſelves in their Synagogues,
do whiſper this as a truth, which is a clear
lie, <hi>That their Meſſias was born in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian
Captivity, though he do not yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
himſelf to Iſrael.</hi> For the firſt of theſe,
how vainly they look after other Saviours, I
ſhall prove by an Hiſtoricall exemplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
annexed to that ſpeech of our Saviours
to the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 46.</note> to verifie it, <hi>I am come in my
Fathers Name, and ye receive me not, if another
ſhall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</hi>
Our <hi>Samuel</hi> could give us in a large Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
how oft the <hi>Jews</hi> have been gulled
with <hi>Pſeudo-Meſſiahs,</hi> and <hi>falſe-Chriſts,</hi> that
came in their own name; and the poor <hi>Jews</hi>
have madly doted on them, as the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">17. Digreſ.</note> I ſhall endeavor to give ſome
account of the notableſt deluſions that that
people has groaned under in this kind. There
were of theſe falſe-Chriſts, ſeducing many,
ſome before the deſtuction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and
ſome after, which for methods and orders
ſake, we will in that manner reckon up.</p>

many, took many alive, and among the

Jews write ſomewhat confuſedly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe <hi>Barcochabs,</hi> and for moſt part men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
little of the firſt, but attribute all to
this laſt; yet others finde out there were
two of them, and that out of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
Very much is ſaid of this laſt,
whoſe doings ſwallow up the memory of
the firſt. The Jews that remained after <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
was deſtroyed, made a Citie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49435:109"/>
                  <hi>Bitter,</hi> the Metropolis and chief ſeat of
the Kingdom, and took this falſe Chriſt for
their King. Nay, <hi>R. Akiba,</hi> they write, was
blinded the ſecond time, and proclaimed
this <hi>Barcochab</hi> the Meſſias alſo. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Adrian</hi> beſieged them in the Citie
<hi>Bitter</hi> three years and an half, at length he
took it, and the head of <hi>Barcozbi</hi> was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
off: in which War 45000 Jews were
ſlaughtered; but make room for the Jew,
his mouth runns over, and he cannot ſpeak a
lie, but it muſt be of the firſt magnitude,
and exceed all lies, for they write, that the
Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> ſlew in <hi>Bitter</hi> four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
times ten thouſand, till the blood of
the ſlain, like a river, rolled great ſtones in
the ſtream of it, and carryed them into the
Sea, which was four miles diſtant from the
Citie. Nay, that all lyars may take a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> (they ſay) had
a Vineyard 18 miles in length, and 18 in
breadth, and yet he hedged it about with
the bodies of them that were ſlain in <hi>Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
Many other Hyperboles, none of the
leaſt, they have about this <hi>Barcozbi,</hi> which
I omit. In the Talmud they write, that
<hi>Barcozbi</hi> ſaid to the Rabbins,<note place="margin">In Gemara Sanhedrim. cap. 11. ſect. 15. ex verſ. Io. Coch.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</hi>
The wiſe Maſters of the Jews ſaid to
him again, <hi>It is written of the Meſſias, [quod
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49435:110"/>
odorans erit &amp; judicans] Hee ſhall ſmell and
judge,</hi>

ſmelling who is innocent, and who is guiltie;
Let us ſee therefore whether thou beeſt able to
judge by ſmelling; and when they ſaw his ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
was without this judgement, they ſlew him.</hi>
This will ſcarce agree with ſo great a
ſlaughter of <hi>Barcozbi,</hi> and all his people, by
<hi>Adrians</hi> Forces. But certain it is, many
Jews were now ſacrificed to the Romans
furie by their ſword, that the Lord might
thorowly execute his wrath upon them.
This falſe Chriſt, they ſay, his reign and
rule was ſome thirty years and a half, and
ſome make it foretold in thoſe words of
<hi>Daniel,</hi>

ſtop their mouthes, that they had not a word

Reaſons.</p>

                  <hi>Diego Payva Andradius,</hi> the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender

                  <note place="margin">Trident. lib. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>that inhabit the inner Africa, that
were induced by the reading of the fifty third
Chapter of Eſay onely, to leave houſe, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
friends, fair Eſtates, Parents, and with
inflamed deſires of ſoul to conſecrate themſelves
to Chriſt.</hi> I asked (ſaith he) ſome of theſe
<hi>Iews,</hi> that came out of <hi>Africa</hi> into <hi>Portugall,</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:49435:123"/>
to be entred among Chriſtians by Baptiſm,
what it was in that 53 of <hi>Eſay,</hi> that did ſo
much trouble them, that they could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thoſe things to be true concerning <hi>Ieſus
Chriſt</hi> the Sonne of God, which are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by us, to which they returned me this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
alwayes that which we tranſlate &amp; read
<hi>percuſſum à Deo, ſmitten of God,</hi> they uſe to
interpret, <hi>percuſſus Deus ipſe &amp; humiliatus,
God himſelf was ſmitten and humbled.</hi> By
which words they aſſure themſelves, that
whole Chapter is to be underſtood not of
of ſome man, but of God himſelfe made
man, that he might blot out our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>I conclude this with that of <hi>A Lapide</hi> the
Jeſuite,<note place="margin">Cor. à lap. in Iſai. cap. 53.</note> that which (ſaith he) is tranſlated by
the Syrians <hi>percuſſum Dei,</hi> or <hi>à Deo, ſmitten
of God,</hi> out of the Hebrew may be turned
thus, <hi>percuſſum Deum &amp; humiliatum, God
ſmitten and humbled, Mucke elohim umeunne.</hi>
This very ſame thing (ſaith he) did a famous
<hi>Jew</hi> tell me himſelf at <hi>Rome.</hi> We ſee when <hi>God</hi>
opens Jews eyes, they ſtand not ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Grammer, but here neglect that, to pitch
upon the ſubſtantiall truth, and aske not
leave at the Rules of Art, when God is
bringing them to the Rule of Faith.</p>
