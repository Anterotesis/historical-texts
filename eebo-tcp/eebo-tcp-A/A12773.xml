            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>THe shepheards boy (best knowne by that name)</l>
            <l>That after <hi>Tityrus</hi> first sung his lay,</l>
            <l>Laies of sweet loue, without rebuke or blame,</l>
            <l>Sate (as his custome was) vpon a day,</l>
            <l>Charming his oaten pipe vnto his peres,</l>
            <l>The shepheard swaines that did about him play:</l>
            <l>Who all the while with greedie listfull eares,</l>
            <l>Did stand astonisht at his curious skill,</l>
            <l>Like hartlesse deare, dismayd with thunders sound.</l>
            <l>At last when as he piped had his fill,</l>
            <l>He rested him: and sitting then around,</l>
            <l>One of those groomes (a iolly groome was he,</l>
            <l>As euer piped on an oaten reed,</l>
            <l>And lou'd this shepheard dearest in degree,</l>
            <l>Hight <hi>Hobbinol</hi>) gan thus to him areed.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Colin</hi> my liefe, my life, how great a losse</l>
            <l>Had all the shepheards nation by thy lacke?</l>
            <l>And I poore swaine of many greatest crosse:</l>
            <l>That sith thy <hi>Muse</hi> first since thy turning backe</l>
            <l>Was heard to sound as she was wont on hye,</l>
            <l>Hast made vs all so blessed and so blythe.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:11639:4"/>Whilest thou wast hence, all dead in dole did lie:</l>
            <l>The woods were heard to waile full many a sythe,</l>
            <l>And all their birds with silence to complaine:</l>
            <l>The fields with faded flowers did seem to mourne,</l>
            <l>And all their flocks from feeding to refraine:</l>
            <l>The running waters wept for thy returne,</l>
            <l>And all their fish with languour did lament:</l>
            <l>But now both woods and fields, and floods reviue,</l>
            <l>Sith thou art come, their cause of meriment,</l>
            <l>That vs late dead, hast made againe aliue:</l>
            <l>But were it not too painfull to repeat</l>
            <l>The passed fortunes, which to thee befell</l>
            <l>In thy late voyage, we thee would entreat,</l>
            <l>Now at thy leisure them to vs to tell.</l>
            <l>To whom the shepheard gently answered thus,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hobbin</hi> thou temptest me to that I couet:</l>
            <l>For of good passed newly to discus,</l>
            <l>By dubble vsurie doth twise renew it.</l>
            <l>And since I saw that Angels blessed eie,</l>
            <l>Her worlds bright sun, her heauens fairest light,</l>
            <l>My mind full of my thoughts satietie,</l>
            <l>Doth feed on sweet contentment of that sight:</l>
            <l>Since that same day in nought I take delight.</l>
            <l>Ne feeling haue in any earthly pleasure,</l>
            <l>But in remembrance of that glorious bright,</l>
            <l>My lifes sole blisse, my hearts eternall threasure.</l>
            <l>Wake then my pipe, my sleepie <hi>Muse</hi> awake,</l>
            <l>Till I haue told her praises lasting long:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hobbin</hi> desires, thou maist it not forsake,</l>
            <l>Harke then ye iolly shepheards to my song.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:11639:4"/>With that they all gan throng about him neare,</l>
            <l>With hungrie eares to heare his harmonie:</l>
            <l>The whiles their flocks deuoyd of dangers feare,</l>
            <l>Did round about them feed at libertie.</l>
            <l>One day (quoth he) I sat, (as was my trade)</l>
            <l>Vnder the foote of <hi>Mole</hi> that mountaine hore,</l>
            <l>Keeping my sheepe amongst the cooly shade,</l>
            <l>Of the greene alders by the <hi>Mullaes</hi> shore:</l>
            <l>There a straunge shepheard chaunst to find me out,</l>
            <l>Whether allured with my pipes delight,</l>
            <l>Whose pleasing sound yshrilled far about,</l>
            <l>Or thither led by chaunce, I know not right:</l>
            <l>VVhom when I asked from what place he came,</l>
            <l>And how he hight, himselfe he did ycleepe,</l>
            <l>The shepheard of the Ocean by name,</l>
            <l>And said he came far from the main-sea deepe.</l>
            <l>He sitting me beside in that same shade,</l>
            <l>Prouoked me to plaie some pleasant fit,</l>
            <l>And when he heard the musicke which I made,</l>
            <l>He found himselfe full greatly pleasd at it:</l>
            <l>Yet aemuling my pipe, he tooke in hond</l>
            <l>My pipe before that aemuled of many,</l>
            <l>And plaid theron; (for well that skill he cond)</l>
            <l>Himselfe as skilfull in that art as any.</l>
            <l>He pip'd, I sung; and when he sung, I piped,</l>
            <l>By chaunge of turnes, each making other mery,</l>
            <l>Neither enuying other, nor enuied,</l>
            <l>So piped we, vntill we both were weary.</l>
            <l>There interrupting him, a bonie swaine,</l>
            <l>That <hi>Cuddy</hi> hight, him thus atweene bespake:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:11639:5"/>And should it not thy readie course restraine,</l>
            <l>I would request thee <hi>Colin,</hi> for my sake,</l>
            <l>To tell what thou didst sing, when he did plaie.</l>
            <l>For well I weene it worth recounting was,</l>
            <l>VVhether it were some hymne, or morall laie,</l>
            <l>Or carol made to praise thy loued lasse.</l>
            <l>Nor of my loue, nor of my losse (quoth he)</l>
            <l>I then did sing, as then occasion fell:</l>
            <l>For loue had me forlorne, forlorne of me,</l>
            <l>That made me in that desart chose to dwell.</l>
            <l>But of my riuer <hi>Bregogs</hi> loue I soong,</l>
            <l>VVhich to the shiny <hi>Mulla</hi> he did beare,</l>
            <l>And yet doth beare, and euer will, so long</l>
            <l>As water doth within his bancks appeare.</l>
            <l>Of fellowship (said then that bony Boy)</l>
            <l>Record to vs that louely lay againe:</l>

            <l>Such loftie flight, base shepheard seemeth not,</l>

            <l>I feele my selfe like one yrapt in spright.</l>
            <l>For when I thinke of her, as oft I ought,</l>
            <l>Then want I words to speake it fitly forth:</l>

            <l>Yet will I thinke of her, yet will I speake,</l>

            <l>Much was the whole assembly of those heards,</l>
            <l>Moov'd at his speech, so feelingly he spake:</l>

            <l>Till <hi>Thestylis</hi> at last their silence brake,</l>

            <l>With <hi>Cynthia</hi> and all her noble crew:</l>
            <l>Why didst thou euer leaue that happie place,</l>
            <l>In which such wealth might vnto thee accrew?</l>
            <l>And back returnedst to this barrein soyle,</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:11639:14"/>Where cold and care and penury do dwell:</l>

            <l>Happie indeed (said <hi>Colin</hi>) I him hold,</l>

            <l>Some part of those enormities did see,</l>
            <l>The which in Court continually hooued,</l>
            <l>And followd those which happie seemd to bee.</l>
            <l>Therefore I silly man, whose former dayes</l>

            <l>Then hauing learnd repentance late, to mourne</l>
            <l>Emongst those wretches which I there descryde.</l>
            <l>Shepheard (said <hi>Thestylis</hi>) it seemes of spight</l>
            <l>Thou speakest thus gainst their felicitie,</l>

            <l>Of which, among you many yet remaine,</l>

            <l>For with lewd speeches and licentious deeds,</l>

            <l>And vse his ydle name to other needs,</l>
            <l>But as a complement for courting vaine.</l>
            <l>So him they do not serue as they professe,</l>
            <l>But make him serue to them for sordid vses,</l>

            <l>Shepheard it seemes that some celestiall rage</l>
            <l>Of loue (quoth <hi>Cuddy</hi>) is breath'd into thy brest,</l>

            <l>And voydnesse to seeke full satietie.</l>
            <l>So being former foes, they wexed friends,</l>
            <l>And gan by litle learne to loue each other:</l>
            <l>So being knit, they brought forth other kynds</l>
            <l>Out of the fruitfull wombe of their great mother.</l>
            <l>Then first gan heauen out of darknesse dread</l>

            <l>Whence he them heares, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he list shew grace,</l>
            <l>Does graunt them grace that otherwise would die.</l>
            <l>So loue is Lord of all the world by right,</l>
            <l>And rules their creatures by his powrfull saw:</l>
            <l>All being made the vassalls of his might,</l>
            <l>Through secret sence which therto doth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> draw.</l>
            <l>Thus ought all louers of their lord to deeme:</l>
            <l>And with chaste heart to honor him alway:</l>
            <l>But who so else doth otherwise esteeme,</l>
            <l>Are outlawes, and his lore do disobay.</l>
            <l>For their desire is base, and doth not merit,</l>
            <l>The name of loue, but of disloyall lust:</l>
            <l>Ne mongst true louers they shall place inherit,</l>
            <l>But as Exuls out of his court be thrust.</l>
            <l>So hauing said, <hi>Melissa</hi> spake at will,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Colin,</hi> thou now full deeply hast divynd:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:11639:18"/>Of loue and beautie and with wondrous skill,</l>
            <l>Hast <hi>Cupid</hi> selfe depainted in his kynd.</l>
            <l>To thee are all true louers greatly bound,</l>
            <l>That doest their cause so mightily defend:</l>
            <l>But most, all wemen are thy debtors found,</l>
            <l>That doest their bountie still so much commend.</l>
            <l>That ill (said <hi>Hobbinol</hi>) they him requite,</l>
            <l>For hauing loued euer one most deare:</l>
            <l>He is repayd with scorne and foule despite,</l>
            <l>That yrkes each gentle heart which it doth heare.</l>
            <l>Indeed (said <hi>Lucid</hi>) I haue often heard</l>
            <l>Faire <hi>Rosalind</hi> of diuers fowly blamed:</l>
            <l>For being to that swaine too cruell hard,</l>
            <l>That her bright glorie else hath much defamed.</l>
            <l>But who can tell what cause had that faire Mayd</l>
            <l>To vse him so that vsed her so well:</l>
            <l>Or who with blame can iustly her vpbrayd,</l>
            <l>For louing not? for who can loue compell.</l>
            <l>And sooth to say, it is foolhardie thing,</l>
            <l>Rashly to wyten creatures so diuine,</l>
            <l>For demigods they be and first did spring</l>
            <l>From heauen, though graft in frailnesse feminine.</l>
            <l>And well I wote, that oft I heard it spoken,</l>
            <l>How one that fairest <hi>Helene</hi> did reuile:</l>
            <l>Through iudgement of the Gods to been ywroken</l>
            <l>Lost both his eyes and so remaynd long while,</l>
            <l>Till he recanted had his wicked rimes:</l>
            <l>And made amends to her with treble praise,</l>
            <l>Beware therefore, ye groomes, I read betimes,</l>
            <l>How rashly blame of <hi>Rosalind</hi> ye raise.</l>

            <l>To make so bold a doome with words vnmeet,</l>
            <l>Of thing celestiall which ye neuer saw.</l>
            <l>For she is not like as the other crew</l>

            <l>Not then to her that scorned thing so base,</l>
            <l>But to my selfe the blame that lookt so hie:</l>
            <l>So hie her thoughts as she her selfe haue place,</l>
            <l>And loath each lowly thing with loftie eie.</l>
            <l>Yet so much grace let her vouchsafe to grant</l>
            <l>To simple swaine, sith her I may not loue:</l>

            <l>That hers I die, nought to the world denying,</l>
            <l>This simple trophe of her great conquest.</l>
            <l>So hauing ended, he from ground did rise,</l>
