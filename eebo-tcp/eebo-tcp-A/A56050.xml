            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The manner of the Scituation of <hi>Great Yarmouth,</hi> and of its Trade and Buildings.</head>
               <p>WIthin a mile, on the Eaſt of the Town, is the Main Ocean: on the North-Weſt, the River <hi>Brayden;</hi> where three Rivers (<hi>Wavenee,</hi> which parts the Counties of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>Suffolk; Yare,</hi> which runs thorow the City of <hi>Norwich;</hi> the <hi>Bure,</hi> which comes from the North-parts of <hi>Norfolk</hi>) meet: from whence this River falls Eaſt and by South; and before it runs into the Sea, continues its courſe on the Key of <hi>Yarmouth.</hi> By theſe Rivers, to the Land-ward, all the Country-Growths and Manufactures are with little charge brought to <hi>Yarmouth:</hi> and up theſe ſtreams, theſe Countries are furniſhed with Forrein and Domeſtick Commodities at reaſonable Rates, by reaſon the Flux of the Sea doth make the current into the Country almoſt equal with the current out of the Country.</p>
               <p>As the Town is naturally ſcituated with theſe advantages for the Trade of theſe Countries, above any of the Eaſtern Coaſt: ſo it lies in the ſame Latitude as <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> and by conſequence, more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent then any other Town on the Eaſtern Coaſt of <hi>England</hi> for the Trade of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Netherlands</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and almoſt equal with <hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> for the Trade of <hi>Hamborough,</hi> the <hi>Hance-Towns,</hi> the <hi>Baltick</hi> and <hi>Norway.</hi> It is moreover inriched above any Town in <hi>England,</hi> or perhaps in the World, with a yearly Revenue of the Fiſhing-trade; which if it were managed and improved to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, might far exceed the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fiſhing trade. But this for many years, by reaſon of this Towns appropriating the Trade to a few hands, hath both rendred this Trade uſeleſs to the reſt of this Nation, beſides the Free-men of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> who have not Veſſels enough to maintain the ſame; and have by this means given the <hi>Dutch</hi> an opportunity of being the greateſt gainers by it, who have for many years laſt paſt brought over their Buſſes, and other Fiſhing Veſſels, and have taken the Herrings on this Coaſt, and brought the ſame into <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and ſold the ſame to them for ready money; which money might as well have been got by our ſelves, and kept at home.</p>
               <p>This place, although ſo naturally and advantagiouſly ſeated for Trade, yet it is no way conveniently built for it: the back-part thereof being ſo narrowly built in Lanes and Rows, as that there can be no acceſs made to it, but by Barrows, uſed no where in <hi>England</hi> but in this place, and for this reaſon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Beſides, the houſes are built ſo low, as alſo being ſtraightned for Warehouſe-room, they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch quantities of Merchandiſe as their Trade is capable of. And although the houſes to the Key are fair and well built, yet they are not of ſufficient capacity to entertain the fourth part of ſuch Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants as might trade upon the account of this Harbour; neither have they the conveniencies of freſh water. Notwithſtanding which, by reaſon of the advantages aforeſaid, they have and do flouriſh in Trade above any Town in <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Briſtol;</hi> which they are able to do upon their own account, without any dependency on any other place.</p>

               <p>THe Town of <hi>Little Yarmouth,</hi> heretofore called <hi>South-Town,</hi> was an Incorporate Town before <hi>Great Yarmouth,</hi> and did enjoy ſeveral priviledges, as the lading and unlading Merchandiſe, and of exporting and importing all kinde of Merchandiſe; which made the ſaid Town in a very flouriſhing condition. But the Town of <hi>Great Yarmouth,</hi> by their much greater power, procured ſeveral Grants and Letters Patents, upon ſome plauſible and ſpecious pretences, whereby they appropriated to the Free-men of <hi>Great Yarmouth,</hi> the Monopoly of Lading and Unlading all ſorts of Merchandiſe within ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               <p>Secondly, <hi>That all ſuch perſons arrived in</hi> England, <hi>ſhall be free in their Eſtates and Perſons, with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſettle themſelves and Families where they pleaſe, and have Liberty of Conſcience, as to matters in Religion; and to enjoy all Priviledges of his own Subjects, and to pay no more Duties or Cuſtoms then his Majeſties Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That his Majeſty at next Seſſions of Parliament will Naturalize them, their Children, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and are immediately made Denizens of</hi> England, <hi>without charge or trouble.</hi>
               </p>
