            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as it is not ſimply the preſent ſuppreſſion and ſetting to work of idle Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants and Beggers of all ſorts, wherewith the Streets, Lanes, and ſeverall parts of this City, have of late ſo much abounded, to the great ſcandall and diſhonor thereof, that can throughly accompliſh that hopefull Reformation in this kind that is deſired and intended, except ſome effectuall courſe be taken for the prevention thereof for the future. And whereas alſo, that through the generall neglect of moſt places, poore children maintained by their reſpective pariſhes, and others are bred up like Atheiſts, after a ſordid looſe, and undiſciplined manner, care being had only for their preſent bodily proviſion; by meanes whereof, ſo much diſſoluteneſſe, idleneſſe, thefts, whoredomes, prophane curſing, ſwearing, and almoſt all kinds of wickedneſſe do generally abound in that ſort of people, being indeed the moſt probable, if not certain conſequences of ſuch an education. And furthermore, whereas many Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and others doe eat the bread of Idleneſſe; ſome through an accuſtomed ocitanſie, who can, but will not work; and others through an unavoidable neceſſity, who would, but cannot procure work: For the hopefull prevention of the inconveniencies aforeſaid, the Corporation for the imploying of the Poor of the City of <hi>London,</hi> doe tender to the reſpective Pariſhes of the ſaid City as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the poor Children of this City, and Liberties thereof, from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> yeers old and upward, who now are at home at the Pariſhes charge, be duly ſent to the Worke-houſes belonging to the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with proviſion for their Dinners with them, where they ſhall have meanes to learn as well to read and write, as to be inſtructed in ſuch manufacturies as they ſhalbe capable of; Provided, they bring with them the Certificate of the Church-wardens or Overſeers of the poore of their ſeverall Pariſhes reſpectively.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That to this end they ſhal have two hours in every day allowed them to learn to read and write, with one houre at noon for their repaſt, and the reſt of the day, from ſeven or eight of the clock in the morning, till five or ſix at night, to be ſpent in getting knowledge how to work in ſome manufactury that may be uſefull to this Common-wealth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That for the firſt quarter of the yeer (except the Children be grown up, or are more expert then ordinary) it cannot be expected that any thing ſhould be given them but their Learning, in reſpect of that unavoidable loſſe which will be ſuſtained in the teaching them any manufacture whatſoever, through the waſte that they will make. But after the firſt quarter, twelve pence <hi>per</hi> week ſhall be allowed to each Child for their work, and ſhalbe increaſed as they ſhall deſerve, which together with what is allowed by the pariſh for their keeping and clothes, will be a competent maintenance for each reſpective Child.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Penſioners in the ſeverall VVards, that are beſt able, may by turns weekly accompany the children to the Work-houſes, one Penſioner to have the overſight of ten children, or their abouts, ſo as to bring them in the morning, and to return with them home at night; and the ſaid Penſioners may likewiſe work upon ſuch manufacturies as they are beſt skilled in, and bee paid according to their earnings.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the Children who ſhalbe imployed by this Corporation, may each of them have a badg of the Corporation upon their ſleeves.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That ſuch Penſioners, or other poore as are aged, or that cannot come to the ſaid VVork-houſes, may have materialls to work upon home to their own houſes, ſome of the Overſeers of the Pariſh inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for the faithfull return of them when they are converted into manufactury, according to the tickets printed by order of the Corporation, and they likewiſe to be paid according to their earnings.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That for the ſtragling Poore, if they belong to any pariſh within this City, and the Liberties thereof, then from thence they muſt have allowance, and there have habitation, and be regulated as is before expreſſed concerning the Pariſh Children.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That when any of theſe children ſo regulated, and educated, ſhall become fit, through ripeneſs of age, or otherwiſe, they may be placed out apprentices in ſome uſeful trades for their future livelyhoods.</p>
            <p>Towards the effectuall accompliſhment of which work aforeſaid, the ſaid Corporation doubt not of the moſt ready concurrence and help of all pious and charitable hearts.</p>
