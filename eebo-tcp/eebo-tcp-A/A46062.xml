         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN HEROICK ELEGIE Upon the moſt lamentable Death of the Incomparable Heroina, Madame ISABELLA BUGGS, The much Loved WIFE of Col. WILLIAM BUGGS, Formerly Widow to that Worthy Gentleman HENRY LLOYD Of <hi>CHEAM, in Com. Surrey,</hi> Eſquire; And DAUGHTER to that Honourable Perſon Sir <hi>GEORGE PARKINS</hi> of <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NNY in Com. Nottinghamſhire,</hi> Knight.</head>
            <l>ASſiſt me all ye Saints, whilſt I aſpire,</l>
            <l>Not like <hi>Prometheus,</hi> to ſteal Heavenly fire;</l>
            <l>But like <hi>Elias,</hi> in a Chair of Flame,</l>
            <l>To wait upon the Herſe, of this great Dame.</l>
            <l>I beg ſuch flames, ſhall give a heat Divine,</l>
            <l>Which burn not to conſume, but to refine;</l>
            <l>Or if conſume, they ſhall ſuch heat afford,</l>
            <l>As leaves the Scabbard whole, yet melts the Sword.</l>
            <l>Thoſe Lambent fiers, inwards do controul,</l>
            <l>Not touch the Body, but embrace the Soul.</l>
            <l>That's Beauties ſeat, whilſt Limbs, and Colours paſs,</l>
            <l>As faint reflections from a brittle glaſs.</l>
            <l>She was within all glory, her Soul ſet,</l>
            <l>Life to a flaming Chryſolyt, in Jet;</l>
            <l>Or Saphires, Rubies, Diamonds were met,</l>
            <l>I'th' compaſs of her Chryſtal Cabinet;</l>
            <l>Through which her Soul tranſpeer'd, and we did find,</l>
            <l>I'th' clouds of Earth, the mirrour of her mind.</l>
            <l>She liv'd a Chriſtian, and did others teach</l>
            <l>If they'd be taught, and great Example preach,</l>
            <l>More than a Sermon; nay, I'le boldly ſay,</l>
            <l>That Heav'n was made more holy, by her way</l>
            <l>Of ſerving it, her whole life being plac'd</l>
            <l>On <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, and ſo interlac'd</l>
            <l>'Twixt Action and Devotion, clearly we</l>
            <l>Did in th'Aſcent, and Deſcent Angels ſee.</l>
            <l>She born upon the wings of Love, doth fly</l>
            <l>Now in the boſom of Eternity.</l>
            <l>Juſt like a Faulcon, that ſoars always true,</l>
            <l>Though newly drawn from Earth, her Mother Mue;</l>
            <l>And neerer mounts to that Eternal Light,</l>
            <l>Doth more, and more, ſtill leſſen to our fight:</l>
            <l>So though ſhe's fled from us, yet ſhe is ſeen</l>
            <l>By Angels tow'ring towards th'high Heavens Queen;</l>
            <l>Who riſeth to receive her in her Arms,</l>
            <l>And prays her Son to guard her from all harms.</l>
            <l>She ſtudy'd to encreaſe two Husbands joys,</l>
            <l>And made one, Father of moſt gallant Boys;</l>
            <l>Whoſe noble care, will always be to bring</l>
            <l>Honour to th'Kingdom, Safety to the King.</l>
            <l>But left ſo many Daughters here behind,</l>
            <l>Enough to teach the Sex of Woman-kind.</l>
            <l>She always ſhew'd of graces rich enacreaſe,</l>
            <l>And ſuch a num'rous Iſſue, ne'r can ceaſe.</l>
            <l>She made the world more happy ſtill by Births,</l>
            <l>Yet brought her Fruits to Heav'n, ſo well as Earth.</l>
            <l>Her Soul was ſure Celeſtial, and did run</l>
            <l>Over all Creatures, like the powerful Sun;</l>
            <l>Which though it keeps its Orb, yet does beſtow</l>
            <l>Eſſence, and comfort on all things below.</l>
            <l>So all good Chriſtians found her Soul to be</l>
            <l>A ſource of inexhauſted Charity.</l>
            <l>She was of <hi>Parkins</hi> good, and glorious Blood,</l>
            <l>Yet never ſtrove to be ſo great as good.</l>
            <l>Nor did th'addition of two Noble Names,</l>
            <l>Adde to her more than Chriſtian humble flames.</l>
            <l>And ſo ſhe did ſubmit her Loyal Fate</l>
            <l>To the Kings fortune, and his then troubled State.</l>
            <l>I'le ſay no more, for that I truly fear,</l>
            <l>The world will call her ſo, a Cavaleer.</l>
            <l>Her Bones St. <hi>Giles</hi> now holds, but Name ſhall have</l>
            <l>In all true Chriſtian Hearts a living grave.</l>
            <l>Whilſt Churches do reſound her Funeral knell,</l>
            <l>Angels their Trumps, her own Name <hi>Iſ-a-Bell</hi>;</l>
            <l>A true Saints Bell, to call both us, and them</l>
            <l>To reſt, i'th' Heavenly Hieruſalem.</l>
