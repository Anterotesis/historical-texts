            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THere is nothing, which Men ſincerely Religious, do more heartily deſire, than that all Men were ſo too; and becauſe they are fully ſatisfied that they are in that very Way which moſt truly leads to Life, they therefore ſtrive that all may know it and walk in it.</p>
            <p>And truly this is my Caſe, my Hearts Deſire and Prayer to God for all Men is, that they may be ſaved. And as I believe it hath pleaſed God to ſhew me the Path of Life, I cannot but do my beſt to ſhew it to others; for as ſome by their Labours, have been helpful to me, ſo I hope mine may be helpful to others.</p>
            <p>When I call the Primitive Chriſtian Church at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the <hi>Mother of us All,</hi> I allude to that Place, <hi>Gal. 4. 26.</hi> Interpreters, (ſo far as I have obſerved) take <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there, for the Goſpel <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> now this Church had its Beginning, and this Beginning was at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and becauſe in the Progreſs of Chriſtianity in the World, for near one thouſand ſeven hundred years, there has abundance of Errors crept in,
<pb facs="tcp:51668:3"/>
and much truth in the antient Simplicity of it rejected, I think it highly rational, that (all prejudice being laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part) Men ſhould ſeek with the greateſt diligence, for their greateſt Security, into the State of Chriſts Goſpel-Church, as by himſelf eſtabliſhed; for whatſoever has not been planted by our Heavenly Father, is nigh to its being rooted up.</p>
            <p>God Almighty direct us all, is the hearty Prayer of thy Friend,</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Containing, by way of Preface, a particular conſideration of the State of the first Christian Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Reaſonableneſs of appealing to Her, as <hi>The Mother of us All.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is evident to all ſuch as have converſed with the Hiſtories of the Ages, which have been ſince the coming of our Lord, to make known and eſtabliſh all things in the Kingdom of Grace, in the firſt Church at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that there hath been great ſtriving among the Chriſtian Churches for ſome Honour and Prerogative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt. Sometimes the Church at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſometimes the Church at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and eſpecially the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> preſſing very hard for Precedence of Honour, and Preheminence of Power; few minding the poor afflicted Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the true Mother of all true Chriſtian Churches; when yet the Holy Ghoſt hath left a high Commendation upon thoſe who do follow Her, both in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Reception of the Goſpel, <hi>not as the Word of ſuch or ſuch a man,</hi> (though preached by <hi>Apoſtles) but as it is in truth the Word of God, 1 Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13, 14. and alſo (not in perſecuting, but) <hi>in ſuffering like things of their Countrey-men, as they did of the Jews.</hi> And we deſire, and hope that there may be yet, all due conſideration had by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in theſe days, of the Heavenly Frame and Holy Walking of that MOTHER-CHURCH.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51668:4"/>Unto whom was committed, in the firſt place, the Principles of the Oracles of God; unto whom our deareſt Lord was a perſonal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and did actually Diſpenſe to, and Communicate with them, in the Divine Myſteries or Ordinances of the Chriſtian Religion; upon whom was poured the moſt excellent Gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit of Promiſe. It was this Church, from whom (according to the Prophets) the Law of Chriſt ſhould firſt go forth, <hi>Iſa. 2. 3. Mich.</hi> 4. 1, 2. Here was <hi>the Houſe of the Lord eſtabliſhed in the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and exalted above the Hills, that all Nations might flow unto it:</hi> an Honour not given to other Churches, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 36. What, came the Word of God out from you?</hi> No, this was the Glory of another, <hi>For out of</hi> Zion <hi>ſhall go forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem. Which by ſpecial Order from Chriſt was fulfilled, when he gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to his Apoſtles, <hi>that Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be preached in his Name, in all Nations, beginning at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 47. And here it was that the Spirit gave utterance unto the Apoſtles, to preach in all Languages, that then ſome of all Nations (who were at that very time at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) might hear from thence the joyful Sound of the Goſpel, and conſequently, keep the ſame Holy Doctrine in all Ages and Nations, as it was there delivered, and <hi>confirmed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Signs and Miracles, and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Math. 28. 19, 20. Heb. 2. 4. Act. 2.</p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch then, as all Churches, in all Ages and Nations, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly bound to follow this Church, in the Obſervation of all things whatſoever Chriſt commanded them; we hold our ſelves concern'd, at this time, to declare our unfeigned Aſſent unto the Truth of the Goſpel, <hi>as it was here delivered;</hi> and our humble Reſolution to keep the Ordinances of Chriſt, <hi>as they were here practiſed</hi> (not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the ſame was received in all Churches at the firſt) being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of this very thing, that a ſafer way cannot be found for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of our Souls, from the manifold Errors, which ſince the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Church, have been obtruded upon the Conſciences of Men, in moſt parts of the Chriſtian Nations.</p>
                  <p>To the intent then that we may avoid Error, and cleave to Truth, we ſhall conſider particularly (though very briefly) the Frame of this Heavenly Building, in reſpect of her <hi>Foundation,</hi> her <hi>Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the <hi>Way of her Worſhip,</hi> in order to her Perfection. And Firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51668:4"/>We find her Foundation-Principles to conſiſt in ſix particulars, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>the beginning of the Word of Chriſt,</hi> which Articles are therefore called the Foundation, becauſe of the Relation they have to Chriſt, who is a Foundation to his Church, as held forth in his own Doctrine, and other Foundations than Chriſt ſo held forth, can no man lay.</p>
                  <p>Of ſuch importance are theſe Sacred Principles, that we find the Ancient Chriſtians uſed to call them the Chriſtian Catechiſm. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtoms,</hi> Teſtimony is this; <hi>That all theſe are fundamental Articles; that is, that we ought to repent from dead Works, to be baptized into the Faith of Chriſt, and be made worthy of the Gift of the Spirit, who is given by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands; and we are to be taught the Myſteries of the Reſurrection and Eternal Judgment. This Catechiſm,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is perfect.</hi> And indeed in the whole New Teſtament, we meet not with ſuch an excellent Epitome of the Chriſtian Doctrine as in this place, which was written to this <hi>Mother-Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, we have ſome mention of <hi>a Form of Doctrine</hi> delivered to the believing <hi>Romans:</hi> And <hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded to hold faſt <hi>the Form of ſound Words,</hi> which he had heard of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> Chriſt is ſaid to be the Apoſtle and High Prieſt of <hi>our Profeſſion,</hi> the Author and Finiſher of <hi>our Faith,</hi> we are willed to contend for the <hi>Faith</hi> once delivered to the Saints. But none of theſe places do ſhew us, as the Text under conſideration, <hi>what this Form of Doctrine,</hi> this <hi>Form of ſound Words,</hi> this <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and <hi>this Faith</hi> was, in reſpect of the Compoſition, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentality of them; nor can there any thing be aſſigned, that is ſo properly the Analogy or Rule of Faith, as theſe Principles of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm.</p>
                  <p>Happy had it been, if all Chriſtian Churches had held faſt this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm, though no more had ever been compoſed; Unity in the Truth would have been better maintained by this one, than by ſo many as are now extant. And ſure this being of Divine Compoſure and Authority, the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> the <hi>Beginning of the Word of Chriſt,</hi> muſt needs outweigh all others, being but of Human Compoſition. To begin with the firſt Principle of this Church, let us conſider.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="principle">
                     <head>1. Repentance from Dead Works.</head>
                     <p>We are firſt to conſider why Repentance is put in the firſt place, even before Faith; ſure it is becauſe no unrepenting Sinner can have the Faith of Juſtification; therefore this Principle of the Chriſtian
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51668:5"/>
Faith muſt follow Repentance. There is indeed a Faith (which we may call the Faith of Mankind) to believe there is a God, that will both puniſh Sinners, and reward the Righteous, and this Faith muſt needs precede Repentance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
                     <p>This Repentance, as it was a Principle of this <hi>Mother-Church,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends three things, a true Sence of Sin, in the exceeding ſinfulneſs of it; in which reſpect it is ſaid, <hi>They were pricked at the heart, and cried out, or ſaid, Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> Act. 2. 37. which is accompanied with Godly Sorrow, and with Amendment of Life, without which, Repentance is rather to be repented of, than to be eſteemed any part of the Foundation of Chriſtian Religion; <hi>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your Sins may be blotted out.</hi> Act. 3. 19. Without which Repentance, there is no Remiſſion. <hi>Luk. 13. 5. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye repent, ye ſhall all periſh,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. How bleſſed had it been, if this Doctrine had been preached, and Men brought to the Obedience of it, before they had been admitted to Memberſhip in the Church of Chriſt? The not keeping to this Rule, has filled all Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Churches with unregenerate, unconverted Perſons, to the Scandal of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>

                     <p>The Lord Chriſt had fully taught the Guides of this <hi>Mother-Church</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of Baptiſm</hi> both by Word and Example; and thereby had informed them of a three-fold Baptiſm. The firſt delivered by Precept, himſelf making the People Diſciples, by teaching them to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, and then appointing his Diſciples to dip them in the River, in which reſpect it is ſaid that Jeſus made and dipped (or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized) more Diſciples than <hi>John, Mat. 4. 17. John 4. 1. John</hi> 3. 22. His own example being an unqueſtionable Rule for the manner of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, he being <hi>Dipped of John into</hi> Jordan, as the <hi>Greek</hi> hath it, <hi>Mark 1. 9. and then coming up out of the Water.</hi> And of this whole Church it is ſaid, their hearts were ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, and their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies waſhed with pure water. For Baptiſmal Water is therefore purer, becauſe it is Sanctified for our Religious uſe, both by the Perſon of Chriſt, and by the Word of God. And of this Church, was firſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that <hi>every one of them</hi> ſhould repent, and then be Baptized; and of them it is alſo ſaid, that they that gladly received the Word preached by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> were baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 40.</p>
                     <p>They were alſo inſtructed concerning the Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit; it being the Promiſe of the Father made to all the called of the Lord, and was particularly applied to them, and poured upon them in the way of Faith and Obedience.</p>
                     <p>To be willing to be Baptized with Afflictions for Chriſt and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels-ſake, they were alſo taught by our bleſſed Saviour in his Diſcourſe with ſome of his Diſciples, and by his own Sufferings, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 30. of which they were alſo partakers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 32. as alſo all that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt expect the ſame. And it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by what <hi>Rule</hi> any man can take upon him to make Baptiſm the <hi>firſt Principle,</hi> ſeeing Chriſt himſelf has made it the <hi>third Principle?</hi> and by what <hi>Rule</hi> any man can call Sprinkling Baptizing? Dare they ſpeak as they act? that is, dare they ſay, I ſprinkle thee in the Name of the Father? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Would not their Conſcience flie in their Face if they ſhould ſo ſpeak? and yet behold, they prevaricate in action, and lye

                     </p>
                     <p>It is alſo excceding plain that the Holy Table of the Lord is here called the breaking of Bread.

                     <p>It is alſo as certain that the whole Church (<hi>this Mother-Church, Acts</hi> 2. 42<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) did then receive both the Bread and Cup of the Lord, as that any one of them did partake of both, the whole Service being expreſſed by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> a part for the whole, which yet will better appear, in that this Ordinance ought to be received by every Recipient, as he is a Member of Chriſt, not as he is a Miniſter: 'Tis true, as I am a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter I diſpenſe this Myſtery, but I receive it as a Member, ſaith St. <hi>Paul; For YE being many, are one Bread, and one Body.

                     </p>
                     <p>It was unto this Church, or the Guides of it, unto whom our Bleſſed Saviour delivered that Myſtical Doctrine, which offended ſo many of his Diſciples, <hi>John 6. 53.

'Tis true, ſome things were pertinent to the Apoſtles here, which were temporary and extraordinary, which Churches in after-Ages are not to expect; but it is alſo true that ſome things were ordinary, and fixed in that Office, for the continual uſe of the Church, and therefore to remain for ever <hi>viz.</hi> Their care for all Churches, their travels and labours to plant and ſettle new Churches, their withſtanding falſe Apoſtles, as themſelves are true Apoſtles.

                     <p>It was unto the Guides of this Cuhrch to whom our Bleſſed Lord firſt gave Rules for the Government of his Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. whence we learn that in caſes of perſonal Treſpaſſes, and ſins of Infirmity or Weakneſs, all poſſible Love, Patience and Charity, ſhould be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by one Chriſtian towards another, and the Offender, <hi>upon confeſſion of his fault,</hi> forgiven, unto ſeventy times ſeven Offences: ſo abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould Charity appear among the Members of Chriſt. But it was alſo in this Church where wilfull Iniquity was puniſhed with great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, as the Hypocriſie and Deceit of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira;</hi> and the like ſeverity was ſhewed againſt <hi>Simon Magus</hi> for his Pride and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, in aſpiring to a Miniſtry for which he was not qualified, and to which he was not called by Heaven's Donation and due vocation from the Church, without which, woful experience hath taught the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Nations, that it is in vain by Money, or for Mony to make Men Miniſters in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                     <p>In this Church was held the firſt and beſt of General Councils, for ſetling the Churches in peace, when troubles did ariſe among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by means of falſe Teachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And becauſe the Churches in all Ages and Nations, may have perpetual need of ſuch helps, it ſhall not be amiſs that we conſider the Quality and Authority of ſuch Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, leſt otherwiſe we be abuſed by Uſurpation and Tyranny: and firſt of the occaſion of the calling this preſent Aſſembly, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.</p>
                     <p>This Aſſembly was called upon the greateſt occaſion that ever was, namely, the Repealing, or rather ſhewing the Repeal, of many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinances, and freeing the Chriſtian Church from their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe they were either fulfilled, or too burthenſome for his Church, as indeed St. <hi>Peter</hi> avers, they were ſo heavie, that neither they nor their Fathers were able to bear them; And the endeavours of this Council was ſucceſsful to the removal of them, and the ſettlement of the Churches in the Faith; and to the great encreaſe of their number, <hi>Asts</hi> 16. From whence we may ſafely conclude, that if <hi>Moſes's Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> which were from Heaven, were a hindrance to Peace and growth in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51668:8"/>
the Chriſtian Church, much more muſt all Ceremonies deviſed, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Human Force and Power only, be an obſtruction to it. Let us therefore ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and not be entangled in the Yoak of Bondage, whether of Legal, or other deviſed Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>As for the quality of the perſons, of whom this Aſſembly did conſiſt, 'tis plain they were <hi>Meſſengers, Elders</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> and theſe did all freely deliberate upon the matters in queſtion, offering their Reaſons <hi>pro &amp; contra;</hi> and the Diciſion was made, not by the interpoſition of <hi>Power Apoſtolical,</hi> but by the clear evidence of Truth and Reaſon, to which they all agreed. The Apoſtles acting here as <hi>Grave Fathers,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>free Audience</hi> and <hi>faithful Advice,</hi> to which when all agreed, the concluſion was made <hi>in all their names,</hi> as appears, <hi>Acts 15. 22, 23. Then pleaſed it the Apoſtles and Elders, with the whole Church, to ſend choſen men of their own Company to</hi> Antioch, <hi>and wrote Letters by them after this manner; The Apoſtles, Elders and Brethren ſend greeting unto the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which are of the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. From the ſweet concord here, we ſuppoſe all Churches ſhould do well to conſtitute their general Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſuch, ſeeing ſuch helps ſhe may have ſtill, in things ordinary to each Office, if ſhe render not her ſelf unworthy of them.</p>
                     <p>Now for the quality and authority of the Decrees, made by this, or ſucceeding Aſſemblies, the caſe is clear of it ſelf; Theſe were ſuch things as ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>not that the Holy Ghoſt now revealed them,</hi> but brought to remembrance what the Scriptures had ſaid concerning them, and partly by what before that time had been ſhewed unto St. <hi>Peter</hi> by a certain Viſion of God's accepting the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, though not cleanſed according to Legal Purification. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till the Holy Ghoſt reverſe thoſe Decrees, they are to oblige all Churches to keep them inviolable. And in this point (as indeed in all the reſt) the Baptized Churches in this Age do ſtand a witneſs againſt the diſorder and diſobedience of moſt of the Chriſtian Nations in the World; who make no Conſcience of <hi>abſtaining from Blood,</hi> &amp;c. though they know the true Churches did Religiouſly obſerve theſe Decrees for ſeveral hundreds of years after. <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, <hi>The cuſtom of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is to abſtain from all Blood, and things Strangled, ſo that it is not lawful for them, when they feed at their Tables to meddle with the Blood of any Beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is further ſafely concluded from hence, that all decrees of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils are ſo far obliging only, as the things decreed are proved to be true, and not becauſe they are decreed in Council only; for here
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51668:9"/>
St. <hi>Peter</hi> proves, that Churches are free from the obligation of Legal Ceremonies, <hi>becauſe they wear a Burthen too heavy to be born. 2. Becauſe God had accepted them already without them.</hi> And <hi>James</hi> [the Angel of this Church] proves or confirms the ſame <hi>by the Scriptures,</hi> and theſe Arguments, and Probations, ſatisfied the Aſſembly. And it's certain, the things prohibited by theſe decrees, were always forbidden, even to <hi>Noah and his perpetual Generations, Gen.</hi> 9. 12, &amp;c. Nor does this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly excommunicate or <hi>anathematize</hi> all that ſhall doubt of the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Determination, but very ſweetly tells the Brethren they ſhall do well to comply with their advice; for they knew that every Church had Power to puniſh offenders, and to them they ſeem to leave that Care, and not to take the Power of any Church out of their Hands, as the manner of ſome is.</p>

                     <p>It was in this Church where the Holy Virgin, Mother of our Lord, had her Converſation and Society, being with that ſelect Company, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of an hundred and twenty names, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 15. among whom this moſt bleſſed Woman is expreſly named, and by whoſe Preſence this <hi>Mother-Church</hi> was honoured above all others.

This Church makes no Prayers to her, nor to Chriſt in her name, nor taught the ſucceeding Churches to do ſo; yet ſurely ſhe was the greateſt Saint that ever was; and if we have no ground from any direction, nor Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Scripture to perform ſuch Devotion to Her, we cannot with

                  <p>AS it hath pleaſed God to exerciſe you many years with various Tryals and Afflictions, for your Faithfulneſs to the Chriſtian Religion (in reſpect of the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> of it to its ancient Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) both in the Form and Power of it, wherein you have laboured hitherto, and have not fainted, but, by the Grace of God, have attained to ſome degree in that behalf, above what hath, as yet, been attained by the generality of your Country-men, for which you owe the greateſt Thankfulneſs to Almighty God. And having (as I verily believe) laid a right Foundation for a true Church-State, you are indiſpenſibly obliged to go on unto perfection, as the firſt Churches, which were built upon the ſame Foundation, were expreſly required and exhorted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:51668:11"/>In which Holy Profeſſion, being by the Grace of God, one with you, and alſo called to the Miniſtry and Office of a Meſſenger of your Churches [which I mention, becauſe it is the moſt deſpiſed Office amongſt all Chriſtians, as it ſeems to have been in the Apoſtles days. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9.] do hold it my Duty, at this time, to endeavour to ſtrengthen you (in what I may) in your Holy Profeſſion; as alſo to call upon ſuch as have been ſhaken in mind by the violence of thoſe Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which have befallen them in common with their Brethren.</p>
                  <p>For as it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, (as thoſe undoubtedly ſhall, who draw back from the Truth they have once embraced unto Perdition) ſo I am very confident, that for any to fall from the Truth, as it is profeſſed by the Baptized Churches, is the moſt dangerous of all other, they being indeed the neareſt to the Truth, in the Priſtine Order and Simplicity of it, of all ſorts of Perſons, who own the Honorable Appellation of Chriſtian. For,</p>
                  <p>What ſort of Chriſtians can with any Confidence look upon, or bring themſelves cloſe to the Rules of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Catechiſm, <note n="*" place="margin">The Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, Repentance, Faith, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Baptiſms, Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Dead, Eternal Judgment.

                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. (as the Antients uſed to call it) except the Baptized Churches? To ſay nothing of others, can they of the preſent <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-Church,</hi> in any wiſe ſquare themſelves, or juſtifie their preſent Church-State by the Rule of thoſe Sacred Principles, in the ſimplicity of them? No, theſe Principles of Chriſt's Doctrine, will in no wiſe be concordant with the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm of the preſent <hi>Roman Church,</hi> ſeeing a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of their own hath told us, that if the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures muſt be our Rule, <hi>&amp;c. they muſt all croſs the Cudgels to the Anabaptiſts;</hi> which is a plain giving up the Victory to the Baptized Churches, unleſs a better Form of Doctrine can be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than this is, which will never be. Yea, ſo preſſing is this place from the true Inſtitution of the Antient Chriſtian Religion, that the Rhemiſts ſeem to be under no ſmall difficulty how to expreſs themſelves about it: For thus they ſpeak upon the Text, <hi>Heb. 6. 1, 2. We ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> (ſay they) <hi>what the firſt grounds of Christian Inſtitution, or Catechiſm, were in the Primitive Church, and that there was ever a neceſſary Inſtruction and Belief of certain Points, had by Word of mouth and Tradition, before men came to the Scriptures, which could not treat of things ſo particularly as was</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:51668:11"/>
                     <hi>requiſite for the teaching of all neceſſary Grounds. Among theſe Points were the twelve Articles contained in the Apoſtles Creed; The Doctrine of Penance before Baptiſm; the Manner and Neceſſity of Baptiſm; the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Impoſition of Hands after Baptiſm, called Confirmation; the Articles of the Reſurrection, Judgment, and ſuch like: without which things firſt laid, if one ſhould be ſent to pick his Faith out of the Scriptures, there would be mad Rule quickly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. It's highly obſervable from hence, that the firſt Grounds and Principles <hi>of our Churches</hi> (which indeed are no other than what men read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2.) are openly acknowledged, by our moſt Potent Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites, to be the ſame which were <hi>in the Primitive Church,</hi> received for <hi>the firſt Grounds and Inſtitutions of Chriſtianity, or Chriſtian Inſtitution and Catechiſm.</hi> That in the Primitime Church, theſe Grounds were held in the very Order now obſerved by the Baptized Churches; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, <hi>Repentance before Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Impoſition of Hands after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi> Sure this is a full Teſtimony, that the Inſtitution of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Churches (now wrongfully called Anabaptiſts) <hi>and theirs only,</hi> is truly Apoſtolical. Whilſt all the <hi>Paedobaptiſts</hi> in the World (among whom, the Papiſts) have quite ſubverted this Order, giving their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Baptiſm before Repentance, and that unto Perſons that are not capable of Repentance.</p>
                  <p>2. They tell us <hi>there was a neceſſary Inſtruction and Belief of certain Points had by Word of Mouth and Tradition, before men came to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Admit this to be ſo, in reſpect of ſuch parts of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures as were then unwritten, when the Apoſtles firſt preached the Goſpel; yet it is certainly falſe, in reſpect of ſuch Books of Scripture as were then in being; for it's evident that our Bleſſed Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the Text of <hi>Scripture, Luke</hi> 4. 17, 18, 19. and thence preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the People, and commanded his Hearers to ſearch the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, John</hi> 5. 29. He did not ſend his Hearers to <hi>Tradition, as the Papiſts do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great Apoſtle of the Jews, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> even then when he was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 17. preached from, and notably confirms his Doctrine by the Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. not by Tradition.

                     <hi>Perſwading men concerning Jeſus, out of the Law and the Prophets</hi> (not out <hi>of Tradition) from Morning to Evening;</hi> and the beſt ſort of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Hearers, <hi>ſearched the Scriptures daily, (not Tradition) to ſee whether the things ſpoken by him were ſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Nor can the Papiſts tell us what one Point of <hi>Neceſſary Inſtruction</hi> or Belief was delivered by Word of Mouth, which is not now contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Holy Scripture; if otherwiſe, let them aſſign ſome <hi>neceſſary Point of Faith or Inſtruction,</hi> ſuch, as without which, we cannot know and ſerve God truly and fully, and be ſaved eternally, which is not contained in the Holy Scriptures. But as this will hardly be attempted; ſo let me exhort you, Brethren, to beware of all manner of Principles and Doctrins, which have any tendency to weaken or invalidate the Authority and Sufficiency of the Scriptures, which the Apoſtle avers to be of that ſufficiency (even before all the Books of Sacred Scriptures were extant) as <hi>to furniſh the Man of God throughly to every good Work.</hi> And then certainly, he who is in all Points of Faith and Inſtruction, a good Chriſtian, according to the Doctrine contained in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, will be out of the reach of any juſt reprehenſion, though he know nothing of the unwritten Tradition, ſo much pretended and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by the Papiſts, or others.</p>
                  <p>Being thus ſecured in your Principles, from the very conceſſion of your Enemies, and by the Authority of the beſt and moſt Sacred An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, even the Holy Scriptures, you have no cauſe to fear the moſt important difficulties, wherewith poſſibly we may be tried in theſe days. And that we may the better ſee how the caſe ſtands between the <hi>Baptiſts and the Papiſts,</hi> with reſpect to the two great Ordinances of Chriſt, to wit, <hi>Holy Baptiſm,</hi> and the Holy Table of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; we will here take a View of the one, and of the other, in a diſtinct Column by it ſelf, the better to diſcern their Diſparity.</p>

                              <p>Then he layeth his hands upon the Altar, the Deacon reaching him the Paten, he putteth it to his right eye, then to his left, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Croſs beyond his head with it, he kiſſeth it and layeth it down.</p>
                              <p>Then he breaketh the Hoſt in three, holding two pieces in his left hand and one in his right over the Cup, which with a Croſs he letteth fall into it.</p>

                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:51668:16"/>Thus, Brethren, I have given you a brief account of the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Obſervations of thoſe who would be thought the trueſt Church on Earth, though they have aſſuredly changed the Ordinances of our Lord more than any ſort of Chriſtians; I have alſo ſet before you the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſimplicity (and yet the great utility) of theſe two great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that you may be more inwardly affected with them, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with him whom they ſo excellently repreſent, for to this end are they ordained <hi>to ſet forth Chriſt and him Crucified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of all the difficulties with which you are likely to be tried in reſpect of your Religious Profeſſion, <hi>that Queſtion which concerns the Judge of theſe and other Controverſies in Religion,</hi> is like to be the moſt dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have been little exerciſed in it; as alſo becauſe many perſons of great Eminency and Authority are deeply radicated and very expert in an opinion diametrically oppoſite to yours, for they ſay, <hi>that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving voice of the Church, aſſembled in a General Council of her Biſhops and Doctors, is the only infallible Judge to determine all Controverſies in matters of Faith and Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, We have been taught, and have conſtantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that it is all Chriſtians Duty <hi>to rely chiefly, and before all things, upon the Authority and ſufficiency of the voice of God himſelf, as he ſpeaks in the Holy Scriptures, as the beſt, and only infallible Decider of all Queſtions that ſhall ariſe, (eſpecially in the Chriſtian Church, and ſince the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were written and received) about matters of Faith and Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed it ſeems very ſtrange that any man ſhould think there is a better Judge than God himſelf, of what is true, and what is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in matters of Religion; and to be ſure he ſpeaks to us with the greateſt Certainty, and Authority, by the holy Pen-men of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. And it is as ſtrange that the Church, who muſt derive all her Light and Authority from God and his Word, ſhould appeal men to her ſelf rather than to him: methinks they ſhould ſay to us (as <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Subſtitute ſaid to St. <hi>Paul</hi>) Haſt thou Appealed to God, as he ſpeaks in his Scriptures? to God and his Scriptures ſhalt thou go. And eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when this is the queſtion, What ſort of Chriſtians are the true Church of Chriſt? for it ſeems then the moſt unreaſonable thing in the World, that any Party contending for this Title [The Church] ſhould be her own Judge; and ſeeing the Church cannot <hi>by meerly avouching</hi> (upon her own Teſtimony only) <hi>that ſhe is the Church,</hi> make any proof or demonſtration that ſhe is ſo, it remains then, that we muſt have ſome Infallible Rule by which to find the Church. And now if
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51668:17"/>
God himſelf does not reveal to us who is his Church, we ſhall never find her; nor does he reveal this, but by the Teſtimonies of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, there muſt we find the Church of God, or no where. For none but <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> pretend to any other Revelation in this Caſe; and to ſpeak feeely, I doubt the Papiſts are more then a little <hi>Enthuſiaſtical;</hi> for rather than let God's Word decide this Queſtion about the Church, they will flye to <hi>Miracles,</hi> as if a falſe Prophet may <hi>not ſhew a Sign, or a Wonder, yea, and that Sign and Wonder come to paſs too,</hi> and yet the thing he brings it to prove, be nothing but a lye: ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he that ſhall pretend to work a Miracle or Wonder <hi>in theſe days,</hi> to prove ſuch, or ſuch a People to be the Church, I ſhould the more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect both him and his Church; becauſe we have a ſure Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy confirmed by Miracles already, which Word, doth as fully ſet forth the Church, as it ſets forth any thing; inſomuch as men may as well call for Miracles to prove there <hi>is a God,</hi> and that <hi>this God is true,</hi> as to call for Miracles to prove <hi>the true Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed the Church of Chriſt being once found, then all wiſe and modeſt men will readily lend an Ear to her in all things, and eſpecially when ſhe undertakes to expound the dark or myſterious points of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or offers her Judgment in things doubtful, [for as for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon point of the Chriſtian Faith, he that is a wiſe and good Man, and no ways byaſſed by Intereſt, may perhaps know theſe things, as well as the Church, or at leaſt, ſuch as call themſelves Church-men.] But to be bound to adhere to any Church in theſe days, as to a people which <hi>cannot poſſibly be miſtaken</hi> in any matters of Faith, or Religion, ſeems to be an Atribute too high for any Society of Sinful men, [and <hi>there is none that liveth and ſinneth not.</hi>] For ſeeing God hath not told us any ſuch thing, <hi>That the Church cannot Err or be Miſtaken,</hi> it ought not to be ſpoken: and if it be only proper to the Almighty to ſay <hi>He cannot lye;</hi> It muſt not be ſaid of the Church, that She cannot lye, leſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove us, and we be found Lyars. <hi>Rom. 3. 4. Let God be true, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man a lyar,</hi> for thus it is written; and again, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 12. Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im <hi>compaſſeth me about with Lyes, and the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>with Deceit.</hi> This was the Caſe of the ten Tribes: and though <hi>Judah be juſtified as to theſe Impieties,</hi> yet Chap. 12. 2. <hi>God tells them he had a Controverſie with them alſo.</hi> Certain it is that famous Churches have erred in matters of Faith, and others were as liable to err as they, no Church being herein pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged above another, for any thing that God has ſaid in his Word, but he every where exhorts his People to beware of Sin, Error, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51668:17"/>
Apoſtacy, and commands every one that hath Ears, to hear what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches: but he does not ſay to any of them that they <hi>cannot Err,</hi> therefore we are not to hear ſuch a ſtory of any Church. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. Is a gracious Promiſe indeed, <hi>That the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church of Chriſt,</hi> as founded upon himſelf, in the true Faith of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> But this Promiſe belongs to all true Churches equally, yet no man ever durſt affirm from hence, That no true Church can poſſibly err. And St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who underſtood this Promiſe, never told any Church of his Planting, that they <hi>could not Err;</hi> but rather tells them they may err, <hi>ſo as to fall from their ſtedfaſtneſs, and be led away with the error of the Wicked.</hi> Indeed if any Church could be aſſigned here on Earth <hi>that cannot err, or be deceived in matters of Faith,</hi> it were the eaſieſt thing in the World to find the Truth, having once found the Church; for we ſhould have no need to know any thing but what that Church ſpeaks, and to receive her Determinations as God's Oracles: but then I conſider again that we ſhould perhaps have great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience alſo. For, if all the Decrees made by General Councils be obliging to us, and were bound up together, we ſhould never be able to read them, nor I doubt, to underſtand them; it will then be our beſt, at the long-run, to take Sanctuary at the Word of God, as our Guide, and Superiour to the Church.</p>
                  <p>But I conſider farther, that no man makes any particular Church this Guide, but does refer us to the Univerſal Church, as aſſembled in a General Council. Surely either this is to make as many Univerſal Churches at leaſt as there has been Ages ſince Chriſt was upon the Earth; or if all make but one Univerſal Church, the direction given to follow her Sentence, is ſcarce practicable; for how long will it be before a man can be aſſured, what was held, and what was rejected by the Church in all Ages? indeed there are Men born of great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who will tell us that the Catholick, or Univerſal Church hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways held ſuch Doctrines, and ſuch Traditiors as are unwritten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it highly concerns all Chriſtians, as much as in them lieth, to make ſure work with ſuch bold Talkers, about the truth of the things which they affirm, eſpecially about the truth of the Antiquity of theſe things, that is, that they appear by ſome Divine Record to have been delivered to the firſt Churches, by Men approved of God, to be the deliverers of Divine Inſtitutes; and if they fail here, it will be ill ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to follow them in their after-enquiries. And there is the higheſt Reaſon in the World to ſtand as ſtrongly as poſſible for the firſt Age;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51668:18"/>
for ſuch pure and undoubted Antiquity is neceſſary in our Caſe, from the tenour of our Bleſſed Saviour's Argumentation againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> in oppoſition to a Tradition, or <hi>Moſaical</hi> Precept in the Caſe of Divorce, <hi>Mat. 19. 8. From the beginning it was not ſo.</hi> For ſeeing the Apoſtles did faithfully deliver the whole Counſel of God to the firſt Churches, condemning all that ſhall teach otherwiſe than they had taught the the Doctrine of Godlineſs; or that ſhould not conſent to wholeſome words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it is therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to bring all Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Practices in the Chriſtian Church to the Teſt of the moſt pure and Primitive Antiquity; for that Church which hath that Argument fairly on her ſide, cannot fail of all other Arguments, which can be any way neceſſary for her Juſtification; for indeed this firſt Argument does infer all the reſt, and they that have not this, have none of the other; which thing being well conſidered, look back upon your Principles (O ye Baptized Chriſtians) and upon what hath been ſaid for them, even by your Adverſaries, and take comfort; for whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver boaſts of the beſt Antiquity, it is certain that you only have it.</p>
                  <p>For what is the moſt ancient Record? Doubtleſs the Holy Scripture; and if ſo, let the queſtion be about Chriſt and his Church, there muſt we find them both, or no where. If any Man like not this Doctrine; let him ſhew me, if he can, theſe lovely Objects without being behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the Scripture. Some I have known to attempt this, but with lamentable ſucceſs, being ſoon driven to a ſhameful ſilence; and indeed the whole World muſt depart into utter ſilence as touching this great Myſtery, Chriſt and his Church, unleſs the Word of God, (as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the Holy Scriptures) through Faith, makes us wiſe in theſe great Concernments of Salvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                  <p>Let men alledge all the Authors in the World, and all the Tradition that ever was, if the Holy Scriptures muſt not be their own Evidence, and ſo capable to command our Belief of them; then for the ſame, or rather more forcible Reaſons, then any Man can bring againſt the Scriptures, all Authors and all Traditions ſhall be dumb and uſeleſs as to the production of the leaſt <hi>iota</hi> of Divine Faith; ſo that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts at the long-run (muſt if they know how) ſhew us their Church without Scripture, or any Author, and without Tradition alſo, as I have formerly written unto you, being provoked thereunto by ſeven Queries ſent by a Learned Papiſt, who in his laſt to me, does undertake to deliver himſelf from this difficulty after this manner; <hi>We may</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>prove the Church by the Holy Scripture, and the Scripture by the Church, and this</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:51668:18"/>
                     <hi>by a</hi> Regreſſus Demonſtrativus, <hi>without a vicious Circle, becauſe we ſuppoſe them both ſufficiently proved, and prudently accepted for ſuch, by all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Credibility, as Miracles, Holineſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by which Chriſt proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his New Goſpel. But as for the Senſe of the Scripture, I have more than ſufficiently demonſtrated, that the Scripture it ſelf cannot bear witneſs for it, but that this muſt be had from a Living Judge,</hi> viz. <hi>the Church, the Infallible Interpreter of Gods Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer briefly: That is a vicious Circle, out of which no man can lawfully deliver himſelf, but muſt run in a Round with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end; and truly ſuch is this Circular Argumentation of my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, he will prove his Church by the Scripture. 2. He will prove the Scripture to be true by his Church, and he will prove his Church true by the Scripture, before the Scripture be proved true; and he will prove the Scripture to be true, after it hath proved his Church true. This Meander is no way to be avoided that I can ſee, but by ſuffering either the Scripture, or the Church to be its own Evidence, for his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative Regreſs</hi> makes his Caſe worſe; for by it, they be both ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved, before either of them be proved, and both prudently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, before either of them be accepted; and which is moſt ſtrange of all the reſt, theſe things are all done before the Scripture hath any ſenſe known; for of this he is the moſt of all confident, <hi>that the Senſe of the Scripture muſt be had from a living Judge,</hi> viz. <hi>the Church, the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Interpreter of God's Word.</hi> So that this is the Concluſion of the whole Matter: The Scripture without Senſe muſt prove the Roman Church, and the Roman Church muſt then give the Senſe of that Scripture, which had no Senſe before, when it proved Her to be the Church; here is indeed a <hi>Regreſſus,</hi> but no ſuch thing as a <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Methinks wiſe men ſhould conſider that the Holy Scripture is its own Interpreter in a great, if not the greateſt part of it, the New Teſtament being the beſt Interpreter of the Old Teſtament, and of it ſelf alſo in many places: for Example; It tells us in one place, that the <hi>Heavens muſt receive Chriſt</hi> from the time of his Aſcenſion, <hi>till the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the Preſence of the Lord. Act.</hi> 3. 21. And hence we hold, that no Chriſtian muſt ſay that the real Body of of Chriſt, which aſcended to Heaven, is upon the Earth, till he ſhall be ſent the ſecond time, [for God <hi>ſhall ſend Jeſus,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter</hi>] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture tells us in another place, That <hi>if Jeſus were on Earth, he ſhould not be a Prieſt,</hi> Heb. 8. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:51668:19"/>It is therefore as plain as plain can be, that the Papiſts make void the Prieſthood of Chriſt, and contradict St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, when they tell the World that the real Body of Chriſt which aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is now really, carnally, corporally preſent upon the Earth, that is, upon their Altars, and in the Hands and Mouths of their Prieſts and People, as often as they celebrate Maſs, and conſequently he is ſo far from being received into Heaven <hi>till the time of his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that he is, according to their own Opinion, received bodily upon Earth ten thouſand times, and in ten thouſand places, to his being once received bodily into Heaven. Sure their Opinion is directly againſt the Scripture, as ſure as their <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is directly againſt the beſt Senſe, and the beſt Reaſon, with which Almighty God hath endowed the beſt of Men, as has been clearly evidenced by many learned Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; among which, I would commend to your Peruſal, one lately publiſhed, under the Title of <hi>A Diſcourſe againſt Tranſubſtantiation:</hi> Printed this Year, and ſold by Mr. <hi>Aylmer</hi> at the <hi>Three Pigeons</hi> againſt the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> Price Six Pence.</p>
                  <p>My Learned <hi>Adverſary,</hi> and indeed <hi>the Papiſts generally,</hi> do urge us vehemently after this manner, admitting <hi>that the Church is to follow the Rule of God's revealed Word in all her Definitions;</hi> yet they hold it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly irrational, that all that can read it, ſhould be <hi>his own Interpreter of it,</hi> for ſo, ſay they, <hi>He will be his own Judge.</hi> And as in a Nation where no Judge of the Law is appointed, there can be no Juſtice, but every man will be his own Judge; ſo likewiſe, unleſs there be a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Judge in Matters of Faith, to wit, the Church, from whom no Appeal may be allowed, there can be no end of Controverſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Objection is conſiderable: to which I ſay,</p>
                  <p>1. What my Adverſary means by <hi>God's revealed Word,</hi> I do not very well underſtand, but I doubt he extends that Term farther than the Holy Scripture, elſe I am ſure enough, the Church of <hi>Rome has no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Word of God to follow</hi> in very many of her Obſervations: but to let this paſs at preſent, I anſwer to the Objection thus;</p>
                  <p>2. It ſeems to be built upon many dangerous Suppoſitions, ſuch as theſe, That we ought to reſt upon the Sentence of a Prieſt (for we muſt hear the Church out of his Mouth) for the ſtate of our Soul, as on the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Judge in a Civil Court for a matter of Debt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that we are no more bound to ſearch the Scriptures for Eternal Life, than to ſearch the Statute-Book for our Temporal Life [nay, here I do them no wrong, for they will permit us to read the Statute-Book, but they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51668:19"/>
forbid us to read the Holy Scripture.] It ſuppoſes the Prieſt cannot deceive us; when the <hi>Prophet</hi> tells us, that though <hi>the Prieſts Lips ſhould preſerve Knowledge,</hi> and that <hi>we ſhould ſeek the Law at his Mouth, yet they had cauſed many to ſtumble at the Law,</hi> becauſe they had <hi>been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in the Law,</hi> Mat. 2. 8. It ſuppoſes, whoever falls under the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Prieſt, is as ſurely damned, as he is caſt or hanged, that falls under the Sentence of a Judge in Law. [Which may be falſe, for the Prieſts did joyntly ſentence our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Saying, We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to die.</hi> It's true, <hi>whatſoever the Church doth bind on Earth,</hi> is bound in Heaven; but then nothing is bound on Earth, unleſs ſhe judge righteouſly; for it is written, that <hi>the Curſe cauſeleſs ſhall not come,</hi> Prov. 26. 2. and ſeeing ſhe may be deceived, (at leaſt by falſe Witneſſes) She may condemn the Innocent, though She had no mind to do ſo, which ſhews She is not infallible, whatever men talk to the contrary.] I do not like this Opinion, therefore becauſe it leaves not Liberty for thoſe whom the Church condemns, to appeal ſo much as to Almighty God, who knows the Hearts of all men, whilſt the Church knows them not. But I anſwer to the Objection, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
                  <p>1. There is a Judgment Authoritative; this indeed muſt be referr'd to the Church, and no wiſe Man ever thought otherwiſe, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church muſt be content to abide the Sentence of the Church, though they be innocent, till God clears their Innocency; but all this while we ſuppoſe the Church we ſpeak of, to be a true Church, and that She judges according to Evidence; and yet becauſe She knows not all Secrets, nor all things contained in the Scriptures, we alſo ſuppoſe She may poſſibly miſtake, though never ſo Honeſt. But,</p>
                  <p>2. There is a Judgment of Knowledge or Diſcretion, by which Men receive the Truth of the Goſpel, as underſtanding, and ſo believing it to be ſo; and by the ſame Judgment he refuſes what is falſe, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it to be ſo; and till his Underſtanding be well informed, or rationally ſatisfied by convincing Evidence, he cannot, if he have the Underſtanding and Spirit of a Man, do either the one or the other. And hence it is, that Salvation, (and conſequently the means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it) are offered to men in the manner of choice, <hi>Joſh. 24. 15. Chuſe then this day whom you will ſerve.</hi> Heb. 11. 25. <hi>Moſes choſe rather to ſuffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> And foraſmuch as all Men are not called at the ſame moment, but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51668:20"/>
ſome receive the Truth in their Youth, others in their middle Age, ſome not till Old Age; all the Liberty which we contend for, is, that Men may have the free uſe of the Means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which they may know the Truth, and be allowed to underſtand it before they be admitted to Sacred things, that they may not only be able to give a Reaſon of the Hope that is in them, but alſo be able to do (as they are alſo exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>Prove every man his own Work, that he may have rejoycing in himſelf alone, and not in another,</hi> Gal. 6. 4, 5. Thus much in anſwer to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
                  <p>There is no Man living that would more gladly (than my ſelf) give to the Church of God, all that Honour and Obedience which God hath allowed Her; but to ſay, <hi>She cannot err,</hi> is to make Her more like God than She is. I think all that can be ſafely affirmed, is, That She ſhall not ſail ſo, as utterly to ceaſe from being, but that God will have a Church in the World, to be his Witneſs to the end of the World, though the Apoſtacy be never ſo great, or ſeemingly univerſal. And as it pleaſed God to foreſhew the great Apoſtacies, which ſhould be found among the Chriſtian Nations: So he was graciouſly pleaſed to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix ſome words of comfort, that when it ſhould ſo fall out, that the Spouſe of Chriſt ſhould be like the <hi>Dove in the ſecret places of the Stairs;</hi> Cant. 2. 14. or thruſt into Priſons, and out of ſight, which might cauſe the Faithful even to think there was no Church remaining (like that of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> who deſired rather to die than to live, becauſe he thought the Faithful had utterly failed, and himſelf left alone) I ſay, that then they ſhould remember that <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhould not prevail againſt the Church,</hi> and therefore God hath always had a Church, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe might be obſcured.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Brethren, my Hearts deſire and Prayer to God for you, is, that you may be of one Mind and Judgment in all the Will of God, and eſpecially in theſe Sacred Principles before mentioned, and in the Conſtitution of your Miniſtry, in reſpect of the <hi>Threefold Order</hi> of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, under which the firſt Churches were undoubtedly governed, <hi>viz. Meſſengers, Elders,</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> And I do the rather adviſe to this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome have been pleaſed to publiſh in Print, that there are only two Offices remaining in the Church of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Elders and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons; This <hi>Presbyterian Principle,</hi> will, I fear, undo ſuch as receive it. They boldly tell us, that the Office of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> was <hi>Temporary,</hi> as if they had none to ſucceed them. What I have formerly written in the defence of the firſt of theſe Offices, is extant among you, and as yet unanſwered, and to that I refer you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:51668:20"/>Our Diviſions have been, and will be, if continued, very prejudicial to the Truth it ſelf; and our Adverſaries know how to make uſe of them againſt us, and our Holy Profeſſion, though they cannot be Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the great Diviſions which were in the Churches in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Days, nor ſhould they be ignorant of their own; and to the end they may ſee they are no more happy in that matter than their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, let them conſider what <hi>Bernard</hi> hath written of them, as he is quoted by the Learned, in <hi>Cant.

                  <p>BEcauſe our Learned Adverſaries are wont to amuſe weak Chriſtians, by telling them <hi>they knew not the Originals,</hi> &amp;c. I thought fit to tranſcribe part of what I have formerly printed in Anſwer to this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Objection; <hi>In the Introduction of my Book of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtianity,</hi> how vain and pernicious this Talk is about the Original, will appear, when you conſider, That no man living ever ſaw the very Papers in which the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did write the firſt Draughts of the Holy Scriptures, and therefore none have the Originals, but only Copies of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And let not this offend any Man: for,</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to have been the beſt for all Chriſtians, that after many Copies are taken and ſpread in many Nations, theſe firſt Draughts ſhould not continue long; for had any now but ſo much Confidence, as to ſay they have theſe very firſt Sheets of Paper to ſhow, how might they trouble the whole World with ſuch a Report? and how might they abuſe the World, and all the Churches in the World at pleaſure? as by adding or taking away, and who ſhould correct the Original?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:51668:22"/>Suppoſe the Roman Church had thoſe Manuſcripts in their Hands, what Miſts might they caſt upon the Nations, and who could come to the ſight of them to diſcover any ſuch abuſe? and the ſame may be ſaid of any other potent Party.</p>
                  <p>But now the Originals being no where to be found, but yet a multitude of Copies extant, and the ſame tranſlated by multitudes of Men into ſeveral Languages; by this means all are forced to be more peaceable than perhaps they are willing to be, ſince they have only Copies of the Divine Oracles, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have Copies as well as they, ſo that they can none of them pretend to have ever ſeen the Original, and therefore can they leſs quarrel about their Copies. Thus hath God's Wiſdom diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed herein, better for his Church than She could have thought or deſired.</p>
                  <p>And it is worth obſervation, that ſcarce any of the Churches to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, had the Original ſent to them, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Galatians</hi>) but had only certain Copies written by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Hands. For Inſtance, <hi>The Epiſtle to the Hebrews was written by</hi> Timothy, as 'tis ſaid in the Post-Script. <hi>The Epiſtle to the Romans was written by</hi> Tertius. <hi>Four Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wrote the firſt Epiſtle to the</hi> Corinthians, Post-Script. Two Brethren wrote the <hi>Second Epiſtle,</hi> Post-Script. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicus</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus</hi> wrote that to <hi>Coloſſus.</hi> All theſe Churches had only Copies, and for ought appears, never ſaw the Originals.</p>
                  <p>And what if ſome of theſe Copies did accidentally vary ſome Word or Tittle, are the Sacred Epiſtles ever the worſe, ſo long as the Holy Doctrine therein contained, was not injured? Can we think that when the Holy Apoſtles preached, that they had ſtill the very ſelf-ſame Phraſes? This were idle to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and yet they had the ſelf-ſame Goſpel to preach in every Place.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak not this, as if I approved of altering the Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; no, not in the least <hi>iota;</hi> yet if accidentally, in Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51668:22"/>
or Printing, there ſhould be ſome ſuch Failure, I do not think that by and by that Copy were to be rejected, or the Authority of the Scriptures therefore to be called in queſtion, that men might ſet up themſelves above it. Some under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of being the Church, and others pretending the Spirit, whilſt they both reject the Church and the Spirit, as held forth in, and ſpeaking by the Holy Scriptures. A plain Instance of this, we have in the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and most <hi>Paedo-Baptiſts,</hi> who whilst they ſeem to admire <hi>General Councils, Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. they regard not the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the beſt <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> which were held by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who among other things, <hi>forbid the eating of things ſtrangled, and Blood,</hi> which the Church obſerved for ſeveral hundred of years after [for indeed <hi>they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Churches to be kept,</hi> not to be broken, <hi>Acts 16. 1, 2.</hi>] and yet without all Conſcience of theſe Decrees, they feed upon Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And on the other ſide, how ridgidly do they impoſe the Decrees of the <hi>Trent Councils,</hi> in the Caſe of Tranſubstantiation (though never heard of before it was there invented) inſomuch as they have puniſhed with the cruelest Death, ſuch as in Conſcience could not ſubſcribe unto it. God give them a better <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and more Moderation for the future.</p>
                  <p>But ye, Brethren, as you have received theſe <hi>Holy Decrees</hi> among the rest of the Heavenly Rules left unto us by the most Antient Fathers, even the Apostles of our Lord, ſo walk in them, and <hi>keep the Ordinances as they were delivered by them, who received them of the Lord.</hi> Now the Lord increaſe our Faith, that we may be able to stand fast in the Truth, and to overcome all Difficulties. So prays your Brother,</p>

                  <p>IT is now about ſix and twenty years ſince it pleaſed a Learned Papiſt to ſend ſeven Queries to the People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> in the County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which many Papers were exchanged, and in the Year 1662; ſome part of them were Printed under the Title of <hi>the Baptiſt againſt the Papiſt, or the Scripture and</hi> Rome <hi>in Contention about the Supreme Seat of Judgment in Controverſies of Religion.</hi> To which the Queriſt never replied in Print, but only ſent me a few Notes in Manuſcript; which ſeven Queries, with my ſeven Anti-queries I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex to this Epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>The Truth is, I did then, and do ſtill look upon this ſort of Chriſtian-Adverſaries (ſo I call them) to be the moſt ſubtil, as well as coherent with their Principles, keeping cloſe to their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and uſing all very much the ſame <hi>Mediums:</hi> and were the Truth with them (as in many things I am ſatisfied it is not) this very thing would be their high Commendation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51668:25"/>But miſſing the Heavenly Mark (more is the pity) they muſt needs be the more dangerous, wherein they ſtand oppoſed to the Truth, of which being very ſenſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot, as I love plain Truth, and the Souls of all Men, but indeavour as much as in me is, after a Christian ſort to undeceive (if it may be) ſome of them, and to prevent others from being deceived by them.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak not this as fearing them, but as truly loving them, as they bear the name of Chriſtians, and doubtleſs are as zealous in their way as any, tho I do verily believe they are under the greateſt miſtakes of any that prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And what I ſaid then, I ſay now, being verily perſwaded by the Scripture, and all good Principles which I could ever meet with, that they and all men [living ſoberly and quietly under the Government] ought to have at leaſt a friendly connivance under our differing ſentiments from the eſtabliſhed Form or Order of Worſhip, &amp;c.

                     <p>Now it is moſt certain, that the Opinion of the Real Preſence by <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> of Bread and Wine into the very Body and Blood of Chriſt, God-Man, doth evidently militate againſt theſe clear Truths, with the greateſt oppoſition, as will appear by theſe Conſiderations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,</p>
                     <p>1. Though the Love of God to Mankind, eſpecially to all that ſhall be ſaved, is exceeding great; yet it is certain, he never died, nor ever will SO take them into Union with himſelf, AS to <hi>Tranſubſtantiate</hi> their Bodies into the Divine Subſtance of Chriſt, and ſo make their Fleſh of the ſame Eſſence with himſelf, as he is <hi>God Bleſſed for ever.</hi>

                     <p>Thus much of the Firſt Propoſition. And for the Second;</p>
                     <p>2. It is to be conſidered, That if the very Subſtance of Bread and Wine, be really tranſubſtantiated into the Subſtance of Chriſt's Fleſh and Blood, then they do either remain that ſame Subſtance of Chriſt's Fleſh for ever, or elſe they are after ſome time either annihilated, or turned to Corruption. But to ſay either of theſe, is flatly to deny, or oppoſe expreſs Scripture, which tells us, That the <hi>Fleſh of Chriſt ſaw no Corruption, and that he continueth ever.</hi> And<note place="margin">Acts 2. 27. Heb. 7. 24.</note> for the firſt, that Bread and Wine, after the Words of Conſecration, remains for ever, of the Subſtance of Chriſt's Real Body, it is no way credible. For then the Body of Chriſt muſt have received a mighty Augmentation ſince its Aſcenſion. For,</p>
                     <p>If all the Bread which has been conſecrated for almoſt 1700 years, ſhall be ſuppoſed to be all in one place, at any time (as ſure the whole Fleſh of Chriſt's Body is ſo) it might, for Magnitude, compare with a Mountain. And if all the vaſt quantity of Wine, which hath been conſecrated for the like ſpace of time, were ſuppoſed to be collected (as ſure all the Blood of Chriſt remains in his Body, being impoſſible to be ſhed ſince he went into Heaven) it might compare with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Fountain of Water. But both theſe are ſo very abſurd, that 'tis hoped no Chriſtian will affirm them; and therefore that Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, which neceſſarily infers theſe, and many more Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, is by no means to be received.</p>

And I ask whether by ſuch reply they do not make the Real and Glorious Body of Chriſt the moſt mutable thing in Heaven and Earth, being, according to this Doctrin, ſubject to be really made, and unmade every day, and that in a thouſand places on the ſame day?</p>

                     <p>Being thus found deſtitute of all Antiquity in the firſt Age, let us hear what one of <hi>their own Chronographers</hi> tells us concerning both the beginning of Infant-Baptiſm and the <hi>want of any Evidence for Infant-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, in this Nation</hi> till more then three hundred years after Chriſt.</p>

Then</hi> Auſtin <hi>gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Synod, to the which came ſeven Biſhops of</hi> Brittains, <hi>with the wiſeſt men of the famous Abby of</hi> Bangor. <hi>But firſt they took Counſel of an Holy Man, whether they ſhould be obedient to</hi> Auſtin <hi>or not.

When the ſaid Biſhops en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the ſaid Synod,</hi> Auguſtine <hi>ſate ſtill in the Chair and removed not, wherefore they were wroth and diſdained him, and would not obey to his requeſts.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The firſt is, That you keep</hi> Eaſter <hi>Day in due Form and Time, as it is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</hi>

                     <p>From this Paſſage it is very evident, that Infant-Baptiſm came not into this Nation till about four hundred years after the Goſpel was firſt Received here; and therefore the Papiſts muſt needs fail of Antiquity here, and muſt, (if they will do us right) give place to the Baptized Believers, not only in the Caſe of Believers-Baptiſm, but alſo in reſpect of the denial of Baptiſm to Infants, ſeeing theſe ſeven Biſhops, and the wiſeſt Men of <hi>Bangor</hi> withſtood <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk, in that point then, as we withſtand the Papiſts in that point now.</p>
                     <p>And as we have ſuffered many hard things, even to the burning of our Bodies in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> for bearing witneſs to the Ancient and True Baptiſm of Chriſt, even ſo it fared very ill with thoſe that withſtood <hi>Infant-Baptiſm, &amp;c.</hi> in the Days of <hi>Auſtin;</hi> for <hi>Fabian</hi> relates how they were many hundreds of them murdered; and Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ſeems to lay the Fault upon <hi>Auſtin.</hi> I conclude with theſe two ſhort Arguments,</p>
