            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2996:24"/> repugnaunce, to their carnall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and vnderſtandynge, and yet not be moued and altered in theyr faith therwith: why ſhuld the ſame matter tolde in a vyle tale &amp; fylthy demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, moue any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now? For why ſhulde any man thinke worſe of the moſt bleſſed ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, when he ſeeth a mouſe take it, then when he heareth of a theef (as Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuilles me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre) to haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it? Or why ſhuld he myſtruſte the preſence of Chriſtes naturall body in the hoſte, beynge in the churche when the ſame is burnt, more then when he ſeeth the man inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently after he hath receyued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hoſt, dye, and wrapped vp in earth. And as for the breakynge, why haue not good men aſmoche ben offended in theyr ſenſes, in the ryght vſe and myſtery of the churche, whiche is dayly done in the maſſe, as in ſuch new tales, as the deuyll now deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,

And thus conclude I, one playne ſolucion to the matter. The churche of god teſtifieth and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth this to be the true byleef of the moſt bleſſed Sacrament of the aulter, that there is preſent the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body and bloud of our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſte. Good men in the ſame churche with theyr bodylye ſenſes haue ſeen and herde, as moch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repugnaunt to theyr ſenſes, in the myſticall and deuoute vſe of the bleſſed ſacrament, as the deuyl now telleth in ſcoffynge tales, and yet therwith reteyned ſtyl the ſame faith inuiolably, wherfore al good men ſhulde lykewiſe do the ſame

            <p>Wherevnto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſaye, that the worde (Sacramente), (as manye
<pb facs="tcp:2996:116"/> other wordes in ſpeache, haue the like) hath thre ſignifications, to oure vnderſtandynge. One moſte general, in whiche it ſignifieth any ſecrete hidden thyng, without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, whither the ſame hydden thing, be holy or no. And after that acceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is applyed to many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete matters and miſteries, both godly, &amp; natural. Another acceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſpecyal, &amp; is reſtrained to ſignifi the ſeuen ſpecial holy miſteryes in our religion, which we cal and be, the .vii. ſacramentes, vnto whiche y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name ſacrament, is in the comen ſpeache onelye applyed, whervnto this diffinitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is truely attribute, a ſacramente to be a viſible ſigne of an inuiſible grace. Another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, is in a moſt ſpecial ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſpeake of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the aulter, whych doth vs vnderſtande, a ſpecyall difference of excellencye from the other ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes,

Whereof when men be thus lerned and taughte, and the thing ſo ſet forth, truely (as it is in dede) it is then mere ſophiſtrie, to reſort, to diſputacion of the word, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with, to ouerthrowe, the truth of the thynge. After whiche ſorte they daly alſo, that make foundacion of argument to proue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bread, to remaine in the mooſte bleſſed Sacrament, bicauſe S. Paule calleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrament, breade, and yet in dede ſaynt Paul calleth it this breade, whiche importeth a ſpeciall vnderſtandinge, and to ſuche as truely beleue, the myracle of chriſtes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration, of his moſt preciouſe bodye, turnynge by the omnipotency of his myghty word the ſubſtaunce of breade, into the

And that whiche before the conſecration was commen breade, with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſubſtaunce of bread, is now by goddes ſpeciall myracle, in his ſecrete operation omnipotent, the onelye ſubſtaunce of the bodye of our ſauyoure Chriſte. And ſo maye be called with an addition wherewith to marke the miſtery, this breade. But whye ſhulde the name, trauayle vs when we rede ſo ofte in ſcripture, thinges to be named not as they be, but as they were? and the rod turned in to a ſerpent, by gods miracle, before Pharao, ſtyl to be called a rodde when it was a ſerpent,<note place="margin">Exo. 7.</note> but the rodde was conuerted by gods power into the ſerpent and ſtyll
<pb n="cxvi" facs="tcp:2996:117"/> called it a rodde, when it was not ſo. But why ſhould men be ſo ſcru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pulouſe in names? After god had ſignified to the patriarche Iacob that he ſhulde be called no more Iacob but Iſraell,<note place="margin">Gene. 32.</note> yet afterward the ſame ſcripture teſtifieth howe god ſpake to Iſrael. <hi>ad puteum iuramenti,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gene. 46.</note> and called Iacob, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob: Here if a man wolde trifle, in the ſounde of the worde, Iacob, ſhulde he not make an argumente to improue the truthe of that god had ſpoken, wherewith the deuyll myghte inueigle the preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe ignoraunt, that eſtemeth him ſelfe ſo muche, as he meaſureth al knowledge by his rude capacitie. But here thexerciſed ſenſes in lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ninge, can conſider how names be of two ſortes, ſometime they do on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye ſignifie anye litle token of the thynge, whervnto they be added, and then we may not make foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion of the name as declarynge
<pb facs="tcp:2996:118"/> hollye the thyng ſignified, or to be demed the propre name, After whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che ſorte, Chryſt was called ſynne, bycauſe he dyed for ſynne, and yet had not ſynne in hym, as the word ſhold import. And when we ſpeake thus, that Chryſte ſaueth ſynners, we ſygnify by the worde (ſynners) ſuche men as were ſynners, and be by Chryſt, waſhed, &amp; purged from ſynne, mete to be receyued to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon. For as Saynte Paule ſayth to the Epheſians, Chryſt purgeth his churche, and leaueth neyther ſpot, ne wrincle. And when we call noughtye men, chriſten men, we ſignify not by the name, what they be now in dede, for they be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyls men, and not Chryſten men, but callynge them nowe Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men, we ſignifie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were ones in the ſtate of grace, at the tyme of their baptiſme.

So Saynte Paule calleth the ſame holy ſacrament, breade, becauſe it was ſoo, before the conſecracyon, and yet ſo he calleth it, withoute
<pb n="cxviii" facs="tcp:2996:119"/> preiudice of the truth, that it is in dede, beinge not breade, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry body of Chriſt, at the time, when it is by hym neuertheleſſe called breade, As Iacob was in dede Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell by goddes fauoure, when he was after by gods mouth againe, called Iacob whych latter callinge of Iacob, dydde nothynge pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicate the truthe of gods worde vttered before.

A quantitie maye be ſo minutely deuided, that his partes be accompted nothinge &amp; yet thoſe ſame together ioyned, make the greate maſſe, and haue an eſtimation. And therfore in the dyſcuſſion of ceremonies, ſemely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and orders, the deuyl frameth
<pb n="cxlix" facs="tcp:2996:148"/> his queſtions by diuyſion, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of eche thynge alone, diſſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the reſte. As for example. Whither a ſhauen crowne maketh a preiſte? where vnto a man muſte aunſwere, as he wolde do to the queſtion of a farthinge before mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued, and ſaye, Naye. Well ꝙ the deuyll, then awaye with youre crowne, and calleth it a fleſhmarke becauſe he wyl with a nycke name deface it. Then he aſketh whether a longe gowne maketh a preiſt, of that colour or that faſhyon, &amp; then it muſt be aunſwered, Naye. And then there muſt be a ſonge made of it, with awaye with it. Then the deuyll commeth to the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in ordres geuinge, and aſketh of ceremonies ſeuerallye alone, whervnto as he diſſeuereth them, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aunſwere muſt be no, whervpon he concludeth. Ergo they be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge requiſite, After whyche
<pb facs="tcp:2996:149"/> ſorte, he ſhall alſo diuide you the ſacramentall wordes, and aſke of euery worde of them alone, And as it is graunted, how that one word doth it not, that worde is layde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, And ſo he wyll peruſe all, and by ſophiſtrye in deuiſion wipe out all, as nothinge. And in other mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters lykewiſe frame this queſtion, for example. Shall forbearinge of meates ſaue a man? The aunſwer muſt be. No. And then, Ergo eate all daye longe. Dothe watchinge bringe a man to heauen? Naye, Er<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>go ſlepe and ſpare not. Is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place cauſe why a mans praier is good? The aunſwere muſte be, Nay, And what nedeſte thou comme to chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che then, ſayth the deuyll, onles it be to heare my falſe teachynge ſet forthe.
