         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MEeting lately with a little Book publiſhed under the Name of one Mr <hi>Richard Reſbury</hi> (a Gentleman, whoſe face, to my beſt remembrance, I never ſaw, whoſe name I never heard of, until now,) in the Frontiſpiece whereof, and more eſpecially in the Epiſtle to the Reader prefixed to it, I found many hard and unchriſtian ſayings uttered, not onely againſt me (which had been more venial,) but againſt thoſe moſt bleſſed and important Truths of God, for the vindication whereof againſt the contrary Errors (being of moſt pernicious conſequence, as I have demonſtratively proved, &amp; which is indeed a thing in it ſelf ſufficiently manifeſt,) he was graciouſly pleaſed to ſtir up and arm my ſpirit, I judged my ſelf ſo far a a debtor to the honor of thoſe truths (aſſerted by me) and to mine own innocency, yea and to the intereſt of your comfort and peace alſo, as to declare briefly unto you, and to the World with you, how inconſiderately (that I ſay not, unworthily) you have vented your ſelf both againſt a perſon, who never did you, nor meant you, the leaſt harm, as likewiſe againſt thoſe manifeſt Truths of God, which ſtand ready preſt to bleſs you, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject not their bleſſing. And firſt I cannot but with bowels of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117457:3"/>
compaſſion over you, take knowledg of that ſad and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian miſdemeanor in you (which I finde alſo in the generality of thoſe, whoſe Judgments are entangled and polluted with the ſame erroneous conceits of God, his counſels and ways, with you.) As the blinde and bloody perſecuting Heathen of old, were wont to put the Chriſtians into Wolves and Bears skins, and then to ſet Maſtive dogs and other wilde beaſts upon them, to tear in pieces and devour them; ſo do you clothe with, and preſent the great Truths of God, under reproachful names, as of <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm, Pelagianiſm,</hi> and ſuch like clamorous and ſcandalous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations (of Satanical device) and then encourage your ſelves, and embolden your Conſciences, to ſtorm, and rage, and rail your pleaſures againſt them. But if that be a <hi>Gangrene of Arminian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm,</hi> which you charge me to have <hi>lately promoted,</hi> I marvel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of what conceit, or notion of hope, you ſtile your piece, <hi>Some Stop to it.</hi> If you expect your Book ſhould work after the manner of a charm, or ſpell, (as I confeſs many ſuch pieces do upon perſons of weak and light apprehenſions) you have the ſame ground to honor your Book with ſuch a title, which you have for ſuch an expectation. But if you look that it ſhould ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon the Judgments and Conſciences of men onely by that <hi>evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit,</hi> which ſhall appear in it, doubtleſs you had very ſlender grounds to think, that it ſhould give any <hi>ſtop to the Gangrene</hi> you ſpeak of. I beleeve I have far better grounds to judg that it will occaſion a further ſpreading of this <hi>Gangrene,</hi> and give no <hi>ſtop</hi> at all to it. They that are armed with Will and preoccupation, againſt the Doctrines aſſerted in my Book of Redemption, who are the onely perſons with whom your Book is like to finde approbation and applauſe, are far from the happy danger of being infected with the ſaid <hi>Gangrene:</hi> and therefore your Book is no ways medicinal unto them. <hi>The whole need not the Phyſician.</hi> A <hi>Gangrene</hi> cannot be <hi>ſtop'd,</hi> where it never comes. As for thoſe, who have conſcientiouſly enquired into, and diligently weighed the grounds of thoſe Doctrines, which you think to blaſt with an angry puff of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and have throughly taſted the ſpirit and life which reign in the Doctrines themſelvs, they are far enough out of the reach of your unhallowed Notions, or from being taken in thoſe ſnares of your ridiculous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to magnifie God, and his Grace; which you ſpread in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117457:3"/>
way of the ſimple. And for ſuch perſons, who poſſibly may be at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unſatisfied whether the Truth be on your ſide of the way, or on mine, but withall are ſeriouſly engaged (as becometh thoſe, who are reſolved not to loſe their Souls for want of looking to, in ſuch a poſture) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to follow, and, if it be poſſible, to finde out the truth, your <hi>Sermons</hi> are much more like to bring the <hi>gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene</hi> you ſpeak of, into their Judgments, then any ways to <hi>ſtop</hi> or prevent it. For doubtleſs ſuch monſtrous Principles, ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, hard, and horrid Notions and thoughts concerning God and his Grace, which are the pillars of your Tenents and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, are not like to ſway the Judgments or Conſciences of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Enquirers, unleſs it be the contrary way. Nor can I give any account unto my ſelf, why you ſhould (in your Title page) pretend any thing ſoveraign in your Book againſt the danger of infection from me, or what hath been written by me, unleſs it be this; <hi>viz.</hi> That this Book of yours having for ſome years (as you acknowledg, if not complain, in your Preface, or Epiſtle to your Reader) layn upon your hands as a drug, or dead com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, you thought by ſetting ſuch a face or gloſs upon it, to make it vendible. For as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſometimes ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> that <hi>poor Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made many rich;</hi> meaning, by occaſion of his writing againſt the Pope, and ſuch Doctrines, which were the pillars of his Throne and Kingdom, which whoſoever would undertake to oppoſe or confute, had great matters of preferment caſt upon them; ſo I perceive that my <hi>poor</hi> Writings are like occaſionally to <hi>enrich</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with credit, approbation, and applauſe from men: and that as <hi>Caleb</hi> promiſed <hi>his daughter Achſah to wife,</hi> to whoſoever <hi>ſhould ſmite Kiriath-Sepher, and take it;</hi> ſo doth that Spirit that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad amongſt thoſe that are called Miniſters of the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us (though they preach another Goſpel, in effect, and not that of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus)</hi> promiſe honor, name, and applauſe unto any man, that ſhal but offer to <hi>ſmite</hi> either my perſon, or writing with his tongue, or pen, though they ſpeak or write, neither truth, nor any thing to purpoſe, againſt either. And Mr <hi>Reſbury</hi> (it ſeems) hath harkened unto the encouragement of this Spirit, and by his Title-page hath tempted the World to beleeve, that he hath done ſome worthy thing againſt me in my Book of Redemption, whereas it cannot reaſonably be thought by any thing in his Book, that ever he look'd any argument, or line of mine, in the face. So
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117457:4"/>
far is he from anſwering any thing argued or aſſerted by me, either <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Yet not content with the ſound of his own Trumpet (in the Frontiſpiece of his Book) by which he would give the world to hope that he was preparing to battel againſt me, he, or ſome factor of his about the City, have purchaſed the lowder blaſts of two Trumpets more to make the ſame ſound, and have bought of two of our common Diurnaliſts their reſpective Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries, or Proclamarees, to call the world together to be Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of his learned valour againſt me, and my Book. Indeed in his Preface he ſupplies in moſt untrue and unchriſtian revilings of my perſon, that which in his Diſcourſe is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in weight and ſubſtance of matter for anſwer to my Book. But the Spirit I ſpake of, ſuggeſted (it ſeems) this unto him; If thou beeſt not able to grapple with his Writings, lay on load of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon his perſon: thou ſhalt have a good reward for thy labor as well in the one kind, as in the other: they ſhall proſper both alike in thy hand. But Sir, I beſeech you by the love you either bear, or pretend to bear unto the Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with what goodneſs of Conſcience, or face of ingenuity, can you ſay, that <hi>the main Truths of God concerning his Electing and Redeeming Grace (aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted,</hi> as you ſay, <hi>by you,</hi> in your Sermons) <hi>have been by the daring hand of that unhappy man Mr</hi> John Goodwin, <hi>in his wretched Treatiſe, by him called (but miſcalled) Redemption Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, been ſo highly aſſaulted;</hi> when as you neither have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, much leſs proved, nor (I have very ſufficient ground to believe) are able to prove, that ſo much as any one, no not the leaſt of theſe Truths, have been in the lighteſt manner <hi>aſſaulted</hi> by me in this <hi>Treatiſe?</hi> Sir, I truſt you will ſuffer this word of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition from him, who God knoweth, and your own Conſcience may know, is no enemy unto you, nor to your peace, nor to your honour or reputation; that ſuch cauſleſs, groundleſs, and <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> aſperſions and reproaches caſt upon your <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Brethren, as theſe, will never make your face to ſhine with any true or perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment luſtre, nor abound to your account in the great day. In term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, an <hi>unhappy man,</hi> you ſpeak truth enough in one ſence, and little enough in another. It is my <hi>unhappineſs,</hi> in point of honour and reſpects with men, not to be believed, when I ſpeak the truth; and much more, that my ſpeaking the truth ſhould prove a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtone unto ſo many, and occaſion their falling into the great

and dangerous ſins of hard ſpeaking, reviling, perſecuting with the tongue, hating, oppoſing, calumniating the Truth manifeſted unto them. In all this I am (I confeſs) an <hi>unhappy man.</hi> But the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf was in all ſuch reſpects as theſe, an <hi>unhappy man</hi> alſo, being <hi>ſet</hi> as well for the <hi>falling,</hi> as for the <hi>riſing of many in Iſrael.</hi> But that he was a ſweet <hi>ſavour unto God,</hi> as well in thoſe who <hi>periſh,</hi> as in thoſe that <hi>are ſaved</hi> by him, as well in thoſe who fall by occaſion of him, as in thoſe who riſe, he was a perſon thrice <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>bleſſed.</hi> And I ſhould deny the ſignal grace and goodneſs of God towards me, if I ſhould not judg my ſelf <hi>happy</hi> in thoſe (not a few) who have been built up by my hand in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, in the grace of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the peace and joy of their Souls; yea and in the reproaches, hard ſayings, and evil entreaties which I meet with from Mr <hi>Reſbury</hi> and others, in as much as theſe alſo work for me ſo much <hi>a better reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>a far more exceeding eternal weight of glory.</hi> In what ſence you call my Treatiſe of <hi>Redemption, wretched,</hi> I do not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. If you mean it, <hi>wretched,</hi> in reſpect of the ſad doom that hath befallen it, by falling into the hands of ſuch hard-ſpirited men as you and ſome others are, who by unjuſt clamours and reviling, ſet your ſelves to render the condition of it as calamitous and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as you can, I confeſs your epithete of <hi>wretched</hi> may ſtand: I think it is one of the wretchedeſt Treatiſes in the world (in this ſence.) But if you call it <hi>wretched,</hi> in reſpect of the matter, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive tendency and import of the Doctrine contained therein, as if this tended, or had any thing in it likely to make any perſon under Heaven <hi>wretched,</hi> or miſerable, your Epithete it ſelf is <hi>wretched</hi> (in this ſence,) becauſe it directly tends to make men miſerable and <hi>wretched,</hi> by dividing their judgments and affections from ſuch Truths, which would make them happy, were they received and ſubmitted unto by them.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſeem deſirous to pick a quarrel againſt my <hi>hand,</hi> by terming it, <hi>during;</hi> I confeſs my hand, and heart too, are very <hi>daring,</hi> venturous, and bold in aſſaulting <hi>Error,</hi> how ſtrongly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fortified by the judgments, affections, intereſts, preoccupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Authorities, credits, writings of men.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117457:5"/>
the quarrel and cauſe of the Truth. And if you count it a blemiſh, or diſparagement unto my <hi>hand,</hi> to be <hi>daring</hi> (in this kind,) it is a ſign that your own <hi>hand</hi> hath little courage for the Truth, nor that it <hi>dares</hi> lift up it ſelf in the defence of it, unleſs it hath a proud arm of fleſh to ſtand by it, and ſecond it in the engagement. But I perceive that Mr <hi>Reſburies</hi> hand it ſelf is <hi>daring</hi> enough, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the cauſe of Error, or of Truth, when he thinks he hath <hi>hands</hi> enough with him to bring him off with honour, though he be foyled.</p>
            <p>Whether in <hi>calling</hi> my Treatiſe, <hi>Redemption Redeemed,</hi> I <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> it, or no, will in due time be judged by a ſtreighter Rule then Mr <hi>Reſburies</hi> ſence or notion in the caſe, and by a far more compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judg, then He. In the mean time, you will give me leave (I truſt) to marvel a little, that you, profeſſing your ſelf ſo devoted an enemy to that, which you call <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> (though I have cauſe in abundance to judg that you little know what <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm</hi> indeed meaneth,) ſhould notwithſtanding practiſe that, which you call (though you <hi>miſcall</hi> it) the <hi>Arminian mode</hi> ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, as you do, in ſpreading a table of <hi>Imperial Dictates, in ſtead of Arguments,</hi> before your Reader. This is more like to be the <hi>mode</hi> of thoſe, who deny the lawfulneſs of the interpoſure or uſe of reaſon in matters of Religion, then theirs, who profeſs to hold nothing, to believe nothing in ſuch things, but only what they ſee or apprehend ſufficient reaſon to evince the truth in. But I fear Mr <hi>Reſbury</hi> was conſcious of this nakedneſs in himſelf, and fellows, (I mean, of <hi>dictating</hi> like Emperors, in ſtead of <hi>arguing</hi> like Teachers,) and hoped to cover it, with a covering made of a bold imputation of it to his adverſaries. For what Argument, or proof, or colour of either, doth he bring, or can he bring, to evince Truth in that charge againſt me, that in <hi>calling</hi> the Treatiſe he ſpeaks of, <hi>Redemption Redeemed, I miſcall it?</hi>

            <p>Your ſubtile inſinuation, to have your ſelf notioned like unto <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael the Arch-angel,</hi> and me unto the Devil, in this imprecatory prayer againſt me, <hi>The Lord rebuke him,</hi> I perfectly reſent. But Sir, you ſhould have done well to have conſidered, whether in caſe the <hi>Arch-angel</hi> had had to do with a man, as you have (though as vile and ſinful as you apprehend the man of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to be) and not with the <hi>Devil,</hi> whether (I ſay) it be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that he would have prayed for him, <hi>The Lord forgive thee,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:117457:5"/>
and not, <hi>the Lord rebuke thee,</hi> until his obſtinacy had appeared. However, if I have ſo deeply finned, as you deem and doom me to have done, in judging me worthy to drink of the Devils cup after him, I ſhall joyn iſſue with you in the words of your prayer againſt me, and pray with you, <hi>The Lord rebuke me,</hi> only with <hi>Davids</hi> addition, <hi>not in his anger.</hi> Mr <hi>Reſbury</hi> (I fear) is impatient of all <hi>rebuke,</hi> for his Errors, either from God, or man, though admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred with never ſo much love and ſweetneſs, by the one and the other. The ground of my fear in this kind, is, becauſe I find that the bare pleading of the Truth, which contradicteth his Error, though without any reflexion in the leaſt upon him, as holding any Error, becomes matter of very high and haynous provocation to him.</p>
            <p>And Sir, give me leave to doubt whether you had the conſent of your Conſcience, or no, in drawing up this charge againſt me, that <hi>for the preſent I ſo ſeriouſly despiſe, and ſo boldly bid defiance unto the peculiar Grace</hi> of God. <hi>Michael the Archangel durſt not bring any railing,</hi> much leſs any forged or falſe, <hi>accuſation</hi> againſt <hi>Satan</hi> himſelf, when he contended with him. If he had done this, he had fought againſt him with no better weapons, then thoſe which Satan himſelf uſeth in his battels: he had plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diabolized. It is a thing of moſt deplorable conſideration unto me, that thoſe who call themſelves Miniſters of the Goſpel, and are ſo reputed by others, ſhould ſo far harden themſelves from the fear of the Lord, as to ſpeak and ſpread abroad at pleaſure, words of an infamous and diſparaging import againſt their Brethren, (who never gave them the leaſt cauſe of offence, whatſoever was taken by them,) and this without ſo much as any colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pretence of truth in them. For Sir, I beſeech you, what ſentence, clauſe, word, ſillable, letter, tittle, can you, or any other for you, find either in my Book of Redemption, or any other of my Writings, wherein I make the leaſt ſemblance, or give the lighteſt intimation that can be imagined, that I at all, much leſs <hi>ſo ſeriouſly</hi> (as your charge advanceth) <hi>despiſe the peculiar Grace</hi> of God? And yet the unchriſtian rage of your pen riſeth much higher, and proclaims, that I alſo <hi>boldly bid defiance to it.</hi> Well might the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> complain, that <hi>the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity.</hi> I, eſpecially in my Treatiſe of <hi>Redemption,</hi> am ſo far from <hi>despiſing the peculiar Grace</hi> of God, or from any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117457:6"/>
               <hi>bold bidding defiance to it,</hi> that I magnifie it upon all occaſions with all my might; and demonſtrate the <hi>peculiarity, i. e.</hi> the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal excellency and glory of it, to conſiſt in this, that it encompaſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole world about, and <hi>particularly</hi> viſiteth and addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf to every creature of mankind (until it be rejected,) and this in order to their Salvation. So that I make the Grace of God, which is ſaving in the nature and tendency of it, never the leſs, but rather the more <hi>peculiar,</hi> by commending the rich diffuſiveneſs of it to particular men. As for that Grace of God, or rather that degree, or that operation of this Grace, which is actually and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſaving unto men, I <hi>peculiarize</hi> it every whit as much, and (for ought I yet know to the contrary) upon the ſame terms, which Mr <hi>Reſbury</hi> himſelf, and men of his Judgment generally do. For my ſence and Judgment clearly is, that no perſon is actually ſaved, but by ſuch an aſſiſtance or operation of the Grace of God, which no other perſon whatſoever partaketh of, or which is vouchſafed unto no other perſon, but only unto thoſe, who are actually ſaved alſo. Only herein I may (I conceive) poſſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them: They hold, that this <hi>peculiar</hi> actually-ſaving grace of God is upon ſuch terms decreed by God, or intended to to be given by God, unto thoſe that come to be ſaved by it, that there was, or is, an abſolute neceſſity for them to embrace it, and ſo to be ſaved by it; whereas my ſence is, that ſuch <hi>grace</hi> is no otherwiſe decreed by God unto thoſe, who in time come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and <hi>in fine</hi> to be actually ſaved by it, then it is unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who never come to receive it; and that theſe might have received it, or come to be partakers of it, in the ſame way, and by the ſame means, by which thoſe others, who are in concluſion ſaved by it, came to have part and fellowſhip in it. But this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Mr <hi>Reſbury</hi> and me, about the <hi>peculiar Grace</hi> of God, doth no whit more prove me to be a <hi>ſerious despiſer of it,</hi> or a <hi>bold bidder of defiance to it,</hi> then himſelf. Therefore his charge againſt me in this point is meerly clamorous and aſperſive, and ſuch as a tender Conſcience would have trembled ſo much as to demur upon; and how much more to have publiſhed?</p>
            <p>Of a like ſtaring and broad-fac'd untruth is that charge alſo, that <hi>I challenge an whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity.</hi> His <hi>ingenuous</hi> and <hi>modeſt</hi> words are theſe: <hi>Neither hath he, for ought I can (and without partiality) diſcern</hi> (I know not how you ſhould, in caſe you never

Nor is there any one line throughout this whole Epiſtle, that, as far as I can imagine, hath ſo much as the ſofteſt ayr, or gentleſt breathing of a <hi>challenge</hi> in it. And yet you not content to have traduced me, as <hi>a Challenger of an whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi> add drunkenneſs to thirſt, ironically, and with the open breach of all the Laws of Ingenuity, (that I ſay not of Piety it ſelf,) inſult over me (that I ſay not over the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> indeed,) in theſe words (immediately ſubjoyned,) <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuch modeſty and ingenuity muſt needs be the Character of the Spirit of Truth in him.</hi> Sir, the worſt I wiſh you (and there is no harm, I am certain, in the wiſh) is, that ſome better and more pregnant <hi>character of the Spirit of Truth</hi> were diſcernable in you, then appears either in your <hi>Stop,</hi> or in your Epiſtle prefixed to it. Upon this occaſion, I ſhall crave leave to inform you, that other manner of <hi>characters of the Spirit of Truth,</hi> and of a far more gracious import, were found (and this in the Judgment, and by the Confeſſion of ſome of his Enemies) in my <hi>Great Maſter Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> (as you, who, it ſeems, claim your tongue, and pen, for your

For how can I reaſonably conceive, that you intending to publiſh a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for the <hi>ſtopping</hi> of an erroneous Doctrine (erroneouſly ſo called) maintained in a printed Book, ſhould not ſo much as draw blood of this evil beaſt with one pointed Argument, in caſe you had come within the reach or ſight of it; though you had left the other Huntſmen you ſpeak of to have followed the chaſe, and done the plenary execution? Upon which account likewiſe I cannot praiſe your ſaying, that <hi>though your Treatiſe be no Anſwer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected</hi>

            <p>But whereas you ſay, <hi>I now thank Mr Goodwin, whoſe dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c.</hi> it ſeems you trade much in ironies, and jeers, having a little before informed your Reader (in the ſame figure) that my <hi>modeſty and ingenuity muſt needs be the character of the Spirit of Truth in me.</hi> Mr <hi>Reſbury,</hi> as our Saviour admoniſheth men not to <hi>judg, leſt they be judged:</hi> ſo I fear you will firſt or laſt meet with thoſe, that will execute <hi>legem talionis</hi> upon you, that will <gap reason="foreign">

Nor do I mention or make uſe of Authors upon any ſuch account, as if the Doctrine I teach, were not able, without having any thing at all added unto it by men, to commend it ſelf with ſufficient evidence and power unto the Judgments and Conſciences of all conſidering men, and truly deſirous of the knowledg of the Truth: but partly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that ſtone, or ſtraw rather, of offence, (at which people of effeminate and weak apprehenſions are ſo apt to ſtumble,) <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſaid Doctrine wanteth an arm of fleſh to ſtand by it, was never held by orthodox or pious men: partly alſo to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that the greateſt Oppoſers of this Doctrine were not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with themſelves in their oppoſition to it, but that ever and anon they fluctuated in their Judgments about it, yea and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pulled down with one hand, what they had built up with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117457:9"/>
the other. This is a thing ſo manifeſt to thoſe, that with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and obſervation are any thing converſant in their writings, that to deny it, is (in effect) to deny that the Sun is up at noon day. Therefore for him to <hi>wreſt quotations,</hi> or pervert the ſayings of men, who hath no more need either of men, or their ſayings, then I, or the Doctrine aſſerted by me have, is to ſacrifice both his precious Name, and more precious Conſcience, upon the ſervice a nut-ſhell, or thing of nought. There was more wiſdom then ſo, though not much honeſty, in that ſaying of the Heathen: <hi>Si jus violandum eſt, regnandi gratia violandum eſt:</hi> i. e.
<q>
                  <l>Juſtice too ſacred is to harm,</l>
                  <l>Unleſs a Kingdom be the charm.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor am I at all edified by your reproof for my <hi>uncouth Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</hi> I make little uſe of any kinde of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> in the Book you wote of: nor can I imagine unto what paſſage throughout the whole Book this ſtigm relateth. My whole Eſtate in <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> is not (I confeſs) very great. That <hi>modicum</hi> which I have, is generally of the ordinary and beſt-known ſtamp: nor have I, to my knowledg, ſo much as any one <hi>uncouth,</hi> affectate, or ſequeſtred notion in my whole Syſteme. If you were as chaſte from the pollutions of <hi>uncouth Divinity,</hi> as I am of <hi>uncouth Philoſophy,</hi> the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> would take more pleaſure in you, then now (I fear) he doth. But (it ſeems) you wanted two words to make a new ſlander: and he that ſtood inviſibly at your right hand, and of whom you were not ſufficiently aware, bad you put in, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth Philoſophy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I perceive you do not think that you have yet layd on a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent load of calumny and reproach; and therefore you reſolve to adventure oneſheaf more of the ſame grain upon your cart, heavier then all the reſt. You arraign me for a miſdemeanor, which you call, <hi>Conſequential Blasphemy.</hi> I want your heifer to plough with, to finde out your riddle of <hi>conſequential Blasphemy.</hi> What may we call the oppoſite ſpecies of <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> contradiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that which you term, <hi>Conſequential?</hi> Or by charging me with <hi>conſequential Blasphemy,</hi> do you mean, that I hold or reach ſuch Poſitions or Doctrines, the direct <hi>conſequences</hi> whereof are <hi>blasphemous?</hi> This is the faireſt and beſt ſence that (as far as my ſhort underſtanding is able to reach) your words will bear. But Sir, if the Doctrine or Principle it ſelf be not <hi>blasphemous,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117457:9"/>
it is that any legitimate <hi>Conſequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>e,</hi> or Poſition dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible from it, ſhould be ſuch. <hi>If the firſt fruit be holy</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the lump is alſo holy: and if the root be holy, ſo are the branches.</hi> And your Logique Maxim is:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ex veris poſſit nil, niſi vera, ſequi:</hi> i. e.</l>
                  <l>From Truth, nothing, but truths themſelves, will follow.</l>
               </q>
Therefore if there be any thing <hi>blasphemous</hi> in my Book, you ſhould rather have charged it upon my Principles, or fundamental Doctrines, then upon any thing <hi>conſequentially</hi> deducible from them. Or if by the <hi>conſequential Blasphemies</hi> you ſpeak of, you mean your own ſpurious <hi>conſequences</hi> begotten rape-wiſe, either by your ignorance, or paſſion, or ſome worſe ſpirit then either, upon my innocent premiſſes, and call theſe <hi>blasphemous,</hi> it is a clear caſe, that the baſtards are yours, and only layd by you (after the manner of thoſe that are loath to own, or keep their own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) at my door. Onely you ſhould have done well to have given your Reader a taſt of that which you call <hi>conſequential blaſphemy,</hi> out of the book it ſelf, that ſo he might have underſtood your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this particular of your Charge. But as <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife out of a ſpirit of Anger and Revenge, accuſed her chaſte and loyal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Joſeph</hi> of incontinency unto his Lord, becauſe he rejected and abhorred her unchaſte and diſloyal motions: ſo (I fear) you accuſe me of <hi>Blasphemy</hi> (whether <hi>conſequential,</hi> or by what name or title ſoever called or diſtinguiſhed) unto the world, out of a ſpirit of indignation, becauſe I will not ſay a <hi>confederacy,</hi> where you, and men of your Principles, ſay a <hi>confederacy,</hi> againſt the honor, mercy, goodneſs, juſtice, truth, and other the glorious Attributes of God, but have ſet my ſelf, and endevored with all loyalty and faithfulneſs unto my God (whom with my whole heart and Soul I love, reverence, and honor) to detect thoſe Doctrines and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> wherewith the Judgments and Conſciences of ſo many thouſands have been bewitched and abuſed; as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117457:10"/>
evinced that Doctrine of Reprobation maintained by him, and his party (which is the ſame with yours) to contain this <hi>Blasphemy</hi> in it, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>God ſhould Reprobate himſelf,</hi> he replyed unto me (in the hearing of thouſands there preſent) <hi>Sir, I pray ſpeak more reverently of God.</hi> By which words he ſought to inſinuate into the Auditory, that I had ſpoke irreverently or <hi>blasphemouſly</hi> of God, when as I onely detected and brought to light before the people that horrid <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> which was bound up in a bundle at the heart of his and your Opinion, againſt which I then diſputed.</p>
            <p>Sir, you ſay (though untruly, as is before proved) <hi>I challenge an whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity to remove me:</hi> I will not <hi>challenge</hi> you, but modeſtly and humbly entreat and deſire you (and if you pleaſe, you may take ten Univerſities to your aſſiſtance) that you will pleaſe to ſhew me (onely I deſire withall that you will not ſhew me darkneſs in ſtead of a viſion, or that which is not, under the name of that which is) but that you will pleaſe to ſhew me, any one ſpot of my <hi>darkneſs,</hi> any one ſtrain, either of any unſeemly <hi>boldneſs,</hi> or of any <hi>uncouth Philoſophy,</hi> or of any <hi>Blasphemy</hi> (whether <hi>conſequential,</hi> or of what kinde ſoever) any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, either of my <hi>imperial dictating in ſtead of arguing,</hi> or of any <hi>monſtrous Concluſion,</hi> or of a <hi>wreſted quotation,</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my whole Book. If you be able, and ſhall pleaſe chriſtianly and friendly to ſhew me any of theſe, it will be <hi>an excellent oyl, that ſhall not break my head;</hi> you ſhall finde me <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, eaſie to be entreated, tractable both to matter of acknowledgment, and amendment of what is amiſs. But if you be not able to make good, upon a fair and reaſonable account, all, or any the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, wherein you have rendered me to the world a man of guilt, and much unworthineſs, I truſt you will make haſte to the golden Altar of Repentance, and lay hold upon the horns hereof for the ſafety both of your conſcience and reputation: and will not count it any great thing to repair, what you have demoliſhed and pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down.</p>
            <p>One thing (before I cloze) I deſire calmly to know of you: why, or upon what account, you term the Doctrine, maintained by me in my Treatiſe of Redemption, by the name of <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm.</hi> If it be ſimply becauſe the ſaid Doctrine was (as you ſuppoſe) held and maintained by <hi>Arminius,</hi> 1. I muſt crave leave to inform you, that unleſs the good figure <hi>Synecdoche</hi> makes peace
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117457:10"/>
between ſuch your ſuppoſition, and the Truth, they will never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: For the Doctrine here taught by me was onely in part held by <hi>Arminius:</hi> the main foundations on which I build, you will not finde layd by him. 2. Were it granted, that what I teach in that Book, was (for ſubſtance of matter) nothing but what is to be found in his Writings; yet what reaſon is there why that which I teach in common with <hi>Arminius,</hi> ſhould be termed, <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> when you teach twenty times more upon the ſame, terms (I mean, in common with <hi>Arminius)</hi> and yet would be judged the freeſt man in the World from <hi>Arminianiſm?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you charge me with <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> becauſe the Doctrine which I maintain, was held by <hi>Arminius</hi> with oppoſition or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to the Truth; 1. Whether this be a truth, or no, <hi>adhuc ſub judice lis eſt,</hi> is a caſe yet depending in the Court of Equity: and I beleeve before many years ſhall have paſſed over the head of the world, all competent Judges will paſs ſentence againſt you in the Point. 2. In caſe it were true, that <hi>Arminius</hi> did indeed main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Doctrine in oppoſition to the Truth, about which I make one in Judgment with him, yet why ſhould my Doctrine be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther termed <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> then either <hi>Calviniſm, Muſculiſm, Martyriſm,</hi> or the like, conſidering that <hi>Calvin, Muſculus,</hi> and others (reputed Orthodox) did aſſert over and over, and this in terms every whit as ſignificant and expreſs, as any found in <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> the very ſelf-ſame Doctrine, as I fully, and above all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie and contradiction, prove by many Teſtimonies cited from the Writings of theſe men, in my ſaid Treatiſe of Redemption. If you here plead, that theſe Authors elſewhere in their Writings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their Judgments in oppoſition to this Doctrine; 1. I make little queſtion but that this may with as much truth be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelf. 2. If thoſe other Authors declare ſometimes for the ſaid Doctrine, and otherwhile againſt it, why ſhould he, who teacheth contrary to what they deliver in one place, be traduced as an Oppoſer of their Doctrine, rather then he, who teacheth contrary to what they teach and deliver in another? Sir, I fear that when the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (both yours, and mine) ſhall come to umpire between you, and me, your aſperſing his Truth with infamous and ignominious terms will turn to no good account unto you.</p>
            <p>Concerning your Treatiſe, or Sermons, if there be any thing in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117457:11"/>
them more material or weighty, then what your Great Makers at the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> have upon the ſame account, which you ſtand up to juſtifie, afforded us in their Synodical Writings, it ſhall (God willing) be taken into conſideration in due time. But I beleeve that when the Oaks of <hi>Baſhan</hi> ſhall be hewn down and fall, the ſhrubs and under-wood will be broken and beaten down to the ground under them: and that when the horſemen are put to rout, the infantry will throw down their arms, and quit the field. As for your Decree of Abſolute Reprobation, when you ſeek for it in the nineth to the <hi>Romans,</hi> you dig in a wrong field to find any ſuch treaſure: and the truth is, that you will, or may, as ſoon diſcover the Element of fire at the bottom of the Sea, as ſuch a Reprobation as you dream of, in that Chapter, or indeed in any other quarter or paſſage of the Scriptures. Yea your ſelf in this very Epiſtle, making your <hi>Elect ones, through weakneſs of Judgment, and unskilfulneſs in the myſtery of Chriſt, liable to be ſeduced by a Spirit of Error,</hi> do little leſs (if not every whit as much) then ſhake the foundations of your <hi>Abſolute Reprobation.</hi> If you ſpeak of ſuch a <hi>liableneſs to ſeduction,</hi> which endangereth not the Salvation of the <hi>ſeduced,</hi> your zealous ſolicitouſneſs for the ſuppreſſion of Error, is to little purpoſe, at leaſt in reference to ſuch perſons. For men, whether <hi>Elect</hi> (in your notion) or not Elect, will be always <hi>liable</hi> to be thus far (at leaſt) <hi>ſeduced,</hi> were all the <hi>Errors</hi> at preſent on foot in the world, never ſo throughly ſuppreſſed. Beſides, according to your principles, all the ſins which your <hi>Elect</hi> ſhall at any time commit, or fall into, ſhall work for good unto them, and not only be forgiven immediately upon the Commiſſion. Therefore your care of preventing their <hi>ſeduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> being truly interpreted, is only a care to keep them from that, which would turn to a certain benefit or advantage unto them, in caſe they were not kept from it. If you ſpeak of a <hi>liable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to ſuch a <hi>ſeduction,</hi> which may poſſibly end in the deſtruction of the <hi>ſeduced,</hi> then you clearly ſuppoſe a poſſibility of the periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your <hi>Elect ones:</hi> and if your Election ſtaggers, or waves, how can your <hi>Reprobation</hi> ſtand faſt? How impertinently you cite, and apply to your purpoſe, thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>The foundation of God ſtands ſure,</hi> but that I am unworthy to teach, you might have learned from the 359. and 360. Pages of my Book of Redemption. But I ſhall (I truſt) ere long, interruptory occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117457:11"/>
not too numerouſly or importunely thronging me, vindicate the innocency of that nineth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> from the ſcandalous imputation of holding correſpondency with ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and horrid a Doctrine, as that which Mr <hi>Reſbury,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, (led aſide out of the way of Truth by the ſame ſpirit of Error and deluſion,) teach under the notion and name of, <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Reprobation.</hi> In the mean time, hoping that for the future you will be more Chriſtianly tender of the Names and Reputations of your Brethren, at leaſt until you know more evil by them, and this upon better terms, then (I am certain) you yet know, or can know, any by me, or (I truſt) ever ſhall know, I take my leave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching the God of all Grace, with all fervency and effectualneſs of prayer and ſupplication, that he will vouchſafe to make both your anointing and mine, with the Spirit of Revelation, much more rich and full, then hitherto it hath been, that we may be more able to give the light of the knowledg of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, unto men.</p>
