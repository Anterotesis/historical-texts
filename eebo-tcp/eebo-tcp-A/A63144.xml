            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To this he hath Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not Guilty; and we are to prove it upon him, by the Kings Evidence, whom we are now to call.</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment read and opened, you will preſently have it fully proved, and highly aggravated by our Evidence, for Gentlemen, we ſhall prove that the Priſoner at the Bar, is not only a Popiſh-Prieſt, but a Jeſuite, and this by his own Confeſſion; and that his Name was inſerted in Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> Warrant, when he came down into this Country to ſearch for Jeſuites. That he has held a ſecret and dangerous Correſpondence with <hi>Harcourt, Ireland,</hi> and other Popiſh Traytors. That he has been their Procurator, and disburſt and received great ſums of money for them.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, the Priſoner hath been a perſon high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45247:5"/>
ſuſpected, as well as dangerous to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſome years, for Treaſonable matters of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Nature, than he ſtands Indicted of, have been depoſed againſt him upon Oath at the Council Board and thereupon a ſtrict Warrant to Apprehend him was directed to Mr. <hi>Gilbert,</hi> (a worthy Gentleman and Juſtice of Peace of this County) Mr. <hi>Gilbert</hi> Gentlemen, will preſently tell you the manner of his taking him in an obſcure place in the Roof of one Mr. <hi>Powtrels</hi> Houſe at <hi>Weſt-Hallam,</hi> in this County: but here I muſt beg leave to digreſs, for I cannot but take notice of the malicious temper and baſe Practices of this ſort of Men, for though Mr. <hi>Gilbert</hi> acted by vertue of a VVarrant from the Lords of the Council, and has ſince received an approbation from his Majeſty of what he did, under the hand of a Secretary of State, yet could not thoſe people forbear to raiſe falſe and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Reports of, and make falſe Accuſations againſt him, upon this very account; but what is it they will not do to diſcourage Proteſtant Magiſtrates from doing their Duty againſt them? I confeſs nothing is to be wondered at, ſince the barbarous Murder of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury-Godfrey.</hi> But to proceed, Gentlemen, we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo prove to you that the Priſoner is ſo little a friend even to the Civil-Government of this Nation, that he would not ſuffer his Nephew Mr. <hi>Powtrel</hi> to take ſo much as the Oath of Allegiance, which is ſcrupled on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Jeſuites, for I think their ſecular Prieſts will generally take it. Gentlemen, the things I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy opened, are matters of high Aggravation, and come in by way of Indictment. But that which in this caſe we rely upon is this, that the Priſoner has Baptized, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, Confeſt, and abſolved in the Popiſh way, that he has given the Sacrament, and ſaid Maſs very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Popiſh Veſtments, and for proof of this we have a Cloud of VVitneſſes.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you hear the Priſoner is Indicted upon a Statute made in the 27th <hi>Eliz.</hi> which makes it Treaſon for any Subject born to take Orders from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and afterwards to remain in <hi>England,</hi> which Law I conceive was not only made for the ſecurity of the Government, but alſo in favour of the Lay-Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for though ſeveral Statutes were made to keep them within the bounds of their Allegiance and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Government from their Villanous Deſignes;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45247:5"/>
yet it was experimentally found true, that no Dangers or Penalties whatſoever, could deter or hinder them from Plotting againſt the State, in order to bring us back again to the ſlavery of <hi>Rome</hi>: whilſt thoſe jugling managers of their conſciences were ſuffered to come amongſt us. and therefore I may well call this ſtatute upon which the Priſoner ſtands indicted, an Act of Charity, to the common Papiſts, for it was made to prevent the dangers, they would otherwiſe run themſelves into, as well as the Nation, 'Tis true indeed, Gentlemen, that the lively executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Law has (by the Clemency of our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and good nature of the Goverenment) been many times ſuſpended, and might yet have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the ſhade, had not the popiſh prieſts and Jeſuits rouſed up this ſleeping Lyon againſt themſelves by a damnable &amp; helliſh plot againſt his Majeſties life, the true Religion and well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed Government of this Nation, the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which has been confirmed to us, not only by the unanſwerable evidence of <hi>Colemans</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and other loyal proofs, but alſo by frequent Proclamations, and the Uniform votes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of ſeveral Parliaments: I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very well borrow the words of a great Man upon the like occaſion, and ſay that at this Time of the Day its much better to be rid of one Prieſt than many Fellons: And therefore Gentlemen, if our Evidence ſhall make good the Indictment, I hope you will do your King, your Country and your ſelves the right to find the Priſoner Guilty.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I dwell within two miles of Mr. <hi>Powtrells</hi> houſe at <hi>Weſt Hallam</hi> the place where the Priſoner was taken, and have heard that he hath been a prieſt in that Family ſix or ſeven years, though I did never know him perſonally, nor to the beſt of my knowledge ever ſaw him till I apprehended him, which was the ſixteenth of <hi>March</hi> laſt, the very day on which the Judges went out of <hi>Derby</hi> the laſt Lent Aſſizes; the firſt enquiry I made after him was occaſioned by a Letter and a Meſſenger from Sir <hi>Simon Degg</hi> about <hi>November</hi> 1678, at which time I ſent a Warrant to the Conſtable of <hi>West-Hallam</hi> to ſearch for the ſaid <hi>George Busby,</hi> but he could not then be found, at that time it was reported that he was a Jeſuit and concerned in the plot, which I had reaſon to believe, becauſe when Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> came to ſearch Mr. <hi>Powtrells</hi> houſe for ſome Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits the <hi>January</hi> following, by Order from the Lords of the Council (in which ſervice he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to attend him) we perceived Mrs. <hi>Powtrel</hi> (who is <hi>Bu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>However the Government had a jealous eye on this <hi>Busby,</hi> above two years ago, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by a Warrant from the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which warrant I have ready and humbly pray your Lordſhip it may be read openly in Court.</p>

And on <hi>Sunday</hi> Afternoon I ſent to Mr. <hi>John Bagnall</hi> of <hi>Derby,</hi> who was then Under ſheriff, requiring him to meet me early on <hi>Munday</hi> the 24<hi>th.</hi> at Mr. <hi>Powtrells</hi> houſe at <hi>Weſt-Hallam</hi> about ſome earneſt buſineſs lately ſent down from the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Council, wherewith I would acquaint him
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45247:7"/>
at our Meeting. as ſoon as he came I ſhewed him the Warrant, after which we ſearched very diligently in every place we could ſee, but could not find him; though afterwards I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he was in the Houſe at that time alſo.</p>
                  <p>About <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1679. Mr. <hi>Powtrel</hi> obtained a Licence from his Majeſty to Travel beyond-Sea, and it was confidently reported by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that this Mr. <hi>Busby</hi> was gone over too, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that when Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe parts in <hi>January</hi> 1679. with Warrants to ſearch for Jeſuites (In one whereof I ſaw <hi>Busbys</hi> Name) and would have ſearched at <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam.</hi> I diſſwaded him, and did aſſure him I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he was gone beyond-ſea, and tould him how often I had ſearched for him in vain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> diverted to another place, though I have been informed ſince, that <hi>Busby</hi> was never out of <hi>England,</hi> ſince the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Plot.</p>
                  <p>But about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, and ſince, I haveing had notice that <hi>Busby</hi> was in <hi>England,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at <hi>Weſt-Hallam,</hi> and had been ſeen laſt Corn-Harveſt to walk in Mr. <hi>Powtrels</hi> Garden with one <hi>Ann Smally</hi> a Widdow. I thought it my Duty to make ſome further enquiry after him, which I did on the firſt day of <hi>March</hi> laſt, and came to the Houſe to buy ſome Wood for my Cole-pits, and then brought five or ſix per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with me, and ſent for the Conſtable to help me to ſearch for him, which we did moſt part of the Afternoon, but could not find him, though he was ſeen to be walking in the Garden with the ſaid <hi>Ann Smally</hi> when I came firſt into the Houſe, as I was afterwards informed, but when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45247:7"/>
I asked the ſaid <hi>Ann Smally</hi> for him, ſhe affirmed with many Proteſtations, that he was in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and not in <hi>England,</hi> and that if I had any buſineſs with him, I muſt go beyond-Sea to him, for ſhe had not ſeen him for above two years; though ſhe had helped to convey him out of the Garden into his hiding-hole, but a few Minutes before: However, I proceeded in my ſearch, and found in the Chamber where <hi>Busby</hi> Lodged, a <hi>Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-Damask</hi> Veſtment, wherein was packed up a Stole &amp; Maniple of the ſame (as the Papiſt call them) an Alter Stone, Surplice, and a Box of VVaffers Maſs-Books, and divers other Popiſh things, then I told Miſtreſs <hi>Braylsford</hi> (a kinswoman of Mr. <hi>Powtrels</hi>) and the ſaid <hi>Ann Smally,</hi> thoſe things did ſignify that a Prieſt belonged to the Houſe, for the Book had lately been uſed, as was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by the String which was put betwixt two Leaves whereof <hi>Feſta Februarij</hi> was on the one ſide, and <hi>Feſta Martij</hi> was on the other ſide, but they ſtifly affirmed that no Prieſt had been there of above two years before, and Jeared me when I could not find him, and ſaid if there was a Prieſt in the Houſe, why did not I take him?</p>
                  <p>VVhen I had done ſearching and could not find him, I took away the Veſtment, and other things which I brought to the Aſſizes a Fortnight after, and did ask Mr. Juſtice <hi>Charlton</hi> (who came that Circuit) his opinion what I ſhould do with them; he told me they muſt be burnt according to Law; I intreated his favour, that I might ſend them again to the ſame place, for two or three days to make the Prieſt more confident, that I might better Apprehend him: he told me he could give no ſuch permiſſion, but inſiſted, that they ought to be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>VVhen all the buſineſs was done at the Aſſizes on the Crown ſide, (where I was obliged to attend) on <hi>March</hi> the 15th day at Night, I went to the Judge again, and craved his Lordſhips Pardon for preſuming to ſend back the Popiſh things contrary to his Opinion, but acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that I intended to go after them to <hi>Weſt-Hallam</hi> that Night, and if I could not catch the Prieſt, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bring the ſame things again; and after I had asked his Lordſhip ſome Queſtions, and received his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I came to my own houſe, and went about eleven
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45247:8"/>
of the Clock at night (with ſome Company to aſſiſt me) to <hi>Hallam,</hi> and ſet two Men to Watch in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and one in the Church-yard (joyning to another ſide of the Houſe,) to ſee if they could ſpye any Light, or hear any Walking, in the Lofts or falſe Floores, when I made a noiſe on the other ſide of the Houſe. I ſent a Man before to call up the Conſtable, and when he and two or three more came, I knockt at Miſtriſs <hi>Ann Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's</hi> Window, about twelve of the Clock in the Night, and ſaid aloud, <hi>Miſtriſs</hi> Smally, <hi>open the Doors, I am come to ſearch for a Popiſh Prieſt</hi>; She ſtarted up, and ſaid, <hi>Who was there?</hi> I told her, <hi>It was I, ſhe knew me well enough, I dwelt at</hi> Lockco. Then I ſtaid a pretty ſpace of Time, and called aloud to her again, and ſpoke the like Words, but by that time, I ſuppoſe ſhe and her Bedfellow Miſtriſs <hi>Braylsford,</hi> were gone to give the Prieſt Notice, and to help him to his hiding hole, for no body anſwered me; then after a pretty ſpace, I called to her a third time, <hi>And required her in the Kings Name to open the Doors, for I was come to ſearch for</hi> Busby <hi>the</hi> Jeſuite, <hi>who was a Traytor by Law, and if ſhe would not open the Doors, I would cauſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable to force them open</hi>; and when I could have no Anſwer from her, I went to <hi>Joſeph Dudleys</hi> Chamber Window, and called there, Charging him in the Kings Name to open the Doors, but no Anſwer at all was returned, for he alſo was gone into the Prieſts Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and found <hi>Ann Smalley</hi> buſy in helping <hi>Buſby</hi> to ſecure himſelf, as the ſaid <hi>Joſeph Dudley</hi> did afterwards inform me.</p>
                  <p>After I had ſtayed about a quarter of an hour, I commanded the Conſtable in the Kings Name to break the Doors open, which was done; and when we came into the Prieſts Chamber I found the Fire had been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguiſhed, the counterpain and the Blankets laid in confuſed heaps on the Bed, and ſome part of them warm and ſome part cold: the upper part of the Feather-Bed was cold, which I wondered at, then I put my Hand underneath and the Bed was warm; for they had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. I looked for the Pillow, Sheets, Cap, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>Ann Smally</hi> (as I was afterwards informed) had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them into the Chamber where ſhe lay. I asked her divers Queſtions about the perſon, that had layn in that Bed that Night, and particularly, VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it was not <hi>Busby?</hi> She told me, No body
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45247:8"/>
had layn in that Bed that Night, I told her I was ſure ſome perſon had layn there, for the Feather-Bed was warm on the under ſide: She took many Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, That no body had layn thereof divers Nights before: I replyed, if ſhe would diſcover the perſon who had layn there, it would ſave her and me much trouble: But when all I could ſay, would not prevaile, I told her, I muſt ſearch, for I was confident, That <hi>Busby</hi> was in the Houſe, becauſe ſhe would not declare who it was that lay there.</p>
                  <p>I began to ſearch about one of the Clock, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till after ten next Morning before I could find Him: and though the Watchers in the Garden, told me, They heard his Paces and Steps very plainly amongſt the Lofts and falſe Floores, and deſcribed on the out-ſide of the Houſe the place where they laſt heard him, within the ſpace of nine and ten Foot where he was hid: yet were we almoſt ſo many hours before we could find him.</p>
                  <p>At laſt when the Searchers were almoſt all tyred, <hi>Ann Smally,</hi> and others of the Family Scoſſed at us, and asked, <hi>What have you not found him yet, you ſaid there was a Prieſt in the Houſe, why do you not find him then? Why do you not take him?</hi> I ſaid, <hi>All in good time, I was reſolved to find him, or ſtarve him out:</hi> Nay, the Foot-boy of the Houſe, ſeeing my Servant look within the Kitchin Chimney, where there hung a Port-Mantua, ſaid Jeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Man, <hi>Look if he be not in the Port-Mantua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After thoſe perſons had pleaſed themſelves a good while with Mocking us for our diſappointment, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded two or three of the Searchers once again to Climb upon the Lofts (which I could not do my ſelf, by reaſon of a Lameneſs in my Shoulder,) and to look well near the place where <hi>Busby</hi>'s laſt ſteps were heard. VVhich when they had done ſome while and found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I took my Sword and Scabbard, (being in the Rooms underneath) and Knocked on the Plaſter-floores over my Head, and cauſed them to Anſwer me with the like Knocking as near the ſame place as they could, and when we had examined the Floores, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I Knocked near unto a Stock of three Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, but they could not Anſwer within a Yard,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:45247:9"/>I knock'd again in two or three places near the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, yet ſtill they could not Anſwer near thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but told me there was nothing but Tiles and Roof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I bid them break open thoſe Tiles, which they did and eſpied under them a wooden Door, and a little Iron Hinge, I bade them break the Door, then one of the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers put in his hand, into a little hole that was broken in the Door and felt a Hat, then he told me ſome body was in that place, for a Man had thrown his hand off the Hat, then I cauſed them to break open the entrance, which when they had done, <hi>Busby</hi> ſpoke to them, and deſired them to be civil; when they told me what he ſaid to them, I charged them to be civil to him, and bring him to me, which they did. Then I arreſted him in his Majeſties Name, for High-Treaſon, and after he had refreſhed himſelf a little, I told him he muſt get on his Boots, and prepare himſelf to go to <hi>Derby.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after his Apprehenſion, (I perceiving him to be a little diſmay'd) I encouraged him, and ſaid, he ſhould have all the favour a perſon in his circumſtances could expect, for I told him I underſtood he was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a good Family in <hi>Buckinghamſhire</hi> or <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and that his Brother lived at <hi>Coddington</hi> in <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> which he acknowledged, and thanked me for my Civility.</p>
                  <p>I was ſo well ſatisfied that we had apprehended him, after much tedious watching and ſearching, that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought of ſending any Man to look what was in the hiding-hole with him, but after an hours ſtay, or there abouts, I took him away from <hi>Hallam</hi> between eleven and twelve a Clock on the 16th of <hi>March</hi> laſt, and brought him to <hi>Derby</hi> between one and two of the Clock where, after I had taken his Examination, I made a Mittimus and Committed him to <hi>Derby</hi>-Goale.</p>
                  <p>On Satturday following, I writ a Letter to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Conway,</hi> one of his Majeſties principal Secretaries of State, informing his Lordſhip of the apprehending and commitment of <hi>Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> and incloſed a Copy of his Examination, to which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45247:9"/>
his Lordſhip writ me a Letter in Anſwer, that he had acquainted his Majeſty with my Proceedings, who did very well approve of what I had done.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45247:12"/>
that the Souldiers had taken him, or made him away, but when the Soldiers were gone, his Mother and ſome of the Family lamenting for him in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he hearing them, appear'd; ſo that with great joy they received him. My Lord, I think the place was <hi>Coddington,</hi> where he tells you his Mother lived, and that it was hers, ſhe being an Heireſs. At leaſt I am very certain I have heard him ſpeak of the place where he was born, to be in or about <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> I think it was <hi>Coddington</hi>; for it is the place where Mr. <hi>Charles Busby</hi> his Eldeſt Brother now liveth, and he ſaith, that from thence his Father and Mother went Beyond Sea.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, My Maſter and his Family, and all Papiſts that were acquainted with him, ever own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be a Jeſuit; and ſeveral of them have many times told me ſo: Beſides he himſelf hath owned that he was of the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> particularly one time, when I ſhould have been his Convert; telling me, <hi>While I was out of the True Faith, I could not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and there was no way to be ſaved, but by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Catholick Church, which was the Roman Catholick, as Tradition makes appear; for God help me, I was a poor Heretick, and led by weak and blind Paſtors; for they had their Religion only from</hi> Calvin <hi>and</hi> Luther, <hi>and every ſilly Fellow was made now a Preacher of the Goſpel before he underſtood it: but that he and all Jeſuits were Fifteen years labouring in their Studies and Degrees before they came to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</hi>

                  <p>Sir, it is what you know to be truth, and I am ſure you cannot but remember, it was in the Walk at the head of the Orchard, where you was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me expecting my coming to you, and did then uſe all the perſwading means that might be to confirm me in your Opinion; in which I ſeemed ſo well ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that you told me you would leave me to conſider of it, but that I ought to forſake my Friends, and whatever elſe, to come to God Almighty, of which you did not doubt; but bid me be careful, for delays were dangerous: And my Lord, as to his being a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, he did own it when my Maſter was committed to Priſon for refuſing the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: (for he was then private at <hi>West Hallam</hi>) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſaying, in his Conſcience he ought not to take them, for their Church would not allow it, but on the contrary did expreſly forbid it: nevertheleſs Mrs. <hi>Powtrell,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Powtrell,</hi> and divers of the Family did argue for his ſo doing, eſpecially after Mr. <hi>Thomas Cannynge</hi> came from St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-ſhire,</hi> and ſaid that his Uncle <hi>Fowler,</hi> he, and all belonging to him, had taken the Oath of Allegiance:

And that it was the Opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with the conſent of Mr. <hi>Fitter</hi> their Prieſt, that they might do it, and for that reaſon Mr. <hi>Cannynge</hi> came to adviſe my Maſter the like: but Mr. <hi>Busby</hi> did reject the motion, and ſaid no Secular Prieſt could give leave ſo to do, and for his part he was abſolutely againſt it, and ſo was all the Society: But if Seculars gave too much liberty, he would not be guilty of their fault; ſo when all would not prevail with him, then Mrs. <hi>Powtrell</hi> and I went to Mr. <hi>William Brent</hi> at <hi>Fox Coat</hi> in <hi>Warwick-ſhire,</hi> her Grand Father, and Mr. <hi>Busbys</hi> Father-in-Law a Councellor, to have his advice; and upon his writing ſeveral Letters to my Maſter, and Mr. <hi>Busby,</hi> that it was proper for my Maſter ſo to do, nor could he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it; then in compliance to Mr. <hi>Brent,</hi> he did not much oppoſe the taking of the Oath of Allegiance: And thoſe Letters, the next night after Mr. <hi>Gilbert</hi> had taken Mr. <hi>Busby,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Smally</hi> (for fear he ſhould find them) did burn, but ſhewed them to me as ſhe was looking over many papers more, the moſt of which, ſhe did likewiſe burn.</p>

                     <hi>And be it further Enacted by the Authority afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, That it ſhall not be lawful to or for any Jeſuit, Seminary Prieſt, or other ſuch Prieſt, Deacon, or Religious or Eccleſiaſtical Perſon whatſoever, being born within this Realm, or any other of her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Dominions, and heretofore, ſince the ſaid Feaſt of the Nativity of St.</hi> John Baptiſt <hi>in the Firſt Year of her Majeſties Reign, made, ordained, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, or hereafter to be made, ordained, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, by any Authority or Juriſdiction, derived, challenged, or pretended from the See of</hi> Rome; <hi>by or of what Name, Title, or Degree ſoever the ſame ſhall be called or known, to come into, be, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, in any part of this Realm, or any other her Highneſs Dominions, after the end of the ſame For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days, other then in ſuch ſpecial caſes, and upon ſuch ſpecial occaſions only, and for ſuch time only, as is expreſſed in this Act: And if he do, That then every ſuch Offence ſhall be taken and adjudged to be High Treaſon. And every perſon ſo offending, ſhall for his Offence be adjudged a Traitor; and ſhall ſuffer, loſe, and forfeit, as in caſe of High Treaſon.</hi>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>This makes every Offender againſt this Statute a Capital Offender, and guilty of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; now whether he is within this Law, you are to conſider? Mr. <hi>Gilbert</hi> has told you that he is a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prieſt and Jeſuit, in the Neighbourhood, and that as ſuch he had an Order from his Majeſty to apprehend him. He uſed his endeavors to take him for ſome time,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45247:20"/>
but could not apprehend him, till the Sixteenth of <hi>March</hi> laſt, and then he found him; but in ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Hole, that no body would hide himſelf in, but ſuch an extraordinary Offender. Innocent people do not obſcure themſelves in that manner. <hi>Joſeph Dudley,</hi> to prove him a Native and not an Alien, tells you, That when Souldiers in the time of the late Wars, came to plunder his Fathers Houſe, he heard him ſay, That at Two years old he hid himſelf in the Curtains in his Mothers Chamber for fear of the Souldiers. But (ſays the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner) my memory could not ſerve me at Two years old to retain what I did then. But our Parents tell us what we did then. If a Man be asked, What age are you of? No man can tell, but as his Parents tells him. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther told me I was Six years old, and from thence I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it. His Father and Mother were not out of <hi>England</hi> (as appears) till about 1646, and then the War was ended; and the Priſoner confeſs'd himſelf to be about Forty years of Age, which ſhews him born in <hi>England.</hi> He that but obſerves his Language, will find that the Tone of the Engliſh Language remains with him. One born in <hi>Wales,</hi> (though he come young from thence) he will have a Welſh Tone as long as he lives. The Priſoner tells you, That no man has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his being in Orders of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor where, when, or by whom, made a Prieſt: But if all that were to be proved, it would make the Law idle and inſignificant. If he be made a Prieſt in <hi>England,</hi> 'tis as much as if made at St. <hi>Omers</hi> or <hi>Rome.</hi> He did own io <hi>Joſeph Dudley,</hi> That he was made a Jeſuit, and laboured to make a Convert of him in the Garden, when he was alone with him. The next was <hi>Thomas Houis,</hi> who courted a Woman, and muſt not have her, unleſs he turn'd Roman Catholick. <hi>Busby</hi> muſt diſcourſe him, and make a Convert of him. He hears <hi>Busby</hi> preach three times, and heard him ſay Maſs ſeveral times; and was not only married by him, but has been Confeſs'd and Abſolved by him divers times. But <hi>Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>'s fallacious Argument has no weight in it, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he underſtands not Latine, therefore he proves it not Maſs, nor other Services of the Church of <hi>Rome. Dorothy Saunders</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe, That he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45247:20"/>
Confeſs'd and Abſolved her. And ſhe tells you, That ſhe has ſeen him elevate the Hoſt, and has ſhewed you the manner how; and he gave her the Sacrament, which ſhe and the reſt took from him, as the Sacrament. And that ſhe has ſeen him officiate in ſome of the Robes produced in Court. <hi>Sarah Clark</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe, and ſo did <hi>Elizabeth Evans.</hi> But <hi>Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> ſays, Becauſe this was done in an unknown Tongue, they cannot ſwear it; and that he is no Prieſt, becauſe they do not ſwear where, and when, he received his Orders. Whoever does exerciſe that Profeſſion, we do believe him of that Church. When a Miniſter of our Church preaches or officiates, we do not ſay, Pray let us ſee your Orders firſt; but if he officiate uſually as a Prieſt, 'tis taken for granted that he is one. He can tell where he received his Orders, but it may be cannot produce them upon all occaſions. Muſt he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be no Prieſt? Upon the whole, if you believe the Witneſſes or any two of them, you are to find the Priſoner Guilty; I believe you have had full Evidence, go together and conſider of it.</p>
