            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theſe Tempeſtuous times ſeem to threaten Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack to the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> her ſelf, and what muſt a ſingle member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of expect, when he ſteers himſelf betwixt the violence of Oppoſite Intereſts and Factions? <hi>Liberty!

            <p>I Muſt firſt be ſo juſt to my ſelf as to avoid <hi>Pliny</hi>'s malediction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt thoſe Thieves who will ſteal even an whole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and not ſo much as add to the ſenſe one Paragraph, or alter one Syllable in the Phraſe, <hi>Reprehenſione dignum eſt, Majorum tacere nomina, &amp; eorum ſibi appropriare ingenia.</hi> Whereas (ſaith the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)
<pb facs="tcp:63976:7"/>
               <hi>Benignum etenim eſt &amp; plenum ingenui pudoris fateri per quos profeceris;</hi> Nevertheleſs I can only tell thee this, that I have changed both the Phraſe (to a finer Allay) of my Author, I have added many whole Paragraphs and pages to purſue his excellent deſigne, which he had only framed, not compleated; and which came to my hands in the form of an old muſty Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, which was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to tell its Author's name, and very difficult to expreſs its deſigne, being in many places prejudiced by time (that <hi>Edax rerum)</hi> to a great imperfection. I thought
<pb facs="tcp:63976:7"/>
it therefore beſt not to thruſt it into the World crippled and injured as it was, nor to amend its old expreſſions with a new ſort of Dialect, on purpoſe to avoid piecing and patching; And if yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of Lameneſs ſhall remain, be thou not a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verca,</hi> but rather a <hi>Nutrix,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate thy Candor and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thy prejudice and if thou pleaſeſt to take the pains thou haſt as much right to put it into a better dreſs, which I commend to thy ſufficient ability. Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it is expected from ſome that this will be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided with Baſtardy, and
<pb facs="tcp:63976:8"/>
be deſpiſed and hated as <hi>Filius Populi,</hi> by that abounding and multitudinous ſort of People who are called <hi>Partialiſts,</hi> who always wedded to their own particular Luſts and private Intereſts, that are factious even to Rebellion and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that will neither give God nor Caeſar his due: Notwithſtanding it is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to venture, knowing that no ſorrow is ſudden to an expectation; And that it will find ſome (though but a few) that will both commend and protect it. It will Court all but Flatter none: It is the hand that points at <hi>The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Right and the Peoples Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:63976:8"/>
It is that little Coſtick which will twinge all ſuch whoſe corruptions are ripe for ſeparation; and though it may make them wince at the touch of their thwarted paſſions; yet it is the ſureſt means to work the cure, if they will be perſwaded to endure the Pain.</p>
            <p>The deſign of this is to ſweeten the ſeeming bitter ſeverities, yet juſt neceſſities of Government and render them plauſible and palliable to the People, that ſo they may delight more in their Duty to obey than the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign in his Power to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>(Legum ſervi ſumus
<pb facs="tcp:63976:9"/>
ut Libri eſſe poſſumus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> And the Prince (on whoſe Head is placed both at once the Weight and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Crown) and the People may both mutually know (ſince the burthen of a Crown is firſt underſtood before the Glory is percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) that Grandure is both to compenſate as well as digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the toyles and difficulties of Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith <hi>Nihil aliud po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Rex, in terris cum ſit Dei Miniſter &amp; Vicarius, niſi id ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum quod de jure poteſt,</hi> which is an Axiome that puts reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal bounds of Juſtice and Goodneſs, both to inſtruct
<pb facs="tcp:63976:9"/>
the Prince in his Duty and Behaviour towards God and his Subjects, and the People in their due Obedience to their Sovereign, ſince the King is none, but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's Subſtitute or Vice-Roy, and conſequently to be queſtioned for his Actions, or puniſhed by none but God himſelf, who is not to be haſtned or directed in the diſpoſition of his Vengeance, but rather entreated by hearty: Prayer for the removal of his Plagues and Judgements.</p>
            <p>I ſtand amazed when I conſider the many Factions and Seditions amongſt us, that theſe Kingdoms are not
<pb facs="tcp:63976:10"/>
already the Subjects of irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Juſtice: when I hear the open murmurs, and ſee the many Treaſonable Libels in theſe licentious times; The Prince abuſed, and the People deceived by Inſtruments of Darkneſs and wicked practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by ſuch men, or rather Monſters, who when they moſt violently cry up the Kingdomes good under the neceſſity of reforming the manners of Magiſtracy, they onely aim at the deſtruction of Peace and Innocence, which is the hated Object of ſuch devouring Vultures.</p>
            <p>Hence I foreſee the Immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Dangers and miſerable
<pb facs="tcp:63976:10"/>
Calamities that every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeems to threaten ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable miſeries on theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Kingdoms. One may perceive the dreadful ſtorm hanging, as it were, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately over our Heads, We are confounded on all Hands, and the Diſeaſe ſeems almoſt Remedileſs; <hi>Rome</hi>'s horrid Plots are not yet fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and God knows how much of the <hi>Good old Cauſe</hi> remains yet to this day in the Hearts of partial and ill affected <hi>Puritans.</hi> Theſe two are the <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis</hi> of our misfortunes, and ſeem to make but one Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they aim at one end,
<pb facs="tcp:63976:11"/>
the deſtruction of our Lives, Religion, and Government.</p>
            <p>Let the King and People therefore of the eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>England</hi> take as much care againſt the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of a <hi>Puritan</hi> as againſt the malice of a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> the Contrivances of the latter (being commonly prevented) having never acted ſo vile a Tragedy, as the Principles and Practices of the former. The <hi>Pope</hi> in all his Bulls and Interdicts cannot fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate more Maledictions than have been reduced into Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice amongſt our <hi>Jeſuited Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then beware of
<pb facs="tcp:63976:11"/>
theſe two; Be obedient to our King; and his Majeſty careful both of himſelf and us; let the Laws be duely practiſed and obſerved, and then the King, our Lives, Religion and Government will be ſafely preſerved.</p>

the Inſtrument of their intended villanies (the haughty Biſhop) by dilating his particular Vices, and making them conſpicuous, and him notorious both to King and People, which will be ever more poſſible as he is more potent, and ſo conclude to remove him at their pleaſure, or elſe this muſt be the way, to give the King over to ſuch Miniſters as would certainly cut off the affections of his people, and conſequently render the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment odious: So they doubt not (though the firſt ſtratagem miſs) that this muſt certainly hit the mark, and light them the way to their dark and evil purpoſes,

            <p>This Counſel being heard and approved muſt now be put in practice, the corrupt and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63976:18"/>
Biſhop is drawn to their party by Money and an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of increaſe of Power; men are moſt eaſily corrupted in the ſupreameſt Fortunes, where Luſts may have the advantage of being armed with Power: Articles are in all haſt forged and urged againſt the good and innocent Earl, as, Sale of the Crown-lands, Waſt of the King's Treaſure, and Laſtly that (which thoſe ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous times held Capital) giving al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to any that might breed a rupture between the Sovereign and the Subject, which they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be his deſign (to work ſome machinations of his own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government) and to have been done by him, in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the King to annihilate all Patents granted during his mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and enforcing the Subject to pay as the Record it ſelf mentions, <hi>Non juxta ſingulorum facultatem, ſed quicquid Juſticiarius eſtimabat.</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63976:18"/>
But the good Earl ſtood upon his own legs and oppoſed his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence ſingly to ſhield him from the miſchiefs of their wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and he cleared himſelf of all their falſe accuſations; but they did worthily periſh by their own Swords, for Arts that fit Princes, end ever in the ruin of the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors: Bad times corrupt good Counſel and make the beſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters yield to the Luſts of Princes,

            <p>Therefore this King cannot paſs blameleſs, that would ſo eaſily ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all former merit of ſo good a Servant for that wherein him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was chief in fault: But Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces natures are more voluble and ſooner cloyed than others, their Favours tranſitory; and as their minds are large, ſo they eaſily out-look
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63976:19"/>
their firſt elections, having no farther neceſſity in the faſtneſs of their affections than their own ſatisfactions: When it is once paſt Noon with a Court-favourite, it is ſuddenly Night with him. The eminent Vertue of men, if it be <note place="margin">Marq. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil.

            <p>The Biſhop now ſits at Helm and mannageth the State as he pleaſes, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chron. de</hi> Litchfield.</note> having choſen for his Inſtruments,

            </p>
            <p>Thus the Plot of the tumultuous Barons went clear, and had not the diſcreter Biſhops calmed all by dutiful perſwaſions, informing the King of the pernicious conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that muſt inevitably follow this bad mans counſels and power, whoſe carriage before had loſt his Father <hi>Normandy,</hi> his Treaſure, the love of the People, and in that the Crown, and would (by teaching

It was not the beſt Doctrine this man might plant to preach its firmation and eſtabliſhment by a diſordered Liberty, and Civil Wars, when the firſt Church propagated its Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Doctrine by Faſting and Prayer: True Piety bindeth the Subject to deliver a good Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, to bear with a Bad, and to take up the burthen of Princes with a bended Knee, hoping ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in time to merit Abatement than reſiſt Authority: The Vices of bad Princes are to be born with the like patience as we endure Dearths and Tempeſts, or ſuch like Deviations of Nature from her u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual courſe; becauſe though Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (as they are men) may be viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet as ſuch are not immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; and a pious Succeſſor may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the ruins of a former Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.

            <p>To ſuppreſs theſe troubles, and ſupply the King's enormities, a Parliament was ſummoned much to the liking of theſe Lords, who as little meant to relieve the King's wants as they did deſire, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to quiet His Majeſties Realms, their end at this time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to diſcover the Nakedneſs or Poverty of their Maſter at home, that ſo they may be able to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his Credit and Glory abroad, and ſo the better to brave out their inclinations freely; which thoſe licentious times did permit.

Expence of houſe he meaſured by the juſt rule of his proper Revenue, and was heard frequently to ſay, that his exceſs of waſt had cauſed the greateſt iſſue of his Subjects blood. The inſolence of the Souldiers (made lawleſs by the late liberty of Civil Arms) he ſpendeth in Foreign Expeditions, having ſeen that the moſt temperate Spirits bore the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of all the former miſeries, and that the other never were ſatisfied but in the Calamities of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and knowing that if he did not find an Enemy for them abroad, they would procure one to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at home. The rigours and corruptions of Civil and Judicial <note place="margin">Anno 53. Hen. 3.</note> Officers he examineth and redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63976:46"/>
by ſtrict Commiſſion, for the ſence of their Severity became the murmur of his own cruelty. The Seats of Judgment and Counſels <note place="margin">Chron. de Trailba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton.</note> he filled up with men nobly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, for ſuch attract with leſs offence the generous Spirit, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reverence; Their ability he meaſureth not by favour, nor by private information (as before) but by general voice; for every one in particular may deceive and be deceived, but no one can all, nor all deceive one. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to diſcover his own Capacity, that ſo he might know what part to bear hereafter in all deliberate enterpriſes, he daily ſits in Council, and in his own perſon manageth all affairs of the greateſt weight and moment; for Counſellors be they never ſo wiſe are but acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the guidance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; their Office muſt be ſubjection, not fellowſhip, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, and to have ability to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63976:46"/>
viſe, not authority to reſolve; for as the natural Body cannot ſubſiſt unagitated by the Soul, no more can the politique part or grandeur of a Prince always ſupport it ſelf without ſometimes giving a <hi>Sic Volo, Sic Jubeo,</hi> for unleſs he be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive in ſome things to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his Power, he is unfit to be obeyed in any thing, to the proſtration of his Prerogative; For it offendeth as well the Miniſter of merit as the People, to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to one incapable of his own Greatneſs and unworthy of his Fortune.</p>
            <p>This wonderful change to the Kingdom in general, lately deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all hopes or expectations to recover their ancient Rights and former Liberty, that they wiſhed and ſought for nothing but the mildeſt Servitude, did bring them back (without the leaſt Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) miraculouſly to their Duty, and their Allegiance lovingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63976:47"/>
their new recovered and reſtored Rights and Liberties. He that will lay (we ſee) the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Greatneſs upon popular eſteem muſt give his Subjects eaſe and juſtice, for they meaſure the Bond of their obedience by the Good always they receive.</p>
            <p>This calm ſerenity ever after bleſſed his old age, and attended his perſon to the period of his days. And now he ranſacks the various calamities and changes of his own Reign, purpoſing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his Succeſſor with the beſt rules (from Principles which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had drawn from experience) for the ſettling of an happy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and with the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies againſt evil times. The negligence and intemperance of youth, which experience and old age had both amended and worn out in himſelf, he adviſes his Son to avoid, as the greateſt ſtimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to all the incommodities of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63976:47"/>
trouble and infelicity. And the better to inſtruct and enable him, he made him partner both of his Experience and Authority; and farther adviſed him as the moſt approved Antidote againſt the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom of every paſſion, and as the ſureſt Compaſs to ſteer himſelf by amidſt all occurring anxieties and dangers; to learn in Proſperity to be ſilent and not tranſported; in Adverſity, to be patient and not dejected: In neither to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented or diſſatisfied: but in both to be diſcreetly and Philoſophically affected. In fine, all the Actions of his future Reign were exact grounds of Diſcipline and Policy, (the beſt patterns for his Succeſſor's imitation.)</p>
            <p>And, as he was the firſt that ſettled the Law, and State, deſerving to wear the ſtile of <hi>England's Juſtinian,</hi> and the Great and Glorious Title, <hi>To have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Crown from the Subjection

and Wardſhip of the Nobility,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in all his Actions after capable to command not the Realm only, but the whole World.</p>
            <p>Thus frequently doth the wrongs and malice of our Enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the conduct of our own pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, make us ſometime both Wiſe and Fortunate. And as no Man was ever truely Miſerable but by his own miſcarriage, ſo none can ever be truely Happy without putting a <hi>Ne plus ultra</hi> to the career of his unruly Paſſions, and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Luſts: The firſt of which is truely viſible in the Fortunes and Fate of <hi>Mountfort</hi> the King's Minion, and the latter conſpicuous in the bad and good Fortune of this King himſelf.</p>
            <p>That man who becomes the ſubject of his Princes delight and favours, muſt have in him a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent worth as well of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Obedience, as of Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Truth, which makes none

other uſe of this ſo great a bleſſing but to his Sovereigns Honour and his own Credit; and not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage himſelf by the oppreſſion of others. <hi>Sudorem ferro abſtergere tetrum facinus;</hi> ſaith <hi>Pythagoras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To curvet and dance on the top of a Pinacle is the readieſt way to tumble, and it is as dangerous for a man to walk on the Summit of Honour, which is ſo glaciated and ſlippery by the over-tumid paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and temptations (the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant companions of a Supreme Fortune) without the indiſpenſable ſupport of moderation.</p>
            <p>Let the Favourite always taſt the Kings bounty, but not devour it; let him enjoy his Maſters Ear, but not engroſs it; let him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate his Love, but not enchant it. If he muſt be a Moat in the Eye of the Commonwealth, let him not be a Monſter.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, if he muſt hold the Reigns of the Government, let
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63976:49"/>
him not ride it with the Spurs of Ambition: 'Tis that alone makes a ſubject ſally beyond the bounds of his Duty, and at one inſtant to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come both a <hi>Caſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> to endure neither Equal nor Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour; the diſmal conſequences of which is too frequently an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievable miſery both to his Prince and Countrey. Let the Kings Actions be as pure and immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late as Truth and Innocence, yet if his affection either blind or tranſport him to become the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylum of his Servants inſolences and evil actions, then Majeſty it ſelf becomes guilty, and muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſhare both in the grievance and hatred of the poor diſtreſſed Subject.</p>
            <p>The general Cry ſeeing the Stream polluted aſcribe it to the Fountain head, where is the Spring and Power that may reform and cleanſe it. He that will read the Hiſtory of our own, or thoſe of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign

Nations, ſhall find (that by this one particular error of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection) a number of memorable Examples which have produced Depoſition of Kings, Ruine of Kingdoms, the effuſion of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Blood, and the general diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that part of the World, all grounded on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>Princes ſhould put limits to their own affections, and the Power Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick is or ought to be bounded, and the obedience due to the King ſhould reciprocally correſpond with the equal Right and Juſtice due to the ſubject, by which they claim a property in his actions. If either of theſe prove defective by wilful Errour, the State is in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger of a following miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. The Ballance therefore muſt be kept even betwixt the Princes <hi>Power</hi> and the Peoples <hi>Liberty,</hi> which is the firm Baſis of a quiet Government.</p>
            <p>Let the People abſtain from
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63976:50"/>
Faction and Diſcontent (the Dams that at length bring forth Conſuſion and Rebellion) and no doubt the Prince will from Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Oppreſſion. It is the Intereſt as well as Duty of every Subject to pay an entire obedience to the Government under which he lives, and that without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur or grumbling; for his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a Condition annexed to that Security which he hath of his Life and Liberty; for no Prince is obliged to protect his Subjects any longer than they continue in their Obedience to him, ſince Rebellion and faction cannot be nouriſhed, but as a Viper in the Boſom of Government. And a proſpect of danger does often neceſſitate a Prince to become a Tyrant in his own defence; and it was a wiſe ſaying of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Egypt, That good Subjects might eaſily of a bad make a good Prince, but he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of bad Subjects make good.</hi>

The King in his Throne is like the Sun in the Firmament whoſe influence animates all ſublunary beings. So the Authority of a Prince gives life and vigor to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Member of the Body politick; and he is not onely <hi>Caput</hi> but alſo <hi>Anima Reipublicae,</hi> and no member ought to move from his proper ſtation, or againſt that Soul which is the life of its being, or preſume to accede too near this reſplendent Head (by intermedling with the ſcorching influences of the State Arcana, but leave them to their own orderly courſe and natural guidance) leaſt the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof ſhould dazle the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers into Blindneſs and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the heat thereof ſcorch them into Rebellion and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe a Magiſtrate really Tyrannical; it is no contemptible queſtion, Whether the evils of the Redreſs may not be equivolent to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63976:51"/>
the miſchiefs? I remember <hi>Livy's Nec morbum ferre poſſumus nec reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</hi> And <hi>Tacitus, Ferenda Regum ingenia, neque uſui eſſe crebras muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones: vitia erunt donec homines, ſed neque haec continua, &amp; meliorum interventu penſantur;</hi> and <hi>Seneca, Infaeliciter aegrotat, cui plus periculi à Medico quam Morbo.</hi> Poiſe the Miſeries of a Civil War with the Grievances of an unjuſt Magiſtrate, and the Ballance ſeems to me ſo unequal, that if my Chriſtianity fail, the apprehenſion of the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table miſeries by the Sword is ſufficient to deterr from ſuch a practice; for though the fury of incenſed Tyranny may fall heavy upon many particulars, yet the bloody conſequences of an inteſtine Sword are more epidemical and laſting: And <hi>Tacitus</hi> commends to Subjects rather <hi>Scutum</hi> than <hi>Gladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> the Shield of Patience and Toleration to be more excellent than the Sword. But if there be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63976:51"/>
ſuch diſtempers in a State, as ſhall neceſſarily require amendment, let it be left to the courſe of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and not (againſt the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Heaven) be attempted by the Sword of Violence, for I never read that Illegal, or Tumultuous, or Rebellious were fit Epithets for Reformation: And 'tis fit Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould forbear the uſe of ſuch ſurly Phyſick till they have levied a Fine in the Court of Heaven, and cut off the entail of the ſeventh Beatitude.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſt that we are fallen into the dregs of time, we live in the ruſt of the Iron age, and muſt accordingly expect to feel <hi>Ultima ſeneſcentis mundi deliria,</hi> the dotages of a decrepit World, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſeries that attend an hardned and diſſenting people; wherefore I will conclude with the ſaying of the Philoſopher:</p>
