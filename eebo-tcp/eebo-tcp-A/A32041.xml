            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There are two Cities (saith</hi> Austin) The City of God, <hi>and the</hi> City of the Devill: <hi>The</hi> City of God <hi>is</hi> begun and built up by the love of God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, even to the hatred of our selves; <hi>but the</hi> City of the Devill, begins from the love of our selves, and increaseth, even to the hatred of God, by the contempt of our brethren; for he that hateth and contemneth his brother, will in a litle while hate and contemne God. <hi>It cannot be denied, (no not by one made up of Charity) that there are many</hi> Citizens <hi>of this</hi> City of the Devill. <hi>Many who instead of loving</hi> God, <hi>to the</hi> contempt of themselves, <hi>love</hi> themselves <hi>to the</hi> contempt of
<pb facs="tcp:63009:4"/>
God: <hi>Many who seek their</hi> owne, <hi>and not the things of</hi> Jesus Christ', <hi>or which is as bad, if not worse, who seek their</hi> owne, <hi>under the</hi> hpocriticall pretence <hi>of seeking the things of Christ. It is reported of</hi> Cnidius <hi>a great</hi> Architectist, <hi>who building a</hi> sumptuous Watch-Tower <hi>for the</hi> King of Egypt <hi>(to discover the dangerous rocks by night to his Marriners) caused his owne name to be</hi> engrav'd <hi>upon a</hi> stone <hi>in the wall in</hi> great letters, <hi>and afterwards</hi> covered it with Lime and Morter, <hi>and upon the outside wrote the name of the</hi> King of Egypt in Golden Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, <hi>as pretending that all was done for his glory and honour: But herein was his cunning, he knew that the water in a little time would consume the plaistering (as it did) and then his name and memory should abide &amp; continue to after Generations. There are many such in this Nation, who in their</hi> outward discourse and carriage, <hi>pretend to seek onely the</hi> glory of God, <hi>the</hi> good of his Church, <hi>and</hi> the happinesse of the State. <hi>But if we had a window to look into their hearts, we should finde nothing there written, but</hi> selfe-love and selfe-seeking. <hi>My care hath been in the following discourse, to set out the greatnesse and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vousnesse of this sinne, and how destructive it is both to Church and Common-wealth. Besides what is there said, give me leave to adde:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is one of the greatest curses under Heaven, for</hi> God to give a man over to his owne hearts lust, <hi>to</hi> doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever seems good in his owne eyes, <hi>to make</hi> himselfe <hi>the</hi> principle, rule, and end <hi>of all his actions.

They pretended to seek the things of Christ, but sought their own things, under colour of seeking the things of Christ, and therefore are said not to seek them at all.</p>

               </p>

               <p>Qu. 4 <hi>Wherein the grievousnesse, and mischievousnesse of this sinne consisteth?</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <head>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. Whether all selfe-seeking be contradictory to Christ-seeking? Whether a man may not be a Christ-seeker, and yet a selfe-seeker?</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans</hi> For answer to this you must know, that it is not simply and absolutely unlawfull for a man to <hi>seek himselfe,</hi> no more than it is to <hi>love himselfe.</hi> Religion doth not <hi>destroy</hi> naturall affections, but onely <hi>regulates</hi> them, and <hi>sanctifieth</hi> them; <hi>Gratia non extinguit sed ordinat affectiones,</hi> saith Aquinas, <hi>Non tollit sed attollit naturam,</hi> Grace doth not <hi>destroy,</hi> but <hi>elevate</hi> nature.

               </p>
               <p>Therefore you shall finde in Scripture, that there are many
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63009:8"/>
arguments drawne from <hi>selfe-love,</hi> and <hi>selfe-seeking,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us to holinesse, and disswade us from sin, <hi>Deut. 28. Lev. 26. Deut. 32. 46, 47. Is. 1. 19. Rom. 2. 7, 8. Rom. 8. 13. Gal.</hi> 6. 8. The <hi>Scripture</hi> gives us leave to love our selves, and to seek our selves, so it be in a right manner. <hi>Moses</hi> did not sin in <hi>having an eye to the recompence of reward.</hi> Nor did the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> who could not <hi>accept deliverance, that they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a better resurrection,</hi> Heb. 11. 35. <hi>who received joyfully the spoiling of their goods, knowing in themselves that they had in Heaven a better, and an enduring substance,</hi> Heb. 10. 34. It is said, even of Christ himselfe, <hi>That for the joy that was set before him, he indured the crosse, and despised the shame,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. There is a great difference between <hi>amor mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and <hi>amor mercedis, Mercenary</hi> love, and the <hi>love</hi> of the <hi>reward. Mercenary</hi> love is, when we <hi>serve God onely for reward.</hi> This is sinfull, but to make the <hi>hope</hi> of reward <hi>one motive</hi> of service, is not only <hi>lawful,</hi> but <hi>necessary.</hi> For it is our duty to use all <hi>Gods Motives,</hi> as well as all <hi>Gods Ordinances,</hi> and as it is a sinne for any man to say, that he hath no need of Gospel-Ordinances, so also to say that he hath no need of Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motives, amongst which, this is one of the chiefest.</p>
               <p>Know therefore that there is a threefold selfe-seeking.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. There is a lawfull and an allowed selfe-seeking.</item>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>lawfull selfe-seeking,</hi> and that is, when a Christian seeks his owne private gaine and honour in the <hi>last place,</hi> and in the <hi>least place,</hi> when he seeks the <hi>things of Christ,</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>chiefe</hi> place, and his owne things lesser, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the things of Christ, when he seeks his owne things, not in <hi>separation</hi> from, <hi>opposition</hi> to, <hi>competition</hi> with, but in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to the things of Christ. In a word, when a Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an seeks his own things in <hi>due order</hi> and <hi>measure,</hi> so as not to hinder, but to further his seeking the things of Christ, this is a lawfull selfe-seeking.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> To understand this aright, is a point of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the more we know of this <hi>Divine selfe-seeking,</hi> the more we will shun and abhor the <hi>sinfull self-seeking.</hi> Give me leave to deliver what I have to say about it, in these ensuing Propositions, which I doe not name as several distinct heads, but as divers instances of a divine and sublimated selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeking, (amounting most of them, to one and the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That man who seeks the good of his Soule, more than the good of his body, seeks himselfe after a Divine manner.</hi> The Body <note place="margin">Prop. 1.</note> of Man is the worst halfe of Man, <hi>vilissima pars hominis,</hi> The shell, the boxe, the carcasse of Man. <hi>Intus est, quod homo est,</hi> The Soule of Man is the Man of Man. <hi>Animus uniuscujusque is est quisque.</hi> And therefore he that seeks to get his Soule <hi>beautified</hi> with <hi>grace,</hi> to be made <hi>Christs picture,</hi> and a reall member of his body, this Man, and this Man onely, seeks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. He that seeks the <hi>good</hi> of his body, to the <hi>hurt</hi> of his Soule, doth not <hi>seeke</hi> himself, but the <hi>destruction</hi> both of Body and Soule. That Man that makes such a fire, as to burne himself and his house, doth not seek the good of himselfe nor his house. That Merchant that so over-loads his Ship, as to drowne it, and himselfe, doth not seek his owne good. Even so that Man that over-pampers his Body, that laboureth <hi>cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re cutem, magis quam animam,</hi> to stuffe his body with dainty food, to cloath his body with fine apparell, and in the mean time to neglect his most pretious Soule, this Man doth not seek himselfe, but ruine himselfe. For the happinesse of the Body, depends upon the happinesse of the Soule. If the Soul goe to Hell at death, the Body at the great resurrection will goe thither also: And therefore he that beates downe his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63009:9"/>
body, and brings it into subjection, and labours to make it a fit servant to his soule, that endures hardship with his body, as <hi>a good souldier of Jesus Christ,</hi> that weares and tires out his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the service of God; that works with his body for the good of his soule; this is the true, heavenly, and blessed selfe-seeker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That man who seeks his eternall good more than his temporall;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prop. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>who seeks not onely to make himselfe happy for forty or fifty years, but for ever and ever; This man seeks himselfe after a divine manner.</hi> For what will it profit a man to be happy for a few years in this life, and to be miserable for ever in hell hereafter; How quickly will a man in hell forget the happinesse he had here? He that makes provision to live pleasurably and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably while he lives, but makes no provision to live happily when he dyes, this man may seeme to <hi>love himselfe</hi> for a <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,</hi> but sure I am he <hi>hates himselfe to all eternity.</hi> He that layeth up treasure for himselfe upon earth, but none in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, may be accounted rich in this world, which will quickly end, but he will be poore world without end. Such a selfe-hater was <hi>Dives, Luc.</hi> 16. and the rich foole, <hi>Luc.</hi> 12. and <hi>such are all they that lay up treasure for themselves, but are not rich towards God, Luc.</hi> 12. 21. He is a divine selfe-seeker, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to live <hi>holily</hi> here, that he may live <hi>happily</hi> hereafter; to live <hi>graciously</hi> here, that he may inherit <hi>eternall glory</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that denyeth his sinfull selfe most, seeketh himselfe most.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prop. 3.</note> He that hates himselfe as corrupted by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and seeketh the utter ruine and extirpation of the old <hi>Adam</hi> within him, this man doth truly love himself. This is divine self-seeking, to kill thy sins, that thy sins may not kill thy soule. As <hi>Zipporah</hi> by <hi>circumcising</hi> her child, saved the life of her <hi>husband:</hi> So the way to save thy soule, is to <hi>circumcise</hi> and pare off <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>all superstuity of haughtinesse, James</hi> 1. 21. This is the meaning of that which Christ saith, <hi>Mat 5. 29, 30. If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee, for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and cast it from thee, for it is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63009:10"/>
profitable,</hi> &amp;c The more thou hatest thy gainful and pleasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sins, the more thou lovest thy self. As a man in a <hi>Dropsie,</hi> the more he denieth himself <hi>drink</hi> the more he <hi>seekes himself;</hi> because the lesse he <hi>drinketh</hi> the more he <hi>destroyeth</hi> his <hi>disease.</hi> Even so the more thou <hi>deniest</hi> thy corrupt self, the more thou <hi>seekest</hi> thy self, because the more thou <hi>deniest thy corrupt self,</hi> the more thou <hi>destroyest</hi> thy <hi>spirituall diseases;</hi> the more thou ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test the <hi>Devils faction</hi> within thee, &amp; weakenst the opposition of the Flesh against the Spirit. He that loves his sins, hates his own soul, <hi>Pro. 8. 36. Gal.</hi> 6. 8. he that <hi>soweth sin,</hi> shall <hi>reap hell,</hi> he that makes <hi>provision for the flesh, provides fuel for bel fire.</hi> He that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth the old <hi>Adam</hi> within him, cherisheth that which taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and polluteth all his holy duties, which indisposeth him to all good, and disposeth him to all evill, he cherisheth his Souls greatest enemy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. he delights in that, which was <hi>Pauls</hi> greatest misery, and which made him cry out, <hi>O wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death,</hi> Rom. 7. 24. therefore I may truly say, he that is the greatest <hi>selfe-denier,</hi> is the greatest <hi>selfe-seeker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that seeks to doe most service to God in his generation, that seeks his own glory, by seeking Gods glory, is a Divine self seeker.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prop. 4.</note> The reason is, because the <hi>perfection of every thing consisteth, in attaining the end for which it was made.</hi> As the perfection of meat is to be eaten, he that hoards it up and will not eate it, destroyes it. The end for which God made Man is to serve him, to glorifie him here, and enjoy him hereafter. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more service we doe to God, the more we seek his glory; the more we attaine the end of our creation, and therein we are the more happy. <hi>He that loves himselfe for himselfe, and for his owne ends, destroyes himselfe,</hi> because the end for which God made us, is to serve him, and not our selves. When all the streames of selfe-love flow into the great Ocean of the love of God, this is Divine selfe-love. Oh that men would thus labour to love themselves, and seek themselves, to look upon themselves as servants and instruments unto God and his glory; to say, <hi>Lord, how may I advance my selfe, by advancing thy name! how may I glorifie my selfe, by glorifying of thee? How may I seeke my selfe, by seeking thy praise, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63009:10"/>
perfect my selfe, by disposing of my selfe of my understanding, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, will, heart, affections and actions, in order to thee and thy glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The more a man serves God out of pure love, without reflection</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prop. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>to selfe, the more he seeks himselfe;</hi> for this is a certaine truth, <hi>The lesse we seek our selves and our owne ends in any holy duty, the more we seek our selves,</hi> because the lesse we seek our selves, the more we seek God and his glory, and the more we seek God &amp; his glory, the more reward we shall have. <hi>The lesse we look after reward for that we doe, the more reward we shall have;</hi> and therefore the Papists who teach men to doe good works that thereby they might merit heaven, (supposing their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be true) lose all the reward of their good worke. <hi>He that serves God to merit by his service, cannot merit by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; the more he eyes merit, the lesse he meriteth:</hi> He that serves God for his owne ends, doth not serve God but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; but he that serves God for Gods sake, shall be rewarded by God. The lesse we eye our selves in any duty, the more reward we shall have, and therefore the more we seek our selves.</p>

                  <hi>owne glory and honour, is a Divine selfe seeker.</hi> The reason is, because the <hi>happinesse of Man is more in God than in himselfe.</hi> As the happinesse of a <hi>member</hi> of the body is in <hi>conjunction</hi> with the body, (take it from the body it dieth.)

to have his head cut off, will willingly (even out of selfe-love) lift up his arme and suffer it to be cut off to save his head, because his life is more in his head than in his arme.

He preferred Jerusalem above his chiefe joy,</hi> In a storme at Sea, he that seeks the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ship, seeks most the preservation of his own Trunk, for if the Ship be drowned, his Trunk cannot be saved. The truth is, if the Church and the true Religion be destroyed, to what purpose is it for a godly man to live? I read of <hi>Titus Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi> that when the Souldiers had destroyed the Temple of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> they came to him and asked him, what they should doe with the Priests that did supervive? <hi>Kill them</hi> (said he) <hi>for now their worke is at an end.</hi> When Religion is destroyed, what will it advantage a godly man to live? therefore they that seek the good of the Church, more than their owne, are blessed selfe-seekers.</p>

                  <hi>That man who had rather lose wife, children, estate and life it selfe, than sinne against God, is a Divine selfe-seeker:</hi> The <note place="margin">Prop. 8.</note> reason is, because his <hi>happinesse is more in keeping a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, than in keeping his Estate or saving his Life.</hi> The holy Martyrs <hi>who loved not their lives unto the death,</hi> were the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test selfe seekers.</hi> It is a most blessed selfe-seeking, to suffer the <hi>fire of Martyrdome,</hi> to avoid the <hi>fire of Hell,</hi> to lose <hi>earthly promotions,</hi> to attain <hi>everlasting honours:</hi> And therefore Christ argueth from selfe-love, Mat. 16. 25. <hi>Whosoever will save his life shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall finde it;</hi> so also <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 29, 30. the antient Martyrs did the like, <hi>Heb. 10. 34.

               <p>From all that I have said concerning this blessed selfe-seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I gather these three conclusions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That no Man is a true <hi>selfe, seeker,</hi> who is not a true <hi>Christ-seeker.</hi>
               </p>

to the rules of it is founded upon <hi>Right reason,</hi> and that no man can be truely said to be a <hi>rationall man,</hi> who is not a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man;</hi> for the more <hi>Religious</hi> any man is, the more he seeks himselfe and his owne happinesse; the more <hi>irreligious</hi> he is, the more he <hi>ruinateth and destroyeth himselfe.</hi>

               <p>But now in the third place, besides this lawfull, and this heavenly, and blessed selfe seeking, there is a <hi>sinfull, cursed, and devilish selfe-seeking,</hi> a selfe-seeking which is complained on in the Text, <hi>inconsistent and incompossible,</hi> with a true Christ-seeking, which is the root of all the miseries that have hapned to this Nation.

               <p n="2">2. When a Christian seeks his <hi>owne things,</hi> and the <hi>things of Christ</hi> also, but seeks his owne things <hi>antecedently</hi> to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63009:12"/>
                  <hi>things of Christ.</hi> When he first seeks his owne things, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the things of Christ; of this the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> complanes, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11. The people said, <hi>It was not time to build Gods house, but it was time to build their owne houses.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Heavens</hi> over them were as <hi>brasse,</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> withheld her <hi>fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. When a man seeks his owne things, and the things of Christ also, but seeks his own things, <hi>chiefly and principally,</hi> not onely before, but more then the things of Christ, and that both in his value and esteem, and in his love and affection. When a man <hi>prizeth</hi> his owne profit and preferment, and <hi>loveth</hi> his owne praise and glory more than the profit, praise and honour of Christ and his Gospel. Such were the <hi>Gade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi> who preferred their Hogges before Christ. Such were the <hi>Merchants and Farmers, Mat.</hi> 21. 3. who made light of the call of Christ, and preferred their Farmes and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing before Christ and his Gospel. Such was <hi>Demas,</hi> who forsook <hi>Paul</hi> and embraced the present world, and such were the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> John 12. 43. <hi>Who loved the praise of Men, more than the praise of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. When a Christian seeks his <hi>owne things</hi> in seeking the <hi>things of Christ,</hi> when he <hi>pretends</hi> to seek the things of Christ, and yet intends no such thing, but seeks <hi>himselfe</hi> even under <hi>colour</hi> of seeking the things of Christ. Such a one was <hi>Jehu,</hi> who pretended a great deale of zeale for the Lord of Hoasts. <hi>Come</hi> (said he to <hi>Jonadab) and behold my zeale,</hi> &amp;c. but he did but pretend a zeale for God, his zeal was to purchase the Kingdome to himselfe. Such a one was <hi>Balaam,</hi> who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that if he had a house full of Gold and Silver offered him, he would not goe beyond the Commandement of God, and yet notwithstanding he did but counterfeit, for he loved the wages of iniquity, and was mad after the preserments that <hi>Balac</hi> proffered him. Such another was <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Silver-Smith, who pretended a zeal to the great <hi>Goddesse Diana,</hi> and therefore caused an uproare against <hi>Paul</hi> to defend the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse, but it was the gaine he got by making Shrines for <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> that was the principle that set him on worke, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Diana,</hi> but intended himselfe, he had <hi>dolum in idolo,</hi> as one saith.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:63009:12"/>
5. When a man seeks his owne things, when they stand in <hi>competition with,</hi> and in <hi>opposition to</hi> the things of Christ, when things come to so narrow a bridge, that either he must part with Estate, Liberty, and Life, or with Christ and a good Conscience: If he chooseth to part with Christ and a good Conscience, rather than with his Liberty, Estate or Life, this is a wicked self-seeker. Such a one was the <hi>young man</hi> in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, who <hi>forsook Christ,</hi> rather than he would part with his <hi>great possessions.</hi> Such was <hi>Spyra,</hi> who himself tels the story; that he <hi>placed Wife, Children, Liberty, Estate and Life, in one part of the ballance;</hi> And <hi>God, Christ, the Gospel, and a good Conscience in the other, and forsook the last to preserve the first.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The last head of this Monster is, when a Christian seeks the good of his <hi>Body,</hi> to the prejudice of his <hi>Soule,</hi> when he bestoweth all his time, all his strength, and all his cares and indeavours, in providing for his perishing carcasse, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects to provide for his eternall <hi>Soule,</hi> when he layeth up all his treasure upon earth, but hath no treasure layed up in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when he is <hi>anxiously solicitous</hi> for his comfortable living in this world, but strangely <hi>neglectfull,</hi> to take care for his happy living in the other world, this is a sinfull, cursed, and devilish self-seeking. So much in answer to the second que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:63009:13"/>
Cant. 8. 6, 7. If we did love the Lord Jesus and his Gospel, in good earnest, we would rather part with Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Estate, Life, and all our own things, than lose the things of Christ as the blessed Martyrs did. But because there are few men that love Jesus Christ in sincerity, hence it is that most men seek their owne things, and not the things of Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This proceedeth from that <hi>cursed selfe-love,</hi> which is in all men by nature. Of this you shall read, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3. 2, 3, 4, 5. where <hi>selfe-love</hi> is placed in the <hi>fore-front</hi> as the cause and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot of all the other sins there named. <hi>Selfe-love</hi> is like a <hi>great tree,</hi> and eighteen sins as eighteen branches sprouting out from this root, because men are <hi>lovers of themselves,</hi> therefore they are <hi>covetous, proud, unthankfull, unholy, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God,</hi> &amp;c. From this sinfull self-love proceeds this sinfull self-seeking. As the love of Christ is the <hi>root</hi> of Christ-seeking, so the love of our selves is the <hi>root</hi> of sinfull self seeking.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From that <hi>immoderate</hi> and <hi>inordinate worldly love</hi> which is in all men by Nature: for (as a Martyr well said at the stake) if we should unrip and anatomize a wicked man, we should finde nothing in him but <hi>self-love,</hi> and <hi>worldly love:</hi> by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we love the <hi>Creature</hi> m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. From that <hi>hypocrisie, insincerity, and rottennesse of heart</hi> which is in all men by nature, hence it is that men pretend Jesus Christ, but intend their own private interest, because of the hypocrisie and falsenesse of their hearts. Thus the Pharisees, who were Hypocrites, under <hi>pretence made long prayers that they might devour widdows houses,</hi> Mat. 23. 14. Thus <hi>Herod</hi> pretends to worship Christ, when his intendment was to <hi>worry</hi> him, Mat 2. 8. Thus <hi>Jesebel</hi> proclaimeth a Fast, and pretends Religion, but intends onely to put <hi>Naboth</hi> to death, and to get his Vineyard. Thus <hi>Absolem</hi> covers over his Rebellion with the faire cloak of Religion, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 7. There are two things that are in all men by nature:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To make a <hi>shew of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:63009:13"/>
2. To cover over all manner of wickedness under the shew of Religion; Ungodlinesse is so odious, that if it should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in its own colours, all men would abhorre it; and therefore as the Devill never sheweth himself but under some handsome form, sometimes under <hi>Samuels</hi> mantle, sometimes transformed into an Angel of light; so doth sin and iniquity alwaies appeare under the form of godlinesse. The Apostle tells 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. that in the last times there should be men, who <hi>should be lovers of themselves, treacherous, heady, high-minded, without naturall affection,</hi> &amp;c. having a <hi>form of godlinesse;</hi> which last words are to be understood <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to all the former sins. They should be <hi>Covenant-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> having a <hi>form of godlinesse,</hi> covetous, false accus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemous self-lovers, <hi>having a form of godlinesse.</hi> They should (through the Hypocisie that is in them) cover all their sins under the <hi>vizard</hi> of a form of godlinesse.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This sinfull self-seeking ariseth from that <hi>spirituall igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and blindnesse</hi> which is in all men by nature. There is no wicked man rightly understands what it is to seek himself: for he thinks, that if he seeks to satisfie his corrupt self, he seeks himself; if he seeks the good of his body with the neglect of his soule, he seeks himself. He thinks that if he seeks his own ease, gain, safety, and preferment, without looking after the things of Christ, that he seeks himself. Thus did the rich Fool, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. who built his barnes bigger, and said, <hi>soule take thy ease,</hi> &amp;c. he supposed that he sought his own happinesse in so doing: and so did the <hi>rich Glutton, when he cloathed himselfe in purple, and fared deliciously ever day,</hi> &amp;c. But now did a wicked man convincingly understand, that this <hi>self-seeking</hi> is <hi>self-hating,</hi> and <hi>self-destroying:</hi> That the rich Glutton by <hi>pampering</hi> his body, <hi>damned</hi> his soule: that the rich Fool, by laying up goods for a <hi>few yeares,</hi> lost his soule to all <hi>eternity:</hi> That he that <hi>denieth himself most, seeks himself most,</hi> He that <hi>serves God best, seeks himself most:</hi> He that seeks the <hi>glory of God</hi> before his <hi>owne glory,</hi> and the <hi>good of Church and State</hi> more than his <hi>own good,</hi> seeks himself most: that he that loseth his life for Christ, shall finde a better life in Christ. Did he (I say) convincingly believe this, he would not sinfully seek himself:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63009:14"/>
Therefore this sinfull self-seeking proceedeth from that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ignorance and blindnesse that is in all by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Lastly, it springs from that <hi>spirituall self-deceit</hi> and <hi>soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delusion</hi> that is in all men by nature: Every man by nature, is <hi>(Narcissus</hi> like) in love with himself, blinde in his own cause, and apt to think that he seeks the things of Christ, when he doth not, and that he doth not seek his own things in <hi>oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to, <hi>competition</hi> with, or comparison of the things of Christ; even as the Philosopher, who could not be perswaded, but that snow was black, or the mad Athen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>an, hat all the ships that came to <hi>Athens</hi> were his. So there are multitudes of Christians, who fancy to themselves, that they do seek the things of Christ, when it is apparent to others that they doe not: and by this self-deceit couzen themselves into Hell. Thus you see the cursed roots from whence this sinfull self-seeking proceeds.</p>

                  <hi>Answ</hi> 1. If the seeking of thine own things take up the first, best, and most of thy time. If thy marrow and strength of thy Soule, goe out after them, if thou makest them thy <gap reason="foreign">

If thou mournest more for <hi>personall miseries,</hi> than for the <hi>desolations of Sion,</hi> it is a signe thou mindest thine owne things more than the things of Christ, this is a frame of spirit, quite opposite to true Saintship. <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah, David, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> were more afflicted with the miseries of the Church then their owne.</p>

night, as <hi>Nichodemus</hi> did, and the more thou hast of the world, the lesse thou appearest for Christ and his Gospel; the more honours, the more fearfull: If the <hi>preserving</hi> of thine owne things make thee <hi>betray</hi> the things of Christ by <hi>sinfull silence,</hi> or <hi>base cowardise,</hi> this is a sign thou preferrest thine own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest before the interest of Christ.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the seeking of thine own things make thee seek to find out <hi>excuses,</hi> and <hi>vaine pretences,</hi> to hinder thee from appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for Christ, this is a sign, &amp;c, I read <hi>Luke</hi> 14 18. when the Servant was sent to fetch the Guests to the great Supper of the Gospel, they <hi>all with one consent, began to make excuse,</hi> &amp;c. The times wherein we live, are very sinfull and perillous: the <hi>Truths and Ministry of Christ</hi> are trampled under feet, <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> neglected. Now God by us his Ambassadors, calls upon you to appear for his Truths, and for his Gospel ministrie, and Gospel-ordinances. Meth nks I hear the Nobleman say, <hi>I have a great estate to lose, pray have me excused:</hi> I heare the rich Citizen say, <hi>I shall be utterly undone in my trading, pray have me excused:</hi> I heare the voluptuous Epicure say, <hi>I have married a wife, pray have me excused.</hi> Take it for a certain rule, <hi>If the seeking of these outward things puts thee upon excuses, thou seekest them sinfully:</hi> For if you look into the text forementioned, you will finde that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses there made were</p>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Unreasonable and unconscionable.</hi> For they made those things <hi>laqueos Diaboli,</hi> snares and impediments to hinder them from Christ, which would have been <hi>vincula obedientiae,</hi> motives and incouragements to bring them to Christ.</p>

                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:63009:17"/>
5. Lastly, If when thine owne things and the things of Christ come in <hi>competition,</hi> and thou must either part with the one or the other, if thou choosest as <hi>Spyra</hi> did, and as the young man in the Gospel did, rather to part with Christ and his Gospel, than with thy profit and preferment, this is a sure note that thou seekest thine own things, before and more than the things of Christ. I read of <hi>Tiberius</hi> Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he sent to the Senate to receive Christ into the number of their Gods, but they refused to doe it upon this account, because if they received him, they must reject all their other Gods, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chose rather to renounce Jesus Christ, than to receive him, and part with the rest of their feigned Deities. If thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncest and rejectest the Lord Christ and his Truths, rather than thou wilt lose thy creature-enjoyments, thou art a sinful self-seeker of the highest forme.</p>
               <p>But now on the contrary, If thou pursuest after the things of Christ in the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>chiefe place;</hi> If thou <hi>mournest</hi> more for <hi>Church desolations</hi> than <hi>personall miseries;</hi> If the more <hi>wealth</hi> thou hast, the more <hi>couragious</hi> thou art for God, and art glad, that thou hast an Estate to lose for Christs cause; If the seeking of thine owne things doe not put thee upon ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vaine, frivolous, and unconscionable excuses; If thou art like unto <hi>Hormisdas,</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Persia,</hi> who was deposed from all his Honours because he would not deny his Religion, and afterwards restored again, and a little after solicited again to deny Christ and his truths, but he rent his purple robe, and laid all his honours at the foot of the Emperour, and said, <hi>Si propter ista me denegaturum Christum put as, ea denuò accipe.</hi> If you <hi>thinke</hi> to <hi>gaine</hi> me to deny Christ for the <hi>re-obtaining</hi> of my honours, take them <hi>all back againe:</hi> If this be the frame of thy heart, it is a certaine token that thou prizest, lovest and seekest the things of Christ before, and more then thine owne things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third sort of those who are guilty of this sinfull selfe-seeking are <hi>such who pretend to seek the things of Christ, but seek their owne things, under colour of seeking the things of Christ,</hi> who hold forth the preservation and propagation of Religion as a <hi>stalking horse,</hi> to catch men by, as a <hi>blinde</hi> to deceive the

Therefore <hi>Antichristianisme</hi> is called a <hi>Mysterie of iniquity,</hi> that is, iniquity covered over with faire shewes and pretences of godlinesse; What Murders, what Treasons hath not the Pope committed under the colour of defending the Catholique Religion? under pretence of being <hi>Peters</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, and of having <hi>

               <p>What I affirme of Papists and Jesuites, the like I say of all the Errors and Heresies that have been broached in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world; The Apostle tells us, that the first Authors of Heresies and Schismes were great selfe seekers. Men <hi>greedy</hi>

Such a one was <hi>Pelagius</hi> (one of the greatest enemies to the Doctrine of Grace that ever the Church had) who made such a shew of godlinesse, that when <hi>Hierome</hi> first wrote against his Heresies,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63009:18"/>
he was forced to conceale his name, lest by appearing to write on purpose against him, his book should have been rejected by the people, who did so highly magnifie him.</p>
               <p>Let me adde, This is a sinne which not onely <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Jesuits, Schismaticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but most <hi>Christians</hi> in the world are tainted withall. It is a most true saying, <hi>Pauci amant Iesum propter Iesum,</hi> there are <hi>few,</hi> and but <hi>very few,</hi> who <hi>love Christ for Christs sake:</hi> Most people follow <hi>Christ</hi> for the <hi>loaves,</hi> and make <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>serve</hi> their own ends and interest. Let a Man be to <hi>marry a Wife,</hi> and he will in words pretend, that it is <hi>Religion and Godlinesse</hi> that he most of all desires; but if you had a window to look into his heart, you will finde that it is <hi>Money</hi> which is his chiefe aime. But amongst all sorts of Men, the <hi>great States-men,</hi> and <hi>deep Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititians</hi> are most eminently guilty of this sin, who usually bring Religion upon the stage meerly to usher in their <hi>Politick designes.</hi> It is a cursed <hi>Maxim</hi> in <hi>Machiavel,</hi> that <hi>Kings and Princes should labour after a shew of Religion, but not look much after the substance;</hi> For the <hi>substance</hi> would be a burden, but the <hi>shew</hi> of it would be very usefull for the carrying on of their own ends and designes. This wicked advise and counsell is followed by many Kingdoms &amp; Common-wealths at this day: there was scarce ever any <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Church-reformer</hi> who did reforme <hi>Religion</hi> for <hi>Religions sake,</hi> but for his <hi>owne ends,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be revenged of his enemies, or to gaine Church-reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, or to be a coy-Duck, to draw a party to side with him. Let me give in a few Examples;</p>
               <p>It pleased God so to order affaires, in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eights time, that the <hi>Popes supremacy</hi> was abolished in <hi>England:</hi> But what was the principle that moved the King to doe this? was it out of love to the true Religion? or was it not rather that thereby he might be revenged of the Pope, who would not allow of his Divorce from his first Wife?</p>
               <p>I have read of <hi>Maximilian</hi> Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, professed a great deale of zeale after Reformation; and especially, in plucking down golden Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But the story saith, that it was not so much out of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63009:19"/>
                  <hi>hatred</hi> to the Images, as out of love to the <hi>gold,</hi> which made him undertake it.</p>
               <p>In the History of the Civill Warres in <hi>France,</hi> I read that when the Princes of the blood fell out one with another, one party called in the <hi>Protestants</hi> to their assistance, not out of love to <hi>Religion,</hi> but that thereby they might gaine a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>That which I say of Kingdomes and Common-wealths, the like I say of Armies; I read of <hi>Goliahs sword hid in a cloth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Ephod, 1 Sam.</hi> 2. 9. The <hi>sword</hi> never appeares to the world under <hi>bloudy colours,</hi> but alwayes <hi>cloathed</hi> with a <hi>linnen Ephod,</hi> pretending Reformation of abuses in Church and State. But it is worth remembring, that this sword was the <hi>sword of Goliah,</hi> who was a <hi>defier</hi> of the <hi>Israel of God,</hi> and a great <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Religion.</hi> The summe of all amounts to this, that in all ages of the Church, especially in times of <hi>Civil Warre,</hi> and in times of <hi>Reformation,</hi> there are thousands that hold forth to the world, in their words and Declarations, a sincere desire to propagate the <hi>Gospel</hi> and the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and to advance the pure <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet notwithstanding minde nothing really and inwardly, but their preferment and advancement.</p>

If thou art <hi>as zealous</hi> for the advancement of Religion and Reformation, when it doth not concerne thy <hi>int rest,</hi> as <hi>when it doth;</hi> this is a certaine signe thou seekest the things of Christ in sincerity: Thus it was with <hi>Moses,</hi> in the <hi>Rebellion of Corah and his company,</hi> there was a <hi>conjunction of interests;</hi> the conspiracy was against God and <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es,</hi> but the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Golden calfe,</hi> was onely against the <hi>interest</hi> of <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, Moses</hi> was not prejudiced by it, and yet he was every way as zealous
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63009:19"/>
for the <hi>glory of God</hi> in the <hi>latter,</hi> as in the <hi>former.</hi> But now on the contrary, if thou drivest <hi>furiously</hi> when any gaine is to be got by a Reformation, but very <hi>heavily</hi> and <hi>slowly,</hi> when thy interest is not at all concerned, this is a signe that thou makest <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> for thine owne ends. Thus it was with <hi>Iehu,</hi> he had a <hi>double Idolatry</hi> to root o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of <hi>Baal,</hi> and of <hi>Ieroboams Calves;</hi> he <hi>destroyed</hi> the first, but <hi>continued</hi> the second, because it was against his interest to abolish it. Thus it is with many Masters of Families, if their Servants play the theeves, they will cry out against them as dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of God; but let the same Servants prophane the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> or abuse the <hi>name of God</hi> by <hi>vaine Oaths,</hi> they are not troubled at it, because it is not against their private interest.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A <hi>pretender</hi> to the things of Christ, if he undertakes to doe service for <hi>Church or State,</hi> he will doe it by <hi>halves,</hi> so far as it makes for his interest and no farther. This is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the Reformation of Religion in most places of the Christian world is but a <hi>patcht Reformation,</hi> and as a <hi>Cake halfe baked,</hi> because that <hi>States and Kingdomes</hi> mould the <hi>Reformation,</hi> not according to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> but according to <hi>State-interest.</hi> Thus it was in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eights time, he thrust out the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> because it furthered his designe of a second Marriage, but he continued much of the Popish Religion, and made <hi>six Articles</hi> called <hi>A whip, with six strings,</hi> which were the death of many godly men. <hi>Erasmus</hi> hath a notable saying of <hi>Luther,</hi> That he had been a good man, had he not medled too much with the <hi>Monks bellies,</hi> and the <hi>Popes triple Crowne,</hi> the Pope was willing to yield to a Reformation of the Church, so far as it might consist with the upholding of his <hi>triple Crowne,</hi> and no farther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>pretender</hi> to the things of Christ when he hath got what he aimes at, will <hi>leave Christ wholly,</hi> and <hi>lay aside</hi> all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. As the <hi>Angels</hi> who appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and divers others, <hi>assumed bodies,</hi> not out of love to the bodies they assumed, but onely to <hi>doe their errant,</hi> and when they had done it laied them aside. So there are many who <hi>assume a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63009:20"/>
profession of Religion</hi> for the pursuing of their ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, which when they have obtained they lay aside, as the <hi>Fisherman did his Net, when he was made Pope;</hi> when he was an <hi>Abbot,</hi> and then a <hi>Bishop,</hi> and then a <hi>Cardinal,</hi> he would have his <hi>Net</hi> spread for a <hi>Table-cloath,</hi> to put him in minde of his meane and poor originall; But when he came to be Pope, he then commanded his <hi>Servants</hi> to lay aside his <hi>Net,</hi> for now he had caught what he had been so long <hi>Fishing</hi> for.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that seeks his owne things, under <hi>pretence</hi> of seeking the things of <hi>Christ,</hi> will <hi>walke contrary</hi> to his <hi>Protestations, Declarations, Vowes</hi> and <hi>Covenants,</hi> even then, when he seems outwardly to be most solemne and serious in making of them. Thus did <hi>Balaam,</hi> he protesteth, that if he had an house full of Gold given him, he could not doe any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the will of God, and yet at the same time, he goeth with the Messengers sent by <hi>Balac.</hi> Are there not many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, who when they <hi>Covenanted with hands lifted up to Heaven, to endeavour the extirpation of error and Heresie, and whatsoever was contrary to sound Doctrine, did even at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same time, secretly foment and countenance the things they Covenanted against?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Lastly, He that <hi>pretends</hi> to the things of Christ, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends</hi> his own, <hi>cares</hi> not <hi>by what wayes</hi> and <hi>meanes</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth his ends, nor by what kind of persons; whether the <hi>wayes</hi> be <hi>lawfull</hi> or <hi>unlawfull,</hi> the <hi>persons</hi> good or bad, it is all one to him so he may obtaine his <hi>ambitious intendments,</hi> which is a certaine signe of a notorious hypocrite. For <hi>he that truly and sincerely indeavours to promote the Glory and Honour of Christ, will never goe out of Christs way to obtaine his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.</hi> For Christ will be more <hi>dishonoured</hi> by his sin, than ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by his indeavours, though never so laborious and sincere.</p>
               <p>Let us I beseech you examine our selves, according to these severall notes and markes, whether we be guilty of this <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cursed and Devilish selfe-seeking.</hi> And know, that if this sinne rule and raigne in us, it makes us accessary to a <hi>foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fould murder;</hi> It makes us <hi>selfe-murderers, Church</hi> and <hi>State-murderers,</hi> and <hi>Christ-murderers.</hi> It brings us under a <hi>double

This is not <hi>selfe-seeking</hi> but <hi>selfe-hating</hi> and <hi>selfe-destroying:</hi> he that <hi>seeks</hi> to give <hi>satisfaction</hi> to his <hi>corrupt selfe,</hi> is just like a <hi>Man</hi> who gives <hi>strong wine</hi> to his <hi>friend in a high Feaver,</hi> which is not to <hi>love</hi> him, but to <hi>kill him.</hi> He that seeks to please his <hi>sinfull selfe,</hi> seeks to strengthen his <hi>disease,</hi> to <hi>maintaine</hi> that within him, which <hi>God hateth,</hi> and to <hi>nourish</hi> that which will <hi>destroy</hi> his Soule. He that seeks the <hi>welfare</hi> of his <hi>body,</hi> and neglects the <hi>welfare</hi> of his <hi>soule,</hi> destroyes (as I have said) both <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soul.</hi> This is just as if a <hi>Husbandman</hi> in time of <hi>Harvest</hi> should gather in his <hi>stubble,</hi> &amp; leave his <hi>corne</hi> to be <hi>devoured by hoggs.</hi> Just like a Father who takes care to <hi>feed</hi> &amp; <hi>cloath</hi> his children, but not to instruct and teach them. In a word, he that seeks his owne ease and safety, his owne gaine and credit, his owne pleasure and satisfaction, and neglecteth and slighteth the things of Christ, this Man is the greatest <hi>selfe-hater,</hi> and <hi>selfe-destroyer;</hi> For he <hi>that sesks not the interest of Christ, shall never have any interest in Christ.</hi>

               <p>

Thus I have put an end to the Sermon of selfe-seeking, Oh that I could put an end to the sinne of selfe-seeking! Two things I dare affirme:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That this sin hath been the <hi>Originall cause of all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glands miseries.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That it will never be <hi>well with England,</hi> nor shall we ever see <hi>better dayes,</hi> till this <hi>sinne be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Let us <hi>goe to Christ,</hi> and labour <hi>by Faith,</hi> to fetch power from his Death, to crucifie and mortifie this sinne; Let it be our daily prayer, that <hi>England may have more Christ-seekers, and fewer selfe-seekers;</hi> or which is all one, <hi>That God would make us all true selfe-seekers, by making us true Christ-seekers.</hi>
