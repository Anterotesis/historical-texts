            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shou'd not preſume to take up any part of that time, which Your Grace ſo happily employs in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conſervation of a whole Nation; nor to divert the reſt of this honourable Board from thoſe important Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which uſually call your Lordships hither; were I not under an Obligation both of Gratitude and Duty, to be an Interpreter for thoſe poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, lately come out of <hi>France,</hi> to take Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary with you: and to expreſs for them and in their names, as they have earneſtly deſired me, a part of that grateful ſenſe, which they have, and will for ever preſerve, of your Lordships Chriſtian Charity and Generoſity towards them: This they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I aſſure you, acknowledg'd to Heav'n in their Pray'rs, but cou'd not be ſatisfied, till they had made their ſolemn and publick Acknowledgments to their Noble Benefactors.</p>
            <p>Life and Religion are the two things moſt dear and valuable of all upon earth: Life is the ground of all the Good and Happineſs we enjoy in this world, and Religion is the foundation of all the Felicities we hope for in that to come; ſo that thoſe perſons that are depriv'd both of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Life, and the Profeſſion and Exerciſe of their Religion, may juſtly be look'd upon as the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48644:3"/>
trueſt objects of pity that we can meet with in this world; and by the ſame rule, thoſe that have a lively ſympathy with ſuch, have the true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a Chriſtian Spirit, and are the true examples of a Chriſtian Practice.</p>
            <p>What extream Hardships and Sufferings thoſe Proteſtants were under in their own Country, both as to their Livelihood and Religion, is too ſad and too notorious a truth, as well as too big a Subject for me now to enlarge upon. The many Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations which their Prince made againſt them, for pulling down and demolishing moſt of their Churches, and excluding them from all Trades and Preferments, are well known, they cou'd neither ſerve God, nor enjoy themſelves; They are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to quit their Country, and yet by their hard u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and perſecution, in effect, not ſuffer'd to ſtay.</p>
            <p>The Cry of that Egyptian-like Bondage and Slavery, they groaned under, that entred into the ears of the Lord of Hoſts, entred alſo into your noble and charitable Hearts, and there has met with Compaſſion and Pity; and by your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Example and Charity you have ſet your ſelves Patterns to this whole Nation: By it you have excited the general Beneficence of all; and by it, no leſs than by your Orders, you have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd this great City (and I hope will shortly after, the whole Kingdom) into an Obedience to that truly Chriſtian, and royal Law of Beneficence and Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48644:3"/>And altho this be eminent, and extraordinary in its kind, yet it is no wonder that that Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon, who began as early to be good, as to be great, whoſe matchleſs Courteſie and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity are not only known to his Friends, to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to Strangers, but even to his greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; who has learn'd by a long experience, what it is to ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all, rather than his Honour and Religion; no wonder, I ſay, that He shou'd be ready and zealous to relieve thoſe that ſuffer innocently, and for a good Conſcience, and who forſake their All, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than forſake their God.</p>
            <p>Nor is it ſtrange, that that moſt eminent Prelate the Churches Primate in Piety and Learning as well as in Rank and Dignity, <hi>on whom comes daily the Care of all the Churches,</hi> shou'd take care of that ſmall part of the Flock of Chriſt, that are forc'd from their own Sheepfold, to ſeek Food and Protection under ſo great a Shepherd.</p>
            <p>Or that He, whoſe Tribunal is a common San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary to all injur'd perſons, shou'd relieve thoſe that are oppreſs'd and perſecuted, only for their obedience to God, his Goſpel, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>Such a noble and charitable act as this, becomes indeed all this honorable Company whom the King hath choſen for his great Council: You do not only imitate your Royal Patron, and act like the beſt of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48644:4"/>
men, but this is truly to act God-like; for nothing makes us more conformable to the Divine Nature, nor better reſemble his actions, than doing good, and being merciful, as our Heavenly Father is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful. We can't imitate God in many of his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, we can't command the Wind, nor ſtill the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Sea; but we can relieve the ship wrackt, and thoſe that are in miſery, according to our abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; in this we imitate our great Maker, the God of all Comfort and the mighty one to ſave; and ſure 'tis our happineſs as well as our duty ſo to do.</p>
            <p>There are ſome that make long Pray'rs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Widows houſes, and wou'd be thought religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous too; but St. <hi>James</hi> tells us that pure Religion and undefil'd before God and the Father, is this, to help the fatherleſs and the widow. And there is no ſort of Duty more highly Chriſtian, none ſo benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to thoſe that practice it: For we dare affirm that the ſtretching out of our hands towards our poor Brother, will call down more Bleſſings upon us, than the lifting them up in Pray'r all day long.</p>
            <p>Nay, there are no actions, nor perfections, that get us more true love and reſpect in the world, than Charity and Beneficence. The renown of Power and Greatneſs, of Wit and Learning, and the like, may perhapsd well for a while in the fancies and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of men with ſome admiration, &amp; often with fear &amp; envy too; but the remembrance of Goodneſs and Bounty reigns in the heart, with pure affection,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48644:4"/>
without any mixture or allay of contrary paſſion; and when the great ones are either forgotten, or ill ſpoken of, the memory of the charitable and bountiful lives and triumphs over Death and Envy it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And what great Reward doth attend this religious Duty in this world &amp; in that to come, we are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently aſſur'd by the ſacred Word of God. <hi>For God is not unrighteous to forget the work and the labour of your love which you have shewed towards his Name, in that you have miniſtred to the neceſſities of the Saints, and do</hi> ſtill <hi>miniſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have receiv'd and felt the kind effects of your Charity, they have receiv'd it, <hi>as an odour of ſweet ſmell, a ſacrifice acceptable and well pleaſing to God,</hi> and I hope <hi>God alſo will ſupply all your need according to his Riches and Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while, Noble Benefactors, give leave to thoſe whoſe Bowels you have refresh'd, to offer up to you their humble and hearty thanks, not to ſay themſelves. They come with their Lives you have ſo generouſly preſerv'd; but I can't ſay, with their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, alas! moſt of them have none other, but a part of your own. But they come with honeſt Hearts, full of Gratitude towards their Benefactors; full of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty towards the King, the Defender of their Faith, &amp; of their Perſons; of Obedience &amp; Conformity to the beſt Chriſtian ſetled Church: Full of Love &amp; Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of a peaceable temper and diſpoſition towards their new fellow Citizens; and full of Pray'rs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout wishes for the proſperity and welfare of this Church and State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48644:5"/>But however grateful now they be, yet no other return can they yet make for your ſignal Favours vouchſafed unto them, but that uſual one of the poor and needy, Bleſſing, Pray'rs and Thankſgiving.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May he that miniſtreth ſeed unto the ſower,</hi> whoſe <hi>is the earth and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> that great Creator, whom by your Charity you have made your debtor, and <hi>who is able to make all Grace abound towards you, multiply the ſeed</hi> of your Charity <hi>ſown, and increaſe your ſubſtance and the fruits of your Righteouſneſs, that you having an All-ſufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work, being enriched to every good thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May the Lord be for ever gracious unto this good Land. Let Mercy and Truth always meet here toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let Righteouſneſs, Peace and Plenty, wiſe and ſteady Government long continue to kiſs each other.</p>
            <p>And when the righteous and merciful Judge shall appear with his Reward with him, to crown Charity (that Queen and greateſt of all Chriſtian virtues) with eternal Bliſs, may every one of your Lordships hear theſe joyful words, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepar'd for you from the foundation of the World, for I was an hungred, and you gave me meat, I was thirſty, and you gave me drink, naked, and you clothed me: I was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and you took me in.</hi> Which mighty Reward, that every one of your Lordships may be partakers of, shall always be my humble and hearty Pray'r.</p>
