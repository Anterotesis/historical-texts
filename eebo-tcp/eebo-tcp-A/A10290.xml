         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat strange sad silence, doth the world astound?</l>
            <l>Why doth not <hi>Fame's</hi> still eccho'ng
trumpet sound?</l>
            <l>She's grown forgetfull, or else hoarse,
I fear;</l>
            <l>That we, no more victorious sounds can heare.</l>
            <l>'Twas but of late; when as the thundring noise,</l>
            <l>Of doubled triumphs, conquests, and applause</l>
            <l>Fill'd our <hi>Horizon,</hi> and the aire did ring,</l>
            <l>With shouts of praise, to <hi>Swedes</hi> victorious King.</l>
            <l>Was this a dream, or fancied apparition;</l>
            <l>And now is vanisht like a fleeting vision?</l>
            <l>Could all the world be thus deluded? No.</l>
            <l>'Twas surely reall, and no feigned show!</l>
            <l>Those bloudie battels, and those dismall fights,</l>
            <l>We lately heard, were not like vap'rie sights,</l>
            <l>Compos'd of airie breath, which to the eye,</l>
            <l>Two dreadfull <hi>Armies,</hi> grappling do descrie!</l>
            <l>These! These were reall, and thy direfull steel,</l>
            <l>(Victorious Prince!) shall after ages feel!</l>
            <l>And those deep wounds, which in thy furious ire,</l>
            <l>Thou did'st inflict by force of thundring fire,</l>
            <l>Shall leave wide scarres, upon the <hi>German</hi> land;</l>
            <l>Which shall for ever, to their terrour stand!</l>
            <l>This thou hast done allready; and amaz'd</l>
            <l>Remotest kingdomes, where thy deeds are blaz'd.</l>
            <l>But on a suddain, loe! thou dost appeare,</l>
            <l>To stop, in middle of thy full careere!</l>
            <l>All tongues are silent, and our greedie eares,</l>
            <l>Heare nothing now; but terrours, doubts, and fears!</l>
            <l>Or <hi>Fame</hi> her self is dead; or he that gave</l>
            <l>Life unto <hi>Fame,</hi> is sunk into his grave!</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Fame</hi> cannot <hi>die!</hi> Oh! can he die, whose look,</l>
            <l>So many thousands dead at once hath struck?</l>
            <l>What mortall durst give him a wound, whose eye,</l>
            <l>Hath made grimme <hi>Death</hi> to start, and turn awrie?</l>
            <l>Sure he's not dead! <hi>Swethlands</hi> for grief would roar;</l>
            <l>And make their groans heard to our <hi>English</hi> shore;</l>
            <l>If he were dead, whom they have priz'd more deare</l>
            <l>Then their own proper lives, and did not fear</l>
            <l>To runne like <hi>Lions</hi> at their Princes words,</l>
            <l>Upon the mouthes of Canons, points of Swords!</l>
            <l>He's dead I fear! For can he living be,</l>
            <l>And we no spoils, nor further conquests see?</l>
            <l>Can he be living and not heard to thunder;</l>
            <l>To batter cities, and trample kingdomes under?</l>
            <l>Whose very soul, was fire Aethereall pure:</l>
            <l>Such as no mortall bodies can endure!</l>
            <l>His breath was direfull smoke, and from his hands</l>
            <l>Flew show'rs of iron-balls, that quell'd whole lands!</l>
            <l>Can that <hi>Sulphurious</hi> dust, more quick then winde,</l>
            <l>Once toucht with flame. in prison be combinde?</l>
            <l>Not steel, nor iron, nor the hardest brasse,</l>
            <l>Can stay its furie for the shortest space!</l>
            <l>Though mighty mountains prest this living flame;</l>
            <l>Yet would it teare them and an entrance frame,</l>
            <l>His <hi>Hellish</hi> breath, and dismall noise to vent;</l>
            <l>Nor would it cease, till all his furie spent.</l>
            <l>Thus hath it been with <hi>Europes</hi> Northern Starre;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Swedes</hi> Victorious <hi>Prince,</hi> made all for warre:</l>
            <l>Whose <hi>Spirit</hi> toucht with fire from heav'n, did blaze</l>
            <l>Like to some <hi>Comet,</hi> sent for to amaze</l>
            <l>And scourge us mortal wights: whose direfull breath</l>
            <l>Doth shoot down vengeance, terrours, plagues, and death!</l>
            <l>Had <hi>Turk,</hi> and <hi>Tartar,</hi> and the <hi>Triple crown</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That awes the <hi>Christian</hi> world, and treadeth down,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Monarches,</hi> as slaves, themselves in one combin'd;</l>
            <l>This <hi>Heav'n-sent furie</hi> had, like lightning winde,</l>
            <l>Shot through them all; and like to scatter'd corn,</l>
            <l>Their feeble squadrons, had been rent, and torn:</l>
            <l>Till his <hi>Celestiall</hi> vigour were quite spent;</l>
            <l>No <hi>Warres,</hi> no <hi>Ruines</hi> could his ire content!</l>
            <l>But now his date is out, and his <hi>Commission</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Is stopt from heav'n with a new <hi>Prohition!</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He's dead! Oh bitter word! enough to make</l>
            <l>Stones for to weep, and iron hearts to ake!</l>
            <l>So soon, alasse! In so unwisht an houre,</l>
            <l>Is all our joy quell'd, by some secret power!</l>
            <l>Why do we not breath forth such dolefull grones,</l>
            <l>And powre such melting tears; as should hard stones</l>
            <l>Dissolve into salt drops; that they, and we,</l>
            <l>Might so expresse one mournfull <hi>Elegie!</hi>
            </l>
            <l>What! are we spent and drie? I see no teares:</l>
            <l>I heare no grones: no wailings pierce my eares!</l>
            <l>Oh pardon me! I fear my faltring tongue,</l>
            <l>Distract with troubled sorrow doth you wrong!</l>
            <l>'Tis slender grief that doth by weeping vent;</l>
            <l>And `tis not much, that can by teares be spent!</l>
            <l>But this, this sorrow, like a mortall wound,</l>
            <l>Strikes deep, and doth our senses quite astound:</l>
            <l>Lies like a lump of lead, or heavie weight,</l>
            <l>Upon our heart, and presses it so straight,</l>
            <l>That neither sigh nor grone can issue thence;</l>
            <l>But lies as dead, and quite bereft of sense!</l>
            <l>Since then 'tis so: we cannot weep; let's borrow,</l>
            <l>From others help, for to expresse our sorrow,</l>
            <l>Ye glistring lamps above. ye Northern starres,</l>
            <l>That roul about the <hi>Pole,</hi> your frozen Carres!</l>
            <l>In <hi>Thetis</hi> waves, plunge over head and eares,</l>
            <l>That you may have your fill, of brinish teares:</l>
            <l>And by sad influence, make the heav'ns to low'r;</l>
            <l>And to the earth, send down a weeping show'r!</l>
            <l>But chiefly on that place, that cursed ground,</l>
            <l>Where <hi>Adolph</hi> first receiv'd his mortall wound!</l>
            <l>Let never grasse, nor verdant hearb grow there;</l>
            <l>Nor any tree, nor ground it self appeare.</l>
            <l>Let it be all a lake, whose face may look,</l>
            <l>Just like the colour of the Infernall brook:</l>
            <l>Like pichie <hi>Stix,</hi> or black-stream'd <hi>Acheron;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Or like <hi>Cocytus,</hi> or dark <hi>Phlegethon:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That it may seem to all, a mourning vail,</l>
            <l>Which doth the compasse of that ground empale:</l>
            <l>And let its murmuring waves, make such a noise,</l>
            <l>As may expresse to us, the dolefull voice</l>
            <l>Of some, that crie, that roar, that shreik, that groan:</l>
            <l>Of some, that mourn, that weep, that wail, that moan!</l>
            <l>That after ages, to their children may</l>
            <l>Tell this sad storie, when they passe that way.</l>
            <l>These fouls do mourn, for <hi>Swethlands</hi> conqu'ring King:</l>
            <l>But these, whose clamours fearfully do ring.</l>
            <l>Are such, as in this place, died by his power;</l>
            <l>And thus expresse, their horrour to this houre!</l>
            <l>Mean while (renowned <hi>Prince</hi>) sleep thou secure,</l>
            <l>No further pains, nor travels to endure!</l>
            <l>The dreadfull Cannons, which so oft did roar,</l>
            <l>And thunder in thy eares; shall now no more</l>
            <l>Disturb thy rest; nor force thee to arise</l>
            <l>In suddain hast, glut now with sleep thine eyes!</l>
            <l>While that a quire of <hi>Angels</hi> in a ring,</l>
            <l>Shall round about thee blessed musick sing.</l>
