            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT was once the distressed Case of those Mariners in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> that by no means could save themselves from Shipwrack, they rowed and they prayed, and they did what men could doe, and yet the Sea wrought, and the angry waves beat upon them, till that sleepy <hi>Jonah,</hi> for whose sake it was this Evil came upon them, was thrown over-board in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea. It were worth the while to sit down and think in this perilous season of delusion and division, whereby men are all in a Tempest, the great God influencing the storms in his just Indignation; and though there are those that rowe hard and pray hard, no abatement of the danger, but the Heavens are darker and darker over our heads: I say it were worth the while to enquire into the Provocation, what the Cause is of these swellings of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and Innundations of such Seas that we never saw worse, nor more dangerous to destroy us all: like that Tempest upon the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, of which the Apostle gave his Opinion, <hi>That this Voyage would be with hurt and much damage, not only of the Lading and Ship, but also of their Lives,</hi> Act. 27. It is readily confest of all hands amongst those that pretend to the least degree of Wisdom, That sin in general is the Cause of all this. They must assemble themselves amongst those that sit in the Seat of Scorners, and declare themselves to have
<pb facs="tcp:54938:3"/>
taken the highest degree in Atheism and defiance of a God, that will not yield us this point: They must arest the Reins of Providential Government out of Gods hands, and put them into the hands of blind Chance and Fortune, and then the World is like to be well governed; and those of this Belief may chance to get to Heaven, if blind Fortune do but know the way. But now the question will rise, For <hi>whose</hi> sins? and for <hi>what</hi> sins? For the first of these, it must necessarily be granted, that the sins of great men have more of the spirit of Provocation in them, than the sins of men of low degree: and the sins of the Priests are more full of bloody Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances than the sins of the Laity, and the Epidemicalness of sin cryes for Extirpation with a louder voice, than the sins of some few diseased persons that through Incogitancy have made themselves out of frame. And further, the more Mercies and Deliverances men sin against, and the greater Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and the more sacred Vows and Resolutions they sin against, the more is their sin like to bring down such kind of Judgments as shall not be prayed away: And these Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will justifie God in the Equality of his proceedings, if we all perish from off this good Land. But if you ask me for what particular sin, or way of sinning it is that the Lord is angry with us; I would as soon lay the blame upon the Drunkenness of the Nation, as upon any one branch of that Prophaneness that is gone abroad. And the reasons are these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The bewitching, besotting nature of Drunkenness: It doth not turn men into Beasts, as some think, for a Beast scorns it: I do n't know that ever I saw a Beast drunk (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it were a Swine) in my life. But it turns them into Fools and Sots, dehominates them, turns them out of their own Essences for the time, and so disfigures them, that God saith, <hi>Non est haec Imago mea,</hi> This is not my Image; and so cares not what Judgments he lets fall upon their heads: And this Insatuation is more eminently seen in the Poorer sort, that earn their Money hardest, and pay most
<pb facs="tcp:54938:3"/>
for their Drink: For when others pay their Money, these pay their Time also, which is more than their Money, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the loss of Trade and other possible advantages: That others drink Sack cheaper than<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they pay for their Beer and Ale, all things considered; and their poor Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by this Means are in want of Bread for their Mouths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And will not God be avenged upon such a sin as This? Their Money burns in their Pockets, but it will burn worse in their Conscieces, if ever God shew them Mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Drunkenness is the general Rendezvouze of all sin, the common Parent of the greatest Provocations. Even the worst of men when they are drunk, do that which if they were so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they would blush to be found guilty of. Men naturally quiet, good humor'd, moderate in sinning, as one may say, when they are themselves; are by Drunkenness metamorphos'd into such Extravagancies, you would not think them to be the same men: Thus having their natural tempers well soak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in strong Liquors, they are framable into any shape. Satan calls for: Would he have a Swearer? give him a Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and there he is: An Adulterer? bring him a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and there he is: A Persecutor, he swears by all that's Sacred, he will root all the Professors out of the Countrey. Satan can mould him into any shape, and raise a Devil out of a <hi>Samuel</hi> by this Artifice. And how can the Sea but boyl, when all the foul Spirits are blowing up a flame underneath? Nations must needs reel, when the Inhabitants can't stand upon their feet; and God must needs strike, when he hath an advantage given him to cut off all sorts of sins at one blow.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And as to Health-drinking, it is an Engine invented by the Devil, to carry on the Sin of Drunkenness with the greater ease and Infallibility, by which men must either be suspected of their Loyalty to their Sovereign, or Respect to their Friends (neither of which any sober man can be defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in) if they refuse it, though upon conscientious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: and so it becomes a great snare to those that would
<pb facs="tcp:54938:4"/>
be temperte: Every man at all times hath not consideration enough to give him a convincing Evidence, that Loyalty and Respect to others, is not proper to be shewn in so absurd a Method; and so this poysoned Health goeth down (right or wrong) the Throats of those that do n't think what they do. Here the sin lies chiefly, though not only, upon the Imposer; as our Saviour said, <hi>Wo to the World because of Offences, but wo be to him by whom the Offence comes:</hi> Wo to the Imposers of Healths, which commonly happens to be some ordinary Fellow in the Company, that hath nothing but that single Ceremony to commend his Love or Loyalty to the World, who also having a tumor of Pride in him, hath no way to overtop and command his Superiours, but upon the advantage of the Laws of Drunkenness.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is a Custom of Sinning only proper for those that are upon the design of Mortgaging their Senses: for there is no sence in it or reason for it? How can any man drink anothers Health? Or by what new kind of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation can his Health be converted into a glass of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor? or if so! what's the man the better, to have his health drank into my Body, and then piss'd out again against the walls? And why not Eat his Health, rather than Drink it? and so bring up a new fashion of Eating of Healths, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Intemperances of the sin of Gluttony.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it is expressed by drinking a health to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of, &amp;c. and here's Nonsence upon the neck of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which is perfect Foolery, as patch upon patch is plain Beggery: A health to the Confusion—If they mean a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion to the health, as I think they do, why is it exprest quite contrary to what they mean? unless it be to give us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that men that will begin a health are enter'd upon speaking of Nonsence, and may be lookt on as half drunk already.</p>
            <p>But laying all this aside, they say all these are Modes and Ceremonies in drinking; and their meaning is no more, but only to pray for the Health and Prosperity of such and such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:54938:4"/>
Which is the reason they are at it in a posture of Prayer, standing up, standing bare, sometimes kneeling upon their knees, as Supplicants do to God Almighty: But will any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional man think these men at Prayers? Are these praying postures? Did God ever command, or his People ever apply to the Throne in this manner of Address? Have men lived to this age, and cannot yet distinguish between drinking intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately and praying fervently? as if to Pray were to Drink, and to Drink were to Pray! Worse than Pagan Idolatry, to offer at the Throne of the Great God, with a glass of Wine in our hand! It may be praying to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> but not to God. Heaven must needs be shut against these Prayings: And to what purpose is any mans health prayed for, by such kind of Prayers, so circumstanced, as we are very sure that God will throw them back as dung in the faces of those that thus disorderly put them up? What hast thou to do to take his Name in thy Mouth, when thou hatest to be reformed? To see the Postures of Health-drinkers, singing, and roaring, hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and carousing, and Huzzaing after a new fashion, sometimes quarrelling, and challenging, and duelling; can any man that hath not his Wits in his Pocket, think these men at Prayers?</p>
            <p>Now because we find by Experience; and from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, that these prodigious kind of Offenders we now speak of, are under no likelihood to be perswaded out of their cursed way by Arguments drawn from the Love of Christ, or Hope of Glory, which are things they do n't trouble their heads about; or fear of Hell, (let them alone till that day;) The Author of these Collections hath very well and to good purpose gather'd up together out of several Authors, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Instances of the Judgments of God taking these Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the very fact, and tacking them up as dreadful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and Examples of his great Abomination of, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Vengeance against this sort of Sinners more specially; that reading these Histories we may prevent being made a History our selves: And though they are but Collections, I do n't know why a good dish may not be twice set upon the
<pb facs="tcp:54938:5"/>
Table. There are several late Instances of Gods Vengeance upon Drunkards, thundred down upon the heads of many of them in our Age; the publication of which is forborn, out of a tender respect to their Relations yet surviving: The next Generation will be able to set forth remarkable Stroaks from Heaven upon some, (and no mean ones neither.) But least I transgress the bounds of a Preface, no more, kind Reader, but my love to thy Soul remembred, with my earnest Prayer to God for the Health of Sion, and all that love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.</p>

               <hi>SEer,</hi> art thou also blind? <hi>Watchman,</hi> art thou also drunk, or asleep? Or hath a Spirit of slumber put out thine Eyes? Up to thy Watch-Tower, what descriest thou? Ah Lord! what end or number is there of the Vanities which mine Eyes are weary of behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? But what seest thou? I see men walking like the tops of trees shaken with the wind, like Masts of Ships reeling on the tempestuous Seas: Drunkenness I mean, that hatefull Night-bird; which was wont to wait for the Twilight, to seek Nooks and Corners, to avoid the howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wonderment of Boyes and Girles; Now as if it were some Eaglet, to dare the Sun-light, to fly abroad at high Noon in every Street, in open Markets and Fairs, without fear or shame, without controul or punishment, to the disgrace of the Nation, the out-facing of Magistracy and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54938:6"/>
Ministry, the utter undoing (without timely prevention) of Health and Wealth, Piety and Vertue, Town and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, Church and Common-wealth. And doest thou like a dumb Dog hold thy peace at these things? dost thou with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Sluggard fold thine hands in thy Bosom, and give thy self to ease and drowsiness, while the envious man causeth the noisomest and basest of Weeds to over-run the choicest <hi>Eden</hi> of God?

And what though some of these deaf Adders will not be charmed nor cured; yea though few or none of this swinish Herd of habitual Drunkards, accustomed to wallow in their mire; yea, deeply and irrecoverably plunged by legions of Devils into the dead Sea of their filthiness? what if not one of them will be washed and made clean, but turn again to their Vomit, and trample the Pearls of all Admonition under feet; yea, turn again and rend their Reprovers with scoffs and scorns, making Jests and Songs on their Ale-bench? Yet may some young ones be deterred, and some Novices reclaimed, some Parents and Magistrates awakened to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and suppress the spreading of this Gangrene: And God have his work in such as belong to his Grace.

say, Woe be to Hypocrites; It's true, wo be to such and all other witting and willing Sinners; but there are no kind of Offenders on whom Woe doth so palpably, inevitably attend, as to you Drunkards. You promise your selves Mirth, Pleasure, and Jollity in your Cups; but for one drop of your mad Mirth, be sure of Gallons and Tons of Woe, Gall, Wormwood, and bitterness here and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Other Sinners shall taste of the Cup, but you shall drink off the dregs of God's Wrath and Displeasure. <hi>To whom is Strife?</hi> You talk of good fellowship and friendship, but Wine is a rager and tumultuous, a mocker, a make-bate, and sets you a quarrelling, and medling. When wit's out of the Head, and strength out of the Body, it thrusts even Cowards and Dastards, unfenced and unarmed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to needless Frayes and Combats: And then to whom are Wounds, broken Heads, blew Eyes, maimed Limbs? You have a drunken by-word, Drunkards take no harm; but how many are the mishaps and untimely misfortunes that betide such, which though they feel not in drink, they carry as marks and brands unto their Grave. You pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you drink Healths, and for Health; but to whom are all kind of Diseases, Infirmities, Deformities, pearled Faces, Palsies, Dropsies, Head-aches, if not to Drunkards?</p>
            <p>All Interpreters agree, that he means some most viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Serpent, whose Poyson is pleasant and deadly. All the woes he hath mentioned before, were but as the sting of some Emmet, Wasp or Nettle, in comparison of this Cockatrice, which is even unto death; death speedy, death painful, and woful death, and that as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and inevitably as <hi>Opium</hi> procureth Sleep, as <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore</hi> Purgeth, or any Poyson killeth.</p>
            <p>Three forked is the Sting, and threefold is the Death it procureth to all that are stung therewith. The first is, the Death of Grace; the second is, of the Body; the third is, of Soul and Body eternal. All sin is the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son wherewithall the old Serpent and red Dragon enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54938:7"/>
the Soul of Man, but no sin (except it be that which is unto Death) so mortal as this, which though not ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonably, yet for the most part is also irrecoverably and inevitably unto death. Seest thou one bitten with any other Snake, there is hope and help; as the Father said of his Son, when he had information of his Gaming, of his Prodigality, yea, of his Whoring; but when he heard that he was Poysoned with Drunkenness, he gave him for dead, his case for desperate and forlorn.</p>
            <p>The Adulterer and Usurer desire to enjoy their Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but the chiefest pastime of a Drunkard is to heat and overcome others with Wine, that he may discover their nakedness, and glory in their Foyl and folly. In a word, excess of Wine, and the spirit of Grace are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites; the former expells the latter out of the Heart, as Smoak doth Bees out of the Hive; and makes the man a meer Slave and Prey to Satan and his snares; when, by this Poyson he hath put out his Eyes, and spoyled him of his strength, he useth him as the <hi>Philistines</hi> did <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> leads him in a string whither he pleaseth, like a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry drudge, scorn and make-sport to himself and his Imps; makes him grind in the Mill of all kind of Sins and Vices. And that I take to be the reason why Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness is not specially prohibited in any one of the Ten Commandments, because it is not the single breach of any one, but in effect the violation of all and every one: It is no one sin, but all sins, because it is the In let and Sluce to all other Sins. The Devil having moistened and steep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in his Liquor, shapes him like soft Clay, into what mould he pleaseth; having shaken off his Rudder and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, dashes his Soul upon what Rocks, Sands, and Syrts he listeth, and that with as much ease as a man may push down his Body with the least thrust of his Hand or Finger. He that in his right Wits and sober mood seems Religious, modest, chast, courteous, secret; in his drunken fits, swears, blasphemes, rages, strikes, talks fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54938:7"/>
blabs all secrets, commits folly, knows no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Persons or Sexes, becomes wholly at Satans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as a dead Organ, to be enacted at his will and pleasure. Oh that God would be pleased to open the Eyes of some Drunkard, to see what a Dunghill and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion his Soul is become, and how loathsome effects fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon thy spiritual death, and sting of this Cockatrice, which is the Fountain of the other two following, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and eternal death.</p>
            <p>How terrible a Theater of God's Judgments against Drunkards, such as might make their Hearts to bleed and relent, if not their Ears to tingle; to hear of a taste of some few such noted and remarkable Examples of God's Justice, as have come within the compass of mine own notice, and certain knowledge; I think I should offend to conceal them from the World, whom they may happily keep from being the like to others themselves.</p>

               <p n="1">1. AN Alewife in <hi>Kesgrave</hi> near to <hi>Ipswich,</hi> who would needs force three Serving-men (that had been drinking in her House, and were taking their leaves) to stay and drink the three Outs first; that is, Wit out of the Head, Money out of the Purse, Ale out of the Pot; as she was coming towards them with the Pot in her

This Sir <hi>Antheny Felton,</hi> the next Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman and Justice, with divers other Eye-witnesses of her Sickness, related to me; whereupon I went to the House with two or three Witnesses, and inquired the truth of it.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Anno</hi> 1619. A Miller in <hi>Bromeswell</hi> coming home drunk from <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> (as he often did) would needs go and Swim in the Mill-pond; his Wife and Servants knowing he could not Swim, disswaded him; once by intreaty got him out of the Water, but in he would needs go again, and there was Drowned; I was at the House to inquire of this, and found it to be true.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In <hi>Barnwell</hi> near to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> one at the Sign of the <hi>Plough,</hi> a lusty young man, with two of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and one Woman in their company, agreed to drink a Barrel of strong Beer, they drank up the Vessel; three of them died within twenty four hours, the fourth hardly escaped after great Sickness. This I have under a Justice of Peace his Hand near dwelling, besides the common fame.</p>

A Butcher in <hi>Hastingfield</hi> hearing the Minister in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh against Drunkenness, being at his Cups in the Ale-house, fell a jesting and scoffing at the Minister and his Sermons; and as he was drinking, the Drink, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Cup quackled him, stuck so in his Throat, that he could get it neither up nor down, but strangled him presently.</p>
               <p n="6">6. At <hi>Tillingham</hi> in <hi>Dengy</hi> Hundred in <hi>Essex,</hi> three young men meeting to drink Strong-waters, fell by degrees to

               <p n="7">7. At <hi>Bungey</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> three coming out of an Ale-house in a very dark Evening, swore, they thought it was not darker in Hell it self: One of them fell off the Bridge into the water, and was drowned: the second fell off his Horse, the third sleeping on the Ground by the Rivers-side, was frozen to death: This have I often heard, but have no certain ground for the Truth of it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. A Bayliff of <hi>Hadly,</hi> upon the Lords-day, being drunk at <hi>Melford,</hi> would needs get upon his Mare, to ride through the Street, affirming (as the Report goes) That his Mare would carry him to the Devil; His Mare casts him off, and broke his Neck instantly. Reported by sundry sufficient Witnesses.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Company drinking in an Ale-house at <hi>Harwich</hi> in the Night, over against one Master <hi>Russels,</hi> and by him out of his Window once or twice willed to depart; at length he came down, and took one of them, and made as if he would carry him to Prison, who drawing his Knife, fled from him, and was three dayes after ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Sea with the Knife in his hand. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to me by Master <hi>Russel</hi> himself, Maior of the Town.</p>
               <p n="10">10.

               <p n="11">11. A Glasier in <hi>Chancery-Lane</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> noted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly for Profession, fell to a common course of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereof being oft by his Wife and many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an friends admonished, yet presuming much of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to himself, continued therein; till upon a time, having

surcharged his Stomach with drink, he fell a vomiting, broke a Vein, lay two dayes in extream pain of Body, and distress of Mind, till in the end recovering a little comfort, he died: Both these Examples related to me by a Gentleman of worth upon his own knowledge.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Four sundry Instances of Drunkards wallowing and tumbling in their drink, slain by Carts; I forbear to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because such examples are so common and ordinary.</p>

A Knight notoriously given to Drunkenness, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying sometime Payls of drink into the open Field, to make people drunk withall; being upon a time drinking with Company, a Woman comes in, delivering him a Ring with this Posie, <hi>Drink and die;</hi> saying to him, <hi>This is for you,</hi> which he took and wore, and within a week after came to his end by drinking: Reported by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, and justified by a Minister dwelling within a Mile of the place.</p>

               <p>The Names of the Parties thus punished, I forbear for the Kindreds sake yet living.</p>
               <p>If conscionable Ministers of all places of the Land would give notice of such Judgments, as come within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of their certain knowledge, it might be a great means to suppress this Sin, which reigns every where to the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of our Nation, and high displeasure of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54938:11"/>These may suffice for a taste of Gods Judgments: Easie were it to abound in sundry particular Casualties, and fearful Examples of this nature. Drunkard, that which hath befallen any one of these, may befall thee, if thou wilt dally with this <hi>Cockatrice;</hi> whatever leagues thou makest with Death, and dispensations thou givest thy self from the like. Some of these were Young, some were rich, some thought themselves as wise as thou; none of them ever looked for such ignominious ends, more than thou, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art: if thou hatest such ends, God give thee Grace to decline such courses.</p>
               <p>If thou beest yet insensate with Wine, void of Wit and Fear, I know not what further to mind thee of, but of that third and worst Sting of all the rest, which will ever be gnawing, and never dying: which if thou wilt not fear here, sure thou art to feel there, when the Red Dragon hath gotten thee into his Den, and shall fill thy Soul with the gall of Scorpions, where thou shalt yell and howl for a drop of water to cool thy Tongue withall, and shalt be denied so small a refreshing, and have no other liquor to allay thy thirst but that which the lake of Brimstone shall afford thee: And that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, for that thou wouldest incurr the wrath of the Lamb for so base and sordid a sin as Drunkenness, of which thou mayest think as venially and slightly as thou wilt. But <hi>Paul</hi> that knew the danger of it, gives thee fair warning, and bids thee not deceive thy self, expresly and by name mentioning it among the mortal sins, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding from the Kingdom of Heaven. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Esay</hi> tells thee, That for it <hi>Hell</hi> hath enlarged it self, opened its mouth wide, and without measure; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall the multitude and their pomp, and the jollyest among them descend into it. Consider this, you that are strong to pour in drink, that love to drink sorrow and care away: And be you well assured, that there you shall drink enough for all, having for every drop of your
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54938:11"/>
former Bousings, Vials, yea, whole Seas of God's Wrath, never to be exhaust.</p>
               <p>Now then I appeal from your selves in drink, to your selves in your sober fits. Reason a little the case, and tell me calmly, would you for your own, or any mans pleasure, to gratifie Friend or Companion, if you knew there had been a Toad in the Wine-pot (as twice I have known happened to the death of Drinkers?) or did you think that some <hi>Caesar Borgia,</hi> or <hi>Brasutus</hi> had tempered the Cup? or did you see but a Spider in the Glass, would you, or durst you carouse it off? And are you so simple to fear the Poyson that can kill the Body, and not that which killeth the Soul and Body ever; yea, for ever and ever, and if it were possible for more than for ever, for evermore? Oh thou vain Fellow, what tellest thou me of Friendship, or good Fellowship! wilt thou account him thy Friend, or good Fellow, that draws thee into his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that he may poyson thee? and never thinks he hath given thee right entertainment, or shewed thee kindness enough, till he hath killed thy Soul with his kindness; and with Beer made thy Body a Carkass fit for the Biere, a laughing and Loathing-stock, not to Boys and Girls alone, but to Men and Angels? Why rather sayest thou not to such, What have I to do with you, ye Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> ye poysonful Generation of Vipers, that hunt for the precious life of a man? Oh but there are few good Wits, or great Spirits now a days, but will Pot it a little for company, What hear I? Oh base and low-spirited times, if that were true! If we were fallen into such Lees of Time foretold of by <hi>Seneca,</hi> in which all were so drowned in the dregs of Vices, that it should be Vertue and Honour to bear most drink. But thanks be to God, who hath reserved many thousands of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and without all comparison more witty and valorous than such Pot-wits, and Spirits of the Buttery, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bared their knees to drink health, nor ever needed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54938:12"/>
to whet their Wits with Wine; or arm their Courage with Pot-harness. And if it were so, yet if no such Wits or Spirits shall ever enter into Heaven without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, let my Spirit never come and enter into their Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; ever abhor to partake of their bruitish pleasures, lest I partake of their endless woes. If young <hi>Cyrus</hi> could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to drink Wine, and tell <hi>Astyages,</hi> He thought it to be Poyson, for he saw it metamorphose men into Beasts and Carkases; what would he have said, if he had known that which we may know, that the Wine of Drunkards is the Wine of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> their Grapes, the Grapes of gall; their clusters, the clusters of Bitterness, the Juyce of Dragons, and the venome of Asps.</p>

               <p>THere is a very remarkable Story published by Mr. <hi>Robert Abbot</hi> Minister some years since of <hi>Cranebrook</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> concerning one <hi>William Rogers</hi> an Apothecary there, that was exceeding much given to Drinking, and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath breaking: He was in his general course, as he relates of him, a Young man of a sweet and pleasing temper: It was reported, that the Devil never abused a better Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and he was observed never to Swear or Curse in all his Life, except once; but was often admonished and perswaded by Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> to come to the Church on the Sabbath-dayes; at last he was prevailed with to come, though he had often promised, and failed: The Lords day before in the morning, when as he said he was ready to come to Church, he was taken sick, and betook himself to his Bed; it was but as a fit of an Ague, which being over, he was the next morning in his old course again; but about the middle of the week after, the messenger of Death came, and Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> forthwith addressed himself to him in his Chamber, saying, Oh how often have you deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, your own Soul, and me! and what is now to be done? I fear you will dye, and then what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you? His sickness so prevailed, that it emptied him of any hopes of Life, and filled him with thoughts of his present Guilt, and future Judgment before the great God, who is a consuming fire: He apprehending his own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, made it known to him and others; there was too great a fire within to be Smothered, it burned in his own Soul, and it Lightened from his Heart and Lips, into the Ears and Hearts of those Friends that were about him. One while he cryes out of his sins, saying, I have been a fearful Drunkard, pouring in one draught after another, till one draught could not keep down another; I now would be glad if I could take the least of Gods
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54938:23"/>
Creatures which I have abused: I have neglected my Patients, which have put their Lives in my hands, and how many Souls have I thus murthered! I have wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected Gods House, Service and Worship, and though I purposed to go, God strikes me thus before the day of my promise comes, because I am unworthy to come among Gods people again. Another while he falls to wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Oh, that I might burn a long time in that fire, (pointing to the fire before him) so I might not burn in Hell! Oh that God would grant me but one Year or a Month, that the world might see with what an Heart I have promised to God my amendment! Oh that God would try me a little! but I am unworthy. Another while he speaks to his Companions, praying all to be warned by him to forsake their wicked wayes, lest they go to Hell, as he must do. He forgot not his Servant that was young, calls him to him, and tells him, That he had been a wicked Master to him; But be warned by me, said he; you have a Friend that hath an Iron Furnace, which burns hot a long time, but if you give your self to my sins, you shall be burned in the Furnace of Hell, an hotter Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, millions of millions of Ages: Therefore look to your self, and be warned by my Example, who must be burned in Hell for ever; I must to the Furnace of Hell, millions of millions of Ages. The Minister offered to him the Comforts of the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Promises of the largest size, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that God was delighted to save Souls, and not to destroy them: But he cryed, It was too late, I must be burned in Hell: He pressed him with tears not to cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that Soul for which Christ died; and told him, Christ rejected none that did not reject him: He answered, He had cast off Christ, and therefore he must go to Hell. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten complained, that former Counsels and Prayers might have done him good, but now it was too late; he was no Swearer, Whoremonger, Thief, no scoffer at Religion, no Perjured wretch, nor wilful Lier; yet when Conscience
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54938:23"/>
was awakened, and sate as Judge on him, he confessed his being given to drunkenness, and neglect of mens bodies, and neglect of Prayer and other dutyes, hearing the Word, and keeping the Sabbath-day: which caused him to pass this heavy doom on himself, and at last in Idleness of thoughts and talk he ended his miserable Life: And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever God hath done with his Soul, we are bound to hope the best; this sad example is a warning-piece from Heaven, to warn all young men to leave off their evil courses, lest a worse thing befall them. He desired others might be warned by his Example.</p>

               <head>I shall here give you a short Relation how <hi>Nathaniel Butler,</hi> who murthered his Friend <hi>John Knight</hi> in <hi>Milk-street, London, August 6. Ann. 1657.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himself.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>NAthaniel Butler,</hi> declared that before this Murther committed, he was addicted to divers sins, as Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he himself freely confessed. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:</p>
               <p>1. He was a great Company-keeper, and given to Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much; whereby he gain'd Money and several Watches of Young men, one whereof he restor'd to the Owner after his Conscience was awakened in prison.</p>
               <p>2. He enticed some Servants to purloin from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and sell the Goods; then would he and they go together, and spend the money among themselves.</p>
               <p>3. He lived in Fornication, frequenting the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and the Houses of Harlots; insomuch that (as he himself under his own hand informed me) he judged
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54938:24"/>
this very sin of Whoredom did draw him on to that of shedding blood. Concerning which fact I shall now speak, as also concerning his carriage in Prison, and at his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, being an eye and ear witness thereof.</p>
               <p>4. This <hi>Nathaniel Butler,</hi> came from <hi>Alten</hi> in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> where he was born; and at the time of his apprehension, was an Apprentice with one Mr. <hi>Goodday,</hi> a Drawer of Cloth in <hi>Carter-lane, London;</hi> during which time he became acquainted with one <hi>John Knight,</hi> and Apprentice also in the same City. These two were much together, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when Mr. <hi>Worth (John Knight</hi>'s Master) was gone to <hi>Bristol</hi>-Fair; then did these two young men lye toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther several nights at Mr. <hi>Worth</hi>'s house, at the <hi>Rose</hi> in <hi>Milk-street;</hi> where in the Shop, on Wednesday morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sixth of <hi>August</hi> 1657. <hi>Nathaniel Butler</hi> seeing some Bags of Money, he was thereupon tempted to take away the Life of his Friend and Bed-fellow, that he might se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely convey away the money which he had now seen in the Till of the Shop. After they had been abroad that day, at night they lay again together, the bloody design running still in the mind of <hi>Bulter:</hi> he intending about the dead of the night (for so he expressed himself to me) to destroy the Young man by cutting his Throat: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he took his Knife in his hand, but his Heart would not suffer him to do it; then he laid down the Knife again; yea, he took up and laid down his Knife several times (so he told me) before he acted his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty: But in the morning very early, he did indeed fall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry violently and inhumanely on the Youth, who lay harmlesly asleep upon the bed. The first wound not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mortal, awakened him, whereupon he struggled and made a noise (not considerable enough) which was heard into another room of the same house. Then <hi>Butler</hi> chopt his fist into the mouth of the Young man, and so they two lay striving and tumbling very near half an hour, before the fatal blow was given; but at length, he did
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54938:24"/>
most barbarously murder the Young-man, giving him a very ghastly deadly wound cross the Throat: And then he went down, taking away out of the shop a summ of money in two bags, being about One hundred and ten pounds: And so with his double guilt of Robbery and Murder, leaving his bloody Shirt behind him, and a lock of his own hair in the hand of the dead Young-man, which Hair was pulled off in their striving together, one to commit, the other to prevent the fact; after he had so done, he went to his Masters house in <hi>Carter-lane,</hi> where he privately laid the Money in a new Trunk that he bought with part of the Money. This Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer abode for certain dayes, that is from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thursday to Saturday, at his Masters house unsuspected, following his business at home, as formerly.</p>
               <p>5. Many thoughts and jealousies were working in men, who should be the Murderer: And in a few dayes, one in <hi>Milk-street</hi> (the street where the Murder was done) knowing that <hi>Butler</hi> used sometimes to be with the Young man who was now murder'd, went to <hi>Butlers</hi> Masters house in <hi>Carter-lane,</hi> and spake with him, by whose words and carriage, he supposed he might be guilty, and so caused him to be apprehended: But yet for some small time, the said <hi>Butler</hi> denied the Fact; but at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, That he, and he only did it. After his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he was brought before the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> to whom he declared the murder, and the circumstances of it, crying out for a little Time for his Soul, and much lamenting his Sin. That night he was committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and there lay exceedingly startled about the state of his Soul, saying often, <hi>What will become of my poor Soul! What shall I do to be saved!</hi> beginning now to see the sinfulness of sin. Whom I may compare to <hi>Manasses</hi> in three respects. 1. As to matter of Fact; for <hi>Manasses</hi> shed much innocent blood, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 16. so did he shed (too much) innocent blood. 2. He something re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54938:25"/>
                  <hi>Manasses</hi> in his Imprisonment, mentioned 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 33. 11. As <hi>Manasses</hi> was taken and bound with Fetters, so was he clapt in the hole or Dungeon of <hi>Newgate,</hi> with heavy Irons about his legs. 3. <hi>Manasses</hi> and he were one and the same in this sense, that when they were in affliction, they besought the Lord God, and humbled themselves greatly before the God of their Fathers. For this great Offendor could often say, <hi>He could never be humbled enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the 13 of <hi>August,</hi> when he was arraigned at the Sessions in the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> he pleaded Guilty to the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with very much shame, confusion of face and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of heart: And on Friday the 15 of <hi>August,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned himself very humbly before the Bench, heartily submitting to the Sentence of death that then passed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, saying, <hi>He had destroyed the Image of the Eternal GOD;</hi> alluding (as I verily believe) to those words in <hi>Gen. 6. 9.—For in the Image of God, &amp;c.</hi> After his Sentence, he was conveyed back to prison; penitently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, that he had neglected the good Word of God, and therefore was the longer kept off (through ignorance of the Gospel) from closing with Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. But after a few dayes discourse with several Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and others, who opened the Scriptures to him, he began to understand (through the Grace of God) the Word of Grace. And though he had many good Books brought to him by divers visiting Friends, yet he chiefly looked into the holy Scriptures themselves, and found very much advantage, light and peace, by these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing passages out of the Old Testament, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 9. Where <hi>Nathan</hi> spake sharply to <hi>David,</hi> for despising the Commandment of the Lord, to do evil in the sight of the Lord, in killing <hi>Uriah</hi> the <hi>Hittite</hi> with the Sword, vers. 13. <hi>David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord; and Nathan said to David, The Lord also hath put away thy sin.</hi> From hence he understood
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54938:25"/>
the readiness of God to forgive confessing, repenting sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, though they are guilty of innocent blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job 33. 27, 28, He</hi> (the Lord) <hi>looketh upon men</hi> (Oh that men would look after the Lord!) <hi>and if ANT say, I have sinned and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; he</hi> (that is the Lord) <hi>will deliver his Soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</hi>

               <p>Isa. 55. 7. <hi>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous man his thoughts, and let him return to the Lord, and he will ABUNDANTLY pardon;</hi> The word <hi>abundantly</hi> he used to pronounce with an emphasis; for he saw (his eyes being now anointed with spiritual Eye salve) that he had multiplied sins exceedingly, and that he stood in absolute need of the Lords abundant multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied pardons: whereof he had good hope through this good word of <hi>Isaiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ezek. 18. 23. <hi>Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die, saith the Lord God, and not that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from his wayes and live?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>30.—<hi>Repent and turn your selves from all your trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions; So iniquity shall not be your ruine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>31. <hi>Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed, and make you a new heart, and a new spirit; for why will you die, O house of Israel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>32. <hi>For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dyeth, wherefore turn your selves, and live ye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ezek. 33. 11. <hi>Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord,</hi> (here the poor Prisoner would note to his comfort, that a repenting sinner had not onely the Word and Promise of God for forgiveness, but the Oath of God, to give such a sinner the greater assurance of pardon,) <hi>I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his wayes and live: Turn ye, turn ye,</hi> (see the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of God with poor sinners for the good of their

                  <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 18. was a place pleasant to his Soul. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?

               <p>Now I shall give you a short List of some New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Texts, whereby the Lord conveyed Counsel and Consolation to this doubting, staggering, poor Wretch.</p>
               <p>Mat. 18. 11.—<hi>For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Joh. 3. 14, 15, 16. <hi>And as Moses lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have eternal life; for God SO loved the WORLD, that whosoever</hi> (this word [<hi>whosoever</hi>] he spake with joy) <hi>believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life:</hi> Now (saith <hi>Nathaniel Butler</hi>) I am one to whom this word speaketh; and therefore God gave the Lord Jesus Christ for my Soul; I believe in him, and therefore I trust to live eternally through him, according to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious terms of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>John 6. 37.—<hi>And him that cometh to me I will in no wise</hi> (here he would repeat and reiterate these words in <hi>NO WISE CAST OUT,</hi> in <hi>NO WISE,</hi> in <hi>NO WISE) cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 Tim. 1. 15. <hi>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of whom I am chief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 Tim. 2. 5, 6. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</hi>

                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:54938:26"/>In hearing, reading, and conferring upon these (and many more) Scriptures, he would often say to me and others, These are good Scriptures, brave Scriptures; are they not brave Scriptures? He would make very diligent and frequent search into his Soul, concerning the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Sorrow, and would not easily believe that his Repentance was true, or that he had right to the precious Promises of the Gospel. But by much speaking to him by many good people, that he would apply Christ, and also by seeking unto God for a spirit of Faith for him, he did begin to act a faith of recumbency and adherence, being (as he often said) perswaded the Lord Jesus Christ was able to save to the uttermost, and willing to save such as come unto God by him; yet he could not come up to that full assurance of hope and confidence, as he desired; and we also desired heartily on his behalf. Yet for some certain dayes before his suffering death, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the God of all Comfort, to give him Joy and Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and sometimes strong consolation, insomuch that he would at times express very great inward gladness, which all that knew his former mournings, were glad to see, and glorified God for giving him the Joy of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for he was so satisfied concerning the favour and mercy of God towards him in Jesus Christ, that he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now desired Death then feared it; as seeing death through Jesus Christ without a Sting.

               <p>
                  <hi>THomas Savage,</hi> born in the Parish of <hi>Giles</hi> in the Fields, he was put out Apprentice to Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> Vintner, at the Ship-Tavern in <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> where he lived about the space of one year and three quarters: in which time he manifested himself to all that knew him, to be a meer Monster in sin: in all that time he never once knew what it was to hear one whole Sermon; but used to go in at one door, and out at the other; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted them fools that could spare so much time from sin, as two or three hours on a Lords day, to spend in the Lords service. He spent the Sabbath commonly at the Ale-house, or rather at a base house, with that vile Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet <hi>Hannah Blay,</hi> which was the cause of his ruine; he was by a young man (now gone to Sea) first enticed to go drink there, and after that he went alone, and now and then used to bring her a Bottle or two of Wine, which satisfied not her wicked desires; but she told him, if he would frequent her house, he must bring money with him: he told her often, he could bring none but his Masters, and he never wronged his Master of two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in his Life: still she enticed him to take it private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: He replyed, he could not do it, because the Maid was alwayes at home with him: Hang her Jade, saith this impudent Slut, knock her brains out, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the money; this she many times said; and that day that he committed the murther, he was with her in the morning, and she made him drunk with burnt Brandy, and he wanted one Groat to pay of his reckoning: she
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54938:27"/>
then again perswaded him to knock the Maid on the Head, and she would receive the Money: he going home between twelve and one of the clock; his Master stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Street-door, did not dare to go in that way, but climbed over a back door, and cometh into the Room where his Fellow-servants were at dinner: O saith the Maid to him, Sirrah, you have been now at this Bawdy-House, you will never leave till you are undone by them: He was much vexed at her; and while he was at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Devil entred so strong into him, that nothing would satisfie him but he must kill her; and no other way, but with the Hammer; to which end, when his Master was gone with all the rest of his Family to Church, leaving only the Maid and this Boy at home; he goeth into the Bar, fetcheth the Hammer, and taketh the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in his hand, and sitteth down by the fire, and there knocketh the bellows with the Hammer: the Maid saith to him; <hi>Sure the boy is mad, Sirrah, what do you make this noise for?</hi> He said nothing, but went from the Chair, and lay along in the Kitchin Window, and knocked with the Hammer there; and on a sudden threw the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with such force at the maid, that hitting her on the head she fell down presently, screeching out: then he taketh up the Hammer three times, and did not dare to strike her any more, at last the Devil was so great with him, that he taketh the Hammer and striketh her many blows with all the force he could, and even rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that he had got the victory over her: which done, he immediately taketh the Hammer, and with it strikes at the Cupboard-Door in his masters Chamber, which being but slit Deal presently flew open, and thence he taketh out a Bag of Money, and putting it upon his arm, under his Cloak, he went out at a back-door straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to this base house again: when he came thither, the Slut would fain have seen what he had under his Cloak, and knowing what he had done, would very fain
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54938:28"/>
have had the Money; he gave her half a Crown, and away he went without any remorse for what he had done. Going over a Stile, he sat down to rest himself, and then began to think with himself; <hi>Lord what have I done!</hi> and he would have given ten thousand worlds he could have recalled the blow. After this, he was in so much horrour, that he went not one step but he thought eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one he met came to take him. He got that Night to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and lay there; telling the people of the house that he was to go down to <hi>Gravesend:</hi> that night he rose and walked about, and knew not what to do, Conscience so flew in his face: The Mistress of the house perceiving the Lad to have Money, and not seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, said, <hi>I wish this Lad came by this Money honestly.</hi> The next morning he going away towards <hi>Woolliedge,</hi> the Mistriss of the house could not be satisfied, but sent for him back, and told him, <hi>Sweet heart, I fear you came not by this Money honestly. Yes, indeed Mistris,</hi> saith he, <hi>I did; for I am carrying of it down to</hi> Gravesend <hi>to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, a Wine-Cooper. We live upon</hi> London-bridge, <hi>and if you please to send any one to my Mistris, I will leave my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So there were some people going to <hi>London,</hi> and he writ a Note to send to his Mistris, and he left the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with the woman of the House, and went his way, wandring toward <hi>Woolliedge,</hi> and there was in the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; about which time news came to <hi>Greenwich</hi> of the Murther that was committed at <hi>Ratcliff</hi> by a Youth, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Fellow-servant, and that a Bag of Money was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: the Mistris of the House forthwith concluded that sure it was the same Youth that was at her house, and that was the Money: whereupon she sent men out presently to seek him: who found him in an Ale-house, where he had called for one pot of Beer, and was laid down with his head on the Table and faln asleep: One of the men calling him by his name, <hi>Tom,</hi> saith he, <hi>Did</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:54938:28"/>
                  <hi>you not live at</hi> Ratcliff? He said, <hi>Yes: And did you not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your fellow-servant?</hi> He confessed it: <hi>And you took so much Money from your Master,</hi> he acknowledged all: then said they, <hi>You must go along with us:</hi> He said, <hi>Yes, with all my heart.</hi> So they went forthwith to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> to the house where he lay that night: where when he came, he met his Master with some Friends, and when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster spake to him of it, he was not much affected at first, but after a little while burst out into many tears: thence he was conveyed to the Justice at <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> where he fully confessed the Fact again, and by him was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted close Prisoner in the Goal of <hi>Newgate,</hi> where Mr. <hi>H. B.</hi> (who after some acquaintance with him, had this preceeding Narrative from his own Mouth) came to see and speak with him: and he seemed but little sensible of what he had done. <hi>Are you</hi> (said he) <hi>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that committed the murther upon the maid at</hi> Ratcliff? He said, <hi>Yes: O what think you of your condition? What do you think will become of your precious Soul? you have by this Sin not only brought your body to the Grave, but your Soul to Hell, without Gods Infinite mercy: Were you not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the Fact when you did it? Not for the present, Sir, said he; but soon after I was, when I began to think with my self what I had done.</hi> The next time he asked him, whether he were sorry for the Fact? He said, wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hands, and striking his breast, with tears in his Eyes, <hi>Yes, Sir, for it cuts me to the Heart to think that I should take away the Life of a poor innocent Creature; and that is not all, but for any thing I know, I have sent her Soul to Hell: O how can I think to appear before Gods Bar, when she shall stand before me, and say, Lord, this wretch took away my Life, and gave me not the least space that I might turn to thee: he gave me no warning at all, Lord: O then what will become of me?</hi>

                  <hi>R. F.</hi> and <hi>T. V.</hi> went to him in the Prison, and had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, with much readiness from the Keepers to discourse with him: They asked him, if he were the person that had murthered the Maid? He answered, that he was; they did then open to him the hainous nature of that sin, endeavouring to set it home upon his Conscience, telling him of the express Law of God, <hi>Thou shalt not Kill,</hi> and the express threatnings, <hi>That whosoever sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed.</hi> They spake to him of the Law of the Land, and the punishment of Death which would certainly be inflicted upon him; that he had but a few Weeks more to live, and then he would be Tryed, and Condemned, and Executed: but they told him, that the punishment of the temporal Death was but small in comparison with the punishment of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death in Hell, which he had deserved, and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unto. They told him, that so soon as Death should make a separation between his Soul and body, that his Soul must immediately appear before the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tribunal of the Sin-revenging God, and there receive its final doom, and be irreversibly sentenced to depart from the presence of the Lord, into everlasting fire, if he were found under the guilt of this, or any other sin. They asked him if he knew what Hell was? telling him what a fearful thing it would be for him to fall into the hands of the living God; how intolerable the immediate expressions of Gods Wrath would be upon his Soul, what horrour and anguish he would there be filled withal, and how he would be bound up in Chains of darkness until the Judgment of the great day; and then told him of the glorious appearance of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ to Judgment: that Soul and Body should be then joyned together, and condemned together, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished together with such exquisite torments as never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Heart of man to conceive; declaring the Extremity and the Eternity of the Torments of Hell,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54938:29"/>
which were the just demerit of his sins. Then they ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, whether he had any hopes of escaping this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful punishment of Hell? He answered, that he had: they enquired the grounds of his hopes? He told them, that he repented of his fault, and hoped God would have mercy on his Soul. They asked him, whether he thought his Repentance could procure for him a Pardon? He knew no other way. They told him that God was just, and his Justice must be satisfied: and there was no way for him to do it, but by undergoing the Eternal torments of Hell: and did he know no way of satisfying God's Justice besides? and pacifying his anger that was kindled against him? No, he knew not any: And yet did he hope to be saved? He answered, Yes. They enquired whether ever he had experience of a gracious change wrought in him. Herein he could give no account, and yet ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to be saved. They told him his hopes were unsound, having no good foundation: and he would find himself disappointed: that it was not his Repentance, his Tears, and Prayers (though he ought to use them as means) that would save him, if he fixed the Anchor of his hope upon them. That if he hoped to be saved in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which for the present he was in, he would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be damned: that he must cast away all those ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less hopes he had conceived, and endeavour to despair in himself, that being pricked and pained at heart, through the apprehensions of the wrath of God ready to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and seeing no possibility of flying and escaping, if he looked only to himself, he might cry out, <hi>What shall I do to be saved?</hi> and enquire after a Saviour. And then they spake to him of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the way of Salvation by him, which before he was sottishly ignorant of, as if he had been brought up in a Countrey of Infidels, and not of Christians. The words spoken to him by these two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, seemed to take little impression upon him whilest they were present, yet after they were gone, the Lord did begin to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54938:30"/>
work, and he did acknowledge to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that two had been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with him (he knew not their names) whose words were like arrows shot into his heart, and he did wish he had those words in writing, especially one expression of <hi>T. V. That he would not be in his condition for ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Worlds,</hi> did affect and so affright him, that he said it made his hair stand on end.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Vincent,</hi> Mr. <hi>Francklin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Doolittle,</hi> Mr. <hi>Janeway,</hi> discoursed with him, and he suffered very penitently and chearfully at <hi>Ratcliff</hi> near his Masters House.</p>
               <p>We do not read of any more of all the drunkards and debauched persons, that were Converted, but those two, <hi>Nathaniel Butler</hi> and <hi>Thomas Savage,</hi> whom God gave true Repentance unto.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>A Common Drunkard, is the fittest man to make a debauched. Health-drinker of, they are so near a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to one another, that there is little difference: you can hardly know one from another, and it is seldom seen, that a Health is begun for his Majesty, or his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> till the Feasters are well entred in there Glasses of Wine first.</p>
               <p>This I can Witness, That one Evening this Winter, two or three Drunken Companions met another drunken man in the street, and did ask him if he would drink the Dukes Health: He answered presently, Yea, I'le drink any mans Health: Is not the King and Duke much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to such for their Love, that can shew it in no better way? We are commanded, and its our duty, to Fear God and to Honour the King; and he that truly doth so, will pray heartily to God to bless and preserve his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty from the danger of all Popish and Sham-Plots: and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54938:30"/>
this way is better to shew their true Love to the King, than in a Sinful Custom of Healths, which provokes the King of Kings to send Judgments on the Kingdom. Read Dr. <hi>Stillingfleets</hi> Text, of his Fast-Sermon before the House of Commons, <hi>Novem.</hi> 13. 1 Sam. 12. 24, 25.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Audacious</hi> Abominable Health-drinkers were so Wicked as to drink a Health to the great Prince of Darkness, their Father the Devil; and it is credibly. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, he came boldly amongst them and carryed away some of them, as bold as he was. One being told, that unless he left off his Drunkenness and Whoring he would loose his sight: He answered thus, <hi>Tum valeat Lumen ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>—Then Farewell Sweet Light.</p>
               <p>One was put to his choice, which of these sins he would choose to commit, either to be drunk, or to kill his Father, or to lie with his Mother: he refused the two last, and was drunk, and then committed the other two.</p>
               <p>At one great Feast in the City since his Majesties hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Restoration, I heard they were so mad, in their Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cups of Wine and Healths, as to drink down small live Fishes, and make Fish-ponds in there Bellyes: it's a wonderful Mercy it proved not their last drinking. So to abuse themselves and Gods Creatures, by Drunkenness and Gluttony, it is the way to provoke God to send a Famine on the Land; for such wanton excessive doings.</p>

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That Drunkenness is expresly against the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Drunkenness is plainly and expresly forbidden in Gods Word, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Be not drunk with wine.</hi> Luke 21. 34. <hi>Take heed to your selves, lest at any Time your Hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and Drunkenness.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54938:31"/>
light of Gods Word, and that is a great aggravation of sin, to sin against the light of Gods Word: sins of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance are as it were no Sins, compared with sins against Knowledge. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 22. <hi>If I had not come and spoken to them they had not had Sin, but now they have no cloak for their Sin.</hi> Drunkards cast Gods Word behind their backs, and trample his Commandments under their feet: God saith, <hi>Be not drunk with Wine: take heed left your Hearts be overcharged with Drunkenness:</hi> But they say in effect, though not in words, We will not regard these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God; let God say and do what he will, we will take our fill of Wine and strong drink: Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and other sinners that know Gods will, and will not do it, contemn and dispise God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the Wicked contemn God?</hi> Drunkards are guilty of Rebellion against God, who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords: for sinning against the Light of Gods Word, is accounted Rebellion; <hi>Job</hi> 24. 13. <hi>They are of those that rebell against the Light:</hi> and that is a hainous Sin, to be Stubborn and Rebellious against the God of Heaven. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 23. <hi>Rebellion is as the Sin of Witchcraft, and Stubbornness is as iniquity and Idolatry.</hi>

                  <p>Drunkennss is a beastly Sin, in depriving a man of his Reason, and makes him carry himself like a Beast: it is a vile thing for a man to degrade, and make himself like a Beast. <hi>Job</hi> 18. 3. <hi>Wherefore are we counted as Beasts, and reputed as vile in your Sight.

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. It is a mischievous Sin both to Body, Soul, and Estate.</p>
                  <p>Drunkenness is a most <hi>Mischievous</hi> Sin, and brings a world of mischief along with it, both to Soul and Body, Estate and good Name.</p>
                  <p>1. It doth great mischief to the Soul: For (1) It besots and Stupifies the Soul, and estranges a mans Heart from God, who is his chiefest good: <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Whoredom and Wine, and new Wine take away the Heart:</hi> We may take Heart here for the Understanding; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>Their foolish Heart was darkened:</hi> And so it is true, that Wine takes away the Heart; that is, it stupisieth the mind, it blinds and darkens the understanding, and maketh men sottish; as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> complains of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were much addicted to drunkenness. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 22. <hi>My People is Foolish, they have not known me, they are sottish Children, and have no understanding, they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no Knowledge:</hi> Or we may take Heart for the Affections; and so it is true, that Wine takes away the Heart, for Drunkenness takes off the Heart from God
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54938:32"/>
and all things that are good: Drunkards have no Love to God, no delight in God; no desire of enjoying God, no Fear of God, no Heart to that which is good. Drunkenness is a fleshly lust; and fleshly lusts war against, and tend to the ruine of our precious Souls. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, I beseech you as strangers and Pilgrims abstain from fleshly Lusts, which War against the Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It brings great mischief to the Body, by the painful Diseases that it breeds in the Body, and by the Wounds and Bruises men get by falls, when they have drunk so much they are not able to go, or to guide the Horses they ride on; and also by the wounds they get in quarrels and contentions with their Companions when they are in their Cups. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 29, 30. <hi>Who hath Woe? who hath Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? who hath Contentions? who hath Bablings? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of Eyes? They that tarry long at the Wine:</hi> Not only the Eyes are made red, but the whole Body is inflamed and greatly distempered by excessive drinking. <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Woe to them that follow strong drink, that continue till night, till Wine enflame them.</hi> Our Bodies should be the Temples of the Holy Ghost; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. <hi>What, know you not that your Body is the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Holy Ghost which is in you?</hi> And it is dangerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing the Temple of God with excess of Wine or strong Drink: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>If any man defile the Temple of God, him shall God destroy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. It brings ruine on a mans Estate; <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 21. <hi>The Drunkard and the Glutton shall come to poverty.</hi> Many persons by their drunken and sottish courses waste fair Estates, that were left them by their Parents: Others that have been brought up to Callings, spend all they gain by their Callings in excessive drinking, whereby it comes to pass that they make no provision for their Families, but their Wives and Children are brought into great wants and straits; such as these are as bad, yea worse than Infidels; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>But if any provide not for his own,</hi>

                     <hi>and especially for those of his own House, he hath denyed the Faith, and is worse than an Infidel.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The greatness of the Sin of Drunkenness will appear from hence, that it disposeth a man to many other great and crying sins: as for Instance,</p>
                  <p>1. Drunkenness disposeth men to commit Uncleanness; <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 31, 33. <hi>Look not upon the Wine when it is red:—Thine Eyes shall behold strange Women.</hi> When men are overcome with Wine, they are easily drawn to commit the worst of uncleanness: <hi>Lot</hi> though a Righteous man, being overtaken with Drunkenness, commited Incest twice. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Be not drunk with Wine, wherein is excess.</hi> As <hi>Beza</hi> observes, <hi>Omnis profusio eaque summâ cum turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudine conjuncta;</hi> All excess of riot, even that which is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the greatest filthiness: No filthiness comes amiss to a drunken man, who is shameless whilest he is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with strong drink. The <hi>Jews,</hi> who were much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Drunkenness, were greatly addicted to Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom also. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 11, 18. <hi>Whoredom and Wine take away the Heart: Their drink is sowre, they have committed Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom continually.</hi> Their drink is sowre, some interpret of the sowre belches drunkards have after their Cups: And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effect of immoderate drinking Wine, besides the sowring of it in the Stomach, is, that it provokes men to Whoredom. <hi>Hierom</hi> hath a smart passage to this effect, <hi>Nunquam ego ebrium castum putabo;</hi> I shall never think a Drunkard can be a chaste man.</p>
                  <p>2. Drunkards are easily perswaded to be Idolaters; for they making<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>their Belly their God, Phil.</hi> 3. 19. will easily be perswaded to bow down their Bodies to an Idol, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54938:33"/>
comply with any Religion which will suit best with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest: <hi>Hos.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>The Children of</hi> Israel <hi>who look to other Gods, and Love Flagons of Wine.</hi> Dan. 5. 4. <hi>They drank Wine, and praised the Gods of Gold, and of Silver, and of Brass, of Iron, of Wood, and of Stone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Drunkenness is accompanied with abundance of Vain Bablings, and Foolish and Idle talk, which men have together when they are in their Cups. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 29, 30. <hi>Who hath Bablings? They that tarry long at the Wine.</hi> And if any think there is no great hurt in those Bablings, and Foolish talking that Drunkards have when they sit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Inns or Alehouses, let such consider,</p>
                  <p>(1.) That Vain Bablings hardens the Heart, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a man to ungodly practices. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>But shun profane and vain Bablings, for they will increase to more Ungodliness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2.) Though Foolish Talking and Jesting is made Light of, and accounted by many a matter of Mirth, yet it is a sin brings down Gods wrath. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 4, 6. <hi>Neither filthiness, nor Foolish talking, nor Jesting, which are not convenient: Let no man deceive you with Vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the Children of Disobedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) Men must give an Account for every Idle Word at the day of Judgment, and without Repentance they shall be condemned for their Idle Words, as well as their other sins: <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 36, 37. <hi>But I say unto you, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Idle word that men shall speak, they shall give an account thereof in the day of Judgment: For by thy Words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(4.) There are few Drunkards, but they will mock and scost and rail at the Ministers and Servants of Christ, and sing Songs of them, especially when they are in their Cups: <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 1. <hi>Wine is a mocker;</hi> that is, it makes men Mockers. <hi>Mercer's</hi> note upon that Text is, <hi>Vini potor derisor Dei hominumque esse solet:</hi> A Drunkard is wont to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54938:34"/>
be a Derider of God and Men. It hath been usual with Drunkards in former, as well as these dayes, to sing Songs of the People of God: <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 12. <hi>I am the Song of Drunkards.</hi> Now this mocking the Ministers and People of God is a grievous Sin, it brings down wrath without Remedy; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 16. <hi>They mocked the Messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his Prophets, untill the wrath of the Lord arose against his People, till there was no Remedy.</hi> Mockers bring upon themselves mighty and unavoidable Judgments. <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 24. <hi>Now therefore be ye not Mockers, lest your bands be made stronger.</hi> Forty two little Children were torn in pieces by two she-Bears, for mocking a Prophet, and calling him <hi>Bald-head,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2. 23, 24. And if God was so offended with little Children for this sin of Mocking a Prophet, that he sent two Bears which tore in pieces forty two Children, how offensive is it to the Lord, to hear those that are come to mans Estate, knowing and understanding men, mock and scoff at his Servants? Though no Judgment come upon them in this World for their Sin, yet without Repentance a worse thing will come unto them; they shall be rent and torn, that is, they shall be tormented in the other World for ever by the Devil, who is a roaring Lyon, a far more dreadful Enemy than the Bears that tore the little Children in pieces.</p>
                  <p>(5.) Drunkards are usually Swearers, and some of them will Swear dreadful Oaths, such as would make a man tremble to hear them: And Swearing, profane Swearing is an abominable Sin, and brings a man in danger of Hell Fire: <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>(6.) Drunkards are oftentimes Persecutors, and Smiters of their Fellow Servants: <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 48, 49. <hi>If that Evil Servant shall say in his Heart, My Lord delayeth his coming, and shall begin to smite his Fellow-Servants, and to eat and</hi>

                     <hi>drink with the drunken.</hi> They are such which eat and drink with the drunken, that smite their Fellow-servants; and smiting and persecuting the Servants of Christ is a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Sin: he takes it as ill when his Servants are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, as if he himself was persecuted: <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? Saul</hi> did not persecute Christ in his own person, for he was in Heaven, sitting at his Fathers right hand: but he persecuted Christs Servants, and Christ was as much offended at the persecuting of his Members, as if he himself had been persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>(7.) Drunkenness casts men into a deep Sleep, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them dreadfully secure under those Judgments that hang over their Heads. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 34. <hi>Yea, thou shalt be as one that lyeth down in the midst of the Sea, or as he that lyeth on the top of the Mast. Solomon</hi> speaking of such that tarry long at the Wine, sets out their danger by one that lyeth on the Top of the Mast in the midst of the Sea, who is in danger every moment of falling into the Sea and to be drowned, yet fears nothing whilest he is asleep: Such is the case of Drunkards, they are in danger of falling into Hell every day, and yet they fear nothing, till God awakens their Consciences, and shews them their Sin and Misery. When the Prophet calls, <hi>Awake ye Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Joel</hi> 2. 5. it implies, they are in a deep Sleep, and that it is no easie matter to awake them.</p>
                  <p>(8.) Sometimes Drunkards commit Murder in their Drunkenness, and quarrel with and kill their best Friends. It is reported of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that when he was drunk he killed his beloved Friend <hi>Clytus:</hi> yea, there is no Sin so horrid, but a Drunken man may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fall into it, if he hath an occasion and Temptation to commit it.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54938:35"/>
we read of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> that their Land spued them out for their defiling it; and the <hi>Israelites</hi> are warned not to defile their Land, lest they also be spued out; <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 28. <hi>That the Land spue not you out also when ye defile it, as it spued out the Nations that were before you:</hi> And when the <hi>Israelites</hi> did defile their Land by Drunkenness and others Sins, they were a burthen to the Land; it was weary with bearing them, it spued them out, and they were carryed captive into a strange Land: <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 11, 13. <hi>Woe to them that rise up early to follow strong drink, and continue until night, till Wine enslame them: Therefore my People are gone into captivity.</hi> The Lord threatned to send mighty Adversaries against <hi>Ephraim,</hi> for their Pride, and Drunkenness, which should come upon them as furiously as a tempest of Hail and a destroying Storm, and as a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty flood of Water, that should overflow all places, and bear down all before it. <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 1, 2. <hi>Woe to the Crown of Pride, the Drunkards of Ephraim:</hi> So that Drunkards are the Plague of a Nation, that bring down Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on themselves, and the place where they live: And when an overflowing Scourge comes on a Nation, usually Drunkards have the speediest and deepest share in the Judgments of God. <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 1, 3, 6, 7. <hi>Wo to them that are at ease in Zion: That put far away the evil day: That drink in Bowls: Therefore now shall they go Captive with the first that go Captive.</hi> When the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> invaded the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Drunkards were trod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet like mire in the streets; <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 2, 3. <hi>Behold the Lord hath a mighty and strong one: The Crown of Pride, the Drunkards of</hi> Ephraim <hi>shall be trod under feet.</hi>

As Christ said to deterr us from looking back, <hi>Remember Lots Wife;</hi> so may I say, to deterre you from Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Remember <hi>Elah,</hi> who was kill'd whil'st he was drinking himself drunk: And if God did not spare a King in <hi>Israel,</hi> take heed lest he do not spare you.

                  <p>Drunkenness makes a man unfit for any good work, unfit for the service of God and men, unfit for Death and Judgment: it makes a man unfit for Prayer, and all other Religious duties. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>The end of all things is at hand, be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer:</hi> No men are fit for Prayer, but sober men.

Fire, and Fire went out from the Lord and devoured them: for immediately after the Relation of their Sin and Punishment, there is a strict charge given to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, that they should <hi>not drink Wine or strong drink, when they went into the Tabernacle of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on pain of Death,</hi> Lev. 10. 8, 9, 10, 11.

                  <p>Drunkenness is an enticing, bewitching Sin, which is very hardly left by those that are addicted to it: Neither the Word nor Rod of God prevaileth with men to leave this Sin, but they go on sinning against Light, sinning against the Counsels, Reproofs and Tears of Friends, against the checks of their own Consciences; though the Lord afflict them in their Bodies, Estates, Good Names, yet still they persevere in this sin: though when upon sick beds they are under terrors of Conscience, and feel as it were some flashes of Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, and make great Vows and solemn Protestations, that if God will spare their Lives, and raise them up again, they will leave off their Drunkenness; yet when they are restored to Health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they return to their old course again: <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 35. <hi>They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick: they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again: Solomon</hi> speaks here of Drunkards, who are not disheartened by all the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54938:37"/>
difficulties, and troubles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and blowes that they meet with in following after strong drink; but resolve to seek it yet again, and to persist in their dissolute courses. Drunkards are wont to encourage themselves, and one another, to persist in their drunken courses under all discouragements. <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 12. <hi>Come ye, say they, I will fetch Wine, and we will fill our selves with strong drink, and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.</hi> Instead of desisting they grow more resolved in their way: and the reason why this sin is so hardly left, and so few recovered from it, may be partly from the strength this sinful habit gets in the Soul by the many repeated Acts of this Sin, and also from the Pleasingnesse of this Sin to corrupt Nature; for the more pleasing any sin is, the more hardly it is left: And chiefly from the Just and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgment of God, who giveth up men who go on sinning against Light, unto their own Hearts Lusts, saying to them, <hi>He that is filthy, let him be filthy still.</hi> Drunkenness is called by some, <hi>Vitium maximae adhaeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae;</hi> a Sin that sticks closer and faster to a man than any other Sin.</p>
                  <p>These ten Arguments against Drunkennss were taken out of the Sermons of Mr. <hi>Owen Stockton</hi> of <hi>Colchester,</hi> lately deceased, an able and worthy Divine, in a Larger discourse again that Sin, well I worth the Reading, sold by Mr. <hi>Thomas Parkhurst</hi> at the Bible and three Crowns in <hi>Cheapside:</hi> Preached upon the occasion of a sad and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Providence, which lately befell a young man, who for some years was very hopefull for Religion, a diligent attender upon God's Ordinances, and well esteemed of among the People of God; but afterwards being led away by temptation, he was sometime overtaken with the sin of Drunkenness, and it seemed good to the Holy and Righteous God to cut him off in the Act of sin, when he was (as is generally reported) so far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

those (against whom We have been ever enough offended, though We could not, in this manner declare it,) who under pretence of Affection to Us and Our Service, assume to themselves the liberty of Reviling, Threatning and Reproaching others; and as much as in them lies, endeavour to stifle and divert their good Inclinations to Our Service, and so to prevent that Reconciliation and Union of Hearts and Affections, which can only, with Gods Blessing, make Us rejoyce in each other, and keep Our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies from rejoycing.</p>
               <p>There are likewise another sort of Men, of whom we have heard much, and are sufficiently ashamed; who spend their time in Taverns, Tipling-houses and Debauches, giving no other Evidence of their Affection to Us, but in drinking Our Health, and Inveighing against all others, who are not of their own dissolute temper; and who, in truth, have more discredited Our Cause, by the Licence of their Manners and Lives, than they could ever advance it by their Affection or courage. We hope that this extraordinary way of delivering Us all, from all we feared, and almost bringing Us to all We can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably hope for, hath and will work upon the Hearts, even of these Men to that degree, that they will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially renounce all that Licentiousness, Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Impiety, with which they have been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and endeavoured to corrupt others, and that they will hereafter, become examples of Sobriety and Uertue, and make it appear, that what is past, was rather the Uice of the Time, than of the Persons, and the fitter to be forgotten together.</p>
               <p>And, because the fear of punishment, or apprehension of Our Displeasure, may have influence upon many, who will not be restrained by the Conscience of their Duty, We do declare, That We will not exercise
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54938:38"/>
just Severity against any Malefactors sooner, than against Men of dissolute, debauch'd, and profane Lives, with what parts soever they may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise qualified and endowed; and We hope, that all Persons of Honour, or in Place and Authority, will so far assist Us, in discountenancing such Men, that their discretion and shame will perswade them to reform what their Conscience would not, and that the displeasure of good Men towards them, may supply what the Laws have not; and, it may be, cannot well provide against, there being by the Licence and Corruption of the Times, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Nature of Men, many Enormities, Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, and Impieties, in Practice and Manners, which Laws cannot well describe, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not enough provide against, which may by the example and severity of Uertuous Men, be easily discountenanced, and by degrees suppressed.</p>
               <p>However, for the more effectual reforming these Men, who are a discredit to the Nation, and unto any Cause they pretend to favour, and to wish well to; We require all Maiors, Sheriffs, and Justices of Peace, to be very vigilant and strict in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and prosecution of all Dissolute and Prophane Persons, and such as Blaspheme the Name of God, by prophane Swearing and Cursing, or revile or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb Ministers, and despise the Publick Worship of God; that being first bound to the good Behaviour, they may be further proceeded against, and exposed to shame, in such a manner, as the Laws of the Land, and the just and necessary Rules of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall direct or permit.</p>

Secondly, Though I do not hold it the principal Agent in digestion, yet it does excite, is auxiliary, and a necessary concomitant of a good digestion, <hi>ut signum &amp; causa.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Omne frigus per se, &amp; pro viribus destruit;</hi> Cold in its own nature, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the graduation of its power, extinguisheth natural heat, and is destructive; but <hi>per accidens,</hi> and as it is in <hi>gradu remisso,</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:54938:40"/>
it may contemperate, allay, and refresh, where heat abounds, and is exalted.</p>
               <p>Therefore as there is <hi>variety</hi> of Palates, and Stomachs liking and agreeing best with such kind of Meats and Drinks, which to others are utterly disgustful, disagreeing and injurious, though good in themselves: so is it in Drink <hi>warmed</hi> or <hi>cold;</hi> what one finds a benefit in, the other receives a <hi>prejudice;</hi> at least does not find that satisfaction and refreshment, under such a qualification; because of the various natures, particular appetitions, and <hi>idiosyncra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> properties of several bodies, one thing will not agree with all: Therefore he that cannot drink <hi>warm,</hi> let him take it <hi>cold,</hi> and it is well to him; but he that drinks it <hi>warm,</hi> does better. And this is to be understood in Winter, when the extremity of cold hath <hi>congelated</hi> and <hi>fixed</hi> the Spirits of the Liquor in a <hi>torpid</hi> inactivity; which by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle<note place="margin">Primum crater ad sitim per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinere, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum ad hilaritatem, tertium ad voluptatem, quartum ad insaniam dixit. <hi>Apulius.</hi>
                  </note> warmth are <hi>unfettered, volatile</hi> and <hi>brisk;</hi> whereby the drink is more agreeable and grateful to the Stomachs fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heat, being so prepared, than to be made so by it.</p>
               <p>There are three sorts of <hi>Drinkers:</hi> one drinks to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie <hi>Nature,</hi> and to support his <hi>body;</hi> without which he cannot well subsist, and requires it as necessary to his Being. Another drinks a <hi>degree</hi> beyond this man, and takes a larger <hi>dose,</hi> with this intention, to exhilerate and chear his <hi>mind,</hi> to banish <hi>cares</hi> and <hi>trouble,</hi> and help him to <hi>sleep</hi> the better; and these two are lawful Drinkers. A third drinks neither for the good of the <hi>body,</hi> or the mind, but to stupifie and drown both; by exceeding the former bounds, and running into excess, frustrating those <hi>ends</hi> for which drink was appointed by Nature; converting this <hi>support</hi> of Life and Health, making it a <hi>procurer</hi> of sickness and untimely death.</p>
               <p>Many such there are, who drink not to <hi>satisfie</hi> Nature, but force it down many times <hi>contrary</hi> to natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and when there is a reluctancy against it: as <hi>Drunkards</hi> that pour in Liquor, not for love of the <hi>drink,</hi> or that Nature requires it by <hi>thirst,</hi> but onely to maintain
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54938:40"/>
the <hi>mad frolick,</hi> and keep the Company from breaking up. Some to excuse this intemperance, hold it as good <hi>Physick</hi> to be drunk once a month, and plead for that liberty as a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som custom, and quote the authority of a famous <hi>Physician</hi> for it. Whether this Opinion be allowable, and to be admitted in the due <hi>Regiment</hi> for preservation of Health, is fit to be examined.</p>
               <p>It is a <hi>Canon</hi> established upon good reason; <hi>That every</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Omne ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae est ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micum.</note> 
                  <hi>thing exceeding its just bounds, and golden mediocrity, is hurtful to Nature.</hi> The best of things are not excepted in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule; but are restrained and limited here to a due proportion. The <hi>supports</hi> of Life may prove the <hi>procurers</hi> of Death, if not qualified and made wholsom by this corrective.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> is no longer sustenance, but a load and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, if they exceed the <hi>quantum</hi> due to each particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and then they are not, what they are properly in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and by the appointment of Nature, the <hi>preservatives</hi> of Life and Health; but the <hi>causes</hi> of sickness, and consequently of Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Drink</hi> was not appointed man, to discompose and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order him in all his faculties, but to <hi>supply, nourish,</hi> and <hi>strengthen</hi> them. Drink exceeding its measure, is no longer a refreshment, to <hi>irrigate</hi> and water the thirsty body, but makes an inundation to drown and suffocate the <hi>vital powers.</hi> It puts a man out of the state of Health, and represents him in such a degenerate condition both in respect of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>mind,</hi> that we may look upon the man, as going out of the World, because he is already gone out of himself, and strangely <hi>metamorphosed</hi> from what he was.</p>
               <p>I never knew <hi>sickness</hi> or a <hi>Disease,</hi> to be good prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Physick; and to be drunk, is no other than an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound state, and the whole body out of frame by this great change. What difference is there between <hi>sickness</hi> and <hi>drunkenness?</hi> Truly I cannot distinguish them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than as <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>species:</hi> Drunkenness being a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Disease, denominated and distinguished from other sicknesses, by its <hi>procatarctick</hi> or <hi>procuring</hi> cause, <hi>Drink.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:54938:41"/>That Drunkenness is a Disease or Sickness, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in that it hath all the requisites to <hi>constitute</hi> a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,</hi> and is far distant from a <hi>state</hi> of Health: for as Health is the free and regular discharge of all the <hi>functions</hi> of the Body and Mind; and sickness, when the <hi>functions</hi> are not performed, or weakly and depravedly: then <hi>Ebriety</hi> may properly be said to be a Disease or sickness, because it hath the <hi>symptoms</hi> and <hi>diagnostick</hi> signs of an <hi>acute</hi> and great Disease: for, during the time of <hi>drunkenness,</hi> and some time after, few of the faculties perform rightly, but very depravedly and <hi>preternaturally:</hi> if we examine the <hi>intellectual faculties,</hi> we shall find the <hi>reason</hi> gone, the <hi>memory</hi> lost or much abated, and the <hi>will</hi> strangely perverted: if we look into the <hi>sensitive</hi> faculties, they are disordered, and their <hi>functions</hi> impedited or perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very deficiently: the <hi>eyes</hi> do not see well, nor the <hi>ears</hi> hear well, nor the <hi>palate</hi> rellish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>speech</hi> faulters and is imperfect; the <hi>stomach</hi> perhaps vomits or nauseates; his <hi>legs</hi> fail: Indeed if we look through the whole man, we shall see all the faculties depraved, and their functions either not executed, or very disorderly, and with much deficiency.</p>
               <p>Now according to these <hi>symptoms</hi> in other <hi>sicknesses,</hi> we judge a man not likely to live long; and that it is very hard he should recover; the danger is so great from the many threatning <hi>symptoms</hi> that attend this sickness, and <hi>prognosticate</hi> a bad event: here is nothing appears <hi>saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> but from head to foot, the Disease is prevalent in every part; which being collated, the <hi>syndrom</hi> is <hi>lethal,</hi> and Judgment to be given so.</p>
               <p>Surely then Drunkenness is a very great Disease for the time; but because it is not usually <hi>mortal,</hi> nor lasts long; therefore it is slighted, and look't upon as a trivial matter that will cure it self. But now the question may be asked, Why is not <hi>Drunkenness</hi> usually <hi>mortal;</hi> since the same signs in other Diseases are accounted <hi>mortal,</hi> and the event proves
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54938:41"/>
it so? To which I answer; All the hopes we have that a man <hi>drunk</hi> should live, is; First, From common <hi>experience</hi> that it is not deadly: Secondly, From the nature of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive</hi> or <hi>procuring</hi> Cause, strong Drink or Wine; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it rage, and strangely discompose the man for a time, yet it lasts not long, nor is <hi>mortal.</hi> The <hi>inebriating</hi> spirits of the liquor, flowing in so fast, and joyning with the spirits of mans body, make so <hi>high</hi> a <hi>tide,</hi> that overflows all the banks and bounds of order: For, the spirits of mans body, those <hi>agents</hi> in each faculty, act smoothly, regularly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, with a moderate supply; but being overcharged, and forced out of their natural course, and exercise of their duty, by the large addition of <hi>furious spirits;</hi> spurs the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions into strange disorders, as if nature were conflicting with death and dissolution: but yet it proves not <hi>mortal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this, first, because these <hi>adventitious spirits</hi> are amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and friendly to our bodies in their own nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not so <hi>deadly injurious,</hi> as that which is not so familiar or noxious.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because they are very <hi>volatile, light</hi> and <hi>active;</hi> Nature therefore does much sooner recover her self, <hi>transpires</hi> and sends forth the <hi>overplus</hi> received; than if the <hi>Morbisick</hi> matter were more ponderous and fixed; the <hi>gravamen</hi> from thence would be much worse and longer in removing: as an over-charge of <hi>Meat, Bread, Fruit,</hi> or such like substances not spirituous; but dull and heavy (<hi>comparative</hi>) is of more difficult digestion, and layes a greater and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous load upon the faculties, having not such <hi>volatile brisk</hi> spirits to assist Nature, nor of so liquid a fine substance, of quicker and easier digestion: So that the <hi>symptoms</hi> from thence are much more dangerous, than those <hi>peracute</hi> distempers ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from Liquors. So likewise those bad <hi>symptoms</hi> in other Diseases are more to be feared and accounted <hi>mortal</hi> (than the like arising from <hi>drunkenness</hi>) because those perhaps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon <hi>malignant causes;</hi> or such as by time are <hi>radicated</hi> in the body; or from the defection of some <hi>principal part:</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:54938:42"/>
but the storm and discomposure arising from <hi>drunkenness,</hi> as it is suddenly raised, so commonly it soon falls, depending upon <hi>benign causes,</hi> and a spirituous matter, that layes not so great an oppression; but <hi>inebriates</hi> the spirits, that they act very disorderly and unwontedly; or by the <hi>soporiferous</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, <hi>stupifies</hi> them for a time, until they recover their <hi>agility</hi> again.</p>
               <p>But all this while, I do not see, <hi>that to be drunk once a month</hi> should prove good Physick: all I think that can be said in this behalf, is; that by overcharging the Stomach, <hi>vomiting is procured;</hi> and so carries off something that was lodged there, which might breed Diseases.</p>
               <p>This is a <hi>bad excuse</hi> for good Fellows, and a <hi>poor plea</hi> for <hi>drunkenness:</hi> for the gaining of one supposed benefit (which might be obtained otherwise) you introduce twenty <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences</hi> by it. I do not like the preventing of one Disease that <hi>may be,</hi> by procuring of one at the <hi>present certainly,</hi> and many hereafter most probably: and if the Disease feared, or <hi>may be,</hi> could be prevented no otherwise, but by this <hi>drunken means;</hi> then that might tolerate and allow it: but there are other wayes better and safer to cleanse the body either <hi>upwards</hi> or <hi>downwards,</hi> than by overcharging with strong drink, and making the man to <hi>unman</hi> himself; the evil consequents of which are many, the benefit hoped for, but <hi>pretended;</hi> or if any, but very <hi>small</hi> and <hi>inconsiderable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although, as I said before, the <hi>drunken fit</hi> is not <hi>mortal,</hi> and the danger perhaps not great for the present; yet those <hi>drunken bouts</hi> being repeated; the <hi>relicts</hi> do accumulate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitate Nature, and lay the foundation of many <hi>chronick Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.</hi> Nor can it be expected otherwise; but you may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude from the manifest irregular actions which appear to us <hi>externally,</hi> that the functions within also, and their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are strangely disordered: for, the <hi>outward madness</hi> and unwonted actions, proceed from the <hi>internal impulses,</hi> and disordered motions of the faculties: which general distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and discomposure (being frequent) must needs <hi>subvert</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:54938:42"/>
the <hi>oeconomy</hi> and government of humane Nature; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ruine the Fabrick of mans body.</p>
               <p>The ill effects, and more eminent products of Ebriety, are; first, <hi>A changing of the natural tone of the Stomach, and aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the digestive faculty;</hi> That instead of a good transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of food, a degenerate Chyle is produced. Common experience tells, that after a <hi>drunken debauch,</hi> the stomach loseth its appetite, and acuteness of digestion; as <hi>belching, thirst, disrelish, nauseating,</hi> do certainly testifie: yet to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port nature, and continue the custom of eating, some food is received; but we cannot expect from such a <hi>Stomach</hi> that a <hi>good digestion</hi> should follow: and it is some dayes before the Stomach recover its <hi>eucrasy,</hi> and perform its office well: and if these miscarriages happen but <hi>seldom,</hi> the injury is the less, and sooner recompenced; but by the <hi>frequent repetition</hi> of these ruinous practices, the Stomach is overthrown and ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated from its integrity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>An unwholsom corpulency and cachectick plenitude of body does follow: or a degenerate macilency, and a decayed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A <hi>Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophy,</hi> or <hi>Atrophy.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>constitution.</hi> Great Drinkers that continue it long, few of them escape, but fall into one of these <hi>conditions</hi> and <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi> of body: for, if the Stomach discharge not its office a right, the <hi>subsequent digestions</hi> will also be defective. So great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and dependance is there upon the <hi>Stomach;</hi> that other parts cannot perform their duty, if this leading <hi>principal Part</hi> be perverted and debauched: nor can it be expected other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; for, from this <hi>Laboratory</hi> and <hi>prime office</hi> of digestion, all the parts must receive their supply; which being not suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but depraved, are drawn into <hi>debanchery</hi> also, and a <hi>degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> state; &amp; the whole Body fed with vitious <hi>alimentary succus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that different <hi>products</hi> or <hi>habits</hi> of body should arise from the same kind of debauchery, happens upon this score. As there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>properties</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> of bodies; so the result from the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing causes shall be much different and various: one puffs up, fills, and grows <hi>hydropical;</hi> another pines away, and falls <hi>Consumptive,</hi> from <hi>excess</hi> in <hi>drinking;</hi> and this proceeds from the different <hi>disposition</hi> of parts: for, in some persons, although the <hi>stomach</hi> be vitiated, yet the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54938:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
strength of the <hi>subsequent digestions</hi> is so great, from the integrity and vigor of those parts destinated to such offices; that they act <hi>strenuously,</hi> though their <hi>object matter</hi> be transmitted to them imperfect and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: und therefore do keep the body <hi>plump</hi> and <hi>full,</hi> although the juyces be <hi>foul,</hi> and of a <hi>depraved</hi> nature. Others <hi>è contra,</hi> whose parts are not so firm and vigorous; that will not act upon any score, but with their <hi>proper object;</hi> does not endeavour a transmutation of such <hi>aliene matter,</hi> but receiving it with a <hi>nice reluctance,</hi> transmits it to be evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and sent forth by the next convenient ducture, or emunctory: and from hence the body is frustrated of nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ition, and falls away: So that the pouring in of much liquor (although it be good in <hi>sua natura</hi>) does not beget <hi>much aliment,</hi> but washeth through the body, and is not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similated.</p>
               <p>But here some may object and think; <hi>That washing of the body through with good Liquor, should cleanse the body, and make it fit for nourishment, and be like good Physick for a foul body.</hi> But the effect proves the contrary; and it is but reason it should be so: for, suppose the Liquor (whether Wine, or other) be pure and good; yet when the <hi>spirit</hi> is drawn off from it, the <hi>remainder</hi> is but <hi>dead, flat, thick,</hi> and a <hi>muddy flegm.</hi> As we find in the distillation of Wine, or other Liquors; so it is in mans body: the <hi>spirit</hi> is drawn off <hi>first,</hi> and all the parts of mans body are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Receivers,</hi> and do <hi>imbibe</hi> that <hi>limpid congenerous</hi> enlivener, freely and readily: but the <hi>remainder,</hi> of greatest proportion; that heavy, dull, <hi>phlegmy part,</hi> and of a <hi>narcotick quality;</hi> lies long fluctuating upon the digestions, and passeth but slowly; turns sowre, and vitiates the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> of the parts: So that this great <hi>inundation,</hi> and supposed washing of the body, does but drown the Faculties, <hi>stupifie</hi> or <hi>choak</hi> the Spirits, and defile all the Parts; not <hi>purifie</hi> and <hi>cleanse.</hi> And although the more <hi>subtile</hi> and <hi>thinner</hi> portion, passeth away in some persons pretty free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Urine;</hi> yet the <hi>grosser</hi> and worse part stayes behind, and clogs in the <hi>percolation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third injury, and common, manifest prejudice from intemperate drinking, is; <hi>An imbecillity of the Nerves;</hi> which is procured from the disorderly motions of the Animal Spirits; being impulsed and agitated preternaturally by the <hi>inebriating spirits</hi> of strong Liquors: which <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration</hi> being frequent, begets a habit, and causeth a <hi>trepidation</hi> of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
