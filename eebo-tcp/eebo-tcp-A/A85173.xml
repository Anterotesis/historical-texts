         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The occaſion of our writing was the diſperſing of ſome Papers amongst us, out of which we drew thoſe Doctrines and Exhortations which we examine. And having the advantage of ſome former know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge of that way which helped us to look beyond their inſinuating expreſſions, and principles, more accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the reliſh of many Profeſſors, we took warning (though it is our grief and hinderance) to hold a ſword in one hand while we build with the other.</p>

            <p>Surely could we ſee a ſimple tendency in thoſe warnings, rebukes, exhortations, which they abound with, to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this perverſe Generation to look after Jeſus Chriſt, and direct their ſteps into the way of righteouſnes and true peace, we ſhould rejoice that there were ſo many touched at heart, and brought to the Lord, though they walk not <hi>with</hi> us: nevertheleſs we ſhall not forbear to own what words of truth we ſhall find, though we think it meet, eſpecially intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brevity, not to inſiſt upon thoſe doctrines wherein they differ not from us, for the word of the Lord came not out from them, neither came it onely to them; but where they ſeem to us to be mingled with deceits, thoſe whatſoever, in what moderation the truth allows, we ſhall make to paſs under the ſame, <hi>For what is the chaff to the wheat?</hi> ſaith the Lord.</p>

            <p n="4">4 It may not be rejected by us as unlikely, That God by his Spirit, which works by way of Remembrance, may bring to mind words of Goſpel-truth, which a man hath read or heard without underſtanding or affection, and thereby quicken and turn men without any actual reading or hearing.

            <p n="1">1. It is the Spirit brings to God by Faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And it is by Scripture light, even the teſtimony of the Apoſtles and Prophets, which once was read or heard, elſe he could not know it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is not Gods ordinary way, who uſually for divers ends which might be mentioned, for the converſion of ſinners makes uſe of his people and ſervants, according to the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointments of the Kingdome of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Whereby you may ſee the aim of theſe Doctrines (as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged

            <p>Nay how this Tenet fighteth with their own practiſes, who leave not men to the <hi>light in them,</hi> but by words and papers induſtriouſly ſuggeſt to them their apprehenſions; And though they often quote the Scriptures,</p>
            <p>Yet, 1. it is but partially,</p>

               <p>IT were a ſmall thing, O all ye that paſſe by, if we and our names ſhould ſleep in the duſt in everlaſting ſilence, and contempt. But will not the ſtones cry out if we hold our peace while theſe deceits ſeem to lay all upon Chriſt, and his Spirit, while as in truth they lay nothing at all upon him? Is the light of Nature, the light of Chriſt as Mediatour, nay Chriſt himſelf, and the ſtrength that accompanies that light, the ſtrength of Chriſt? Then how is man become the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his own ſalvation, while you change the name and call it Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Moreover, here is jealouſie adminiſtred to the eie of an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced ſoul, notwithſtanding their fair ſpeeches, by laying ſuch ſtreſſe upon the watchings of man, as if Man rightly do his part by watching and yielding up himſelf to the light in him, he ſhall be ruled and directed by it, and his vain and evill thoughts ſhall be brought into ſubjection, yea ſo, that he may poſſibly compaſſe an exact obedience to the Law of Chriſt, or dictates in his heart, in this life, and ſo ly down in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Father in the everlaſting reſt which is prepared for the People of God, which reſt theſe aſſertors are diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at if we refer the Saints for, to the reſurrection and coming of our Lord.</p>

not the work of <hi>Regeneration</hi> (which may be collected out of this aſſertion duly minded:) Moreover it reſerves to Man a power of turning away from the Lord Jeſus, and by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience or vain mind, notabiding in this light, he may fall from that eternal ſalvation, which began to be wrought in him by the power of light while he did abide in it, as this Doctrine implies.</p>
               <p>It is further obſervable, that there is no mention made in any of their papers we have yet ſeen, of <hi>eternall</hi> ſalvation from the wrath to come, or condemnation of Hell, by any Atonement, price, or purchaſe, or blood-ſacrifice of our Mediatour without us, but of an Eternal ſalvation from the <hi>Dominion of evil,</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt, who is eternal life in us which we partake of as we abide in him (in obedience) Thus making this eternall light of life to be in every man, but not every man in it; which a man may truly, in their ſenſe, be ſaid to partake of, and again to fall ſhort of, as he is gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by this light, or his vain mind, every day.</p>

               <p>Indeed here is the hiding of his power under exhortations, admonitions, rebukes, perſwaſions, offers, and promiſes in the Goſpel, becauſe, as all creatures glorify God in their kind, ſo man, <hi>as rationall</hi> muſt glorify God his Maker<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in cloſing with the <hi>Chief Good</hi> and eternal life in the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is therefore ſo offered as the moſt reaſonable thing, moſt feeding, perfecting, and making happy, the capacious and neceſſitous ſouls of men.

               <p>Secondly, But in the next place when any ſoul by this <hi>Preventing</hi> grace is brought to Chriſt, having once taſted how gracious the Lord is in his dear Son, he is taught to <note place="margin">1 Pet 2. 3.

               <p>Thus doth the remembrance of the loving kindneſſes of the Lord, and the ſights of his glory in the true ſanctuary, ingage him (as <hi>David Pſa.</hi> 63. 1, 2, 6, 8.) to ſeek, wait and <hi>follow on</hi>

                  <hi>Redeemer.</hi> Should we here grant, that he that walks up to the Law or light of Nature, ſhall have the light of Grace or Goſpel revealed to him, (although we never read nor knew the Goſpel beſtowed on any Perſon or People upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 2.</note>or the Spirit received by the works of the Law) yet we do more than doubt whether ever there ſtood before the throne of Glory, or ſhall, any ſuch who without Goſpel-light and grace, did obey the Law, pleaſe God, or rightly approach <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6. Rom. 4. 24, 25. 2 Pet. 1. 5. 1 Tim. 1. 5.</note>unto him; for we know that faith in Jeſus, as dying for us, and riſing for our juſtification, is the firſt ſtone in the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al building, and the Fountain of Love (Man loving God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is firſt beloved of God) without which mans ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous works, &amp; moſt upright worſhips are abhominations threapt on the Lord.

               <p>Secondly, Moreover we add, that if this Poſition take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the true and proper miniſtration of the Goſpel, it muſt needs ſhut up the Kingdom of God from Men. For what are good tidings if they be not told?</p>
               <p>But to the beſt of our underſtandings by this Aſſertion is the miniſtration of the Goſpel taken away. For we do not know that ever the goſpel was publiſhed or promiſed to be made known, without the miniſtration of man, or without hearing; But rather as Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I am with you</hi> in teaching to the <hi>end of the world;</hi> ſo intended he teaching to be to the end; alſo it was the Apoſtles care that the truth might be committed from one to another from age to age, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. likewiſe the promiſe is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. the laſt verſe, that the <hi>Word</hi> ſhould not depart from the <hi>mouth</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt and his <hi>ſeed,</hi> and his <hi>ſeeds ſeed</hi> for ever, and that the Spirit ſhould accompany the word in the <hi>mouth</hi> of the ſeeds ſeed or ſucceſſive Saints from age to age.</p>
               <p>We confeſſe, that though reading the Scriptures or Scripture Truths in books may be a means of Faith through the Holy
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114660:14"/>
Ghoſt working therewith, yet this may be fitly comprehended under <hi>hearing</hi> of the Apoſtles and Prophets by their writings, by which they being dead, yet ſpeak, and doth ſtill confeſſe the Goſpel adminiſtred by Man, and not by any other Creatures, or by ſecret communication of light to the mind by God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, which theſe Aſſertors affirm, and we ſhall have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion to examine.</p>
               <p>We contend not herein for any particular ſort of Men, or them who do moſt readily call themſelves the Miniſters of the word of God, though we ſhall alway acknowledge the Order and Offices of the Church of God, but our chief contention is for the Goſpel as adminiſtred by Man, whether in word or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as not knowing how any ſhould believe unleſſe they hear the Teſtimony of the Apoſtles <hi>(John</hi> 17. 20.) or their <hi>Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For truly, we ſhould bear more eaſily the laying aſide of Man or his Miniſtration (though none may adventure to do it but Chriſt) who hath declared his mind as we have obſerved and ſhall) if theſe that advance themſelves above him who is the true Chriſt did not aim to beguile you of the Scriptures themſelves, even while you are looking on, and think not ſo.</p>
               <p>Wherefore while they ſay this Light or Goſpel is within you, they proceed to ſay it is the <hi>ſure word of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is then a Prophetick light in <hi>all men?</hi> or what doth it prophecy? of life and righteouſneſſe for ſinners in a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or of Death becauſe of diſobedience? or if this be the light that ſhines in a dark place, what is the day-ſtar and the Sun of righteouſneſſe, if this be Chriſt, as was before affirmed by them? But as the legs of the lame are not equal, no more are theſe parables; but that we may ſhew their diſtance from the truth rather than from themſelves, we beſeech you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that by this means,</p>
               <p>Either firſt, The Scriptures are laid aſide, not onely as not uſeful, but as not true Scripture to you, nor truth <hi>to you,</hi> if they be not particularly dictated in your hearts after the ſame manner as to them that wrote them. Thus they call it a

               <p>Fourthly, touching Apparel, We confeſs and may not deny that in the Church-relation, and in preſence of Chriſt, we may not have reſpect to gay cloathing and a gold ring, For then all eyes ſhould be inward while ſoul affaires are <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 16.</note>tranſacted; And we may not here know men <hi>after the fleſh,</hi> but as they are enriched with Faith and gifts of Grace, and as they ſtand in the judgement of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Apparel concerns the outward Man in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Man, though it is (as all other things) to be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and directed by the grace of God.

2. Which is the ſecond conſiderable in the obtaining of Propriety.</p>
               <p>Children are ſurviving parts of their parents, and have a true right to their Fathers inheritance by the Law of God, Nature, and Nations: And though it may ſeem not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to reaſon to make ſuch wide differences in dividing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances among many Brethren, as ſome do uſe, yet it was the Law in <hi>Iſrael</hi> that the eldeſt Sonne ſhould have a double <note place="margin">Deut. 21. 17</note>portion to his brethren, which by the appointment of God moſt juſt, did perpetuate propriety, and that in a way of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, one having more than another.

               <p n="3">3. But a private intereſt in worldly goods is alſo had by purchaſe, which is an exchange of things equally valuable in <note place="margin">Gen. 23. 16</note>lieu of each other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Alſo by the Victorious Iſſue of Lawfull Warre, when nations offer injuries and violence to their neighbours, reparation may be ſought in Warre, and the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers <note place="margin">Judges 20. 13.</note>refuſing to give ſatisfaction, forfeit what they have to the Law of Iuſtice, to make Reparation for the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>

               <p>Our anſwer is,</p>
               <p>That as for the practiſe of the Churches of <hi>Judaea, Act.</hi> 2. their love did riſe high at the firſt prevailing of the Goſpell, and propriety was caſt up by no law or perſwaſion but that of Love, as may be ſeen <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 4.

               <p>As for the giving one Coat of two to him that hath none, binds you not to give your coats to any beggar that firſt coms, but the Lord Jeſus hath left his people to the prudence of his Spirit in them, and diſcretion, to ſee the <hi>time</hi> when to give, and out of their abundance to ſupply anothers conveniency, and <note place="margin">Pſa. 112. 5.</note>out of their conveniency anothers neceſſity, and out of their neceſſaries anothers extremity.

                  <hi>Alſo becauſe they hold</hi> the uſe of Learning in and about Divine things.</p>
               <p>We anſwer to the firſt concerning wages,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is one thing to take a ſupply of neceſſaries, yea unto conveniency, for ones ſelf and family (if you call it wages) <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 6. 1 Cor. 9. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</note>while they adminiſter to the people ſpiritual things, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing to be a <hi>hireling</hi> (though we fear there are many ſuch.)</p>

them whom he intended to ſend into the Nations far off, to truſt him, by an experiment of his Providence in their own nation (as you read <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 36.)

               <p>We anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Apoſtles were itinerant preachers or travelling Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Chriſt, for the planting of Churches.</p>
               <p>Prophets were <hi>tranſient,</hi> or for ſome particular ſervice, and ſo neither Apoſtles nor Prophets needed any conſtant meeting-places to which they were bound, but the <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled</hi> Miniſtery of the old and new Teſtament had conſtant meeting-places, as twill appear to him that readeth, ſo far as perſecution in the Apoſtles time allowed.</p>

               <p>As for Learning, it is but ſubſervient to the underſtanding the Letter of the Scriptures, gives a more diſtinct utterance, helps to ſignificant words, and is an advantage that equalls them to their Adverſaries armed with learning againſt the truth. But ſome contend againſt learning, becauſe they know it not: as for theſe people, we ſuppoſe, had they learning, as their Leaders and Abbettors beyond the Seas, and in <hi>England</hi> did, ſo would they uſe it to the utmoſt againſt what they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>There be many railing and impertinent applications of Scriptures made by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which every one may ſee into that hath not darkneſſe on his right eye, and we ſhall not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; onely remembring, its not any perſon or circumſtance ſo much that is aimed at, as the Miniſtry it ſelf, or all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teachers; in which Argument they diſcover more En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Pride, Paſſion, than in any other. But be aſſured, if the Magiſtrates had not a material ſword, as the Miniſters have not, their language would light as heavy on their heads, and more than ſo.</p>
               <p>In all this we plead not for the ignorant, ungodly, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting men called Miniſters, but do ſadly bewail that after all the Petitions from the Nation, Declarations of the State, and Propoſalls from the wiſe hearted, there is yet any thing hinders the doing of ſomething to purpoſe to withdraw the Publick incouragement from the corrupt Miniſtry with whom God hath a controverſie.</p>

               <p n="4">4. To enquire after the way of God more perfectly, and not to reſt in National-Church-Conſtitution.</p>

                  </gap>, ſavoury, living at he me more (in ſelf examinations) ſeeking after full and <hi>clear</hi> enjoyments of Chriſt in his waies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The onely wiſe God may by meanes of theſe make way for the clearing up,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of the glorious myſteries appertaining to Saints ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience by provoking them,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To take notice of the <hi>Knockings, Offers, Motions,</hi> of the beloved putting in his finger to open their hearts, which ſleepy ſouls under the Temptations of Eaſe mind not, as Chriſt deſires and deſerves; This is an occaſion of many ſouls mournful walking, feebleneſſe, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedneſs with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The urging of theſe Doctrines, and boaſting of ſuch inward experiences though falſely grounded, ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke us to enquire after,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 33. 22. Rom. 8. 2.</note> 1. The royal dignity of the King of Righteouſneſſe on his Throne in a Saints heart, effectually guiding thoughts, words, actions, with a princely freedome of inlarged ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And of the <hi>frequent inſtructions</hi> of the <hi>Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 21.</note>who ſhall awaken their eares to hear whom he takes in hand to teach, writing the Law of God in their heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Likewiſe the glorious liberty of the children of <hi>Sion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted from under <hi>Sinai's</hi> curſes; even the purgation of <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 5.</note>the conſcience by the blood of ſprinking, by the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">Iſa. 41. 12. Cant.</note>who ſaith, Fear not, I am thy God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We ſhould be ſtirred up to enquire more in our experiences, after the ſweet and familiar entercourſe from conjugall Love between the King and Queen of glory, walking, talking, living, reſting together in <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 23.</note>that oneneſs which is the beginning of heaven.</p>
               <p>All which, with what concerns this head, are not onely conſiſtent with, but do abſolutely require Faith in Jeſus, who was crucifyed on Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> who is the Head of the

Body the Church, by the blood of whoſe croſs we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8, 9. Col. 1. 18, 19, 20.</note>the Atonement, and are admitted into the preſence of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19, 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the jealous God being diſpleaſed with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe gloſſes, and carnall interpretations of his holy word, which do rather ſhut than open it, may by this meanes awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the upright, and wiſe, to give diligence to the moſt plain, convincing, evident, and ſimple interpretation of the Scriptures, which are not incloſed in a private interpretation (or applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) onely to, or of the perſons to whom they were directed, but alway reach the like ſtate, ſpirit, condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and whenever, they being of more publique interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 11.</note>as that <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. 5. is applyed <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 1. is alſo fulfilled <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The head and husband of the Church may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make way for the clearing up the primitive inſtitution and exerciſe of Church-adminiſtrations, and by means known to himſelf to work out thoſe rotten members of Church and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, ſhaking down what is not right, that that which cannot be ſhaken may remain.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, theſe things will alſo tend to the diſcovery of many giddy and wanton Profeſſors, and of them who are approved of God; Alſo whether we have embraced the truth in the true light of it, and love of it, and ſo, whether we will contend for it, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Hereby God doth chaſten us for our Formality, Earthly Mindedneſſe, careleſsneſſe of the Saints ſcattered, whom we now ſee drawn away before our eyes with theſe inviſible Bands of ſtrong deluſions, which God onely can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve.</p>
               <p>Some other things we have in our thoughts, which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will ſhortly manifeſt, but we ſhall not now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But whatever the thoughts of God are, ſurely the Enemy the Devil thinks not ſo.</p>
               <p>But to deſtroy perſons and truths not a few, by laying waſt Scriptures, Churches, Graces, Experiences; which is the firſt leſſon theſe teach their Diſciples, even to forget
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114660:33"/>
and forgo all paſt principles and experiences.</p>
               <p>And to bring an odium upon the glorious affairs of Chriſts Kingdome (which haſten towards us in their time) which theſe imitate, and boaſt of, but have not.</p>
               <p>And to hinder the progreſſe of the Goſpell by weakning the hands of the moſt faithful preachers thereof, who hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were ſilenced by the Prelatical Power.</p>
               <p>Yet however Satans deſigns may be layed, ſurely there <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 23. Jude 22.</note>are many ſimple-hearted who may do him ſervice unawares, as <hi>Peter</hi> once did; wherefore on ſome have compaſſion, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a difference.</p>
               <p>Five things are partly obſerved, partly conceived, to occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on honeſt and ſimple minds cloſing with them unawares.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The badneſſe and ignorance of many in the Miniſtery (ſo called) in moſt places, by whom God doth not ſpeak to their hearts, and they cannot be contented without it; which occaſions their looking out, and liſtning to theſe who come as it were with the preſence and power of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some preſent deadneſſe in their hearts, occaſioned ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by formality in duties, or through grieving, the Spirit which then retires and leaves them in ſadneſſe, which they are weary of, and ſo cloſe with theſe as the firſt Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that come plauſibly to direct their way to regain their loſſe.</p>
               <p>We might here ſhew you that the deceitful heart reaſons it ſelf out of the way of the Lords Mercy, ſaying, The Lord is gone out of the publique Aſſemblies, he will uſe the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery no more, for I have prayed and endeavoured, and yet have not found quicknings there, when it may be that ſoul went to the watchmen that beat and abuſed him, or elſe went not in Faith, and hope fixed on God above men and meanes, or were impatient of the tarrying of God, and ſo concluded in haſt (as ſome of that way impertinently in this caſe uſe to ſay) He is riſen, he is not here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but read <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are perſwaded that God is doing ſome great and wonderfull thing, from the Scriptures, ſignes of the Times, and ſayi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gs of the wiſe; and having made triall of many waies <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>at leaſt in their Minds) at length come to this as the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114660:33"/>
moſt wonderful, which firſt they for a while admire, &amp; not being able to ſee thorough their words to their meaning, and beyond the golden pretences of glory, and Spirit, and croſs, &amp;c. come to be perſwaded there is ſome Divine thing among them, and ſo are ingaged to wait among them, and in waiting, the mind (partly by deſire, and partly by ſympathy, affections and tremblings, provoking others to the like) we ſay, the mind is put forward to meet the Temptation half-way, and ſo fall into the like feelings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we doubt not to ſay proceed from the mighty power of Satan.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Grappling with ſome corruptions, and being foiled by neglect and ſlumberings, and being in this way made to look more to their watch, the Truth heretofore manifeſted to them comes forth: And why may not Satan help on mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and a righteouſneſſe of works, for ſuch an end as <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 15.</note>to take away the death of Chriſt as for us <hi>without us,</hi> and the <hi>hearing of Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Some that are witty, having gotten ſome ſpeculations by the end are fed in their fond deſires after high things, &amp; finding the clew run well for a while, trace theſe notions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they find them ſtick, and becauſe for ſhame (it may be) they cannot retire, they get another end, and after that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, untill they have loſt themſelves, and be indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to return to the plain ſenſe of the Scriptures. But that is mercy from God to redeem any from theſe ſnares. The wonder is great in this Temptation, becauſe when once the mind is biazed, and hath drunk in the bottom of theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he ſhal read the Scriptures with ſuch ſpectacles, that he'l think all the Scriptures confirm his way, and by one alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory or other will wreſt the Plaineſt Scriptures againſt them to ſtand on their part; and this wicked wit ſome have by this meanes, ready at hand, and as it were naturall to them. As for thoſe who yet are not of their way, whoſe affections are good, but whoſe judgements ſerve them not to diſcern the myſtery of this way, they warn them, to take heed of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil of what they know not, and oppoſing the work of God which may be for ought all men know that are not of their way, carryed on among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:114660:34"/>
Thoſe who are in their ſnares are held,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By denying them liberty of diſcourſing or reaſoning with them that are not of their way, urging them to believe the pure teſtimony of Jeſus in them; although had we time or deſire to render them diſpicable to the enemies of the Truth, we could ſhew what inferences they make, and how things hang together like ropes of ſand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By ſetting them at utmoſt enmity to, and diſtance from, them who are moſt able (by the Grace of God) to convince them, and oppoſe their deceipts, by repreſenting them under the moſt hateful names of Scribes, Phariſees, Prieſts, Dogs, Swine, Idolators, Samaritans, Sorcerers, Babyloniſh, and what not that's naught?</p>
               <p n="3">3. By denying them liberty to try what is commanded them in their hearts, under pretence of giving up themſelves to God to do what he will with them; the ſad conſequences of which are known by ſome inſtances lately, by this means drawn to what modeſty hates, and ſome to baſpheme, and attempt lying wonders.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By frequent meetings and multiplyed papers; and it is manifeſt how the mind is ſtrengthned by daily converſing with them onely of one way.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By fitting them with things ſuitable, whether they have been Church-members or not, or whether diſcreet or leſs knowing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By applying all the Scriptures which ſpeak of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves partakers with them, as if they were the onely hated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted people for Chriſts ſake; when as indeed ſome do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to ſufferings more than wiſdomes waies lead to, or God requires, out of an ambition to be perſecuted.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, although many otherwiſe honeſt hearted may be thus inſnared and thus detained, yet we have cauſe to judge that ſome think to raiſe themſelves by levelling others; or make themſelves conſiderable by ſome new thing, which yet is not new; or to bring us under the yoke of <hi>Rome</hi> again, which hath theſe probable grounds.</p>
               <p>Conſidering the concordance between theſe principles and the Popiſh in the righteouſneſs of works, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:114660:34"/>
Alſo that ſome of them ſay Papiſts are as near the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God as Proteſtants;</p>
               <p>Again, remembring that Familiſts have ever been greater enemies to Puritans than to Papiſts or Prelates.</p>
               <p>Again, that many writings of Papiſts are applauded and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by diverſe of this way, above and before <hi>Preston, Sibbs, Perkins,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe that ſome printed Books ſhew ſomething of the deſigns of Jeſuits and others, turning and changing their cloaks to deceive, divide, and break us.</p>
               <p>But he that ſitteth in the Heavens laugheth, the Lord hath them in deriſion.</p>
               <p>Wherefore by what we have written, and a ſhort time will bring forth, you may ſee ſomething of thoſe ſpecious impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, which we warn you of in the name of the Lord; O watch and pray that you fall not into this Temptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 16. 25</note> Now to him who is of power to eſtabliſh you a ording to the Goſpell and the preaching of Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Revelation of the myſtery which was kept ſecret ſince the world began, but was made manifeſt ſince the comming of Chriſt, and by the Scriptures of the Prophets, according to the Commandment of the everlaſting God, made known to all Nations for the obedience of Faith, To God only wiſe be glory, through Jeſus Chriſt for ever.</p>
