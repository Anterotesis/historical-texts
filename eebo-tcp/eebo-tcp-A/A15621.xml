            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

benefites I am bounde: As I confesse that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest them I haue founde many and great welwillers, so to you two, whome my estate hath compelled to trouble and vse moste, for your constant good will and continued fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour shewed and benefites bestowed, I am aboue all others most bounden, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a thankfull remembrance haue dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated this simple sily labor vnto your honors. God in these our days, hath raised vp a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of worthy, learned carefull men for the Church of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of the latter sort, some translate into our tongue the learned works of other, some set out learned Sermons, Catechismes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther treatises for the admonition &amp; instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people: some shew their learning in mightily refuting and confounding the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon aduersaries: Yet amongest them all, one thing I see wanting. For where I see that God hath giuen vnto men two manner of Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and teachings: one by his word, another by his creatures, and for to help our dulnesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o learne by his creatures, hath by his Spirite in his holy Worde, giuen a meruellous num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Lessons drawne from thinges sensible. In the former manner of teaching, God hath blesse vs (in comparison of our Fathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly)
<pb facs="tcp:2010:3"/>
But in the latter I haue not seene any man of our time, that of purpose hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken paynes. Which want no doubt is some cause, that (by these outwarde thinges, which God hath appointed to bee so many helpes not onely for the present necessities of this life but also to Heauen) Men, ignoraunt of the good Lessons which the Holy Ghoste giueth by them, for want of further and dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per consideration, are detayned vppon earth, and drowned in earthly thinges, and doe not possesse but are possessed of their possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Wherefore in some little part to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye that wante, but cheefelye to giue to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of greater learning and giftes, occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bestowe this way some part of their leasure: I haue collected into the order of an Alphabet these fewe Lessons giuen by the spirite of God: Wherein, as I haue cheefely respected the benefite of the ruder sorte, so to accommodate my selfe vnto them, I haue endeuored with playnesse asmuch breuitye and shortnesse as I possibly could, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for the moste part, I haue deliuered the very wordes of the Holy Ghoste, worde for worde: And wheresoeuer I haue gone a little from them, yet there the very wordes giue manifest occasion of the collection. Which, that it may of all men the better and with lesse payne bee seene and viewed, I haue in the Margent noted not onely euery Chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb facs="tcp:2010:4"/>
but also euery verse whence I haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the note set downe. If then any may be occasioned by meane hereof, by the sight and vsing of earthly blessings, to lift vp their minds to heauenly contemplation, and thank<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full consideration of the Power, Wisedome, and goodnesse of God; then haue I my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and that which I onely seeke for.
