         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have perhaps troubled thee and the Press al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too much; if it be so, I shall how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hope, that I am not unpardonable, because I have still intended well to the good of the Publick; every one I think desires to give their Children the best Education that they can; but the highest degree of Education is not always best: And I must beg thy Pardon, if I do offend thee, in saying, That next to the bare Reading of <hi>English,</hi> the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Children to the <hi>Latin</hi> School, is not the best way of giving them Education, for if
<pb facs="tcp:64961:3"/>
that were granted, which I must deny, That the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues were not only necessary for all Children whatsoever, but also more easily learned, than the liberal Arts; yet <hi>Writing</hi> is so necessary to be first Learned, that it is almost impossible to attain the other without it.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Writing</hi> is very necessary in order to the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues, so is it also necessary in order to the true Spelling and Understanding of the <hi>English,</hi> or any other Native Language; and indeed the Art of <hi>Grammar</hi> is the only One of the Seven, that claims a propriety in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Language: As for the other Arts, they are the same, in all Languages, the Rules of <hi>Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> and <hi>Geometry,</hi> of <hi>Musick</hi> and <hi>Astronomy,</hi> of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64961:3"/>
are in the General, as Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible in every Language, as in the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> or any other; and therefore to them, that have no other need of the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues, than the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of these Arts, may, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, spare that pains, and Learn them in their own Native Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, or as many of them, as will be thought useful for them, in their several Stations in the World.</p>
            <p>Again, these Arts are not only attainable in every Native Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but more easily attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues are, to which some seem desirous to confine the Arts; and being so attained, do render other Languages more easie also.</p>
            <p>For these, and the like Reasons, as I have already Published distinct Introductions to every Art, except
<pb facs="tcp:64961:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Musick;</hi> for which I refer thee to Mr. <hi>Joh. Playford</hi>'s Introduction; so now I have been easily perswaded, to give thee a short view of them altogether; he that desires more full Instruction, may peruse the several Tracts by me Written, in our own, or those that are Written by other Men in other Languages. The whole Building is but small, and therefore I will not make the Porch great, I have placed the Arts in that Order, in which, (with submission to better Judgments) I do conceive they should be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: And although I cannot say now, as I have in some of my Epistles preceding my former Tracts, that there is not so much as one <hi>Mathematical School</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> for now there is by the Bounty of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> a fair one Erected in <hi>Christs Hospital, London,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64961:4"/>
and a worthy Master chosen to Manage it, by Name Mr. <hi>Edward Pagett,</hi> who is so well known, that he needeth no Mans Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations to express his VVorth; Yet thus much I still declare to be my opinion, That it is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that the <hi>Latin</hi> School should be supplied with Scholars from the <hi>Mathematical,</hi> than that the <hi>Mathematical</hi> should be supplied from the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Schools: However by this means, I hope it will come to pass, that after-ages will be supplied with that Knowledge in <hi>Arithmetick, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,</hi> and <hi>Astronomy,</hi> which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto our <hi>Writing</hi>-Masters have not been able to Teach, nor our <hi>Grammar</hi> Masters either able or willing to undertake; so that in a Word, There are few School-Masters that can Teach these
<pb facs="tcp:64961:5"/>
things: But yet amongst them, the well Accomplished Mr. <hi>John Colson,</hi> now living in <hi>Goodmans-fields,</hi> with whom I have not had the happiness to be immediately Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, yet Report hath rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to the World a worthy Master and Teacher of that Science. And there are not many Tutors in either of our Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that do; and yet the usefulness of these Arts cannot be denied, and therefore my hopes are, that some Universal Encouragement will yet be given for the Teaching of them.</p>
            <p>And could I be so happy, as to see something done in order to it, I should think my self abundantly satisfied for all the Pains I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto taken, and shal1 ever rest,</p>

Wisdom, are the only true <hi>Philosophers:</hi> for <hi>Philosophy</hi> is nothing else but the love of Wisdom, and they who Fear God, and depart from Evil, are the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of that, which is only real and true Wisdom: Now for as much, as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to fear God, except we know him, Wisdom may well be defined to be the Knowledge of God, and the things that are of him, the knowledge of things Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane, and this is commonly called <hi>Philosophy,</hi> but somewhat impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, for <hi>Philosophy</hi> is not properly the Knowledge it self, but the love of that Knowledge; and what soever <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> doth conduce to this Knowledge, may be rightly and truly called <hi>Sophia</hi> or <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> and because all Men should love such Knowledge and Delight in it, I shall not gain say the general Name by which it is called, custom will have it so, let it therefore be called <hi>Philosophy.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Rammer</hi> is an ART which Teacheth how to Speak and Write truly.</p>
               <p>The Parts thereof are Four, Letters, Syllables, Words, and Sentences.</p>
               <p>A Letter is a Character, or Index, of a simple sound. And in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue there are Twenty four.</p>
               <p>The which Letters are distinguished from one another, partly by their shapes and partly by their sounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64961:8"/>In reference to their shapes, they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished by three different Characters, the <hi>Roman, Italick,</hi> and black <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in each of these Characters there is the great and the small Letter.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Roman</hi> Character, the Great Letter is thus formed,</p>
               <p>A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.</p>
               <p>The small thus,</p>
               <p>a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z.</p>
               <p>The great and small <hi>Italick</hi> Letters are made thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great and small black <hi>English</hi> thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, r, s, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great Letters are used in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of proper Names, Emphatical words, Sentences, and Verses. The Letter I when it stands alone, is always written with a great Character.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64961:8"/>These Twenty and four Letters are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Vowels and Consonants.</p>
               <p>A Vowel is a letter which maketh a full and perfect sound of it self, and they are five, <hi>a, e, i, o, u,</hi> besides the <hi>Greek</hi> Vowel <hi>y.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Consonant is a letter which maketh a sound by help of a Vowel, and these are Eighteen, besides the letters <hi>j, v,</hi> and <hi>y,</hi> which sometimes are Consonants also.</p>
               <p>Of the eighteen Consonants, some are mutes, as these eight, <hi>b, c, d, g, k, p, q,</hi> and <hi>t.</hi> Some semi-Vowels, as these eight, <hi>f, l, m, n, r, s, x,</hi> and <hi>z,</hi> of which these four, <hi>l, m, n, r,</hi> are also called Liquids, <hi>x,</hi> and <hi>z,</hi> double Consonants, and the other two, <hi>h,</hi> and <hi>w,</hi> irregular Letters.</p>
               <p>Some of these Letters, as well Vowels as Consonants, have sounds very different from their common names. Thus the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>c,</hi> before <hi>e,</hi> and <hi>i,</hi> is sounded like <hi>f,</hi> but before <hi>a, o, u,</hi> it is sounded like <hi>k,</hi> as in <hi>cat, cot, cut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Letter <hi>f,</hi> is sometimes sounded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its usual name, as when it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a Vowel, as in <hi>if, of, effeminate,</hi> but when it begins a Word or Syllable, it is sounded <hi>fee,</hi> as in <hi>feet, foolish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Letter <hi>g,</hi> before <hi>a, o,</hi> and <hi>u,</hi> is soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hard, thus, <hi>ghee,</hi> as in <hi>gad, God, gut,</hi> but before <hi>e</hi> and <hi>i</hi> it is sometimes, but not always, sounded according to its usual name <hi>gee,</hi> as in <hi>danger, ginger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64961:9"/>The Letter <hi>h,</hi> is never sounded according to its name <hi>ach,</hi> but thus, <hi>hee,</hi> as in <hi>hand, help, him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The letters <hi>j</hi> and <hi>v,</hi> when they come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themselves, or any other Vowel in the same Syllable, become Consonants, and have different sounds from their usual names, <hi>j</hi> is pronounced like <hi>g</hi> soft, thus <hi>ji</hi> is pronounced like <hi>gi,</hi> in <hi>ginger, v</hi> is pronounced <hi>vee,</hi> or <hi>vu,</hi> as in <hi>vanish, vine</hi>; and when they are thus sounded, their shape is also changed, and hence some would have them to be distinct letters, and would have the number of our letters to be not 24 but 26.</p>
               <p>The Liquids <hi>l, m, n,</hi> and <hi>r,</hi> when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a Word or Syllable, are sounded thus, <hi>lee, mee, ree,</hi> as in <hi>light, mind, need, read.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The letter <hi>q,</hi> hath always <hi>u</hi> after it, to help its sound, but is not to be sounded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its name <hi>eu,</hi> but <hi>que,</hi> as in <hi>question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The letter <hi>s,</hi> when it begins a word or Syllable is to be sounded thus; <hi>see,</hi> as in <hi>sad, secret,</hi> but in the end of a word, or between two Vowels or Dipthongs, it hath for the most part the sound of <hi>z,</hi> as in <hi>easie, bosom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The letter <hi>t</hi> before <hi>i,</hi> if another Vowel fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, hath the sound of <hi>si,</hi> as in <hi>Egyptian, patience</hi>; but when it followeth <hi>s</hi> or <hi>x,</hi> it hath its own proper sound, as in <hi>bestial, mixtion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The letter <hi>w,</hi> hath its name from its shape, being composed of twice <hi>u,</hi> it is called dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>u</hi>; but is in no case so sounded, but <hi>we,</hi> as in <hi>wall, well, will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64961:9"/>The letter <hi>x,</hi> when it begins a word or Syllable, is sounded thus, <hi>xee,</hi> as in <hi>Xerxes</hi>; in other cases thus, <hi>ex,</hi> or <hi>ecs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The letter <hi>y</hi> hath by no means its sound according to its usual name <hi>wi,</hi> but when it begins a word or Syllable, and so becomes a Consonant, it is sounded <hi>yee</hi>; when it comes in the middle or end of a word, it is sounded like <hi>i</hi> Vowel, as in <hi>my, thy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The letter <hi>z</hi> is to be sounded <hi>zee,</hi> as in <hi>Zeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Syllable is a literal or articulate Voice of one individual sound.</p>
               <p>Syllables are of two sorts, improper and proper.</p>
               <p>An improper Syllyble is made of one or more Vowels without a Consonant; as <hi>a-ny, e-vil, Ae-neas, Oe-dipus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Proper Syllable is the comprehension of one or more Consonants, with one or more Vowels, in one sound or breath; as <hi>Ge-ne-ra-ti-on, Moun-tain,</hi> and in our <hi>English</hi> Tongue doth sometimes consist of eight let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as <hi>strength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When two Vowels are joyned together in one sound or breath, they are called Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thongs; of which there are two sorts, Proper and Improper.</p>
               <p>Of proper Dipthongs, there are these eight, <hi>ai, ei, oi, au, eu, ou, ee,</hi> and <hi>oo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first six are sometimes written thus, <hi>ay, ey, oy, aw, ew, ow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64961:10"/>Of improper Dipthongs there are but these three, <hi>ea, oa,</hi> and <hi>ie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two Vowels which make a Dipthong, are for the most part to be sounded together, as in <hi>Faith, neither, Eunuch,</hi> but in these words, <hi>Laity, Mosaick work, Deity, Atheist, moity, doing, reenter, reiterate,</hi> and such like; and in most Proper Names in the Bible they are to be sounded severally.</p>
               <p>The Improper Dipthongs <hi>ea,</hi> and <hi>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> are sounded together, except in these words, <hi>beatitude, Creator, creation, real, theatre,</hi> and most proper names of Women, Cities, and Countries; but the two Vowels in this Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thong <hi>ei,</hi> are usually parted, except in these two words, <hi>friend, grief,</hi> and when they come in the end of a word, as in <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, charitie,</hi> and such like.</p>
               <p>An <hi>English</hi> syllable, though it may consist of eight letters, yet doth it never begin with more than two Vowels before a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant, of three Consonants before a Vowel or Dipthong.</p>
               <p>The two Consonants which may begin an <hi>English</hi> word or syllable, are these thirty, <hi>Bl, br, ch, cl, cr, dr, dw, fl, fr, gl, gn, gr, kn, pl, pr, sc, sh, sk, sp, sl, sm, sn, sq, sw, th, tr, tw, wh,</hi> and <hi>wr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the three Consonants that may begin an <hi>English</hi> word, are these nine, <hi>Sch, scr, shr, skr, spl, spr, str, thr, thw.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the sounding of the Consonants, which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64961:10"/>
are joyned together in the beginning of a word, there is no difficulty, but in these few, <hi>ch, gh,</hi> and <hi>th.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The letters <hi>ch,</hi> when they come before a Vowel in a pure <hi>English</hi> word, they are to be sounded as in <hi>chance, cheap</hi>; and when they come after a Vowel, they are to be sounded, as in <hi>ach, reach, rich.</hi> But in words derived from the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> they are to be sounded like <hi>k,</hi> as in <hi>character,</hi> these few only excepted, <hi>Rachel, Cherubin, Tychicus, Arch-Bishop, Arch-Duke, Architect, Arch-enemy, Arch-pirat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The letters <hi>gh,</hi> in the beginning of a word, are to be sounded like <hi>g</hi> hard, as in <hi>ghost, ghess,</hi> in the midd1e of a word, they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not sounded at all, or but softly, as in <hi>might, light,</hi> and in the end of a word they have the sound of <hi>ff,</hi> as <hi>cough, tough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These letters <hi>th,</hi> in words of one syllable, and in words of more than one, ending in <hi>ther, thed, theth, thest, thing,</hi> they have the sound of <hi>d,</hi> in other words the sound of <hi>t,</hi> or the Greek <hi>Theta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The letters <hi>ph,</hi> never begin a pure <hi>English</hi> word, but such only as are derived from the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as <hi>Pharisee, Pharez, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph,</hi> and in these they are sounded like <hi>f.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Liquids, <hi>l, m, n, r,</hi> when another Consonant doth precede them in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or middle of a word, do retain their own sound, but in the end of a word, though
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64961:11"/>
the Vowel <hi>e,</hi> ought to be written, yet in the pronounciation, you must stop at the two Consonants, and omit the Vowel; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>fable, acre, uncle,</hi> must be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as though they were written thus, <hi>fabl, acr, uncl.</hi>

               <p>A <hi>Word,</hi> is such a comprehension of letters and syllables, as helpeth Man-kind to express their minds to one another.</p>
               <p>There are eight kinds of Words, or parts of Speech, <hi>Noun, Pronoun, Verb, Participle, Adverb, Conjunction, Preposition, Interjection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Noun,</hi> is the name of a Person or Thing; as, an <hi>Author,</hi> a <hi>Book, learned, guilded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of <hi>Nouns,</hi> some be <hi>Substantives,</hi> and some be <hi>Adjectives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Noun Substantive,</hi> is a Word, that sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth something, and may have the sign (<hi>a</hi>) or (<hi>the</hi>) before it; as <hi>a Man, the Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Noun Adjective,</hi> is a Word, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not signifie a thing of it self; as, <hi>good, bad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two sorts of <hi>Nouns Substantives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Noun Substantive</hi> proper, and a <hi>Noun substantive</hi> common.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Noun Substantive</hi> proper, is a <hi>Noun</hi> that is proper to the person or thing, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth; as, <hi>Henry, England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64961:11"/>A <hi>Noun substantive</hi> common, is a <hi>Noun</hi> common to all things of the same kind; as, <hi>a Man, a Land, an Angel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To a <hi>Noun</hi> there doth belong two things, number and comparison.</p>
               <p>There be two <hi>Numbers,</hi> the <hi>singular</hi> and the <hi>plural</hi>; the <hi>Singular number</hi> speaketh but of One; as a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Book,</hi> a <hi>Stone.</hi> The <hi>Plural number</hi> speaketh of more than One, as <hi>Men, Books, Stones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nouns Substantive</hi> of the <hi>singular number,</hi> are turned into the <hi>plural,</hi> by adding unto them <hi>s</hi> or <hi>es,</hi> as <hi>web, webs, robe, robes, Church, Churches, hedge, hedges.</hi> Some <hi>Nouns</hi> of the <hi>singular number</hi> ending in <hi>f,</hi> being <hi>plurals,</hi> do change <hi>f</hi> into <hi>v,</hi> as <hi>beef, beeves, calf, calves.</hi> And some are made <hi>plurals,</hi> by adding of <hi>en</hi> or <hi>ren</hi>; as, <hi>Ox, oxen, chick, chicken, brother, brotheren,</hi> or by contraction <hi>brethren, child, children</hi>; of <hi>Man</hi> is formed <hi>mannen,</hi> or <hi>men, house, housen, hose, hosen</hi>; to which may be added, <hi>mouse, mice, louse, lice, die, dise, sow, swine, cow, kine, peney, pence, goose, geese, tooth, teeth, foot, feet</hi>; these two; <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Mile,</hi> are both <hi>singular</hi> and <hi>plural</hi>; as, <hi>one sheep, ten sheep, one mile, ten mile</hi> or <hi>miles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other variation of <hi>Nouns</hi> we have none in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue; all other distinctions are made by these Articles and Prepositions; <hi>a, of, to, the, o,</hi> and <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>from,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nouns</hi> that signifie the Male-kind, we call <hi>hees</hi>; such as signifie the Female, we call
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64961:12"/>
                  <hi>shees</hi>; and of such as signifie neither, we say <hi>it</hi>; as, <hi>Esau</hi> could not obtain his Fathers blessing, though <hi>he</hi> sought <hi>it,</hi> with tears: <hi>Jezabel</hi> was a wicked woman, for she slew the Lord's Prophets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Comparison</hi> belongeth only to <hi>Nouns Adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives,</hi> whose significatoin may be increased, or diminished.</p>
               <p>There be three degrees of <hi>Comparison,</hi> the <hi>Positive, Comparative,</hi> and the <hi>Superlative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Positive degree</hi> setteth down the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a thing absolutely without excess, as <hi>hard, soft, swift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Comparitive degree</hi> raiseth the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the <hi>Positive,</hi> in comparison of some other, as <hi>harder, softer, swifter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Superlative</hi> exceedeth his <hi>positive</hi> in the highest degree, as <hi>hardest , softest, swiftest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adjectives</hi> are compared in the <hi>English</hi> tongue, either by the signs <hi>more</hi> and <hi>most,</hi> or by the terminations <hi>er,</hi> and <hi>est,</hi> as <hi>hard, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. IV Of a Verb and Participle.</head>
               <p>A <hi>Verb</hi> is a part of Speech, that joyneth the Signification of other words to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>There are three kinds of <hi>Verbs, Active, Passive,</hi> and <hi>Neuter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Verb Active,</hi> is a <hi>Verb</hi> that betokeneth doing, as, <hi>I love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Verb Passive,</hi> is a <hi>Verb</hi> which betoken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth suffering, as <hi>I am loved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Verb Neuter,</hi> is a <hi>Verb</hi> which betoken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth being, as <hi>I am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Four things belong to a <hi>Verb, Mood, Tense, Number</hi> and <hi>Person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are four <hi>Moods,</hi> the <hi>Indicative,</hi> the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64961:13"/>
                  <hi>Imperative,</hi> the <hi>Potential,</hi> and the <hi>Infinitive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Indicative</hi> either sheweth a reason true or false, as <hi>I love,</hi> or asketh a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as, <hi>dost thou love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There <hi>Imperative Mood,</hi> intreateth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth, or commandeth, as <hi>love he,</hi> or <hi>let him love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Potential Mood,</hi> signifieth a power, duty, or desire, and hath one of these Signs, <hi>may, can, might, would, should, could,</hi> or <hi>ought,</hi> as <hi>I may or can love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Infinitive Mood,</hi> notes no certain Number or Person, but followeth another <hi>Verb,</hi> or an <hi>Adjective,</hi> and hath commonly this Sign (<hi>to</hi>) before it, as <hi>I desire to learn, worthy to be praised.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Tenses</hi> or distinctions of Time, are five, The <hi>Present Tense,</hi> the <hi>Preterimperfect Tense,</hi> the <hi>Preterperfect Tense,</hi> the <hi>Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluperfect Tense,</hi> and the <hi>Future Tense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>Tenses</hi> in respect of signification, are thus distinguished; in the <hi>Indicative Mood, do</hi> is the sign of the Present Tense, <hi>did</hi> of the preterimperfect Tense, <hi>have</hi> of the Preterperfect, <hi>had</hi> of the Preterpluper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>shall</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of the Future,</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Potential Mood,</hi> by the signs alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy given, the Present Tense by the signs <hi>may</hi> or <hi>can,</hi> the Preterimperfect <hi>would, should, could,</hi> or <hi>ought,</hi> and the Preterperfect, by annexing the sign have to the former Signs, and the Future, by adding <hi>hereafter</hi> to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64961:14"/>
signs of <hi>may</hi> or <hi>can,</hi> the Signs of the Present, as, <hi>I may or can hereafter,</hi> the Preterpluper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in this Mood is wanting in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue.</p>
               <p>But in respect of Termination, there are no Moods but one, no Tenses but two, namely, the <hi>Present,</hi> and <hi>Preterimperfect</hi> Tenses.</p>
               <p>And the Preterimperfect Tense is formed from the Present, by adding thereto the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination (<hi>ed</hi>) and in some few the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (<hi>en</hi>) as of <hi>love</hi> is formed <hi>loved,</hi> of <hi>fall, fallen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Persons in every Tense are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by the personal Pronouns, <hi>I, Thou,</hi> and <hi>He,</hi> in the Singular Number, and <hi>We, Ye, They,</hi> in the Plural; only the Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Singular in the Present and Preterimper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Tenses is formed from the first, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto the Termination <hi>est,</hi> as of <hi>love, lovest,</hi> of <hi>loved, lovedst</hi>; and the Third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Singular in the Present Tense is formed from the First, by adding thereto the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination (<hi>eth</hi>) as of <hi>love</hi> is formed <hi>loveth.</hi> other variations of Persons or Tenses there is none, but what is done by Signs, as was said before.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Verb Active</hi> then is thus formed in the <hi>Indicative Mood.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of Dividing of Words into Syllables.</head>
               <p>FOr the dividing of Words into Syllables there are four Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Two Vowels which make no Dipthong, must be divided; as, <hi>ie, iu, ua</hi>; as in <hi>qui-et, tri-umph, mutu-al.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Those Consonants which are doubled in the middle of a Word, must be divided; as in <hi>Abba, accord, adder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Except they be needlesly doubled, as in words of the <hi>Plural Number</hi>; as in <hi>crabbs, rodds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Except such words in which they are dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for distinction sake; as in the words, <hi>Ann, Cann, Inn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Rule.</hi> When a Consonant cometh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Vowels, it is to be joyned to the latter; as in <hi>a-vail, a-ni-mate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this Rule there are four Exceptions</p>
               <p n="1">1. Except Words ending in <hi>es,</hi> as in <hi>Nouns,</hi> of the <hi>Plural Number,</hi> and <hi>Verbs</hi> of the <hi>third person Singular,</hi> in which this particle is for the most part swallowed up, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Syllable; but in all proper Names, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> it makes a distinct Syllable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Except Words that are compounded of such Simple Words, as are significant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64961:16"/>
in which each Simple Word must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its own letters; as, <hi>Trades-man, safe-guard, hence-forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Except <hi>Derivative</hi> Words, whose ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the <hi>Primitive,</hi> doth signifie nothing of it self, in which the <hi>Primitive</hi> must be sounded by it self, and the addition by it self; as, <hi>hope-less, lov-ing, joyn-ing,</hi> and such like.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Except such Words in which <hi>x</hi> cometh between two Vowels, in which it must be joyned to the first Vowel; as, <hi>ox-en, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Rule.</hi> Any two or three Consonants, which may be joyned together in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a word, are not to be seperated in the middle; as in <hi>a-gree, bestow, en-thrall; destruction</hi>; but in compounded words, each simple word must retain its own Letters.</p>
               <p>When you are to write any hard long word, mark how many sounds or Syllables it hath, as if you were to write <hi>disdainfullness, universalitie,</hi> or the like, before you write it, say thus to your self; <hi>dis-dain-full-ness, u-ni-ver-sa-li-tie,</hi> and you shall hardly miss in the writing thereof.</p>

               <p>The Stops or Points to be observed in <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,</hi> are of two sorts, <hi>Primary,</hi> and <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary.</hi>

               <p n="7">7. A <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> is a note, like two half Moons, inclosing a sentence, which may be used or omitted, and yet the sense remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, thus ()</p>

               <p n="1">1. An <hi>Apostrophe,</hi> which is a note, set on the top or side of a Letter, whereby two Syllables are contracted into one, and is made like a <hi>Comma,</hi> thus (') as <hi>it's for it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. An <hi>Eclipsis,</hi> which is a note cutting off one or more words in the beginning or end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Verse or Sentence, cited in our <hi>Writing,</hi> and is made with a long stroke thus — as

               <head>CHAP. I. Of single Arithmetick in whole Numbers.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ARithmetick</hi> is the art of accompting by Numbers; it is either <hi>positive</hi> or <hi>negative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Positive Arithmetick,</hi> is that which is wrought by certain and infallible Numbers at first propounded; and this is either <hi>single</hi> or <hi>comparative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Single,</hi> which is wrought by Numbers, considered alone, without relation to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and this either in whole Numbers; or in Fractions.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:64961:19"/>4. The parts of <hi>single Arithmetick,</hi> are two, <hi>Notation</hi> and <hi>Numeration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Notation</hi> hath two parts; the first shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the value of the Notes, by which all num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are expressed; the second sheweth how to read the Numbers which are expressed by those notes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Notes or Characters, by which all Numbers are usually expressed are these, 1. <hi>one,</hi> 2. <hi>two,</hi> 3. <hi>three,</hi> 4. <hi>four,</hi> 5. <hi>five,</hi> 6. <hi>six,</hi> 7. <hi>seven,</hi> 8. <hi>eight,</hi> 9. <hi>nine,</hi> 0. <hi>nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. These notes are either significant Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, or a Cypher.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The significant Figures, are the first nine, <hi>viz.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The first whereof is more particularly termed an <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> or <hi>unitie,</hi> the rest are said to be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of <hi>unities</hi>; so 2, is composed of two <hi>unites</hi> 3, of three <hi>unites,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The <hi>Cypher,</hi> though it signifie nothing of it self, yet being set before or after any of the rest, increaseth or decreaseth their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, as shall be farther shewed hereafter.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The second part of <hi>Notation,</hi> is the reading of the Number expressed by these notes; and this is done by distinguising the Number given into Degrees and Periods.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The degrees are three, the first is that first place of a number towards the right hand, and is the place of Unity. The second is the second Figure towards the right hand, and this is the place of Tens. The third is the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64961:19"/>
third Figure towards the right hand, and is the place of Hundreds; so this Character 9, doth signifie Nine; these Notes 27, Twenty seven; and these 235, Two hundred thirty five.</p>
               <p n="12">12. A <hi>Period,</hi> is when a number consisting of more notes than three, hath each three notes thereof (beginning at the right hand) distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by Points or <hi>Commas</hi>: The several parts of the Numbers so distinguished, are called <hi>Periods</hi>; so the Number 38156249, being distinguished into <hi>Periods,</hi> will stand thus, 38.156.249. of which the first Period is read thus, Two hundred forty nine; the first Figure in the second <hi>Period</hi> is the place of Thousands, the second Tens of Thousands, and the third Hundreds of Thousands. In the third <hi>Period,</hi> the Figure is in the place of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, the second Tens of Millions, and so this Number is thus to be read. Thirty Eight Millions, One Hundred Fifty Six Thousand, Two Hundred Forty Nine.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>Numeration,</hi> is that which by certain known Numbers propounded, doth discover another Number unknown.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Numeration</hi> hath four Species; <hi>Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Subtraction, Multiplication,</hi> and <hi>Division.</hi>

               <p n="15">15. <hi>Addition,</hi> is that by which divers num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are added together, to the end that the Sum or Total may be discovered. For which purpose, having placed the numbers as in the following Example, begin with those in the

               <p>
                  <hi>SIngle Arithmetick</hi> in a whole Numbers, hath been shewed in the last Chapter; <hi>Single Arithmetick</hi> in Fractions now followeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A <hi>Fraction</hi> is a part of an Integer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Single Arithmetick</hi> in Fractions, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so consist of two Parts, <hi>Notation,</hi> and <hi>Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Notation</hi> of Fractions, is that which sheweth how the Fraction part of any Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may be expressed in numbers; that is, an Integer on one whole thing being Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into any Number of equal parts, Notati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sheweth how these parts may be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; as if a Yard were Divided into four parts, and it were desired, that I should set down three of these parts; the usual manner is thus, draw a line, &amp; set the Number of parts into which the Integer is supposed to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, under the line, and the Number of parts you would express set above the line; thus to express three of four parts, I write 4 under a line, and 3 above it, thus, ¾; and so may you do with any other number pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded: Where note, that the number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the line is called the Numerator, and the number under the line the Denominator.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A <hi>Fraction</hi> is either <hi>Proper</hi> or <hi>Improper.</hi>

               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:64961:22"/>6. A <hi>Proper Fraction</hi> is that whole Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator is less than the Denominator, such as are these ¾ 6/12 25/100.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A <hi>Proper Fraction</hi> is either <hi>single</hi> or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. A <hi>Single Fraction</hi> is that which consists of one Numerator and one Denominator, such as are ¾ 6/12 25/100.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A <hi>Compound Fraction</hi> (otherwise called a <hi>Fraction of a Fraction</hi>) is that which hath more Numerators and more Denominators than one, which kind of Fractions are disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable by this word <hi>(of</hi>) which is interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed between their parts; as, ⅔ of ¾ is a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Fraction, or a Compound Fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and expresseth two thirds of three fourths of an Integer.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The things expressed by broken num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or Fractions, are principally the Parts or Fractions of Money, Weight, Measure, Time, and things accounted by the Dozen.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The least part or Fraction of Money used in <hi>England</hi> is a Farthing; and four Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things makes a Peny; twelve Pence, a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and twenty Shillings, one Pound Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The least Fraction of weight used in <hi>England,</hi> is a Grain; that is, the weight of a Grain of Wheat, well dryed and gather'd out of the middle of the Ear, whereof 32 make a peny weight, and twenty peny weight an ounce <hi>Troy,</hi> and twelve ounces a Pound; but

               <p>THus much hath been said concerning <hi>Single Arithmetick, Comparative</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, which is wrought by Numbers, as they are considered to have relation to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Relation consists either in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or in quality.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Relation in quantity is the reference that the Numbers themselves have one to another; as when the comparison is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 8 and 2, or 2 and 8; 7 and 3, or 3 and 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:64961:29"/>And here the Numbers propounded are always two, whereof the first is called the Antecedent, the other the Consequent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Relation in quantity, consists either in the difference, or in the rate or reason found between the Numbers propounded; the one is found by Subtracting the less from the greater; so 6 is the difference between 8 and 2; but the other, to wit, the rate or reason, is found by dividing the greater by the less, and thus the rate between 8 and 2 is four-fold, because 2 is found four times in 8; Or the rate may be also found by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the less by the greater, or setting the Numbers given in manner of a Fraction, and thus the rate between 2 and 8 is 4 also, or 2/8 that is ¼.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This rate or reason of Numbers is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther equal or unequal; equal reason, is the relation that equal Numbers have one to another, as 5 to 5, 6 to 6. Unequal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is the relation that Unequal Numbers have one to another, and this is either of the greater to the less, or of the less unto the greater.</p>
               <p>In the one the greater Number is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, and the less the Consequent; and in the other the lesser Number is the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and the greater is the Consequent.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Relation in quality, (otherwise called Proportion) is the reference or respect that the reasons of Numbers have one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of the Rule of Fellowship.</head>
               <p>THe Rules of plural proportion are those, by which we Resolved Questions that are discoverable by more Rules of Three than one, and cannot be performed by the double <hi>Rule of Three</hi> mentioned in the last chapter.</p>
               <p>Of these Rules there are divers kinds and varieties, according to the nature of the Question propounded; I will only mention one, and refer the rest to my larger treatise of this Subject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Rule of plural proportion that I mean to mention, is the Rule of <hi>Fellowship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And the Rule of <hi>Fellowship</hi> is that by which in Accompts amongst divers Men, (their several stocks together) the whole Loss or Gain being propounded, the Loss or Gain of each particular man may be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Rule of Fellowship</hi> is either single or double.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Single Rule of Fellowship</hi> is, when the stocks propounded are single numbers; As in this Example: <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B</hi> were Partners in an Adventure to <hi>Sea, A</hi> put in 25. <hi>l. B</hi> 56, and upon return of the Ship, they sold the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64961:34"/>
Fraight for 50 <hi>l.</hi> profit; the question is, What part of this 50 <hi>l.</hi> is due to <hi>A,</hi> and what to <hi>B</hi>? to resolve this and the like Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, the sum of the stocks must be the first term in the Rule of Three, the whole gain the second, and each particular stock the third; this done repeating the Rule of Three, as often as there are particular stocks in the Question, the fourth term pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by these several operations are the respective Gains or Losses of those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar stocks propounded; so in the present question, the Resolution will be as here you see. <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Double Rule of Fellowship</hi> is, when the stocks propounded are double numbers, that is, when each stock hath relation to a particular time. <hi>A, B,</hi> and <hi>C,</hi> hire a piece of Ground for 45 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> in which <hi>A</hi> had 24 Oxen 32 days, <hi>B</hi> 12, for 48 days, <hi>C</hi> 16, for 24 days; now the question to be resolved is, What part of the Rent each person must pay?</p>
               <p>For this purpose you must first Multiply each particular stock by its respective time, and take the total of their Products for the first term, the Gain or Loss for the second, and every man's particular stock and time
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64961:35"/>
for the third; this done repeating the Rule of Three so often as there are Products of the double Numbers; the fourth terms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced upon those several operations are the numbers sought. So then in the question propounded, the Product of 24 and 32 is 768; the Product of 12 and 48 is 576, and the Product of 16 and 24 is 384, the sum of these Products is 1728, which is the first term, 45 <hi>l.</hi> the Rent is the second, and each particular Product the third; <gap reason="math">

               <p>By which three Operations the question is Resolved.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>GEOMETRY</hi> is the Art of Measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring well.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Subject of <hi>Geometry</hi> is Magnitude, or continued Quantity, whose parts are joyned together by a common term or limit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Magnitude</hi> is either a Line, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing made of a Line or Lines.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A <hi>Line</hi> is a Magnitude, consisting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of length, without either breadth or thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the term or limit whereof is a Point.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:64961:36"/>5. A <hi>Point</hi> is an indivisible sign in Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. A <hi>Point</hi> therefore is no quantity, but the beginning of all continued quantities, which are divisible in power infinitely.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A <hi>Line</hi> is either considered simply by it self, or else comparatively with another Line.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A <hi>Line</hi> considered simply of it self, is either Right or Oblique.</p>
               <p n="8">8. A <hi>Right line,</hi> is that which lyeth equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly between his Points.</p>
               <p n="9">9. An <hi>Oblique line,</hi> is either circular or mixt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. A <hi>Periphery,</hi> or Circular Line, is that which is equally distant from the middle of the comprehended space, which middle is called the <hi>Centre,</hi> and the distance between that Centre and the Circumference, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Radius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Lines compared to one another are or the same or different Species.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Lines compared together of the same Species, are either Parallel or Angular.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>Parallel lines,</hi> are such as are equally distant in all places, and are either Right lined Parallels, or Circular.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Right lined Parallels,</hi> are such as being in one and the self same plane, and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced on both sides, do never meet in any part.</p>
               <p n="15">15. A <hi>Circular Parallel</hi> is a Circle drawn within or without another Circle.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:64961:36"/>16. <hi>Angular lines</hi> are such as inclining, or bowing to one another, touch one another, but not in a direct line.</p>
               <p n="17">17. An <hi>Angle</hi> is either Right or Oblique.</p>
               <p n="18">18. A <hi>Right Angle,</hi> is that whose legs or sides are Perpendicular to one another.</p>
               <p n="19">19. An <hi>Oblique Angle,</hi> is that whose legs or sides do incline to one another upon one side more than upon another.</p>
               <p n="20">20. An <hi>Oblique Angle</hi> is either Acute, or Obtuse.</p>
               <p n="21">21. An <hi>Acute Oblique Angle,</hi> is that which is less than a Right.</p>
               <p n="22">22. An <hi>Obtuse Oblique Angle,</hi> is that which is greater than a Right Angle.</p>
               <p n="23">23. The <hi>Measure of an Angle,</hi> is the Arch of a Circle described upon the Angular Point, and intersected between the sides of the Angle sufficiently prolonged; but of this Measure there can be no certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, unless the quantity of that Arch be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in Numbers.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Every Circle therefore is supposed to be divided into 360 equal parts, called De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and every Degree into 60 Minutes, and every Minute into 60 Seconds, and so forward; others suppose every Degree to be subdivided into 10 parts, and every one of those into 10 more, and so forward, as far as you please.</p>
               <p n="25">25. A <hi>Semi-circle</hi> is the half of a whole Circle, and containeth 180 Degrees.</p>
               <p n="26">
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:64961:37"/>26. A <hi>Quadrant,</hi> or fourth part of a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, is 90 Degrees; and seeing that a Right Line falling Perpendiculary upon a Right Line, doth make the Angles on both sides e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and cutteth a Semi-circle into two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual parts, the fourth part of a Circle, or 90 Degrees, must needs be the Measure of a Right Angle.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Thus are Lines compared with Lines of the same Species, the comparing of Lines of different Species, is the comparing of Right Lines with those that are Oblique or Circular.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And <hi>Right Lines,</hi> as they have refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to, or are compared with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of a Circle, are either such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed within it, or applyed to it.</p>
               <p n="29">29. A <hi>Right Line,</hi> inscribed in a Circle, either passeth through the Centre, as the Diameter and Radius, or is drawn besides the Centre, as Chords and Sines.</p>
               <p n="30">30. A <hi>Diameter,</hi> is a Right Line inscrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the Centre of the Circle, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Circle into two equal parts.</p>
               <p n="31">31. The <hi>Radius</hi> of a Circle is the one half of the Diameter, or a Right Line drawn from the Centre to the Circumference; thus the Right Line <hi>GBD,</hi> in <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. is a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, <hi>GB,</hi> or <hi>BD,</hi> the Radius.</p>
               <p n="32">32. A <hi>Chord</hi> or <hi>Subtense,</hi> is an inscribed Right Line drawn through or besides the Centre bounded at both ends with the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference.</p>
               <p n="33">
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:64961:37"/>33. A <hi>Chord</hi> or <hi>Subtense,</hi> drawn through the Centre is the same with the Diameter.</p>
               <p n="34">34. A <hi>Chord</hi> or <hi>Subtense,</hi> drawn besides the Centre, is a Right Line bounded at both ends with the Circumference, but always less than the Diameter.</p>
               <p n="35">35. <hi>Sines</hi> are either Right or Versed.</p>
               <p n="36">36. A <hi>Right Sine</hi> is half the Chord of the Double Arch and it is either the whole <hi>Sine,</hi> and <hi>Sine</hi> of 90 Deg. or <hi>Sine</hi> less than the whole.</p>
               <p n="37">37. The whole <hi>Sine</hi> is equal to the <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter</hi> or Radius of a Circle, as the right Line <hi>BE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="38">38. A Sine less than whole, is half the Chord of any Arch less than a Semi-circle; as <hi>CA</hi> is the sine of <hi>CD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="39">39. A <hi>Versed Sine,</hi> is a part of the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lying between the right sine and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, as the Right Line <hi>AD,</hi> which is one part of the Diameter, is the versed sine of the Arch <hi>C D,</hi> and the right line <hi>AG,</hi> which is the other part of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, is the versed sine of the Arch <hi>CEG.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="40">40. A <hi>Right line</hi> applied to a Circle, is either a Tangent or Secant.</p>
               <p n="41">41. A <hi>Tangent,</hi> is a right line without but touching the Circle, drawn Perpendicular to the end of the Radius or Diameter, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to the Secant.</p>
               <p n="42">42. A <hi>Secant,</hi> is a right line drawn from the Centre of the Circle, through the term
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64961:38"/>
of an Arch, and continued to the Tengant; thus the right line <hi>FD,</hi> is the Tangent, and the right line <hi>BF,</hi> is the Secant of the Arch <hi>CD,</hi> or of the Arch <hi>CEG,</hi> the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof to a Semi-circle.</p>
               <p n="43">43. These Lines thus inscribed in, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to a Circle, may to any limited Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us be drawn or made upon a Rule of Wood, Brass, or other Metal; or, a Table may be made, expressing the length of these lines in numbers, answering to every Degree and part of a Degree in the Quadrant or Semi-circle; That is, the lines of <hi>Chords</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sines</hi> may be made to any part of a <hi>Semi-circle,</hi> and the lines of <hi>Sines, Tangents</hi> and <hi>Secants,</hi> to any part of a Quadrant: The use of such Scales and Tables is such, that no Student in <hi>Geometrie</hi> can well be without them; here therefore I will lay down such Propositions as will sufficiently demonstrate the way of making these lines upon a Scale or Ruler, but as to the construction of the Tables by which the lengths of these lines are expressed in Numbers: I refer them to my <hi>Trigonometria Britannica,</hi> and other Books of the like nature.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The second kind of Magnitude, is that which is made of <hi>Lines,</hi> that is a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>Figure</hi> is that which is every where bounded, whether it be with one only limit as a Circle; or with more, as a Triangle, Quadrangle, Pyramis, or Cube, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The terms or limits of every Figure, are either <hi>Lines</hi> or <hi>Superficies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. A <hi>Figure,</hi> which is terminated by <hi>Lines</hi> is a <hi>Superficies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. A <hi>Figure,</hi> which is bounded or limited with several <hi>Superficies,</hi> is a Body or Solid.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A <hi>Superficies</hi> is a Magnitude, consisting of length and breadth, and is either right lined, curved lined, or composed of both.</p>
               <p n="8">8. A <hi>Right Lined Plane</hi> or <hi>Superficies,</hi> is that which is Terminated with right lines; and it is either a Triangle, or a Triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A <hi>Triangle,</hi> or the first right lined Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, is that which is comprehended by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64961:41"/>
three right lines. It is distinguished from the sides, or from the Angles.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In respect of the sides, a Triangle is either <hi>Isopleuron, Isosceles,</hi> or <hi>Scalenum.</hi>

               <p n="13">13. An <hi>Oblique Angled plane Triangle,</hi> is either Acute or Obtuse</p>
               <p n="14">14. An <hi>Oblique and Obtuse Angled plane Triangle,</hi> hath two Acute Angles and one Obtuse; an Acute angled Triangle hath all the three Angles Acute.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The second sort of right lined planes is called a <hi>Triangulate,</hi> or a Plane, composed of <hi>Triangles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. The sides of a Triangulate, are in number more by two than the Triangles, of which it is composed.</p>
               <p n="17">17. A <hi>Triangulate,</hi> is either a <hi>Quadrangle,</hi> or a <hi>Multangle.</hi>

               <p n="29">29. A <hi>Right angled Multangled Plane,</hi> is that which is comprehended by more than four lines.</p>
               <p n="30">30. A <hi>Multangled Right lined Plane,</hi> or <hi>Polygon,</hi> is either Ordinate and Regular, or Inordinate and irregular.</p>

               <p n="3">3. In <hi>Singing</hi> there are five things to be considered: 1. The Number of the Notes. 2. Their Names. 3. Their Tunes. 4. Their Times. And 5. Their Adjuncts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The number of Musical Notes are three times seven, or twenty one, that is from the lowest Note of a Man's Base, to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of a Boy's Treble, we usually reckon twenty one Notes; though there are some
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64961:53"/>
Bases that reach below, and some Trebles that arise above this ordinary compass.</p>
               <p>The number of Musical Notes is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore divided by Septenaries, because there are in Nature, but seven distinct sounds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in Musick, by <hi>seven</hi> distinct Notes, in the several Cliffs or Cleaves of the Scale; for the <hi>eighth</hi> &amp; <hi>fifteenth</hi> have the same sound or tune, and therefore the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>cliff</hi> of the first; the 9<hi>th</hi> and 16<hi>th</hi> of the second; the 10<hi>th</hi> and 17<hi>th</hi> of the third; the 11<hi>th</hi> and 18<hi>th</hi> of the fourth; the 12<hi>th</hi> and 19<hi>th</hi> of the fifth; the 13<hi>th</hi> and 20<hi>th,</hi> of the sixth; the 14<hi>th</hi> and 21<hi>th,</hi> of the seventh.</p>
               <p n="6">6. These thrice seven Notes are descern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their places. A <hi>place</hi> is either a Rule or space, and therefore in eleven rules with their spaces, is comprehended the whole scale.</p>
               <p n="7">7. At the beginning of each <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>space</hi> is placed one of the first seven Letters in the Alphabet, and these Letters are thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated one above another, the letter <hi>G</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put upon the first or lowest place of each sepentary being the first letter in the word <hi>Greece,</hi> and in the first sepentary, retained the Name and Form of the Greek <hi>Gamma,</hi> in remembrance, that the Art of <hi>Musick,</hi> as other learned Arts came to us from that seat of the Muses.</p>
               <p n="8">8. By these seven letters of the Alphabet, otherwise called seven <hi>cliffs</hi> or <hi>cleaves,</hi> the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64961:53"/>
scale is divided into three several parts of <hi>Musick</hi>; the first and lowest is called the <hi>base</hi>; the 2d. or middle part, the <hi>Mean</hi>; the third or highest part, the <hi>Treble.</hi> As for the Notes, which do exceed this compass, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>base</hi> or <hi>treble,</hi> they are signed with double letters in the same manner, that the ordinary Notes are with single.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The second thing to be considered in <hi>Singing,</hi> is the Name by which each of these Notes is called.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And for these seven notes, signed by the first seven letters in the Alphabet, there are but <hi>six</hi> several <hi>names invented</hi> to <hi>help</hi> the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the tuning of them; <hi>ut, re, Mi, fa, sol, la,</hi> and for the <hi>seventh</hi> note, because it is but half a tone above <hi>la,</hi> as the fourth is above <hi>Mi,</hi> (whereas the rest are all whole tone) it is fitly called by the same name with the <hi>fourth,</hi> and so the next will be an <hi>eight,</hi> or <hi>Diapason</hi> to the first, and consequently placed in the same let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or cliff, and called by the same name.</p>
               <p>And thus they were wont to be placed in the scale, in which the first name <hi>ut</hi> being placed upon the same line with the Greek <hi>Gamma,</hi> hath caused the whole scale to be called the <hi>Gamut</hi>; but modern Musicians in these latter times, have rejected the names of <hi>ut</hi> and <hi>re,</hi> as finding the other four to be sufficient for the expressing of the several sounds, and less bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome to the Memories of Practisioners.</p>
               <p n="11">11. This scale or <hi>Gamut</hi> then is divided into
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64961:54"/>
four Columns. In the first you have the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabetical <hi>letters</hi> or <hi>cliffs,</hi> the other three shew the <hi>names</hi> of the notes, <hi>ascending</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending, according</hi> to their <hi>several names &amp; keys</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>In the second column is set the names of the notes as they be called, where is <hi>B duralis,</hi> or <hi>B sharp,</hi> as having no flat in <hi>B mi,</hi> and then your notes are called as they are set there on the rules and spaces ascending.</p>
               <p>In the third Column is <hi>B proper,</hi> or <hi>B na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalis,</hi> which hath a <hi>B flat</hi> in <hi>B mi</hi> only, which is put at the beginning of the line with the Cliff, and there you have also the names as they are called on Rule and Space.</p>
               <p>In the fourth Column is <hi>B fa,</hi> or <hi>B molla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> having two <hi>B flats,</hi> the one in <hi>B mi,</hi> the other in <hi>E la mi,</hi> placed as the other; by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>serving of which you have a certain rule for the Names of the Notes in any part.</p>
               <p n="12">12. In these <hi>three</hi> columns <hi>observe</hi> this for a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule,</hi> that what <hi>name</hi> any <hi>note</hi> hath, the same <hi>name properly</hi> hath his <hi>eight above</hi> or <hi>below.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. Although the whole ordinary scale of <hi>Musick</hi> doth contain <hi>three</hi> septenaries of lines and spaces; yet when any of the parts which it is divided into, shall come to be Prick'd out by it self in <hi>Songs</hi> or <hi>Lessons,</hi> five Lines is only usual, for one of those Parts as being sufficient to contain the compass of notes thereunto belonging: And if there be any Notes that extend higher or lower, it is usual to add a Line in that place with a Pen.</p>

Though the seven Letters set at the beginning of each Rule and Space, are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Cleaves,</hi> yet four of them are only usual: The first is called the <hi>F fa ut Cleave</hi> or <hi>Cliff,</hi> thus marked 𝄢 this is proper to the <hi>Base</hi> or lowest Part, and is set upon the fourth line, at the beginning of Songs or Lessons. The second is the <hi>C sol fa ut,</hi> which is proper to the middle or inner parts, and is thus mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. 𝄡. The third is the <hi>G sol re ut Cleave</hi> or <hi>Cliff,</hi> which is only proper to the <hi>Treble</hi> or highest, and is signed thus, 𝄞 on the second line of the Songs or Lessons; and these are called the three signed Cliffs.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the <hi>B Cliff,</hi> which is proper to all Parts, as being of two natures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties; that is to say, <hi>Flat</hi> and <hi>Sharp,</hi> and doth only serve for the <hi>Flatting and Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of Notes; it is called by two Names, and signed by two Marks, the one is <hi>B fa,</hi> or <hi>B flat,</hi> and is known on Rule or Space by this mark, (♭), The other is called <hi>B mi</hi> or <hi>B sharp,</hi> and is known by this mark <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Concerning this fourth Cliff, you are to observe: 1. That the <hi>B fa,</hi> or <hi>B flat</hi> doth alter both the Name and Property of the Notes before which it is placed; changing <hi>mi</hi> into <hi>fa,</hi> and making that Note to which he is joyned, a Semi-tone, or half a note low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. 2. That the <hi>B mi</hi> or <hi>B sharp</hi> alters the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Notes before which he is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but not the Name; for he is usually pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64961:55"/>
either before <hi>fa</hi> or <hi>sol,</hi> and they retain their name still, but their sound is raised half a Tone or Sound higher. Lastly, note, that these two <hi>B Cliffs</hi> are placed not only at the beginning of the Lines with the other Cliff, but is usually put to several Notes in the middle of any Song or Lesson, for the <hi>flatting</hi> and <hi>sharping</hi> of Notes, as the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Musick doth require.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Of these four Notes now in use, <hi>Mi</hi> is the principle or master Note, for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found, the rest are known by this dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; after <hi>Mi,</hi> sing <hi>fa sol la,</hi> twice upward and <hi>la sol fa,</hi> twice downward, and so you come to <hi>Mi</hi> again in the same Cliff both wayes.</p>
               <p n="17">17. This Note <hi>Mi,</hi> hath his being in four several places, but he is but in one of them at a time. Its proper place is in <hi>B mi,</hi> as in the second Column of the <hi>Gamut</hi>; but if a <hi>B fa,</hi> or <hi>B flat,</hi> be in its place, then he is in <hi>E la mi,</hi> as in the third Column of the <hi>Gamut,</hi> which is its second place. But if a <hi>B flat</hi> be placed there also, then its in <hi>A la mi re,</hi> which is its third place. If a <hi>B flat</hi> come there also, then it is remov'd into its fourth place, which is <hi>D la sol re,</hi> according to these Examples.</p>

               <p>THe next thing to be considered in Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the Tunes of Notes, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be declared by Precept, but must be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned either by the lively Voice of the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, or by some Instrument rightly Tuned. Only observe that from <hi>mi</hi> to <hi>fa,</hi> and so from <hi>la</hi> to <hi>fa,</hi> is but half a Tone; but between a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other two Notes is a whole Tone, as from <hi>fa</hi> to <hi>sol,</hi> or <hi>sol</hi> to <hi>la.</hi> And in the first guiding of the Voice, it will much help, if at the first Tuning, you sound by degrees all these Notes, as <hi>sol la mi,</hi> and at the second Tuning, leave out <hi>la</hi> the middle Note: this will not only help you to Tune a Third, as from <hi>sol</hi> to <hi>mi,</hi> but it will also help you in the raising of Fourths and Fifths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of the Time of Notes.</head>
               <p>THe Notes in <hi>Musick</hi> have two Names, one for <hi>Tune,</hi> the other for <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</hi> The Names of Notes in reference to their <hi>Tunes,</hi> are, as hath been said, these four, <hi>Sol La Mi Fa</hi>; And their Names in Proportion of <hi>Time,</hi> are Eight; A <hi>Large,</hi> a <hi>Long,</hi> a <hi>Breve,</hi> a <hi>Semi-breve,</hi> a <hi>Minum,</hi> a <hi>Crotchet,</hi> a <hi>Quaver,</hi> a <hi>Semi quaver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The four first are of Augmentation, or Increase; the four latter are of Diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Decrease, and are thus proportioned. The <hi>Large</hi> being the first of Augmentation, and longest in Sound; the <hi>Semi-breve</hi> is the last of Augmentation, and the shortest in Sound, and in <hi>Time</hi> is called the Master-Note, being of one Measure by himself, all the other Notes are reckoned by his value, both in Augmentation and Diminution.</p>
               <p>In Augmentation, the <hi>Large</hi> is Eight <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-breves,</hi> the <hi>Long</hi> four, the <hi>Breve</hi> two, the <hi>Semi-breve</hi> is one <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Note.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Diminution, the latter four do decrease in this proportion; two <hi>Minums</hi> make a <hi>Semi-breve,</hi> two <hi>Crotchets</hi> make a <hi>Minum,</hi> two <hi>Quavers</hi> make a <hi>Crotchet,</hi> and two <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-quavers</hi> make a <hi>Quaver.</hi> As in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble following may be seen.</p>

               <p>THere belong to Notes, thus described by their Number, Names, Tunes, and Time, these seven things. A <hi>Tye,</hi> a <hi>Repeat,</hi> a <hi>Pause,</hi> a <hi>Direct,</hi> a <hi>Close,</hi> and single and double <hi>Bars,</hi> and several <hi>Moods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A <hi>Tye</hi> is a Semi-circle, whose two ends point to the two Notes conjoyned, as when two <hi>Minums,</hi> or one <hi>Minum</hi> and a <hi>Crotchet</hi> are tyed together; as also, when two or more Notes are to be Sung to one Syllable, or two Notes or more to be plaid with one drawing of the Bow on the <hi>Viol</hi> or <hi>Violin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The middle and principal Note is the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mibreve</hi>: And when any Note &amp; his half note in the same place are conjoyned for one Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, the mark of the half Note, and of the Ligature too, is a point set by the Note, as 𝆹· 톹텥·
and it is as much, as if with the <hi>Note</hi> his half <hi>Note</hi> were exprest, and conjoyned by Ligature, and prolongeth the sound of that Note it follows, to half as much more; thus a <hi>Semi-breve,</hi> which is of it self but two <hi>Minums,</hi> having a prick after it, is made three <hi>Minums,</hi> in one continued sound, and so in other Notes.</p>
               <p n="4">

               <p n="5">5. A <hi>Pause</hi> is a mark of rest or silence in a Song for the time of some Note, whereof it hath its name. A line discending from a superiour Rule, and not touching the Rule below, is a <hi>Semibreve</hi> Rest: the like line ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from an inferiour Rule, and not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Rule above, is a <hi>Minum</hi> Rest: the same with a crook to the Right hand, is a <hi>Crotchet</hi> Rest, and to the left hand, a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> Rest: Also a line reaching from Rule to Rule, is a <hi>Breve</hi> Rest, or a <hi>Pause</hi> of two <hi>Semibreves</hi>; a line from a Rule to a third Rule, is a <hi>Long</hi> pause, or of four <hi>Semibreves,</hi> and two of them together make a <hi>Large</hi> pause, or a Rest of Eight <hi>Semibreves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. A <hi>Direct</hi> in the end of a line, sheweth where the Note stands in the beginning of the next line, and is marked thus, <gap reason="music">

               <p n="7">7. A <hi>Close</hi> is either Perfect or Imperfect; A Perfect Close is the end of Song, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thus, 𝄐 or thus, 𝄑 or with two Bars thwart all the Rules, or both ways. An Imperfect Close, is the end of a Strain, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place in a Song, where all the Parts do

meet and Close before the end, and it is marked with a single Bar. <gap reason="music">

                  <hi>AStronomy,</hi> is an Art, by which we are Taught the Measure and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heavenly Orbs and Stars that are in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Heavenly Orbs are either <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, without Stars, as the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, such as have Stars in them, as the eight inferiour Orbs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Stars are either fixed or movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: The fixed Stars are those which always keep the same distance from one another; but the moveable Stars, otherwise called
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64961:60"/>
Planets, are such as do not always keep the same distance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All the Stars, as well fixed as moveable have a double motion; the one occasioned by the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> from East to West, the other natural or proper to themselves, by which they move from West, to East.</p>
               <p n="5">5. According to this double motion of the Stars, this Art of <hi>Astronomy</hi> is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Parts; the first sheweth the motion of the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> and how the several Heavenly Orbs are by that carried round the World, from East to West, which is called the <hi>Diurnal motion</hi> of the Stars.</p>
               <p>The second part of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> sheweth the <hi>Periodical motion</hi> of the Stars, in which the inferiour Orbs, according to their own proper and natural motion, do move from West to East.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For the better understanding of these several motions, the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> or tenth Orb, is usually represented by a Sphere or Globe, with such lines drawn about it as the Stars in their motions are supposed to make, or may help to discover unto us, the quantity of their motions, and shew the time of their Risings and Settings, and such like.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This Sphere or Globe, is a round bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, containing one Superficies, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle whereof there is a Point, from whence all Right Lines drawn to the Superficies are equal.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:64961:61"/>8. In the Sphere or Globe, there are ten imaginary Lines or Circles, of which six are great, and four are small.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The great Circles are these which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Sphere or Globe into two equal <hi>Hemispheres,</hi> and such are the <hi>Horizon, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial, Zodiack</hi> and the two <hi>Colures</hi>; the two first of which are called <hi>external</hi> and <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> the other <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>immutable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. The Lesser Circles, are those which divide the Sphere or Globe, into two une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual <hi>Hemispheres,</hi> whereof one is more, and the other less than the half of the Sphere or Globe; such are the two <hi>Tropicks</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> and <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and the <hi>Artick</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartick</hi> Circles, all which are represented in <hi>Fig.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The <hi>Horizon,</hi> which is also called the <hi>Finitor,</hi> is a Circle, which divideth the visible part of the Heavens from the not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; that is, the lower <hi>Hemisphere</hi> from the upper, as the line <hi>AB</hi>; one of whose Poles is in the Point directly over our heads, and is called the <hi>Zenith,</hi> the other Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically opposite, called the <hi>Nadir,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Letters <hi>Z. N.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. The <hi>Horizon,</hi> is either <hi>Sensible</hi> or <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. That is called the <hi>Sensible Horizon,</hi> which bounds our sight, and seemeth to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Heavens into two equal Hemis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheres.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:64961:61"/>14. And that is called the <hi>Rational</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligable Horizon,</hi> which doth indeed bisect the Heavens; and this is Right, when it passeth through the Poles of the World; or Oblique, when one of the Poles is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elevated, and the other depressed; or Parallel, when one Pole is in the Verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Point or <hi>Zenith,</hi> for then the <hi>Horizon</hi> is Parallel to the <hi>Aequator</hi>; it otherwise makes therewith either Right or Oblique Angles.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Hence there is a threefold position of Sphere. 1. A <hi>Right,</hi> where the <hi>Horizon</hi> is Right; that is, where the <hi>Aequator</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth through the <hi>Zenith</hi> and <hi>Nadir,</hi> 2. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> when the <hi>Horizon</hi> is <hi>Oblique</hi>; that is, when one Pole is somewhat elevated and the other depressed. 3. <hi>Parallel,</hi> when one of the Poles of the world is in the <hi>Zenith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. In a <hi>Right Sphere,</hi> all the Stars do Rise and Set, but in an <hi>Oblique Sphere,</hi> some are hid from our sight, and some are always above the <hi>Horizon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. The <hi>Meridian</hi> is a great Circle pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and proper to every place, and drawn through the <hi>Vertical point</hi> and the <hi>Poles of the World,</hi> to which when the Sun comes in his Diurnal motion, in the Day-time he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Mid-day, and in the Night time, he maketh Midnight. There may be as many <hi>Meridians</hi> as there are <hi>Vertical points,</hi> but upon the Globe they are usually drawn thro' every tenth or fifteenth Degree of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the Internal and Immutable great Circles.</head>
               <p>HItherto of the two External and Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Circles, the <hi>Horizon</hi> and <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> I come now to the Internal and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The first Internal and Immutable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is called the <hi>Aequator,</hi> or <hi>Equinoctial Circle,</hi> which divideth the whole Sphere òr Globe into two equal parts between the Poles, to which when the Sun cometh, which is twice in the Year, the days and nights are equal in all places but in a Parallel Sphere: this Circle is noted with the letters <hi>EF.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This Circle is also the measure of Time; for as oft as 15 Degrees of this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle do ascend above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> so many hours are compleated in its going round.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The second Immutable Circle is called the <hi>Zodiak,</hi> which is a great Oblique broad Circle, under which the Planets do always move; the Poles of this Circle are distant, from the Poles of the world 23 Degrees, 31 Minutes, and 30 Seconds, or 23.53 Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesms.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This Circle doth differ from other Circles in the Heavens, in that other Circles to speak properly, have Longitude or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64961:62"/>
Length, but no Breadth, whereas this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is allowed to have both.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In respect of Longitude, this Circle is divided as other Circles commonly are into 360 Degrees, but more peculiarly into 12 parts, constituting, as it were, the 12 Parts or Months of the Year, or 12 Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Stars, called Signs, each Sign being subdivided into 30 Degrees or Parts. The Names and Characters of these 12 Constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, or Signs, are as followeth. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> ♈, <hi>Taurus</hi> ♉, <hi>Gemini</hi> ♊, <hi>Cancer</hi> ♋, <hi>Leo</hi> ♌, <hi>Virgo</hi> ♍, <hi>Libra</hi> ♎, <hi>Scorpio</hi> ♏, <hi>Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius</hi> ♐, <hi>Capricornus</hi> ♑, <hi>Aquarius</hi> ♒, <hi>Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> ♓.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>Zodiack,</hi> in respect of Latitude, is divided into 16 Degrees, that is, into 8 Degrees North-ward, and 8 Degrees South-ward, because all the Planets, except the Sun, do in their Motions vary from the middle Line, sometimes one way, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another; to the quantity of 8 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and the middle Line in which the Sun moves, is the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> Line, because when the Sun and Moon are in Conjunction, the Sun is Eclipsed, but when they are in Opposition, the Moon is Eclipsed.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Of these 12 Signs, 4 are called Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, <hi>viz. Aries</hi> and <hi>Libra,</hi> in which do happen the Vernal and the Autumnal <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctials; Cancer</hi> and <hi>Capricorn,</hi> in which do happen the Summer and the Winter Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:64961:63"/>9. Again these Signs are distinguished in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Northern and Southern; the Northern signs are those which decline from the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator towards the North Pole, as ♈, ♉, ♊, ♋, ♌, ♍; And the Southers signs are those which decline from the Aequator to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South Pole, as ♎, ♏, ♐, ♑, ♒, ♓.</p>
               <p n="10">10. All other Constellations or fixed stars are referred to some one or other of the 12 signs, whether they be the 21 Northern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations, called <hi>Vrsa Minor, Vrsa Major, Draco, Cepheus, Arctephylax, Corona Bore alis, Engonasus, Lyra, Avis, Cassiopeia, Persius, Heniochus, Serpentarius, Serpens, Sagitta, Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Delphinus, Equisectio, Pegasus, Andromeda, Triangulus.</hi> Or whether they be the 15 Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern constellations, called <hi>Cetus, Orion, Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus, Lupus, Canis Major, Precyon, Argo, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra, Crater, Corvus, Centaurus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p n="11">11. The two other great Circles called the <hi>Colures,</hi> are the two Circles which pass through the Poles of the World, and the four Cardinal points in the <hi>Zodiack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. That circle which passeth thro' the Poles of the world, and the two Solstitial points in the Zodiack, which are the beginnings of ♋ and ♑, and is called the Solstitial Colure.</p>
               <p n="13">13. That Circle, which passeth through the poles of the world and the two Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial points, or first entrance into ♈ and ♎, is called the <hi>Aequinoctial Colure,</hi> and in <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. represented by the line <hi>D. C.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of the Ascensions and Descensions of the Parts of the Zodiack.</head>
               <p>HItherto we have spoken of the general Principles of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> from whence the motion of the Primum Mobile is explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; come we now to these affections which properly belong to the motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and these are the Ascension and Descension
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64961:67"/>
of the Parts of the Zodiack, or Astronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rising and Setting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Astronomical Rising and Setting,</hi> is the Elevation of the parts of the Zodiack or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick above the Horizon, and Depressed under it, compared to the Ascension and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension of the parts of the Aequator; and this comparison is in reference to diverse Elevations of the Poles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But this Astronomical Rising and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, takes his Denomination from the parts of the Zodiack; which are above the Horizon or beneath it, and are measured with respect unto the Aequator; for Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers do not refer the Aequator to the Zodiack, but the Zodiack to the Aequator, for it is Zodiack, and not the Aequator which stands in need of measuring.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And an Arch of the Ecliptick or Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, is to be understood two manner of ways; namely, <hi>Continued</hi> or <hi>Discreet</hi>; A <hi>Continued Arch,</hi> is when it is reckoned in the Aequator in a Continued Series, from the beginning of <hi>Aries,</hi> and so forward into the consequent Signs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A <hi>Discreet Arch,</hi> is so called, because it is not reckoned from the first Degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> but from any other point; as from the fourteenth of <hi>Gemini,</hi> to the fourteenth of <hi>Taurus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Any part of the Zodiack is then said to Ascend Right, when a greater part of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64961:67"/>
Aequator riseth above the Horizon than of the Zodiack. And that is said to be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Arch of the Aequator, which is more than 90 Degrees.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Any part of the Zodiack is then said to Descend Right, when a greater part of the Aequator than of the Zodiack is beneath the Horizon.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Any part of the Zodiack therefore is said to Ascend Obliquely, when a less part of the Aequator than of the Zodiack doth As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend; as also, to Descend Obliquely, when less of the Aequator than of the Zodiack is below the Horizon.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Ascension,</hi> is either Right or Oblique.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Right Ascension</hi> or <hi>Descension,</hi> is that which is in a Right Sphere.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In a Right Sphere, the four Quadrants of the Zodiack beginning from the Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial and Solstitial Points, do equally Ascend and Descend, so that in these whole Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants, as many Degrees of the Aequator as of the Zodiack do Ascend; but the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate parts of those Quadrants in the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack do vary, and have not equal Ascension and Descension with the parts of the Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Those Signs that are equally distant from any of those Points, have also equal As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension, as <hi>Gemini</hi> and <hi>Cancer.</hi> And the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension of a Sign is always equal to the Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension of the same.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:64961:68"/>13. In a Right Sphere therefore, four Signs only do rise Right, all the rest do rise Obliquely.</p>
               <p n="14">14. In an Oblique Sphere, the two halves that begin at the two Aequinoctial Points, do rise together, but the parts of those halves do rise Obliquely. And those Signs that rise Rightly, do Descend Obliquely, and the contrary.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The Ascension of opposite Signs in an Oblique Sphere, taken together, are equal to the Ascension of the same in a Right Sphere. And those signs that are equall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from either of the Aequinoctial Points, have equal Ascensions, because they equally Decline from the Aequator.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Besides the Astronomical Rising and setting of the stars, or their rising and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in respect of the Horizon and Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, there are other affections of the stars to be considered, namely, those which they have in respect of the sun.</p>
               <p n="17">17. In respect of the Celestial Circles, that is in respect of the Zodiack, Aequator, and Horizon, there is a fourfold affection of the stars. 1. <hi>Longitude.</hi> 2. Of <hi>Altitude.</hi> 3. Of <hi>Latitude.</hi> 4. Of <hi>Declination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. The <hi>Longitude</hi> of a star is his distance from the first Degree or Point of <hi>Aries,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting from West to East.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The <hi>Altitude</hi> of a star is to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red generally or specially. Generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64961:68"/>
the Altitude of a star is the height thereof above the Circle of the Horizon.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Specially considered, the Elevation of the Pole star above the Horizon, is called the Altitude.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The <hi>Latitude</hi> of a star is his dDstance from the Ecliptick, that is from the very mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Zodiack towards either Pole, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther North or South.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The <hi>Declination</hi> of a star, is his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Aequator, and as he declines from thence either Northward or South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, so is his Declination nominated ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther North or South.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Thus much of these affections of the stars, which they have in respect of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Circles; come we now to those which they have in respect of the sun; usually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Poetical rising and setting; and this is threefold. The first of these in <hi>Latin,</hi> is called <hi>Ortus Matutinus sive Cosmicus,</hi> The Morning or Cosmical Rising. The second, <hi>Vespertinus five Achronicus,</hi> The Evening or Achronical; and the last, <hi>Heliacus vel Sola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> Heliacal or Solary.</p>
               <p n="24">24. The Cosmical or Morning Rising of a star, is when it Riseth above the Horizon, together with the sun. And the Cosmical or Morning setting of a star is, when it-set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at the opposite part of Heaven, when the sun riseth.</p>
               <p n="25">25. The <hi>Achronical,</hi> or Evening Rising of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64961:69"/>
a Star, is when it Riseth on the opposite part, when the Sun setteth; And the Achro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Evening setting of a Star, is when it setteth at the same time with the Sun.</p>
               <p n="26">26. The <hi>Heliacal</hi> Rising of a Star, which you may properly call the Emersion of it, is when a Star that was hid by the Sun beams, beginneth to recover it self out, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. And so likewise, the setting of such a star, which may be also called the Occultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the same, is when the Sun by his own proper motion overtaketh any star, and by the brightness of his beams doth make it invisible unto us.</p>
               <p>And thus having briefly shewed the chief affections of the Primum Mobile; how the quantity of these affections may be compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the Doctrine of Spherical Triangles, shall be declared in the Problems following.</p>

               <p n="3">3. This motion in the Planets is more swift, and although they never move out of the Zodiack, yet they do move sometimes in one part of Heaven, sometimes in another, sometimes towards the south Pole, sometimes towards the North, sometimes near one fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed star, sometimes near another, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times nearer, sometimes farther from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother also, whereas the fixed stars do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep the same <hi>distance</hi> from one another.</p>

               <p>And the <hi>Julian</hi> Year, which is the accompt of all <hi>Christendom,</hi> doth differ from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only in this, that by reason of the suns excess in motion above 365 days, which is about 5 Hours, 49 Minutes, it hath a day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercalated once in four Years, and by reason of this Intercalation, it is more agreeable with the motion of the Sun, the former dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the <hi>Numan</hi> Year, 11 days and 6 Hours, the which 11 days, <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed amongst the Months, and the month <hi>Quintilis,</hi> was by him called <hi>July,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own name; and <hi>Augustus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> called the Month <hi>Sextilis,</hi> by the name of <hi>August,</hi> and altered the Position of days in each month to that which we now use, in which there are 52 Weeks, and one odd day, and this one day supernumerary, maketh an alteration in all the rest, so that the days of the Week, which used to be assigned by the Letters of the Alphabet, fall not alike in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years, but <hi>Sunday</hi> this Year, must fall out upon the next years <hi>Monday,</hi> &amp; so forward,
till

seven years; and because the six odd Hours do make a day in four years, every fourth year hath a day added to its accompt, and such a year doth consist of 366 days, which doth occasion the <hi>Sunday</hi> letter still to alter till four times 7, that is, 28 Years be gone about. This Revolution is called the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Sun, taking name from ☉, <hi>Sunday,</hi> the Letter whereof it doth appoint for every year, as by the Table may be seen.</p>

                  </gap>d by the most skilful <hi>Astronomers,</hi> as for the Number of days in a year, the Emperours Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians were in the right, for it is certain, no Year can consist of more than 365 days, but for the odd Hours, it is a certain that they cannot be fewer than five, nor so many as six, so that the doubt is upon the minutes, sixty whereof goeth to the making of an Hour; a small matter one would think, and how great in the recess and consequence we shall see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> alotted 365 days, 6 hours, to his Revolution; but the Sun goeth about in less time, that is, (according to the most exact accompt,) in 365 days, 5 hours, 49 Minutes, and a little more; so that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours year must of necessity breed a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in so many Minutes every year, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the year which the Sun it self describes in the Zodiack, and that which is reckoned upon in the Calender, which though for a year or two may pass insensibly, yet in the space of 134 years it will rise to a whole day
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64961:75"/>
that is, the beginning of the year in the Calender must be set one day back.</p>
               <div type="example">
                  <head>As for Example.</head>
                  <p>Let the Year begin in the Vernal Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox, or Spring, in the Emperours time, that fell out to be the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> but now this year it fell out the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 13 days backward and somewhat more; and so if it be let alone, will go back to the first of <hi>March,</hi> and first of <hi>February,</hi> till Easter come to be on <hi>Christmas</hi> day, and so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely.</p>
                  <p>To reform this difference in the accompt, some of the latter <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops earnestly endeavoured, and the thing was brought to that perfection it now standeth, (so much as it is,) by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth, in the year 1582. his Mathematicians, (whereof <hi>Lylius</hi> was the chief) advised him thus: That considering there had been in agitation in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> somewhat concerned in this matter upon the motion of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion about the Celebration of <hi>Easter</hi>; and that the Fathers of that Assembly, after due deliberation with the Astronomers of that time, had fixed the Vernal Aequinox; at the 21<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and considering also, that since that time a difference of 10 whole days had been past over in the Calender, that is, that the Vernal Equinox or Spring, which began upon the 21<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> had prevented so much as to begin in <hi>Gregories</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:64961:75"/>
days, at the 10<hi>th</hi> of the same, 10 days dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or thereabout; they advised, that 10 days should be cut off from the Calender, which was done, and the 10 days taken out of <hi>October,</hi> in the Year 1582, as being the Month of that Year in which the Pope was born, so that when they came to the 5<hi>th</hi> of the Month, they reckoned the 15<hi>th,</hi> and so the Aequinox was come up to its place again, and happened upon the 21<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> as at the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> But that <hi>Lylius</hi> should bring back the beginning of the year to the time of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and no farther is to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at; he should have brought it back to the Emperours own time, where the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake was first entred; and instead of 10, cut off 13 days; however this is the reason why these two Calenders differ the space of 10 days one from another.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have given you an accompt of the year as it now stands with us in <hi>England,</hi> and with the rest of the <hi>Christian</hi> World, in respect of the Sun; some other particulars there are with us and them, that do depend upon the motion of the moon, for the better understanding of them, I will give you a brief accompt of her Revolution.</p>

with the Solar, by the addition of which access, in every three years there is gotten a number more than 30, but because the Moon between change and change doth never pass 30 days, the Epact cannot exceed that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and the time in which the Moon is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to make her several Motions and so return to the place where she first began, is a circle or Revolution of 19 years, first found out by <hi>Meton,</hi> and <hi>Athenian,</hi> who lived about 439 years before <hi>Christ,</hi> this Cycle is therefore called <hi>Cyclus Decenno <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And the Epact is found by Multiplying the golden Number by 11, and dividing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct by 30, what remains is the <hi>Epact</hi>; but to save this trouble of <hi>Calculation,</hi> you have it set down to your hand in the table before the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64961:76"/>
the use whereof as of the Golden Number is to find the Change of the Moon, for the Ancient Philosophers supposing the Moon to make a perfect <hi>Revolution</hi> in 19 years, did Calculate the several Changings of the Moon that happened in each Month for that time, and placed the golden number for each year, right against the day of the Month on which the Moon changed, that so having found the <hi>golden number,</hi> they might thereby presently know on what day of the <hi>month</hi> the Moon did change, in any Month of the year for ever, as also the time, when the Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> was to be observed, according to the Canon made at a General Council held at <hi>Nice,</hi> in the year of our Lord, 322, in which it is <hi>commanded</hi> that <hi>Easter</hi> should be Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>upon</hi> the next <hi>Sunday following</hi> the first Full Moon after the Vernal Aequinox, which then was upon the 21<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>March,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this rule is this <hi>Feast</hi> observed with us at this day, and not according to the <hi>true</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Moon, or precise time of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Aequinox, which now is about the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March</hi>; This use of the Golden Number is well expressed in these Distichs.</p>

                  <p>I would know the Age of the Moon on the Fifteenth day of <hi>August,</hi> 1672. The Epact is 11, and the Months from <hi>March</hi> to <hi>August</hi> are 6, and 15 the day of the Month, all which put together, do make 32, from whence take 30, and there rests 2, the Age of the Moon that day. And to know the day of the Change, do thus: To the Epact add all the months from <hi>March,</hi> and if they joyned together, come not to 30, look what they lack of 30, and at so many days of the month the moon chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth: If they be above 30, and the month you desire have 31 days, then Subtract 30; but if 30 days, then Subtract 29, and that rest take from 30, then look what remains, and at so many days of the month the moon changeth, by either of these ways the time of the new moons may indeed be guest at, but not exactly found: How that may be done, is shewed in the larger Treatises of this Subject; this we deem sufficient for our present purpose.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Of the Definition and Parts of RHETORICK.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>RHETORICK,</hi> is the Art or facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Eloquent and delightful Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
               <p>The Parts of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> are Five; <hi>Invention, Disposition, Elocution, Memory,</hi> and <hi>Pronounciation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Invention,</hi> we are to consider three things:</p>
               <p>1. What we are to Invent. 2. By what Arguments we may confirm the Matter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. 3. From what Topicks or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64961:81"/>
Heads those Arguments may be raised.</p>
               <p>And first, the thing or matter which we are to invent, is the scope and purpose of the intended Oration: That is, we must propound some certain Proposition to which we mean to direct our Speech; and of those several Propositions which may be raised from the subject propounded, we should still make choice of that which is most agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Sentence given.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When we have resolved upon a Proposition, we are to bethink our selves of some Arguments or probable Reasons, by which that Proposition may be confirmed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We are to consider the several Topicks or common places from whence these probable Arguments may be invented and raised, and these are of two sorts; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal</hi> and <hi>Extrinsecal</hi>; those that are called <hi>Intrinsecal,</hi> which are comprised in the matter which is propounded, and the Topicks or Heads, from whence such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be invented, are these following.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Definition.</hi> 2. <hi>Division.</hi> 3. <hi>Notation.</hi> 4. <hi>Conjugation.</hi> 5. <hi>Genus.</hi> 6. <hi>Species.</hi> 7. <hi>Semilitude.</hi> 8. <hi>Dissimilitude.</hi> 9. <hi>Contraries.</hi> 10. <hi>Opposites.</hi> 11. <hi>Comparison.</hi> 12. <hi>Causes.</hi> 13. <hi>Effects.</hi> 14. <hi>Adjuncts.</hi> 15. <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</hi> 16. <hi>Consequents.</hi> All other <hi>Topicks,</hi> from whence Intrinsecal or Artificial Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be raised, are contained in these, or may be derived from them.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:64961:81"/>1. <hi>Definition,</hi> is a Speech explaining or declaring what a thing is; The parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, according to Logicians are two; 1. The <hi>Genus,</hi> or general name agreeing with the thing defined, and with several other things besides. 2. The difference or particular name, which doth only agree with that which is defined:</p>
               <div type="example">
                  <head>For Example.</head>
                  <p>Man is a Living Creature, endued with Reason. In which the <hi>Genus</hi> is living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and this agrees with other Creatures besides Man; the Difference, is endued with Reason, and this is proper to Man only. But such Definitions as these, are seldom used by Orators, but such rather as are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Descriptions, more properly than Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions; as when a thing is described by its parts, or by its effects, or by the causes by which effects are produced, and such like.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Division,</hi> is the distribution of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter propounded into its parts; Thus the Life of Man may be divided into Infancy, Child-hood, Youth, Middle-age, Old-age.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Notation,</hi> or <hi>Etymologie,</hi> is the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of a Word, shewing as well the Original thereof, as the Signification; As a <hi>Senate</hi> is so called from the convention of the Seniors or Old Men.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Conjugation,</hi> is either when one word hath various endings; as <hi>knife, knives</hi>; or
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64961:82"/>
when several words do come from one Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, thus; <hi>beautiful</hi> and <hi>beautifulness,</hi> are both derived from <hi>beauty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. A <hi>Genus,</hi> is that which comprehends se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things under it; which are really dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from one another.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A <hi>Species,</hi> is that which may with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things be referred to one common <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>: And thus this word <hi>Art,</hi> is a <hi>genus,</hi> in respect of the seven Liberal Sciences; as <hi>Grammar; Rhetorick,</hi> &amp;c. and these Sciences <hi>Grammar, Rhetorick,</hi> &amp;c. are the Forms and <hi>Species</hi> which are contained under this <hi>Genus</hi> or general term, <hi>Art.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Similitude,</hi> is the comparing of two or more <hi>things</hi> together, which are in <hi>themselves</hi> divers, but do agree in some particular.</p>

                  <p>Equal Comparison is, when two equal things are compared together; as thus, <hi>He hath deceived thee, therefore he will deceive me also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unequal Comparison, is two ways, first, when we argue from the greater to the less: As <hi>God spared not the Angels that sinned, how then shall He spare Man</hi>?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when we argue from the less to the greater; As, <hi>He will not let one sin go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished; much more will he therefore punish a multitude of sins.</hi>

                  <p n="12">12. <hi>Causes,</hi> are such things by which any thing is in any sort produced; there are Four sorts of <hi>Causes; Efficient, Material, Formal,</hi> and <hi>Final.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The <hi>Formal cause,</hi> is that by which the thing is what it is, or that by which it is distinguished from other things; thus a <hi>Ship</hi> and a <hi>Timber-house</hi> do differ in the form, or divers disposing of the parts.</p>

                  <p n="16">16. <hi>Consequents,</hi> are such things which do necessary follow after the thing or matter as he that is thrust through the heart, must needs die; these are the Intrinsecal or Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial <hi>Topicks,</hi> from whence Arguments may be raised on any Theme or matter propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Every Theme or Proposition doth consist of three parts; a <hi>Subject,</hi> a <hi>Predicate,</hi> and a <hi>Copula.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is called the <hi>Subject,</hi> of which we speak; The <hi>Predicate,</hi> is that which is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Subject; and the <hi>Copula,</hi> is some Verb, which joyns the Subject with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, as in this Proposition; Claudius <hi>laid snares for</hi> Milo: <hi>Claudius</hi> is the Subject, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is of him that we are to speak. <hi>Snares for</hi> Milo, is the Predicate; because that is the thing which is said of <hi>Claudius.</hi> And the Verb <hi>laid,</hi> is the Copula, which joyns the Subject with the Predicate. Now then if you will find out Arguments on this Proposition, take the Subject, and go through every Topick: First go to Definition, and ask what it is? what is the nature of it? and how it is <hi>distinguished</hi> from other things? then go to Division, and see into how many parts the Subject may be divided; and so forward from Topick to Topick. And still observe to yourself every Argument, which doth by this means arise from the Subject,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64961:84"/>
and apply it to the Predicate; so shall you easily see, whether it doth fully confirm your Proposition, and when you have done with the Subject, take the Predicate, and run through the several Topicks with that also; but if the matter require it, and that you judge it more convenient to take the whole Proposition, then the Subject and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate a part by themselves, you may in that manner run through all the heads of Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but stay not too long upon any one, for if matter offer not it self in one head, go to another, for every head perhaps may not afford matter, at least not such as is apt and fit. But if you would know whether your Arguments or matter be drawn from the Subject, or from the Predicate, put it into the form of a Syllogism, and if the major be most certain, you may conclude, that the Argument is drawn from the predicate; but if the minor be most certain, it is then drawn from the Subject.</p>
                  <p>VVhen you have found the Arguments which prove the Proposition, you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them into the form of a Syllogism, which doth consist of three Propositions: the first whereof is called the <hi>Major,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the <hi>Minor,</hi> and the third the <hi>Conclusion</hi> or <hi>Inference.</hi>

Discourse may be drawn from the Predicate <hi>the snares laid for</hi> Milo; which being a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous thing, every one may naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that it doth deserve punishment.</p>
                  <p>Now then joyn this Inference with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate of your Proposition; saying, <hi>He that layeth snares deserveth punishment,</hi> and this is your <hi>Major</hi>; then take the Subject of your Proposition, and joyn that with the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and say, Claudius <hi>layeth snares,</hi> and that is your <hi>Minor</hi>: From both which, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion must needs follow, <hi>Therefore</hi> Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us <hi>deserveth punishment.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>DIsposition,</hi> is the orderly placing of those things which are invented: It is two-fold.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Natural,</hi> in which things are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed in that order in which they were done, or in which according to Nature, they should be done; as if you were to commend a Person, you should begin with his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, next his Youth, and so to the other degrees of his Age.</p>
               <p>The second way is <hi>Artificial,</hi> which doth either for delight or profit diversly mingle and confound the matter, putting that in the end, which should be in the beginning, and the beginning in the end, that so he may both delight the Auditors, and hold them in suspense; which in an unexpected e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent doth not a little please and delight the Hearers.</p>
               <p>The Orator then having resolved of his Proposition, must first consider of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is, whether single, or consisting of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts; and which of the parts should be first handled, which next.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he must choose some few of the best Arguments he hath invented, and place
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64961:85"/>
some solid Argument in the beginning, those that are less forcible in the midst, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving still the best and most convincing for the conclusion; because the Auditor at the first being greedy of knowing, must be prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed and convinced; but in the end he must be strongly confirmed and forced.</p>
               <p>And the most perswasive Arguments are those which proceed from the Definition, Distribution, <hi>Genus,</hi> Causes, and Effects of the thing discoursed of, for these explain the nature thereof; and less forcible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are such as are collected from some trivial Adjuncts and Conjectures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he must Logically dispose of these Reasons and Arguments; First, into Syllogisms; and then consider how to enlarge them in an Oratorical manner.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he must consider into what parts his Oration should be divided, and the parts of an Oration are usually reckoned to be these five.
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Exordium.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Proposition.</hi>

                     </item>
                     <item>5. <hi>Peroration,</hi> or <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>As for Confutation, it is comprised in Confirmation: But all these parts are not always necessary; for the ingenious Orator, may as he shall see it convenient, sometimes omit the <hi>Narration,</hi> sometimes the <hi>Exordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:64961:86"/>
sometimes the <hi>Peroration</hi> or <hi>Conclusion,</hi> yea, and the <hi>Confirmation</hi> is many times scarce discernable; as when the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded are certain, there is more need of Ornament than Proof, as in Gratulatory O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and the like. As for the placing of these parts, their natural Order is that in which we have named them. 1. The <hi>Exordium.</hi> 2. The <hi>Proposition.</hi> 3. The <hi>Narration,</hi> if it be not thought fit to omit it. 4. The <hi>Confirmation</hi>; and Lastly, The <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Exordium,</hi> is as it were the door of the Oration, in which the Orator doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the minds of the Auditor for that which is to follow: And this is commonly done by one of these three ways; By bespeaking their favour; by making them Docible; or by begging their Attention. The Favour of the Auditors is bespoke either from the person of the Orator, from the persons of the Auditors, from the persons of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, or from the subject matter of the Discourse. The Orator may bespeak the Favour of the Auditors, in respect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if his gesture and deportment be suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto theirs that are his Auditors, and express himself modestly. And in respect of the Auditors, if he shew how well they have deserved of the Common-wealth, of him, and other men. And in respect of the Adversaries, if he modestly shew wherein
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64961:86"/>
they are faulty, and render them to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors inexcusable. And lastly, in respect of the matter in hand, if he say, that it is some excellent, necessary, and profitable thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Orator may be said to make the Auditors Docible, if he clearly explain the thing of which he is to speak, and how he purposeth to enlarge upon it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Attention will be quickened, if he saith, that he intends to speak of some great and wonderful thing, and something that is delightful; necessary, and very much concerns his Auditors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second part of an Oration is the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>; and the <hi>Proposition</hi> is that part of the Oration, in which the Orator doth briefly deliver the sum of the whole Matter, of which he intends to speak, and bespeaks the Hearers Attention, if need be. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it doth immediately follow the <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>; sometimes it follows the <hi>Narration</hi>; in what place soever it be put, it must be short and clear, and fit for <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third part of an Oration is <hi>Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> by which a relation is made of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or thing done. And this is either a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct part of the Oration, and then for the most part it doth immediately follow the <hi>Exordium,</hi> that the <hi>Proposition</hi> with the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi> which is to be done in such Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which assume the explaination of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64961:87"/>
the thing done to prove the matter in hand.</p>
               <div type="example">
                  <head>For Example.</head>
                  <p>If you were to prove that some Valiant Person had been a Souldier in some Warr; it is necessary that you should declare what the particular Actions were in which he shewed his Valour.</p>
                  <p>But now in that <hi>Narration,</hi> which is made a distinct part of the Oration, the thing done must be briefly and simply decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without any exaggregation: And in such a <hi>Narration</hi> as makes way for <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> the things done may be illustrated with great neatness of Language, with Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and Figures, and some Discourses may be made concerning the worthiness of the action, with some amplification from Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes and Comparisons.</p>
                  <p>The fourth part of an Oration, is <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> is as it were the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heart and Soul by which an Oration may be chiefly said to Live: Or it is the chief part of an Oration in which the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are produced, by which we would prove our <hi>Proposition,</hi> and refute or answer the contrary opinion of our Adversary, if need require. What is necessary in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, may be collected from what hath been already said. Seeing that <hi>Confirmation</hi> doth consist of the Arguments that are invented and the right disposition of them, both which have been fully enough declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:64961:87"/>
                     <hi>Confutation,</hi> is a part or kind of <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in which we Answer all Objections; it doth either precede or follow <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or may be here or there used in all the parts of the Oration.</p>
                  <p>And these objections may be either all Answered together, or those first which are first made, and then the latter; or those first which are most material, and the rest may fall of themselves; or the weakest first, that they being avoided, the strongest Arguments may be somewhat weak'ned. And the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing this, is by shewing, that the Adversaries Allegation is either false, impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, uncertain, or impertinent, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peroration,</hi> or <hi>Conclusion,</hi> is the last part of an Oration, in which the Orator should very much endeavour to set an edge in the minds of his Auditors, and incline them to be of his side; and here he should therefore use such Figures, as are most proper to move the Affections: It doth chiefly consist of two parts, <hi>Enumeration,</hi> and <hi>Amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Enumeration</hi> is required, that the chief Arguments more largely opened in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer discourse may be clearly repeated in a new form of words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amplification,</hi> desires that this repetition may be made, by some serious expressions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with Sentences and Figures.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ELocution,</hi> or the garnishing of Speech, is an Art by which the Speech is beautified with the Elegancy of Words and Sentences.</p>
               <p>And this is performed two ways; by the fine manners of Words, called a <hi>Trope</hi>; or by the fine frame of Speech, called a Figure.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Trope</hi> is such an Elocution or manner of Speech, as doth change the signification of a word into a different signification from the natural.</p>
               <p>In a <hi>Trope</hi> two things are to be considered. 1. The <hi>Affections.</hi> 2. The <hi>Kinds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Affections</hi> of a <hi>Trope</hi> are four,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Catachresis.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Hyperbole.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Matalepsis.</hi>

                  <item>
                     <hi>Allegoria.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catachresis,</hi> is a harsh and unpleasant change of a Word; as namely, when one word or name is put to another, not by any proper relation, but by a kind of force. <hi>He threatens me a good turn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> is a very high relation of a thing, or a more bold excess of a <hi>Trope,</hi> which doth exceed belief, either by Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64961:88"/>
or by Diminution. Note that though an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> doth vary from the truth, yet doth it not deceive us through-Fiction, or such variation.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Hyperbole</hi> is two-fold; <hi>Auxesis</hi> or <hi>Meio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Auxesis</hi> is, when for Argumentation sake or Amplification, we interpose a more vehement expression, in his proper place; as when we say, <hi>magnificent</hi> for <hi>liberal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Meiosis,</hi> or a <hi>Tapinosis,</hi> is when for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation sake, we use a milder or more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable expression, than the matter requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; as when we say <hi>a flatterer is a courteous and an affable person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Matalepsis,</hi> is that which containeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tropes in one expression; as, when we by an improper Speech, signifie, first, that which is improper, and by that improper Speech perhaps another, and so forward, till we come to that which is proper, making way for Transition, by interposing a mean degree; as <hi>All the City was moved. Mat.</hi> 21.10. where the City is put for <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by a <hi>Synechdoche Generis</hi>: and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, by a Metonymy of the Subject.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Allegory,</hi> is the continuation of a Trope as where many Tropes of the same kind are joyned together; as, <hi>Put on the whole Armor of God, Ephesians</hi> 6.11.</p>
               <p>In an <hi>Allegory,</hi> observe to end with the same kind of Trope with which you begin, or
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64961:89"/>
else the Consequence will be abused.</p>
               <p>The several kinds of Tropes are these four:
<list>
                     <item>1. A <hi>Metonomy.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. An <hi>Irony.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. A <hi>Metaphor</hi>: and</item>
                     <item>4. A <hi>Synechdoche.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Metonomy,</hi> is a Trope of the Cause to the Effect, of the Subject to the Adjunct: and the contrary, of the Effect to the Cause, or of the Adjunct to the Subject.</p>
               <p>There are four kinds of Causes.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Efficient Cause,</hi> by which a thing is.</item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>Material Cause,</hi> of which a thing is made.</item>
                  <item>3. The <hi>Formal Cause,</hi> by which a thing is what it is.</item>
                  <item>4. The <hi>Final Cause,</hi> for which a thing is; of which the two first only belong to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose.</item>
               </list>
               <p>A <hi>Metonymy</hi> of the <hi>Cause,</hi> is of the <hi>Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> or of the <hi>Matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Metonymy</hi> of the <hi>Efficient Cause,</hi> is when the Author or Inventor of any thing is put for those things which he hath invented; as <hi>Virgil,</hi> for the Poem or Works composed by <hi>Virgil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Metonymy</hi> of the <hi>Material Cause,</hi> is when the name of the Matter is put for the Effect; as Brass, for Brass Money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Metonymy</hi> of the <hi>Effect,</hi> is when the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Cause is signified by the Effect; as, <hi>Pale Death,</hi> which <hi>maketh Pale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:64961:89"/>A <hi>Metonymy</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> is when the proper name of any Subject is made to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Adjunct; as, <hi>the Cup,</hi> for the <hi>Drink in the Cup.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Metonymy</hi> of the <hi>Adjunct,</hi> is when the Adjunct is put for the Subject; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.53. <hi>Jacob swear by the fear of his Father Isaac, i. e.</hi> by God, whom <hi>Isaac</hi> feared.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Irony,</hi> is a Trope from one opposite to another, or in which we speak by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Opposites</hi>; are either unlike or contrary; all things of different natures are said to be unlike, as a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Stone</hi>; and all things of contrary natures are said to be contrary to one another; as <hi>light</hi> and <hi>darkness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Irony</hi> of a thing unlike, is when any thing is spoken of one person, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of another.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Irony</hi> from the contrary, is when one contrary is signified by another; as <hi>O thou hast done very well</hi>; meaning that he had <hi>done very ill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paralepsis,</hi> is a kind of <hi>Irony,</hi> by which we seem to pass by, or take no notice of such things which yet we strictly observe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apophasis,</hi> is a kind of <hi>Irony,</hi> by which we deny to say or do what yet we speak with greatest earnestness, and do with all our might.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Metaphor,</hi> is a Trope, by which we
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64961:90"/>
express our selves by a word, which is of the like signification with that we mean; as, <hi>the King is the Head of the Common-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> is a Trope, by which a part is put for the whole, or the whole for a part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Part, is either a Member or Species.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Synecdoche</hi> of a Member, when by a Member the whole is signified; as, the <hi>Roof</hi> for the <hi>House.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Synecdoche</hi> of the <hi>Species,</hi> is when the <hi>Species</hi> is put for the <hi>Genus</hi>; as, <hi>Croesus,</hi> for a <hi>Rich man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole is either an <hi>Integer</hi> or <hi>Genus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Synecdoche</hi> of an <hi>Integer,</hi> is when an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teger</hi> is put for a Member; as, <hi>His Army was so great, that it drank the Rivers dry</hi>; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great part of the Water in the River.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Synecdoche</hi> of the <hi>Genus</hi> is, when the general is put for the special; as, <hi>Preach the Gospel to every Creature,</hi> meaning Mankind only, and not to every Creature.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of <hi>Tropes,</hi> the first kind of elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the second kind of Elocution by Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of a Figure.</head>
               <p>A <hi>Figure,</hi> is a kind of Elocution, by which the form of a Speech is changed from its right and plain use.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Figure,</hi> is either of a Word, or of a Sentence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Figure of a Word,</hi> is that by which an Oration or Speech is composed of words aptly and sweetly suitable to one another, and this consists in the Dimension or Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of Sounds or VVords.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Figure,</hi> in the Dimension of Sounds, is the sweet number of Sounds in a Sentence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Number,</hi> is either <hi>Poetical</hi> or <hi>Oratorical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Poetical Number,</hi> is that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a perpetual observation of certain Spaces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Number Poetical,</hi> is either <hi>Rhyme or Meter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rhyme</hi> is a <hi>Poetical Number,</hi> containing a certain number of Feet, without any regard to the quantity of the Syllables; whether long or short, <hi>As,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Dare to be true; nothing can need a lye:</l>
                     <l>A fault that needs it most, grows two thereby.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Meter,</hi> is a Poetical Number, consisting
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64961:91"/>
of certain Feet, of which the last Foot hath the last Syllable indifferent or common; that is, long or short.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oratorical Number</hi> doth indeed consist of Feet, but not of any certain number of Feet, but of as many or as few as the Orator plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Figure</hi> of a word in respect of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition thereof, is either of like or unlike Sounds.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Figure</hi> of a word in the repitition of the like Sound, is either with, or without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repetition</hi> of the like Sound without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, is either an <hi>Epizeuxis,</hi> or an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diplosis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Epizeuxis,</hi> is when a like Sound is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in the same Sentence without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; as, a <hi>sword, a sword is sharpened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Anadiplosis,</hi> is when a like sound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Intermission is repeated in divers senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>i. e.</hi> when it ends one and begins ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as,
<q>
                     <l>If then, why I take not my leave, she ask;</l>
                     <l>Ask her again, why she did not unask?</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Repetition</hi> of like sound with intermission in the same place, is either an <hi>Anaphora</hi> or <hi>Epistrophe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Anaphora,</hi> is when a like sound is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64961:91"/>
in the beginning of Sentences; as,
<q>
                     <l>By art of Sails and Oars, Seas are divided:</l>
                     <l>By art the Chariot runs, by art Loves guided.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Epistrophe,</hi> is when a like sound is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, in the close of sentences; as, <hi>Are they</hi> Hebrews? <hi>so am I: Are they,</hi> Israelites? <hi>so am I: Are they of the seed of</hi> Abraham? <hi>so am</hi> I.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repetition</hi> of like sound with intermission in divers parts or places, is either an <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalepsis,</hi> or an <hi>Epanados.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Epanalepsis,</hi> is when a like sound is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in the beginning and ending of the same Sentence; as, <hi>In sorrow was I born, and I must dye in sorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Epanados,</hi> is when the like sound is in the beginning and ending of divers senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, an <hi>Anadiplosis</hi> coming between; as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenia <hi>desired above all things to have</hi> Arga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus; Argalus <hi>feared nothing but to miss</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenia.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Figure</hi> of a Word made by the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sounds somewhat unlike, is either <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomafia,</hi> or <hi>Polyptoton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paronomafia,</hi> is when a Word being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a Letter or Syllable, it is also chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in sense and signification; as, <hi>Though you advise me to repent, I have not Grace to follow your advise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Polyptoton,</hi> is when words of the same
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64961:92"/>
Original are reiterated, but with some variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as, <hi>Deceiving,</hi> and <hi>being Deceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Figure</hi> in reference to a sentence, is a Figure which affecteth the whole sentence with some motion of the Mind, either in absolute reasoning, or in reasoning Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue-wise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Logismus,</hi> or absolute Reasoning, is when a sentence is composed without any talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with other supposed; this is either <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonesis,</hi> a <hi>recalling of ones self, Apostrophe,</hi> or <hi>Prosopopeia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ecphonesis,</hi> is a Figure in reasoning, by way of Exclamation, by an Adverb expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or understood; as, <hi>O wretched man that</hi> I <hi>am</hi>!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Recalling</hi> of ones self, is when something is called back; and it is as it were a Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the over-hastiness or heat of speech; and this is either <hi>Epanorthosis,</hi> or <hi>Aposiopesis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Eparnorthosis,</hi> is when something pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeing is called back, by correcting it; as, <hi>I had one only Young Man to my son; ah! what have</hi> I <hi>said!</hi> I <hi>had! yea I had! It is now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether</hi> I <hi>have or not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Aposiopesis,</hi> is when the close of a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence begun is stopped, by keeping in a part, which yet is understood; as, <hi>You Rogue if</hi> I <hi>Live!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Apostrophe,</hi> is when a speech is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to another, than was by the speech it
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64961:92"/>
self at first intended; as, <hi>God knows</hi> I <hi>lye not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Prosopopoeia,</hi> is when in our Oration, we suppose another person to be speaking; as, Josh. 24.27. <hi>Behold this shall be a witness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; for it hath heard all the Words of the Lord, which he hath spoken unto us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Figure,</hi> in reasoning Dialogue-wise, is when a sentence is composed in form of a Conference; this consisteth in Question and Answer, in Consenting or dissenting Dialogism.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Figure</hi> of consenting Dialogism, is when ones Answer doth admit of the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction expressed or understood; yet so, as that from thence the inconsequence of the Objection may be shewed if need be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dissenting Dialogism,</hi> is when ones an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer doth impugn or cross the Objection.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning <hi>Elocution,</hi> as for <hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Pronounciation,</hi> which are the other two parts of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> I purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omit them, as being natural Endowments, which may be better improved by constant practice, than by any Precepts which can be given.</p>

                  <hi>LOgick,</hi> is an Art which conducteth the Mind in the knowledge of Things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Parts of <hi>Logick</hi> are two, <hi>Thematical</hi> and <hi>Organical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Thematical</hi> part is that, which Treateth of Themes, with their various af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and second Notions, as of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which Logical Instruments are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>

the understanding, that it may be known.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>A Theme,</hi> is either <hi>simple</hi> or <hi>compound.</hi>

               <p n="13">13. <hi>An Vniversal simple Theme,</hi> otherwise called a Predicable, is that which may be spoken of many; as, <hi>a Body</hi>; and this is either of the first or second Intention.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>A simple Theme of the first intention,</hi> is that which expresseth the thing it self; as, <hi>Gold, Stone,</hi> &amp;c. so called, because they are the names by which the things themselves are first made known.</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:64961:94"/>15. A <hi>simple Theme of the second Intention,</hi> is that which doth not express the things it self, but certain affections agreeing to the thing, and such are all Words of Art; as, <hi>a Noun, a Metaphor, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="16">16. <hi>An Vniversal simple Theme,</hi> may be spoken of many, two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In Quid</hi>? or by declaring what a thing is; and thus it is spoken of such as do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the <hi>species,</hi> and is called <hi>Genus</hi>; as, <hi>a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creature, colour, &amp;c.</hi> or else of such as do differ in number only, and is called <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>; as, <hi>a Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In Quale,</hi> or by declaring what a kind of thing it is, of which it is spoken; &amp; that Essentially or Accidentally, Essentially, and then it is called Difference, the which is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Divisive,</hi> by which a <hi>Genus</hi> is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its several <hi>species,</hi> as by rational and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional a Living Creature is divided into a Man or a Beast.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Constitution,</hi> which doth Essentially constitute some <hi>species,</hi> and this is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Generical,</hi> which doth constitute some remote <hi>species,</hi> but not the next, for the next is the <hi>Genus,</hi> thus <hi>sensibility</hi> in respect of Man, is a <hi>generical difference,</hi> constituting first a living <hi>Creature,</hi> and then a man. And this is always spoken of many differing in <hi>species,</hi> or <hi>number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Specifical,</hi> which doth <hi>constitute</hi> the nearest <hi>species</hi>; as, rationalibility doth <hi>constitute man.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Accidentally,</hi> and that either of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64961:95"/>
and then it is called a proper Accident, which is convertable with its <hi>Species,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually inherent in every of them, and in no other, as the visible faculty in a Man.</p>
               <p>Or not of necessity, and then it is called a common or simple Accident, not converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with its <hi>Species</hi>; as <hi>white.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. All <hi>simple Themes,</hi> may be reduced to ten ranks or orders, called <hi>Predicaments,</hi> of which some are more principal, some less.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The more principal <hi>Predicaments</hi> are the first six, the less principal, are the other four.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The <hi>Predicamental Ranks</hi> or <hi>Orders,</hi> are of two sorts, the one of <hi>Substance,</hi> and the other of <hi>Accidents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. Of <hi>Substance,</hi> there is only one, and it is called by that name <hi>Substance,</hi> which is a thing subsisting of it self, and it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther first or second.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The first <hi>substance,</hi> is a Singular sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, or a substance that cannot be predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of its subject; as, <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. The second <hi>Substance</hi> is an Universal substance, or a substance which may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated of its subject; as, <hi>a Man, a Horse.</hi> The first substance is chiefly and properly a substance, and among the second substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, every one is by so much more a substance, by how much it is nearer to the first.</p>
               <p n="23">23. The <hi>Predicamental Ranks</hi> or <hi>Orders</hi> of Accidents, are of two sorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Absolute,</hi> as the Predicaments of <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64961:95"/>
Quality, Action,</hi> and <hi>Passion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Relative,</hi> as the Predicament of <hi>Relation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. <hi>Quantity,</hi> is an absolute accident, by which a thing is said to be great in bulk or number.</p>
               <p n="25">25. <hi>Quality,</hi> is an absolute Accident, by which it is simply and determinately decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what kind of thing, that subject is, of which it is the <hi>Quality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26. <hi>Action,</hi> is an Accident, by which a subject is said to be doing.</p>
               <p n="27">27. <hi>Passion,</hi> is an Accident, by which the subject is called Patient; or it is the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. <hi>Relation,</hi> is a respective accident, by which one thing is predicated of another, or may by some way be referred unto another.</p>
               <p n="29">29. The less principal Predicaments are these four, <hi>When, Where, Scituation,</hi> and <hi>Habit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="30">30. The Predicament <hi>When,</hi> is an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by which finite things are said to be in time, past, present, or to come.</p>
               <p n="31">31. The Predicament <hi>Where,</hi> is an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by which things finite, are said to be in some place.</p>
               <p n="32">32. The Predicament of <hi>Scituation,</hi> is a certain Ordination, or placing of parts in Generation.</p>
               <p n="33">33. The Predicament of <hi>Habit,</hi> is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, by which some garment or something like a Garment, is put about, hanged upon, or some way or other joyned to a Body.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of Compounded Themes.</head>
               <p>HItherto of <hi>Simple Themes: Compounded Themes,</hi> or such as are made of several Simple Themes are next to be considered; otherwise called <hi>Enunciations,</hi> or <hi>Propositions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. An <hi>Enunciation,</hi> or <hi>Proposition,</hi> is an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative, Congruent and perfect Oration, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying true or false without any Ambiguity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The parts of a Proposition are two, the parts Signing or Signed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The parts Signing are <hi>simple terms,</hi> whose parts can signifie nothing, being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the whole, or no such thing as they did signifie being joyned all together.</p>
               <p n="5">5. These <hi>simple terms</hi> are of two sorts, <hi>Categorematical,</hi> or <hi>Syncategorematical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Categorematical,</hi> or Significative terms, or such simple terms, as do by themselves signifie something perfectly; and these are either <hi>Nouns</hi> or <hi>Verbs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. A <hi>Noun,</hi> is a simple term or word, which doth signifie some certain thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out destinction of time; as, <hi>a man, a horse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. A <hi>Verb,</hi> is a simple term, which doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie something, with some <hi>destinction</hi> of <hi>time past,</hi> present, or to come; as, <hi>he runneth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Syncategorematical,</hi> or Consignificative terms, are simple terms, which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do not signifie any certain thing, or
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64961:96"/>
constitute a Proposition, but being joyned with other Words, are significative, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the manner of such a thing; and such are all Words which serve to express the quantity of a proposition; as, <hi>all, none, some, &amp;c.</hi> with all Adverbs, Conjunctions, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and Interjections.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The parts signed are three; the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> the <hi>predicate,</hi> and the <hi>Copula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. The <hi>subject</hi> is all that which precedes the <hi>Copula</hi> in the Proposition.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The <hi>Predicate,</hi> is all that which is spoken of the <hi>subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. The <hi>Copula,</hi> is the principal Verb, joyning the <hi>Predicate</hi> to <hi>the subject,</hi> and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Proposition is some person of this Verb Substantive, as in this Proposition, <hi>A Man is a living Creature; a Man</hi> is the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; a living Creature</hi> is the <hi>Predicate</hi>; and the Verb is the <hi>Copula</hi>; sometimes the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula</hi> is some Person of a Verb Adjective; as in this Proposition, <hi>Socrates lived at Athens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here note, that the subject doth not always precede, and the <hi>predicate</hi> follow the <hi>Copula,</hi> in order of the parts or terms, but in sense and construction; and also, that in some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, the three terms are not always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, but implyed; as, <hi>I walk, for I am walking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Propositions</hi> are distinguish'd <hi>three</hi> ways, according to <hi>Substance, Quantity,</hi> and <hi>Quality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. A <hi>Proposition,</hi> in respect of the substance or parts of which it doth consist, is either <hi>Categorical</hi> or <hi>Hypothetical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:64961:97"/>16. A <hi>Categorical Proposition,</hi> is that which doth consist of one <hi>subject,</hi> one <hi>Predicate,</hi> and one <hi>Copula</hi>; as, <hi>a man is a Living Creature,</hi> and this is either <hi>Pure</hi> or <hi>Modal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>A Pure Categorical Proposition,</hi> is when the <hi>Predicate</hi> is purely affirmed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed of the <hi>subject,</hi> without expressing the manner of affirming or denying.</p>
               <p n="18">18. A <hi>Modal Categorical Proposition,</hi> is when besides the <hi>subject, predicate,</hi> and <hi>Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> we add some modification, to shew how the <hi>Predicate</hi> is in the <hi>Subject,</hi> as, <hi>it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; it is contingent, it is possible; it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that a man should be without reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. An <hi>Hypothetial Proposition,</hi> is that which doth consist of two <hi>Categorical Propositions,</hi> joyned together by some Conjunction, as, <hi>if a man be a living Creature, then a man is a Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. A <hi>Proposition,</hi> in respect of <hi>Quality,</hi> is <hi>distinguished</hi> two ways; first, according to the <hi>Quality</hi> of the sign, and so it is Affirmative or Negative; secondly, according to the <hi>quantity</hi> of the thing; &amp; so it is either True or False.</p>
               <p n="21">21. A <hi>Proposition,</hi> in respect of <hi>Quantity,</hi> is <hi>universal, particular, indefinite,</hi> or <hi>singular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. An <hi>Vniversal proposition,</hi> is that which hath a note of Universality added to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or universal Subject; as, <hi>every man is a Living Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. A <hi>particular proposition,</hi> is that in which a note of <hi>particularity</hi> is added to an <hi>universal</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:64961:97"/>
Subject; as, <hi>some man is a Living Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. An <hi>Indefinite proposition,</hi> is that, in which no note, whether Universal or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is put before the universal Subject; as, <hi>a man is a Living Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. A <hi>Singular proposition,</hi> is that in which the subject is singular, whether it be a <hi>proper</hi> Name; as, <hi>Secrates is a Philosopher</hi>; or whether it be a common name, with a note of <hi>singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> set before it; as, <hi>this man is Learned.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Logical</hi> Instruments are four; <hi>Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Division, Argumentation,</hi> and <hi>Method.</hi>

                  <hi>ARgumentation is an Oration by which some Problem is proved by inference.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Problem,</hi> is the proposition or Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to be proved; the which Problem, when it is so proved is the Conclusion, and follows the Illative note, or note of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: All that which precedes is the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, that which follows is the Consequent or Conclusion; the Illative is commonly this word <hi>(therefore,</hi>) and in this doth the tye or force of the Argument consist.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Argumentation,</hi> may be considered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reference to the form and manner of Arguing, which is the more general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration; or as it is restrained to certain matter, as shall be shewed in his place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The kinds of <hi>Argumentation</hi> are usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckoned to be four; <hi>Syllogism, Induction,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64961:101"/>
Enthymeme, and Example,</hi> but may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to two; for an <hi>Enthymeme</hi> is nothing but an imperfect <hi>Syllogism</hi>; an <hi>Example,</hi> an imperfect <hi>Induction</hi>; Other less principal kinds of Argumentation there are, which either are of no use, or may be reduced to a <hi>Syllogism</hi>; as, <hi>Sorites</hi> and <hi>Dilemma,</hi> which are indeed redundant <hi>Syllogisms; Sorites</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegorical, and <hi>Dilemma</hi> Hypothetical.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A <hi>Syllogism,</hi> is an Oration, in which something being taken for granted, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else not granted before, is proved or inferred from them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A <hi>Syllogism</hi> is two-fold, <hi>Categorical,</hi> in which all the propositions are <hi>Categori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal:</hi> or <hi>Hypothetical,</hi> in which one or more of the propositions are <hi>Hypothetical</hi>; in both which we are to consider the Matter and the Form.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Matter</hi> of a Syllogism, is either <hi>Remote</hi> or <hi>Next.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>Remote matter,</hi> is that of which it is remotely made, as the Simple Terms which in the propositions of the Syllogism are made Subject and predicate.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>Simple Terms</hi> of a Syllogism are three, of which one is called the Middle Term, the other two are the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>jor</hi> and the <hi>Minor</hi> Extreams, The <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor Extreams</hi> are the <hi>Predicate,</hi> and the other the <hi>Subject</hi> of the question, and the Middle Term or Argument, is the Term not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64961:101"/>
in the question, but is united once to the <hi>Major Extream,</hi> and once to the <hi>Minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The next or immediate matter of a Syllogism, is that of which the Syllogism is immediately made, as the three propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are made of the simple terms, of which the first is called the <hi>Major,</hi> the second the <hi>Minor,</hi> &amp; the third is call'd the <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. The form of a Syllogism is the right disposing of the two-fold Matter, Next and Remote, and this comprehendeth two things, <hi>Figure,</hi> and <hi>Mood</hi>; the one, to wit <hi>Figure,</hi> hath respect to the Remote Matter or Simple Terms, and Moods respects the next Matter or the propositions.</p>
               <p n="11">11. A <hi>Figure,</hi> is the fit disposing of the middle Terms with the Extreams, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to subjection and Predication; this is three-fold.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The first Figure maketh that which is the <hi>middle simple term</hi> to be the <hi>subject</hi> in the <hi>major</hi> proposition and the <hi>Predicate</hi> in the <hi>minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. The second <hi>Figure,</hi> maketh the <hi>middle simple term</hi> to be the <hi>Predicate,</hi> both in the <hi>major</hi> and the <hi>minor</hi> propositions.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The third Figure maketh the <hi>middle simple term</hi> to be the subject both in the <hi>major</hi> and the <hi>minor</hi> propositions; according to these Distichs.</p>
               <q>

               <p>The question propounded is always the conclusion of the Syllogism, and by the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity thereof doth plainly shew in what mood or moods it may be framed, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in what Figure also.</p>
               <p n="20">20. If the Syllogism be to be made in such a mood as doth directly infer the <hi>Conclusion</hi> from the <hi>Premises</hi>; then the <hi>subject</hi> in the <hi>Proposition</hi> is the <hi>Minor</hi> Extream, and the <hi>Predicate</hi> the <hi>Major</hi>; as in the four first moods of the first Figure, and in all the Moods of the second and third Figures; but in the five last Moods of the first Figure, the <hi>subject</hi> in the <hi>Proposition</hi> is the <hi>Major</hi> Extream and the <hi>Predicate</hi> the <hi>Minor</hi>; and the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle term is the Cause or Argument by which the truth or falsitie of the <hi>proposition</hi> is to be proved.</p>

               <p>I Come now to speak of a <hi>Special</hi> or <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial syllogism,</hi> as it is constrained to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conditions of Matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A <hi>special</hi> or <hi>material syllogism,</hi> is of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64961:104"/>
three sorts; <hi>Apodictical, Dialectical</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. An <hi>Apodictical syllogism,</hi> otherwise cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Demonstration,</hi> may be defined two ways; either from the end, or from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Demonstration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. From the end of <hi>Demonstration,</hi> an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictical syllogism,</hi> is a <hi>syllogism</hi> begetting knowledge, or making to know. And we are then said to know a thing, when we know the cause for which it is so, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwise.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All Knowledge is of such Conclusions, to which we assent, for our preceding know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Premises; and the <hi>Praecognita</hi> in every Science are these three: The <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> the <hi>Affection,</hi> and the <hi>Cause.</hi> And the means by which these are foreknown, are called <hi>Praecognitions,</hi> and they are two; <hi>That a thing is,</hi> and <hi>what a thing is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>subject,</hi> is the less Extream, in a <hi>Demonstration,</hi> concerning which some acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is Demonstrated by its next <hi>Cause</hi>; as, <hi>a man, concerning whom we must know both that he is,</hi> and <hi>what he is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Affection</hi> or <hi>Passion,</hi> is a proper acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which is Demonstrated of the <hi>subject,</hi> by a proper <hi>Cause,</hi> it is always the greater Extream, which is Predicated in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; as, <hi>Risibility,</hi> the which is necessary to be foreknown, in respect of its name, <hi>What it is,</hi> but not, <hi>that it is</hi>; for that is the thing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64961:105"/>
to be enquired after, the thing we are to find by Denomination.</p>
               <p n="8">8. A <hi>Cause,</hi> is that by which the <hi>Affection</hi> is Demonstrated of its <hi>subject,</hi> and is always the <hi>Major Proposition</hi> in the Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as, <hi>Every rational Animal is risible</hi>; what the <hi>Cause</hi> is cannot be foreknown, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a compounded Proposition, but it ought to be known, That it is, or else the Conclusion cannot be inferr'd from it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. An <hi>Apodictical syllogism,</hi> being defined from the matter of Demonstration, is a <hi>syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism,</hi> which proveth its Conclusion from such Premises, as are of themselves suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known.</p>
               <p n="10">10. A <hi>Demonstration,</hi> is to be considered, either in respect of the Matter or in respect of the Form.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In respect of the Matter, one kind of <hi>Demonstration,</hi> sheweth why the <hi>Predicate</hi> is inherent in the <hi>subject,</hi> and another sheweth that it is inherent in the <hi>subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. In the first of these kinds of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, called the <hi>Demonstration causal,</hi> why a thing is; the Conditions to be observed, do partly belong to the Question, partly to the <hi>Cause</hi> or <hi>Medium</hi> of the <hi>Demonstration,</hi> and partly to the <hi>Premises.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. Every Question doth not admit of the first and most perfect kind of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, called, <hi>Why a thing is?</hi> but such a Question only as is true, and hath a certain
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64961:105"/>
and immutable Cause of its own Truth.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The <hi>Medium</hi> of a Demonstration, ought to be the next Cause of the <hi>Predicate</hi>; and that either <hi>Efficient</hi> or <hi>Final,</hi> and the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> either <hi>Internal</hi> or <hi>External.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. The Conditions to be observed in the Premises of a Demonstration, are <hi>Absolute</hi> or <hi>Relative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. The <hi>Absolute Conditions</hi> are two; the first is, that the Propositions be necessarily true and reciprocal; The second, is that they be immediate or first, in respect of the subject; as, <hi>A man is Rational,</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Causes; as, <hi>That which is ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, is visible, a man is rational,</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The <hi>Relative Conditions</hi> to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in reference to the Conclusion, are three. 1. That the <hi>Premises</hi> be the Cause of the <hi>Conclusion.</hi> 2. That they be before it: and 3. That they be more known than the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</hi>

               <p n="19">19. The form of these Demonstrations, is descerned partly from the <hi>Quantity,</hi> and so it is <hi>Vniversal</hi> or <hi>Particular</hi>; Partly from the <hi>Quality,</hi> and so it is <hi>Affirmative</hi> or <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi>; partly from the manner of the proof, and so it is <hi>Ostensive,</hi> or by <hi>Reduction</hi> to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility.</p>

               <p>HItherto we have spoken of a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative syllogism, whose matter is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and the end a perfect Knowledge; come we now to a <hi>Dialectical</hi> or <hi>Topical syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism,</hi> whose matter is Probable and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, and the end Opinion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In a <hi>Dialectical,</hi> or <hi>Topical Syllogism,</hi> we are to consider of <hi>Problems, Propositions,</hi> and <hi>Invention of Arguments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>Problem</hi> or <hi>Question,</hi> is the thing of which it is probably discoursed, and the Conclusion of a syllogism already made.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Dialectical Propositions,</hi> ought to be certain, at least probable, and not Paradox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; now that is said to be Probable, which not being absolutely true, doth seem to be true rather than false: And that is said to be a Paradox, which is true, though contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the vulgar opinion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For the Invention of Arguments, we are to consider Common places and Rules.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A <hi>Place,</hi> is common Note, by whose help an Argument is found.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Canon</hi> is a Proposition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64961:106"/>
the Reason of the Consequence, in a <hi>Dialectical syllogism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Arguments</hi> are of two sorts, <hi>Artificial</hi> and <hi>Inartificial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Artificial Arguments,</hi> are such as from the consideration of the parts of a Problem, are not found but by Rules of Art.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Inartificial Arguments,</hi> are such as are found without any help of Art, and these are nothing but Testimonies.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Artificial Arguments,</hi> may be raised from these seven <hi>Topicks</hi> or <hi>Heads.</hi> 1. From the <hi>Cause</hi> and the <hi>Effect.</hi> 2. From the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> and the <hi>Accident.</hi> 3. From <hi>Dissentany</hi> and <hi>Comparison.</hi> 4. From <hi>Conjugates</hi> and <hi>Notation.</hi> 5. From the Whole and its Parts. 6. From <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species.</hi> 7. From <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Division.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. A <hi>Cause</hi> in General, may be defined to be that, by whose power a thing is.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Argument</hi> therefore from the <hi>Cause,</hi> is when in a probable syllogism, the middle term is the cause of the <hi>Major</hi> Extream.</p>
               <p n="13">13. There are two kinds of <hi>Causes; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> as the <hi>material,</hi> or matter, of which a thing is made; and the <hi>Formal,</hi> by which a thing is; as, <hi>The shape and form of a statue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>External,</hi> as the Efficient, which doth bring the thing to pass; and the <hi>Final</hi> or <hi>End,</hi> for which a thing is done.</p>
               <p n="14">14. An <hi>Argument</hi> from the Efficient Cause, is when in a probable syllogism, the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64961:107"/>
                  <hi>middle Term</hi> is the Efficient of the <hi>Major</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream: as, <hi>The Earth is Diametricaly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed between the Sun and the Moon, therefore the Moon shall be eclipsed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. An <hi>Argument</hi> from the <hi>Final Cause,</hi> is when in a probable syllogism, the <hi>middle Term</hi> is the <hi>Final Cause</hi> of the <hi>major</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream.</p>
               <p n="16">16. An <hi>Argument</hi> from the <hi>material cause,</hi> is when in a probable syllogism, the <hi>middle Term</hi> is the <hi>material cause</hi> of the <hi>Major</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, or the <hi>Genus</hi> or <hi>Species</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p n="17">17. An <hi>Argument</hi> from the <hi>Formal Cause,</hi> is when in a Probable syllogism, the <hi>middle Term</hi> is the <hi>Form, Definition, Description,</hi> or <hi>Difference</hi> of the <hi>major</hi> Extream.</p>
               <p n="18">18.

               <p n="5">5. A <hi>Natural Method</hi> is either <hi>Total,</hi> or <hi>Partial.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. A <hi>Synthetical</hi> or <hi>Compositive Method</hi> is that, which begins with the first and most simple Principles, and so proceeds to those which do arise from, or are Composed of the first Principles.</p>

that, which begins with the end, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds still lower and lower, till we come to the first and most Simple beginnings.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AMongst the many Undertakings, that redound to the Advantage of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>Navigation</hi> is very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for on it depends not only the Welfare of private Persons, but of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Kingdoms, as being Enriched and Improved in Knowledge by it: Wherefore it is highly necessary to speak something of it in this Treatise of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> that may Instruct the Unexperienced, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, improve the knowledge of the Elder Practitioners.</p>
               <p>In the Treatise of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> you find the names of the Stars, and many other things necessary to be taken notice of in <hi>Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; for on that <hi>Art</hi> much of this depends, especially in taking the Suns height or <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Altitude,</hi> and the Elevation or height
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64961:111"/>
of the Pole, as being the Computation or Distance in <hi>Latitude</hi> from the Aequator, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther North or South, or any other Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Parralel, as we find East and West is the distance of <hi>Longitude,</hi> where ever the <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> is found, there must consequently be computed an equal distance on either side of it; so that the <hi>Meridian</hi> thus considered, the <hi>Rumb</hi> must be so likewise, for that leading from place to place, may be termed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance run upon such a point of the Compass. And to come nearer the taking of these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and heights are the principal things to be observed in this Art as to the Carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Ship to any Country and Port, and knowing at any time where you are, and all these (according to the greatest Proficients) are more closely, or briefly comprized. 1. In the difference of the Latitude. 2. In the difference of the Longitude. 3. The <hi>Rumbs.</hi> 4. The distance run upon the <hi>Rumb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if two of these be known or given, the two that remain may be easily found, the first by <hi>Observation,</hi> and the last by <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonometry,</hi> or <hi>Arithmetical Calculation,</hi> &amp;c. And in further consideration of these things, to find the Latitude or <hi>Elevation</hi> of the <hi>Pole,</hi> you must observe the <hi>Meridian Altitude</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Sun or Stars, and though there are many ways described to do this, yet what ensues is found the most plain and easy.</p>
               <p>Do it by the <hi>Astrolabe</hi> or <hi>Quadrant</hi> in this
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64961:111"/>
manner, <hi>viz.</hi> by what we call backward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and not troubling your Eyes with looking through the sights, permit the Sun to shine through the sight, that is next to the <hi>Center,</hi> so ordering it, that the beam may fall directly upon the hole of the other sight, by which means the thread will fall upon the right <hi>Altitude</hi> in the Quadrant, or the <hi>Index</hi> in the <hi>Astrolabe</hi> will in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner divide the degrees of <hi>Altitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Sun shine not, and you are desirous to find its <hi>Meridian Altitude,</hi> you may do it by informing your self of the declination and Latitude; And upon this observation, if you find the declination <hi>North,</hi> then add to the Complement of the Latitude, which you will ever find to be the same with the height of the Aequinoctial, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if it be a <hi>South</hi> declination, then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the Complement of the Latitude, and that will at any time give you the <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Altitude.</hi> As put the case we find in any place the <hi>Elevation</hi> of the <hi>Pole,</hi> that is the Latitude to be 52 degrees, the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof to 90 degrees, is 38 degrees, which likewise is found to be the height of the Aequinoctial, and then it being granted, that on <hi>May</hi> 2. the Sun being 20 degrees, 24 minutes of <hi>Taurus,</hi> his declination North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is 117 degrees, 56' 21 s. which, when you add to 38, brings the Suns <hi>Meridian Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> to be 55 degrees, 56 minutes, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64961:112"/>
12 seconds, but if this be required to be found when the Sun comes to the Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial, either on the 13 of <hi>September,</hi> or the 11 of <hi>March,</hi> then the height of the stars or sun, when they are upon the <hi>Meridian,</hi> will shew the true Latitude if subtracted from 90 degrees, but at other times you must find out their declinations, and if it happen Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly, subtract it from the Altitude, but if Southerly, you must add it to the Altitude, by which means you will find the height of the Aequinoctial above the Horizon, and Consequently subtracted from 90 degrees, will give you the true Latitude of the place where you make your Observation.</p>
               <p>If by the Globe you are desirous to find the <hi>Elevation</hi> of the <hi>Pole,</hi> take the Suns <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian Altitude,</hi> bringing the Suns place in the Ecliptick, or the Stars to the <hi>Brazen Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,</hi> and so move that <hi>Meridian</hi> with the Globe through the notches it stands in, till you find the stars, or the suns places Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as many degrees above the Horizon, as their <hi>Meridian Altitude</hi> is; and whilst the Globe stands in this position, you may be confident the <hi>Pole</hi> will be Elevated to a true Latitude of the Place.</p>
               <p>As suppose you find the Suns place in the beginning of <hi>Cancer,</hi> which may be the 12 of <hi>June,</hi> and the <hi>Meridian Altitude</hi> of the sun is 62 degrees from the place where you are to make your observation, then bring
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64961:112"/>
the first degree of the sign <hi>Cancer</hi> to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,</hi> and Elevate the same 62 degrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Horizon, and you will find the <hi>Pole</hi> Elevated 51 degrees and 30 minutes.</p>
               <p>The next thing in <hi>Navigation</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, is the finding the Longitude, which could it be brought to perfection, sailing would be far more easy than it is, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverys of yet unknown Countrys, Rich perhaps as either <hi>Indias</hi>; but indeed, though many have attempted it, and gone very far, they have never brought to perfection, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for the light of the Navigator, we will consider some things herein.</p>
               <p>Suppose the Moon to be Eclipsed, observe how much sooner it begins at a place of known Longitude, for which search the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemerides,</hi> then at the place where you stand, and observing your Latitude by the stars, as has been directed, the true hour of the night may be found; which done, observe the difference of time of the Moons beginning to be Eclipsed, or its middle or endings, at the place where you make your observation, which spaces convert into degrees and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, which added or subtracted from the hour of the beginning, middle or end of this Eclips at a place of known Longitude, these degrees and minutes in their difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hour at one place, and the hour at an other, added or subtracted from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and minutes of the known Longitude,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64961:113"/>
you will find them give the required Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>If the Moon be not Eclipsed, which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clips cannot be expected upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, then you may observe it by the Sun and Moons motion, as thus; suppose, and it is granted, that the Moon is slower in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than the Sun 48 minutes, in 24 hours, or 360 degrees, then by the help of Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Instruments, find the true <hi>Meridian</hi> in any place, suppose the <hi>West-Indias,</hi> &amp;c. you must also find the hour of the Moons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that <hi>Meridian</hi> by the <hi>Ephemerides,</hi> or other helps; and this being calculated for <hi>London,</hi> you find by those helps, that on such a day the Moon comes to the <hi>Meridian,</hi> at four in the Afternoon, and you being the same day in the <hi>Indias</hi> aforesaid, you find her come to the <hi>Meridian</hi> 10 minutes past 4, whereupon consider by the Rule of Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Sun and Moons difference in motion, being 48 minutes in 36 degrees, what will it come to in ten minutes, or if 48 gives 360, consider what ten gives, and the fourth proportional number will be 75d. and so much is the distance of that place in <hi>India</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> and the longitude of <hi>London</hi> being subtracted from that number 20 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and 55 Remainder again subtracted from 360, what remains produces the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude to be 305. Some other ways are laid down to prove a knowledge of the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:64961:113"/>
but the whole matter being in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the dark, these may suffice for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.</p>
               <p>But in plain or circular Sailing, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass is very much heeded, but sometimes there may be mistakes by the variation of the Needle, which you may Rectifie by the Globe, in this manner; let the Suns place be brought to the East side of the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and observe the Circle of Winds, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Suns place you have the point of the Compass, whereon it riseth, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to take notice upon what point it rises or sets, observe then the difference happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Globe, and by the Compass, and if there be any, that is the Variation, for which Variation, allowing that the Needle will ever shew the <hi>Rumb,</hi> which is the true point of the Compass, as to the steering the Ship.</p>
               <p>If you would know how much way your Ship makes in such and such spaces of time, this you may observe by the Logline, or Minute Glass, and by the first so many knots as she runs in half a minute, so many Miles is she counted to Sail in an hour, or it may be done by hanging up a Bullet in a string, which will count the Minutes by its swing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for if the string be proportioned to 38½ Inches, it will swing about 60 times in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, but if longer not so many, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is left to your discretion, to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64961:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it as you make observation by the half minute glass, instead of which, this (for necessity) may serve turn.</p>
               <p>If you would find the Suns <hi>Amplitude,</hi> and thereby the variation of the Compass, observe, That as the Proportion of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine</hi> of the Latitude is to the <hi>Radius,</hi> the same you will find the sine of the declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that of the <hi>Amplitude,</hi> as, It<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being granted the Latitude of 31 degrees, 23 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, its <hi>Cosine,</hi> or <hi>Complement,</hi> is 38 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, 28 minutes, and the declination of the Sun 15 degrees, 10 minutes; the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude</hi> then will be found 24 degrees, 52 minutes North, by reason the declination is so. As for the <hi>Circumference</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass divided into 360 degrees, observe when the Sun rises and sets, how many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees it is from the direct point of the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude</hi> so much you will find the Needle va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the place.</p>
               <p>As for this kind of <hi>Navigation</hi> it is vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly proposed in three manner of ways, or Methods, especially, as relating to private Seamen as plain Sailing, <hi>Mereators</hi> way or Instruction of Sailing, and Sailing by an Arch or great Circle, called Circular Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The plain way of sailing is by a plain Chart, which is the most substantial, and that on which the other are grounded, and to those that sail near the Aequinoctial, they have little or no occasion for any other

way, as having their degrees of Latitude and Longitude equal, each degree divided in to 60 minutes, and each minute put for a Mile, yet somewhat exceed the <hi>English</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured miles, as containing about 6000 feet; but if you are to come far from the Aequinoctial, then though you may keep your Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in plain sailing, yet you will be at a loss for your Longitude, and therefore to be better informed, consider that as the <hi>Radius</hi> or whole sine of 90 degrees, is to 60 Miles, so you will find the <hi>Cosine</hi> of the latitude, is to the Miles contained in one degree of longitude in that latitude, so that in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of 60 degrees, 30 Miles make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as <hi>sine</hi> 90 degrees to 60 Miles 10000, so <hi>Cosine</hi> 60 degrees to 30 Miles 5000. and by this rule we find, that if your departure from the <hi>Meridian</hi> was 280 Miles, and they being divided by 60, reduced into degrees and minutes of longitude under the Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial, it yields 4 degrees and 4 minutes, but if these 280 Miles happen to be East or west, or your departure from the <hi>Meridian</hi> should be in the latitude of 60 degrees, where 30 Miles make a degree of longitude, then divide the 280 Miles by 30, and you will find it yields 9 degrees 10/30, or one third, which is 20 minutes for the difference of longitude in that latitude. To sail by <hi>Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> Chart, is little other than coming to a knowledge of the true latitudes, Meridians,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64961:115"/>
and Elevations of the Poles, Miles, minutes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as when it so fall out that one place is under the Aequinoctial, and the other near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er one of the Poles, then we find, the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dional minutes, answerable to that place, which hath latitude, is to be Accounted for the Meridional difference of latitude, or that latitude inlarged.</p>
               <p>Again, suppose both places are towards one of the Poles, thereupon subtract the Meridional minutes that are found answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the lesser latitude, and the remainer will be found to be the Meridional minutes required.</p>
               <p>Again, if we find one place to have <hi>North</hi> latitude, and the other be in <hi>South</hi> latitude, then add the Meridional minutes, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to either place together, and you will find the sum thereof to be the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal minutes required, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Circular sailing is held to be a very good way of sailing, as the best, shewing the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest way and distances between any two places, yet carrys with it some little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, so that the Seamen seldom keep to their course near this Arch, wherefore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you to consider of what has been said, I proceed to other useful matters.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Meridians</hi> have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly either of them their several ways, being equally distant from the <hi>Meridian Circle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Aequinoctials</hi> mentioned are those of which either have their several ways e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually distant from the <hi>Aequator,</hi> the one above and the other beneath the <hi>Horizon.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Irregular</hi> are either inclining, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining; the first of these is equally distant from any <hi>Vertical Circle,</hi> and from thence is often called <hi>Vertical,</hi> though declining from the <hi>Primary Vertical,</hi> properly so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and is of two sorts, there being one declining from the South to either East or West, and the other from the North to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther East or West.</p>
               <p>That which inclines falls away from the <hi>Vertical Point,</hi> having its inclination toward the <hi>Horizon,</hi> as not being equally distant from it.</p>
               <p>As for the hours which these several sorts
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64961:116"/>
of Dials, are to parcel out time unto, they are Reckoned as to the days they make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, according to the distant Latitudes, the Suns ascending or declining, yet all allow 24 hours to the day and night, dividing each hour into 60 minutes, and those into seconds parts, and smaller proportion of time, till it can be discerned only by imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The days are held in two distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the one natural, and the other Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, the Natural day is accounted 12 hours the Artificial as many as the Sun allows ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the longer or the lesser it shines.</p>
               <p>But to be an exact <hi>Horologian,</hi> observe these methods, be sure to have the exact E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation of the Pole, which to find, you are directed in the treatise of <hi>Navigation,</hi> for by that your determination of the <hi>Center</hi> of hours must be had also the stile of the Dial's <hi>Altitude,</hi> and the order of it, and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is requisite beside of that nature; you must likewise know the true <hi>Meridian</hi> line, that so the Dials-Meridian line may have its place directly under the Meridian of the place where it is posited. And he that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes this work, must be furnished with such Mathematical and Astronomical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments and Materials, as may give him a due understanding of the proportions of time, as a Rule, Compass, Astronomical Quadrant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> divided exactly into 90 degrees, with a description of the hour line &amp; points
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64961:117"/>
and to bring this Ingenious work to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you must be careful the figures of the hours are set at their proper and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable distance to answer the moving of the stiles shaddow, and that your stile be well contrived as to its Form and Altitude, and make your observation to fix it exactly; also be very careful in the Application and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Dial when it is finished.</p>
               <p>But to come to what is more curious, be sure the hours be described, and to do it there are granted to be two right lines sect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other at right <hi>Angles</hi> cross ways, one of them being the <hi>Meridian</hi> line, or the 12<hi>th</hi> hour line, the other is termed the <hi>Occult</hi> line, by which the first cross ways are cut to the right <hi>Angle,</hi> and this is generally called the line of hours, because in it the horary points are designed, but if we come to its more proper denomination, it may be called the Aequinoctial line, since it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents the Aequinoctial Circle, the chief rule of all hours.</p>
               <p>Thus much being explained as to Dial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in general, we come now to more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>If you are desirous to have a right <hi>Dial,</hi> you must be sure to know its right Center, or the Center of the hour, to do which, be very mindful of the Elevation of the Pole, especially in the <hi>Horizontal</hi> Dial, or any of that sort, for they will not declare the hours
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64961:117"/>
in any place, but under a certain Elevation, and therefore if they are removed far, you must be again proportioned to that Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Conjecture we then the Pole be Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 49 degrees in this Region, which is 41, place here the foot of your Compass in the Instruments Center, extending the other foot from that to the Aequinoctial line de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the instrument, where in that part the 41 degrees is cut by the <hi>Radius,</hi> so num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering from the 12th hour line, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this extension of the Compass upon the Dial, having yet the Compasses foot fixed in the Meridian, and Aequinoctial lines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and the other fix in the distant part of the Meridian line, determining, that point to be the hours Center, and so from thence, and each point in the Aequinoctial line, you are to draw all the lines, which some term, <hi>the Arches of hours.</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a line is to be drawn through the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the hours, a line Parallel to the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial, and this is to be accounted the line of the sixth hour, as well in the Evening as the morning, as likewise of the hours of 4 and 5 in the Evening, are to be drawn out beyond the Center of hours, for the like hours in the morning, and so of the rest, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually compeering; and thus you have an exact description of a <hi>Horizontal Dial,</hi> whose figure you may form as you please, placing the Characters of the hours at the end of the line.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:64961:118"/>If you design a <hi>Vertical Dial,</hi> it may be done upon a <hi>Regular</hi> wall, the same way as the former, yet there is some difference to be observed, not only in the Scituation, but likewise in the <hi>Vertical,</hi> in case of being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>Center</hi> of the hour, the <hi>Polar E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation</hi> degrees are to be here taken for the <hi>Altitude</hi> of the <hi>stile,</hi> allowing the degrees complement, though the <hi>Horizontal Dial</hi> is the contrary; however, there being a distinction between a <hi>Vertical</hi> to the <hi>North,</hi> and a <hi>Vertical</hi> to the <hi>South,</hi> the <hi>Vertical</hi> to the <hi>North</hi> is, as we may suppose, a <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Inverted, having the <hi>Center</hi> of hours downwards falling short, in shewing short, in shewing the hours, for in some Adjacent Countreys, it shews but from 4 to 8 in the morning, and the like in the afternoon, and the <hi>South Vertical</hi> hath the <hi>Center</hi> of hours and its <hi>stile</hi> upwards, shewing from the six in the morning to noon.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Meridional Dial</hi> either East or West, for the first, it must have a Line <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel</hi> drawn to the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and a slight <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> at any opening of the Compass, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the <hi>Horizontal</hi> line towards the right side where the <hi>Eastern Dial</hi> is to be drawn, conceiving in the Instrument such an Arch at the like opening of the Compass, in which Arch cut off the <hi>Elevation</hi> of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator,</hi> and carry the <hi>Interval</hi> to the <hi>Circle</hi> drawn from the point, and allow the Arch to be cut off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:64961:118"/>To frame an <hi>Aequinoctial Dial,</hi> two lines must be drawn at right <hi>Angles,</hi> whereof one is to be the <hi>Meridian,</hi> the other that of the hour, 6 morning and evening, and from the usual section of these lines, draw a Circle as you think fit to be divided into 24 pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable and equal parts, for in this kind of Dyaling, all the Intervals must be equal as to the hours.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Polar</hi> Dial goes <hi>Parallel</hi> to the <hi>Axis</hi> of the world, lying as it were in it, and is to be Elevated above the <hi>Horizontal Plain,</hi> the same degrees as the worlds pole, the lowermost part in many places, containing not above 4 hours, yet generally the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hours are 4 and 5, towards the left side the Evening hours 7 and 8, but the topmost shews the hours from 7 in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to 5 in the Evening, but not the sixth by reason the Sun then is parallel to the Dial glancing then upon its side.</p>
               <p>A Dial of <hi>Irregular Declination</hi> may be best managed by the <hi>Marriners</hi> Compass, and applying the <hi>Semi-Circle</hi> divided in the Plan to a competent number of degrees, the pin or stile placed at its Center, so that in that <hi>Meridional</hi> hour, you will perceive the degree the shaddow cuts, and the way it casts, by the which you may the better determine the species, and how it declines; by which observation, you may draw a Dial in any place, fixing your stile of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:64961:119"/>
what <hi>Magnitude</hi> you please at right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles.</p>
               <p>If you are desirous to find by the shining of the Moon, the hour of the night upon a Dial, suppose you have a <hi>Horizontal</hi> Sun-Dial, movable or fixed, joyn to it a Dial, by some called a Moon Dial, made up of two <hi>Concentrick Circles,</hi> where in one you will meet with the day of the Moons Age, by applying a <hi>Globule</hi> to the number 30, in the other, the 12 hours diversly set down; then knowing the Moons Age, so place your Sun-dial, that the Moon may fairly shine on it, and being placed as for the day, see what hour the Moon shaddows on, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the 8, then place the <hi>Globule,</hi> the hour you find set down in the <hi>Horary Circle,</hi> and then again having recourse to the Moons Age, it will give you the hour required, as suppose it be the 12 of the Moons Age, you will find the shaddow about 5 and a half, which is the time, if (as it frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens) the Moon Dial be composed of 3 <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical Circles,</hi> whereof the last and greatest be that of the Moons day, the next to it the hour Circle, and the inmost the <hi>Index</hi>; let the Index be applyed to the day of the Moon, and then by that Circle, observe what hour, or part of an hour the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow marks, and you will find the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64961:120"/>
Measure into such measure as is Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and Usual, for by an Act of the 23 of <hi>Edward</hi> the I. an Acre of Land was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 160 Perches or Poles to be made out square, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by Custom in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Kingdom, this has been altered by the varying of Perches in the number of feet, as, 18, 20, 24, and sometimes 28 foot to the Perch, and this requires the Surveyers diligence to reconcile the one to the other, of which we shall give some insight.</p>
               <p>Suppose you are to Reduce 5 Acres, 2 Roods, 20 Perches measured Statute mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by 18 foot the Perch, in this case seek the least proportional terms between 18 and 16 foot and a ½, and to effect it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the latter carries with it a fraction, reduce it into halves, and that they may be of one denomination, let the 18 foot be likewise halved, and you will find them in this manner 33/36, which you must abbrevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate by 3, in saying, how many times 3 shall I find in 33, and the Answer will be 11 times 3, and the same do by 36, and you will find it 12 times 3, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the two proportional terms between 16½ and 18, will appear to be 11 and 12 which being done, reduce the Given Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of 5 Acres, 2 Roods, and 20 Perches all into Perches, by which means you will find them to be 900 Perches; then observe what is the Proportion, the Square 11,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64961:120"/>
which is found 121, bears to the square 12, which is found 144, the same does the Acre containing 16 and a half feet to the Perch, bear to that that contains 18 feet to the Perch or Pole.</p>
               <p>Always observe, in this was particularly that the greater measure is to be reduced into the lesser, then multiply the Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Given, <hi>viz.</hi> 900 Perches by 144 the larger square, and you will find the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to be 129600, and that divided by 121, you will find the Quotient to be 1071 Perches, and 9/121 parts, which reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Acres, gives us 6 Acres, 2 Roods, and 31 Perches, and 9/121 parts of a Perch, and this compeers with the Quantity of Acres <hi>Parallel</hi> with Statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e measure; but on the other hand, if it had been required for the reducing Statute Measure into Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Measure, you must then Multiply 900 perches, your given measure or quantity, by 121, which is the lesser square, because the lesser is to be reduced into the greater, and you will find the Product to be 108900, which if you divide by the greater square 144, you will have the <hi>Quotient</hi> 756 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:64961:121"/>If in this Mensuration, you are required to reduce Perches into Acres, and so on the contrary, observe that by the Afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Statute, an Acre of Ground should contain 169 square perches or poles, being every Rood 4 square perches, so that if you find any number of perches, that must be done into Acres, the given number must consequently be divided by 160, and the Acres are shewed by the Quotient, but if there be remainder, and it be under 40, they are perches, but if they are found to exceed 40, divide by 40, which you will find to be the number of perches contained in a Rood, so that the Quotient will be Roods, and the Remainder Perches.</p>
               <p>But to reduce Acres into Perches, there is no great difficulty, considering it is but turning it as it were backward, for in the other to bring Perches into Acres, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision was by 160, but in this case, to turn Acres into Perches, it must be multiplied by 160, which being observed, we come now to more nearer particulars, as to the matter in hand. If the piece of ground you measure be square, having considered well that the Acre is 160 Perches, then multiply one of the sides by the other joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, &amp; you will find the sum is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by 160, and suppose your Ground be 40 poles one way and but 20 another, these multiplyed, make 800 Poles or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64961:121"/>
which divided by 160, shews 5 Acres to be the content.</p>
               <p>In measuring a Triangular piece of Ground, you must first observe to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the longest side of the Triangle, as also the Perpendicular opposed to the said long side, then multiplying the half of one by the whole of the other, you must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide by 160.</p>
               <p>Suppose the side be 60, the Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar 40; 60 must be multiply'd by 20, or 40 by 30, which so done, make 1200, which being divided by 160, renders 7 Acres and ½ for the true content.</p>
               <p>If you are to measure that which we call a Trapezia, or a double Triangle, then both the Perpendiculars must be multiply'd by the Diagonal Line, as being the usual or common Base of both the Triangles, and must be divided by 160 in this manner. Let the Diagonal Line be 40, and one of the Perpendiculars 15, the other 8, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put together make 23, which being multiplyed by 20, which is half the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal Line, make 460, and that divided by 160, renders two Acres, three Roods, and 20 Poles.</p>
               <p>If the Ground be Circular, then half the Diameter must be multiplyed by half the Circumference, and the product divided by 160, whereby the Diameter of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle being found to be 140 poles, the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

is 440 poles, and the half of these two producing 220, and 70, they are to be multiplyed together, and then produce 15400 Perches, which being divided by 160 produce 96 Acres and a ¼.</p>
               <p>If the piece of Ground given, be Oval, suppose it to be 30 Perches one way, and 40 the other, to know the content, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply the length 40 by the bredth, which as aforesaid is 30, and you will find it make 1200, which again divided by 203 7/101, and you will find it yield 5 Acres, 3 Roods, and 23 Perches, and by this last number so working, you may find the number of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres contained, in a Semicircle, a quarter or sixth part, or any section or division of a Circle greater or lesser, multiplying the half Diameter.</p>
               <p>If you are to measure wood Land, which is the difficultest of all, you may fix a mark at either corner of the Wood, that 3 marks may be seen at once, then having a Quadrant in your hand, lay it flat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and take sight to two of the marks on each side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then upon paper, mark the degrees of the Angle, and measure to the two marks in sight, and place them on the same paper by your line of equal parts, and do so to all other corners, till you have closed up the Plat or Wood, which then may be easily brought into Acres by the line of equal parts. And Note here, if your
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64961:122"/>
Quadrant be too small, you may joyn two together, or do it by a board for want of a plain Table, so your Plat upon the paper make 3 Triangles, and to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure one of them, measure for one Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle the longest doted line, by half the middle doted line, or Perpendicular, which gives the content, and by so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the other two Triangles you have compleated it.</p>

               <head>The Art and Mystery of <hi>Gauging Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi> of Sundry Forms and Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by Exact Rules laid down plain and easie: Also to <hi>Gauge</hi> and know the Burthen of any Ship, and other matters.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>GAuging</hi> is very necessary to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by all People that deal in Commodities, wherein <hi>Casks,</hi> or the like, give the Dimensions of their Measure; wherefore, for their better Instruction in this Art, there are two things principally to be considered: First, That seeing Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels are mostly of Irregular Forms, it must be the care of the <hi>Gauger,</hi> to consider how they are to be reduced to Regular Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and, in the Second place, to inform himself, of the true content of the Gallon in Cubick Inches, or parts of a Foot; and for the first of these, carefully Measure the Diameter of the Cask at the Bung and Head, and, by those Diameters, to find out the Area of their Circle, and so take 2 thirds of the Area at the Bung, and 1 third at the Head, which, being added, will be found to be the mean Area of the Cask; and if you multiply that Area by the length of the Vessel, it will shew how many solid Inches are contained in that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64961:123"/>
Vessel, which being divided by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Cubick Inches in one Gallon, the Quotient will demonstrate what number of Gallons the Cask holds.</p>
               <p>As, if we suppose that a Vessel of Wine be 18 inches Diameter at the head, and 32 Inches at the Bung, the length being 40 Inches, if you would be satisfied in the content, consider, that one third of Area at the head, is found to make in its due proportion— 85, 823</p>
               <p>And two thirds of the Area of the Bung, make— 536, 166</p>
               <p>And then consider the sum of the two, to be — 620, 909</p>
               <p>When Multiply'd by the length —40. — 959</p>
               <p>Makes Inches solid — 24839, 560.</p>
               <p>These being divided by the solid Inches in one gallon of Wine, they being 231 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for the content, yield 170 Gallons, 530 parts, which is some small matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove half a Gallon, yet some raise a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute about the certain number of Inches in a Gallon, yet the Wine Gallon is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concluded to consist of 231 Cubick, or solid Inches, and the Ale Gallon is held by many in Computation with the Wine Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, as 4 to 5, so that in such a degree of difference, it must be 288 ½ Inches, but upon the imposition of Excise, it has been
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64961:124"/>
generally Esteemed but 282 Cubick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>If you would know the content of any Wine or Beer in Ale or Beer Gallons, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve for the Beer Barrel.</p>
               <p>The diameter at the head 9 inches, 9 parts For the diameter at the Bung, 23 inch, 0 parts</p>
               <p>The length —27 inches, 4 parts</p>
               <p>The Kilderkin has for its measurings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>diameter</hi> at the head. 16 inches, 1 part</p>
               <p>Its <hi>diameter</hi> at the Bung, 18 inch. 6 parts</p>
               <p>The Length — 12 inches, 1 part</p>
               <p>And these are called the Coopers scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and very well agree with the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved quantity of the Ale Gallon, allowing it to be 288 Inches and a half, so that the Barrel this was reckoned to be a Pint over 36 Gallons, and a Kilderkin a Pint and a half over the half of that, though as I have said, this Gallon has lately been agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a Committee of Excise, to hold no more than 282 Cubick inches.</p>
               <p>Now to measure Brewers Vessels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether they be Square or Round, or of any other form; First, to know their true Content, observe what has been said in Measuring such Bodies, dividing by 282 the inches in one Gallon, demonstrates the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in Gallons, and if you divide the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64961:124"/>
by 36, the contents in Barrels are shewed, and so by knowing the true num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Inches, any measure is to be taken.</p>
               <p>If you would know the Burthen of a Ship, or how many Tun she will hold, or Commodiously carry: First, inform your self by measure of the length of the Keel, and take the breadth at the Mid-ship beam, and the depth of the Hold, and these three you must multiply one by the other, then the product thereof must be divided by 100, and so the Tuns of Burthen will be plainly demonstrated.</p>
               <p>As, granting the length of a Ships Keel to be 50 Foot, and at the Middle-beam her breadth 20, and the depth in the hold ten foot, then to know how many Tuns she will carry, let 50 be multiplied by 20, and it makes 1000, and that again multiplyed by 10, makes 10000, the which, when divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by 100, and cutting of the two last Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, it shews the Ship to be 100 Tuns of Burthen; but this way is usually attributed to <hi>Men of War,</hi> but for <hi>Merchant Ships,</hi> they give no Allowance for Masts, Sails, Ordnance, and Anchors, the which, though they are a Burthen, yet are not accounted Tunnage; wherefore, as to <hi>Merchant Ships,</hi> your product must be divided by 95, and then a Merchant Ship, of the aforesaid length, breadth, and depth, will be found 105 Tuns 25/95 parts Burthen, though there
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64961:125"/>
must be regard had in this case, to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Ship, for fear of Erring, and if you are doubtful whether you are right or not, if the Ship be Irregularly built, find out how many Cubick Feet it contains, and Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning that a Cubick Foot of water, weighs, as it is generally accounted, 55 <hi>Averdupois,</hi> or 16 ounces to the pound, so that consider 2000 weight being allowed to the Tun, and every hundred 112 <abbr>lb.</abbr> the Dimensions must be taken accordingly, and by this Rule you must take your proportion: But to come sure of this another way;</p>
               <p>Measure on the out side the Ship to her Lightmark, when she is in the Water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laden, and there you will find the weight or content of the Empty Vessel, so that if you take your measure from her Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark to her full draught of Water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laden, you have the true Burthen of her Tunnage. Also, if you're desirous to know the Burthen of another Ship dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or treble of the same Mould, or a greater or lesser proportion, multiply the measure of the Length, and Breadth, and Depth Cubically, after that is done, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or treble the Cube, and Extracting the Cube Root, your work is done, and so you may go on to other matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or any other belonging to <hi>Gauging,</hi> which your Rules and Instruments of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection will furnish you, in your proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

               <p>
                  <hi>FOrtification</hi> is of great moment, and in the well observing and Regular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it for defence and offence, many times consists the Safety of Countries and Kingdoms, howev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r the Scituation and Circumstances require much Variation, so that to prescribe the Models of all Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would be Endless, and therefore it will be most convenient to treat of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, or those most generally in use.</p>
               <p>Observe then of this kind, your works require to be Flanked to keep the Enemy from a sudden Entrance, where any Breach is made by the great Guns, for if the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegers have made their approaches so near, that the Besiegeds Cannon in the Front are dismounted, then you may be assured their design is to put their Miners to pass the Ditch, and then if they perceive any place out of sight of the Besiegeds firing, they will have an opportunity to make their
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64961:126"/>
Mines with little difficulty, so that a place unless the Garrison be very Large to make frequent Sallys, may be taken in 8 or 10 days, that with Flankers might hold out much Longer, so that it has been the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of late to turn the Antient Round Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions into sharp pointed ones, which not only upon occasion serve for Flankers to defend against any hasty approach, but to slaunt and hinder the force of the great Shot playing against the Town or Fort.</p>
               <p>Amongst other things necessary on this occasion, the great Line of defence is to be considered, or what may be found near E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual into it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Polygon Interiour,</hi> which ought not in mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> cases to exceed 120 Fathoms, or 720 Feet, and this is found to be a point blank of the Execution of a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, the Cannon being here Incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and therefore the defence is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the former, the latter beside the waste of Ammunition, lying much lyable to be dismounted, and not so easily again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, as the Emergency requires, and the difficulty is likewise greater in maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a continual Fire, and if the work be not incommoded by their over largeness, the more Capacious, the Gorges and Flanks are, the better will the Fortification be found for defence, for then the Soldiers may pass to and fro in a good front to the Bastion, when Cannon is planted on both
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64961:126"/>
sides the Flank, and give no interruption to those that are at the Flanks, and if there be but a supposed necessity required, there must be a vacancy left for Retrenchments, and a place under the Bastions left fit for Mining, that if it come to extremity when you have drawn off as soon as the Enemy has possessed the Bastion, it may be blown up, &amp; their Attacque cleared till the Besieged may know what is further to be done in the defence of the place, and draw their strengths from other parts thitherwards.</p>
               <p>Above all, the Curtain Flanks and Faces of the opposite Bastion are to be well secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and guarded, as likewise the Ditch and Counterscarp being made as large as the due proportion of the Bastion will allow, for if they be too great, their Capitals will be found too long, and thereupon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence Line exceed the Port of any Musquet, or small piece— and being too little they will become blunt, and so cut off the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Flank, whilst it ought to be held con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.</p>
               <p>The degrees of the Angle of a Bastion, ought not to be less than 60, or more than 90, some small matter allowed over or under; and the reason is, if it be much under 60, it will be found too slender, or above 90 too large, or more than may be well sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; and moreover, by that the second Flank is shortned, and it will be computed
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64961:127"/>
in less Ground than the Bastion, where it is an Angle of less degrees, though built on the like Gorge and Flanks, and observe in all your works to let them be Cannon proof.</p>
               <p>If we proceed to a description of <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Fortification,</hi> it is to be understood of such <hi>Models</hi> as are equally <hi>Angular,</hi> and founded upon <hi>Equilateral Figures,</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in a Circle, as it may be a <hi>Triangle, Quadrangle,</hi> or a <hi>Quartil Pentagon,</hi> or a Figure of 5 sides to a <hi>Dodecagon,</hi> or a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of 12 sides, and in this case the Basti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be so posited, that all the points may answer in like distance from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre. The Curtains of Equal Length, and all the Angles and Lines to be of an equal Magnitude for <hi>Regular Models</hi> are to be computed from a Calculation of the Angle at the Centre, and that is done by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding 360, the number of the degrees that a Circle is usually divided into, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Regular Figure is to be described by the number of any Polygons sides, or the Regular Figure, that any Fort or Work of War of this nature is to consist on, for hereby the Quotient demonstrates the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of the Centre, as may be demonstrated by a Figure of five sides, wherein by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, the Angle of the Center is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be 72 degrees, and the like of any other figure, then if you draw a Circle with
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64961:127"/>
the Protractor, or Line of Chords, the first being a Semi circle, and the last the fourth part of a Semi-circle, or 90 degrees projected on a straight line, and the Angle beset off at the Center at 72 degrees, the Circle will thereby be divided into 5 equal proportions, or parts, and the straight line drawn to the points, produces a Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone. Besides this <hi>Model of Fortification,</hi> there are sundry Outworks required for strengthening a place, they hinder much the Besiegers from making their Lodgments if the ground happen to be low near the Counterscarp, or from suddeinly raising Batteries by the advantage of that ground, if it happen to be high; wherefore a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Enginier always provides Outworks to hinder it, and prolong the approaches to the main Fort, and these Outworks are various as the Situation of the place, or the danger requires.</p>
               <p>Ravelins, being an usual Outwork, they are usually of two kinds, one with lines, and the other wanting; the first of these are placed before long Curtains, where the two Bastions are not capable of Flanking each other within Musquet shot, and the length of the Curtain not sufficient for the erecting a Plate Bastion in its Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and supply the defect of a Bastion by covering and defending, and to erect these kind, the Ditch must be cut parallel with
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64961:128"/>
the Curtain, and above it erect a Capital from 18 to 20 Poles, and let your <hi>Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorges</hi> be no more than from 10 to 12 Poles the Flanks, from 8 to 10, the Ditch sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding them, and the greatness of the Flanks Parallel to the face of the Ravelin till the ditch of the place of the face of the Bastion be met by it, that so the Ravelins Flanks may scowr over all the ditch that faces the Bastion.</p>
               <p>The Ravelins without lines, consist only of a Capital and two faces, the Capitals from 12 to 18 Poles the face, edging or drawing nearer to the shoulders of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, that within the Ravelin may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Curtain and two Flanks.</p>
               <p>The half Moon is a work ever raised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bastions point, being so named from the lowness of its Gorges Cavity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is to secure the two faces of the Bastion, but when the faces have but a weak defence from the <hi>Ravelin,</hi> these works are soon made useless, or ruined, and give the Besieged an opportunity of Lodgment, &amp; may serve for Batteries and Flanks against the opposing Bastions, however, they may be retrenched by Traverses, yet they will not fail to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque entirely in the face, or where you have your last retrenchment, also, that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Counterguard</hi> runs the like hazard.</p>
               <p>The Outworks, called the <hi>Hornworks,</hi> are placed before the <hi>Curtains,</hi> a <hi>Perpendicular
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64961:128"/>
Line</hi> being drawn from it at the two Flanks about 60 pole front, towards the <hi>Campaign,</hi> their front to be 36 Poles, equal to the <hi>Curtain,</hi> to be divided into 3 Parts, one of them for the <hi>Curtain,</hi> and the other for the <hi>Demigorges,</hi> appertaining to the <hi>Hornwork,</hi> as for the Flanks, they are to be six Rods, or 72 foot each, and this work is held one of the best and strongest Outworks, if well manned and managed, especially when a Ravelin is placed before it.</p>
               <p>The Outworks called the <hi>Tenalis,</hi> is built to secure the Bridge when it is hard pressed upon their sides, containing 50 Poles, and the Fronts no more than 36, which being divided into 4 equal parts, a Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is drawn in the middle, whereon a 1/9 of the front is set off inwards towards the Town, and the Lines must be drawn from the sides, to form the face; this work is advantageous for <hi>Counter Approaches,</hi> and for receiving succours into the Town.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Crownwork</hi> is usually erected, a when heighth is so near to the place, that a <hi>Musquet</hi> shot may reach it, and then the sides of the works must be extended before the Bastion, or <hi>Curtain</hi> about 65 Poles, &amp; the <hi>Demibastions</hi> point to be about 60 degrees, then the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the sides must be joyned, and a <hi>Perpendicular Line</hi> raised on the middle, on which six, for the <hi>Capital,</hi> 18 Rods, making an Angle of two Interiour Polygons.</p>
