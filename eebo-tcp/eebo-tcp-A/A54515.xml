            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>For the beginning &amp; undertaking of this great work it will be good that some able men (as Fathers) to lay the foundation, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welfare doe put in a summe of money to raise a Stock, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same to buy a piece of land whereupon the Husbandman, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Craftsmen, Tradesmen, Marriners, and others [comming in with their moveables as Cattell, Money, or any other Commodityes] may be secured.</p>

                  <p>If any will out of a free reall and bountifull heart bring in any thing to increase the Stock it shall be used for the common benefit, without being appropriated for any mans own in particular.</p>

                  <p>For the well ordering of our businesse we shall have need of two great houses one in [or about the] Citty <hi>viz.</hi> a Warehouse for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants or Tradesmen, another in the Countrey near a River for the Husbandman, Handy Crafts people, Schoolmasters and Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                  <p>The house in the Citty so big that 20, or 30. families may dwell in it, having shopps of severall wares, as Cloth, sayes, linnen, men and womens apparrell, Stockings, shoes, Hatts, and other usefull and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary thinges, being the foundation of the whole work, not onely by reason of the proffit that comes by Trading, but also because all Handy-Grafts, belonging thereunto depend thereon.</p>
                  <p>Our trade will for three sufficient reasons undoubtedly increase, the first is that there will not be overasking in price, but all will be sold at the lowest rate in a word, contrary to the Common custome of the world.</p>
                  <p>The second is, that we dwelling at a cheaper Rent and living less costly, can make all things better at the price.</p>
                  <p>The third is, that the profit is made use of for the common-good, as well for the honest people of one, as of another sect.</p>
                  <p>At the first we may bring into our Scociety, (besides a beginning of several Merchandizes) for the most part unmarried persons, that with laying out little money may presently be on the getting hand, as Cloth, Linnen and Saye-Weavers, Taylors, Shoo-makers and the like. Secondly, Barber-Chyrurgeans, Physitians, and Masters of severall Arts and Sciences; one that can write extraordinary well, another that understands Arithmetick, Geometry, Astronomy, Navigation, Italian book-keeping, or Merchants Accompts. Thirdly, some for Latin, Greek, Hebrew and other Languages, as also Physick, Musick, and other usefull things, referring all to a good and spirituall end.</p>

Our Chyrurgeans or Physitians shall serve the Rich (without the Scociety) for money, and the poor gratis; some going abroad to visit Patients, and others staying at home (at certain times,) to speak with people, that come to them, to shew that they do highly esteem of the life and health of others, as of their own; this will give an increase to our Trading for the common good, the fame thereof being noised round about, and the more when people are sensible that we sell all things at a reasonable rate without deceiving any.</p>

                  <p>There shall be built a great meeting place, not onely for our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or Society, but also for all rationall men, round about with seates, rising one higher than another, that every one may be seen; having before them convenient leaning places, to read, and write upon; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soe one desk on one side, or end, to read the holy Scripture, at a set time, giving liberty (after that reading) to every one to propound somewhat for mutuall edification, none being tyed (unless himself think fit) to anothers matter to follow, or gain-say it.</p>
                  <p>For in spirituall things, we acknowledg none but Christ for head and Master; Who of old hath appoynted in his Church Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers, these having through the spirit of God, (which led them into all truth) brought forth (and left behind them) the writings of the new Testament, we own for Embassadors, and their wordes (without any interpretations of men) for our rule and Plummet, keeping in remembrance when we meet together, that we must allow that liberty of speaking, to others, which we desire our selves, without tying any one to our opinion, maintaining a firm friendship with such, who have renounced all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable thinges contrary to Scripture: without stumbling at any differences, which do not hinder love and piety: For our Children without doubt, will be of differing opinions, and yet no reason, when they do not hinder the common welfare; to exclude them from our Society. It ought also to be considered that the most differences (dwelling together) by time, and liberty of speaking, will cease to bee. The more, because with us, noe loss will be suffered, by the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of our opinion; for the most part of the differences (in spirituall and worldly matters) arise from a consideration of a wordly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which if in the world abroad as in our Society were taken away, evill and false opinions would soon fall to the ground, but the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being Spirituall Captaines, would rather (as to the generallity) for there own profit have Wairs than peace in Christendome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they having made an incurable rent, do set people one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which makes it appear that by nature the people are not at so great a distance, as they now appear to be, contrary to this we intend,

                  <p>But the more divine this state of friendship is, the seldomer it is seen amongst us, and the more is Sathan that enemie of mankind against it; who knows full well, that he hath not so much right or power to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with this holy fire, and the matter which maintaineth it, as he hath, where either recreation or advantage is only looked after, which kind of friendship he useth with very little trouble to dissolve; but in this way of amity God only is the bond, wherewith they are tyed together without being lyable to be unloosed, and upon which foundation being fixed, they resolve to withstand all aslault<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If then there be any felicity in the life of man, or any efficacious remedy to prevent his future miserie: I conceive nothing was ever more solacing or reviving and coming nearer to the divine nature than love, <hi>viz.</hi> true love, which doth so communicate it self in and to that wherewith it reciprocates, that it seems to have exchanged therewith, and made over thereto, whatsoever it did possess before, so that amongst true friends there is such an agreement, that no secret, no joy, no profit, nor any cross or affliction is undivided, but whatsoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides either of them, is no otherwise than if it were the change of one

alone, so that death it self can scarce seperate soules, so totally united, certainly the Heathens, who in all thinges pursued that which they esteemed best, found nothing more excellent, and delightfull then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect freindship.</p>
                  <p>But how far doth Christ excell all others in love, who by his Doctrine and example, hath instituted a partnership or Society of mutuall love; by the denomination of Brethren; Abollishing amongst his disciples, all preheminency, or domineering, of one, over another, requiring that the gifts, and meanes of subsistance in the world, (for necessity and delight) should be Common; having called his people to a moderation, and to a life suitable to pure nature, so that all Christendome ought to be meerly, a certain great fraternity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of such as (having denyed the world and their own lustes) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire together in Christ, the sole head and spring of love; doing well to one another, and for his sake distribute their goodes to those that stand in need.</p>
                  <p>Oh that we had this perfection? and were answerable to the end of our Creation; certainly there would not be such going to law; such intrenching and incroaching of the boundes of landes, such hiding, and close locking up of money, nor would there be such scraping together of superfluous estates.</p>
                  <p>Oh totall summ and highest pitch of all good? if any may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and that in due time to this divine favour for even many decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit aged persons do seldome attain to this; to be desirous to live after such a manner: Emperours, Kinges, Princes, &amp;c. having spent all their yeares, all their strenght of body and soul, have little or no time left them, to serve a better master, than the world, and therefore if God do joyn some such together as endeavour after a life more regular then their former, each of them being at a losse for a Companion to better and promote his resolution, one to whom he may communicate his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, a freindly reprover of his Errors, a reclaimer of him from the worldes alurements, a comforter in adversity, a moderator of Ioy in prosperity, and in all respects a sharer in that which God hath libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally given; and last of all one ready for all cases and conditions that may happen I say and judge, that these are the happiest of all persons that ever were upon the Earth. For as no painfuller or miserabler thing can be thought on, than that life which a man lives according to the course of this world, so nothing is more acceptable and lovely


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53903:13"/>
in the universe, then that harmony and concord, which hath its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from God, and influence upon the man, that is joyned with his fellow man, so agreeable to his mind; which certainly can be found, no where but there onely where a firm love, agreement and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning will in well doing, as also a liberall distribution and imparting, of all created thinges is entertained.</p>
                  <p>It is evident, that the most wise God, would honour the sacred socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Matrimony, with the utmost perfection of this so great love; since they that are so joyned together and built upon the right founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have not onely their Goodes, but also their joyes and griefes, common; And cannot be severed, by any kind of reproaches, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious endeavours of the envious.</p>
                  <p>The world hath her delights in different degrees of Dignities, States, Titles, and offices; exalting themselves one above another; But Christ on the contrary will that every one shall perform his office as a member of one and the same body, In which no one exalteth it self, nor accounteth it self worthier than other, the eye is not puffed up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it sees; the foot is not grieved that it sees not: If any member in the body be blemished it is carefully covered by the other, if any be weak it is dilligently provided for by the rest, whereas on the contrary Every one in the world, which by his office or Title is differenced, from others Conceives he is quite another thing and in himself better than others and must be reputed, for one that is set together and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, of some finer substance, and designed to a sweeter life, yea to an higher place in heaven then others.</p>
                  <p>Now if you do but divest and strip the world of her Riches, Honours, and State; how naked, and refully forlorn will she remain, and how far different will she be found from that she seems to bee; and then it will be easy to beleave, that she is shored up by nothing ells but wormeten propps, which if they were once pulled away they would be fitted and made free for the imitation of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Do but see oh man! what kind of thinges they are, which do shut the door against true love; and hinder communion or fellowship with Christ <hi>viz.</hi> Nugatory, frivelous thinges and trifles which onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in avain esteem and opinion, which some of the very Heathens who saw a little further than others, did oftentimes laugh at.</p>

                  <head>A Letter written in order to the now mentioned Society or little Common-wealth; By some well affected persons, whose hearts and hands have already joyned therein: to stir up all such who are truely sensible of the poor and needy, to carry on this so necessary and charitable a work.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>HAving not only considered the poverty, afflictions and streights of many well minded people; Together with the evil consequences that arise from the corrupt customs and waies of most employments, and the general disorder proceeding from riches and poverty: But also the way propounded by the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of our friend</hi> Peter Cornelius; <hi>to rectifie all such and many other inconveniences, by bringing together a fit, suitable and well qualified people into one Houshold government or little Common-wealth, wherein every one may keep his propriety, and be employed in some work or other as he shall be fit, without being oppressed, as is more at large expressed in a Platform to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Whereupon we are resolved, judgeing it to be necessary, and our duty to promote so good and pious a work, with the assistance of other mercifull and rational men, to lay such a foundation, as may tend to the relief of the oppressed, the preserving of such as are in danger of falling into snares, and the increase of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and mutuall love, as also the exemplary ordering
