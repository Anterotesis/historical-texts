            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

may perchance
(conſidering the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of it) be thought
a Poem too ſad and
balefull to bee read with pleaſure,
<pb facs="tcp:22963:3"/>
or preſented with delight vpon any
Stage. I confeſſe the ſaddneſſe of it;
but if it ſuffer for that, it will raiſe a
queſtion more general; Why trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
haue at any time bin allowed?
Why the ruines and calamities of
ſome men haue beene repreſented
as a delightſome paſtime to other
men? Why thoſe ancient witts,
whom <hi>Greece</hi> in her learned'ſt times
did highly admire, haue choſen for
their deathleſſe Poems almoſt no
other arguments then thoſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
ſtoryes of <hi>Thebes, Mycenae,
Troy,</hi> and, moſt of all, this very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the fatall and inceſtuous
family of <hi>Oedipus?</hi> where almoſt
<pb facs="tcp:22963:3"/>
all the paſſages are ſo farre (a man
would thinke) from delighting
men, that they might mooue
a ſuffering euen in the furyes
themſelues? and why the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Princes, both <hi>Graecian</hi> and
<hi>Roman,</hi> in their higheſt iollity haue
not onely beheld with delight the
preſentation of them: but for their
owne excerciſe (as many of them
as haue had the itch of writing)
haue choſen theſe arguments, and
made them into Tragedyes? VVhy
this hath been generally ſo (though
the cauſe neede no Apology, at leaſt
not mine) I will venture ſome few
coniectures. All the ſpectatours are
<pb facs="tcp:22963:4"/>
either wretched or fortunate; the
wretched in ſad ſtoryes are in ſome
ſort eaſed by fellowſhip in woe, or
delighted with tragicall expreſsions,
as being ſomewhat of kindred with
their owne thoughts; thoſe that are
fortunate, are affected, in ſuch
ſhowes, either with delight, or whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſorrow; if they be delighted, it
is in the taſt of their own proſperity,
which appeares greater, ſet off by an
obiect of ſuch contrariety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
is not out of malice (as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with the woes of others) but
acknowledgement to thoſe high
powers which made the difference;
if they be ſorrowfull, their ſorrow is
<pb facs="tcp:22963:4"/>
wholſome; for as in melancholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
merry tales are vſed to aſsiſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
ſo in too great a ioy, &amp; wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the ſoule, ſuch ſad repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are as a good allay, depreſsing
the leuity of their thoughts to ſuch a
meane, as is fit to entertaine the beſt
contemplations. Moreouer Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
(beſides the ſtate of them) are
pleaſing in the expreſsion, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as ſaddneſſe doth vſually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
the beſt ſtraines of writing: to
omit other inſtances, loue it ſelfe
(the vſuall argument of our new
Comedy) is there beſt written,
where it is moſt diſtreſſed, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing
paſſion; that part of the

did it not more truſt ot your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
