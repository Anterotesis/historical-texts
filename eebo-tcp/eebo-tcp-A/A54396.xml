         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N obdedience to the
charge which you
have beene pleaſed
to lay upon me. I
have tranſlated this
admirable ſtory, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be knowne of
all men, and of ſingular uſe to convince
the Atheiſts and halfe believers of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:108154:5"/>
times: Moſt of which will perſwade
themſelves that there is no ſuch thing
in the world as any ſpirituall, immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall,
intelligent ſubſtance; And ſome
of them will ſay that which moſt of them
thinke: That if they could have any
certainty that there are Devills, they
would believe alſo that there is a God.
And Satan to confirme theſe pretenders
to the title of ſtrong wits in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
unbeliefe, will ſcarce once in an
age diſcover himſelfe in any viſible
or audible manner, but either to the
rudeſt poore people and the moſt beſtial
natures in ſome remote barren heath,
or if he converſe with Magicians, whoſe
wit is of a forme ſomewhat higher, it is
onely in ſecret conference; that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
of the firſt ſort may be aſcribed
to the fumes of groſſe and terreſtriall
melancholy, as the onely Devill that
frameth meetings and dances of witches
in their braines; and that the profeſſion
<pb facs="tcp:108154:5"/>
of the other ſort may be imputed to
the impoſture of wicked men, ſuch as
all Magicians are. Likewiſe when
they are told of perſons poſſeſt or obſeſt
with Devils they aſcribe thoſe diſorders
to ſickneſſe or juggling. And the truth is
that the Devill doth moſt harme where
he is leaſt ſeene, heard, and ſuſpected.
Wherefore I verily beleive that he hath
not in many ages done more wrong to
his kingdome, then in diſcloſing himſelfe
ſo plainely and ſenſibly as he did in the
paſſages here related: for thereby he hath
left no ſhift for the unbeliefe of reaſoning
Atheiſts. And though this was a witty
Devill, yet (in that reſpect) he was not
well read in the Politiques of Hell.
Many relations are extant of manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Daemons: the moſt certaine are in
the hiſtory of the Goſpell, how the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
ſpake alowd out of poſſeſſed bodies
in the preſence of great multitudes,
which they did conſtrained and frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:108154:6"/>
by the preſence of the Lord of life,
their Soveraine and their Judge. But
no hiſtory either ſacred or profane an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
or moderne relateth ſuch a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
publique, continued, and undeniable
manifeſtation of the wicked Spirit as
this doeth. For this familiar converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Devill was not with Magicians
and witches but with godly men: And
it was not in a corner, or in a deſert, but
in the midſt of a great city, in a houſe
where there was daily a great reſort to
heare him ſpeake, and where men of
contrary religions met together: whoſe
proneneſſe to caſt a diſgrace upon the
diſſenting parties did occaſion the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
examining and the full confirming
of the truth thereof, both by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
and by the Dioceſan of the place.
All theſe particulars and many more
have beene related to my Reverend
Father when he was Preſident of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Synod in thoſe parts by the man
<pb facs="tcp:108154:6"/>
that was moſt concerned in them, the
Author of this booke, a religious well
poiſed and venerable Divine, who (if
he be a live ſtill) is above 80 yeares of
age. He writ this relation when it was
freſh in his memory, yet did not publiſh it
but 41 yeares after, in the yeare 1653;
being compelled to it by the many vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and therefore ſome falſe relations of
that ſtory which were ſcattered abroad.
With this he ſet out a Treatiſe about
Demons and witches which he intituled
<hi>Demonologia,</hi> a booke worth reading.
His behaviour in all theſe paſſages was
prudent couragious and godly, for he
allwaies reſiſted the Devill in his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
poſtures, whether of an Angell of
light or of an open enemy of God. He
was tempted by the evill Spirit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to curioſity, ſometimes to covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſometimes to feare, ſometimes to
jeſting and merriment: But the good
man was alwaies alike, grave, conſtant
and ſerious, in rebuking Satan and uſing
<pb facs="tcp:108154:7"/>
the weapons of righteouſnes againſt him
on the right hand and on the left. And
he was not diſappointed of his truſt in
God, for in all the time of that perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God permitted not that ſtirring De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
to doe him any harme, or to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to him, either in their perſons or
goods, and in the end of a hundred dayes
God diſpoſſeſt the Devill of his uſurped
hold. My labour in tranſlating theſe few
ſheets is ſo inconſiderable that I would not
have put my name to it, but that you thote,
Sir, my knowledge of the truth of this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
by the relation of my Reverend
Father would be ſome confirmation of the
certainty of it. I have it at the ſecond
hand, yet from a ſure hand. But your
ſelfe, Sir, had from the Authour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
a more immediate information,
Which being prefixt before this narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
gives it a free and uncontrolable
paſſe to be admitted into the beliefe of
the moſt ſevere and judicious readers.
<pb facs="tcp:108154:7"/>
Neither will they have a leſse opinion
of the utility then truth of this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when they ſee that a perſon ſo high in
learning, ſo deepe in judgment, ſo reall in
godlineſſe, ſo exemplary in good workes
hath judged it to be of principall uſe for
the convincing of unbelievers, and the
confirming of thoſe that are in the faith.
Thereby alſo I ſhall reape this benefit to
my ſelfe, that the world ſhall know I am
honoured with your commands, and that
I delight to approve my ſelfe</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He fourteenth day of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember
in the yeare 1612.
I went with one of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Church of
<hi>Maſcon,</hi> to the claſſicall
meeting held at the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
of <hi>Couches,</hi> and five daies after we
returned. Being come home, I found my
wife and her mayd in a very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernation,
apparent in their face and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
And when I enquired of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108154:9"/>
cauſe of that great alteration, my wife told
me that the night after I went out of
towne, ſhe being in bed, her firſt ſleepe was
broken by ſome thing, ſhe knew not what,
that drew her curtaines with great noiſe
and violence. That her maid that lay in
another bed in the ſame roome, hearing
that, aroſe in haſt and ran to her, to ſee
what it was, but ſaw nothing; yea that ſhe
found the doores and windowes of that
roome very cloſe as ſhe had ſhut
them before ſhe went to bed. My wife
told me alſo that the night following ſhe
made the mayd lie with her, by reaſon of
that accident. That as ſoone as they were
in bed they felt ſomething that pulled off
their blankets: That then the mayd getting
out of the bed went from that roome,
which is on the backſide of the houſe, to
goe to a kitchin which is in the midſt of
the houſe, but that ſhe found the doore
bolted, not within onely, as ſhe had bolted
it herſelfe, but without alſo, which before
ſhe could perceive, after ſhe had unbolted
the doore and would open it, ſhe felt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
as if a man had beene on the other
ſide thruſting againſt her. That the mayd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108154:9"/>
finding herſelfe ſhut up called a youth that
lay in another roome on the foreſide of
the houſe, who roſe to open her the dore,
to whom ſhe would ſay nothing of that
diſorder leſt he ſhould be frighted, but
lighting the candle ſhe found in the kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the pewter and braſſe throwne about,
wherewith the ſame night and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nights the evill Spirit made ſuch a
noiſe as they uſe to make when they give
a<note n="*" place="margin">A <hi>Charivary</hi> is a mad kind of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renada muſique of pans and kettles given to old wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes when they marry.</note> 
               <hi>charivary,</hi> or when they
will hive bees.</p>
            <p>Upon this relation I will
not diſſemble that I was
ſeized with ſome amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet ſo that I tooke a
reſolution not to be too credulous at ſuch
a ſtrange ſtory, nor too incredulous nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Severall thoughts came to my mind.
Sometimes I conſidered the frailty and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morouſneſſe
of women, Sometimes I
thought that it might be the impoſture of
ſome knave hidden in the houſe; Wherefore
afore I would goe to bed I carefully ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
all the corners of the houſe and ſet
bolts and barricadoes to all the dores and
windowes of the houſe, ſtopping even the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108154:10"/>
very cat-holes of the dores, and leaving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that might give way to ſuſpicion of
impoſture: And after I had prayed with
my family I went to bed, while my wife and
her mayd ſate ſpinning by the fire, with a
lampe upon the table.</p>
            <p>Scarce was I in my bed, but I heard a
great noiſe from the kitchin, as the rolling
of a billet throwne with great ſtrength.
I heard alſo a knocking againſt a partition
of wainſcot in the ſame kitchin, ſometimes
as with the point of the finger, ſometimes
as with the nailes, ſometimes as with the
fiſt, and then the blowes did redouble.
Many things alſo were throwne againſt
that wainſcot, as plates, trenchers and ladels,
and a muſique was made with a braſſe cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender,
gingling with ſome buckles that
were at it, and with ſome other inſtruments
of the kitchen. After I had given attentive ear
to that noiſe, I roſe from my bed, and taking
my ſword, I went into the roome where all
that ſtirre was kept, the maid holding the
candle before me, and did ſearch narrowly
whether I could find ſome body hidden,
but finding nothing I returned to my bed.
The noiſe beginning againe, I roſe againe.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108154:10"/>
and ſearcht againe, but all in vaine. Then
did I beginne to know indeed that all
this could not proceed but from a wicked
Spirit, and ſo did I paſſe the reſt of the night,
in ſuch an aſtoniſhment as any man may i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine.</p>
            <p>The next day very early I gave notice of
it to the Elders of the Church. Yea I
thought fit to make it knowne to Mr <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Tornus</hi> a Royall Notary and a Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of <hi>Maſcon,</hi> although he was a Roman
Catholique, and very zealous of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
What reaſons I had for it, I will ſay
afterwards. Since that time both he and
all the others to whom I had imparted it
did not faile to viſit me every evening, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
together or by turnes, as long as that
perſecution continued, ſitting up with me
till midnight, and ſometimes longer.</p>
            <p>The firſt night that they came, and ſome
other following nights, the wicked ſpirit
kept himſelfe from making any noyſe or
ſtirre in their preſence, as not willing to be
knowne to them. But in the end, upon the
twentieth of September about nine a clock
he made himſelfe openly knowne for ſuch
as he was; For in the preſence of us all,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108154:11"/>
Mr <hi>Tornus</hi> being one of the company, he
began to whiſtle three or foure times with
a very lowd and ſhrill tone, and preſently
to frame an articulate and intelligible
voyce though ſomewhat hoarſe, which
ſeemed to be about three or foure ſteps
from us, He pronounced theſe firſt words
ſinging <hi>vingt &amp; deux deniers,</hi> that is <hi>two
and twenty pence,</hi> a little tune of five notes
which whiſtling birds are taught to ſing.
After that, he ſaid and repeated many times
this word <hi>Miniſter, Miniſter.</hi> Becauſe that
voyce was very terrible to us at the firſt,
I was long before I would anſwer any
thing to that word, but only, <hi>Get thee from
me Satan, the Lord rebuke thee.</hi> But as he was
repeating againe very often that word
<hi>Miniſter,</hi> thinking (belike) thereby to grieve
me much, I was provoked to tell him.
<hi>Yes indeed</hi> I <hi>am a Miniſter, a ſervant of the
living God, before whoſe Majeſty thou trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt.</hi>
To which he anſwered, <hi>I ſay nothing
to the contrary.</hi> And I replied, <hi>I have no need
of thy teſtimony.</hi> Yet he continued to ſay
the ſame, as if he would winne us to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable
opinion of him.</p>
            <p>Then he would offer to transforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108154:11"/>
into an Angell of light, ſaying of his
owne accord and very lowd, the Lords
Prayer, the Creed, the morning and evening
prayers, and the ten Commandements. It
is true that he did alwaies clip and leave
out ſome part of it. He ſung alſo with a
lowd and audible voyce part of the <hi>Pſalm.
81.</hi> Then ſaid many things which might
be true, as ſome particular paſſages belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my family, as among other things
that my father had beene poiſoned, naming
the man that did it, and why, and ſpecifying
the place, and the manner of the poiſon.</p>
            <p>That very night he ſaid that he came
from <hi>Pais de Vaux,</hi> that he had paſt through
the village of <hi>Allamogne</hi> which is in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illiage
de Gez,</hi> at the dore of my elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſe, where he had ſeene him with
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Du Pan</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Thoiry.</hi> That
they were ready to goe to ſupper together
at my brothers houſe. That they were
neighbours and deare friends. That he
had ſaluted them, and asked whether they
had any thing to command him to deliver
to me, becauſe he was going to <hi>Maſcon.</hi>
That they had ſhewed themſelves very
kinde to him and deſired him to remember
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108154:12"/>
their love to me, 'yea and had invited him
to drinke with them. Thou wicked fiend
(ſaid I to the ſpirit) had they knowne thee
they would not have beene ſo kind to thee.</p>
            <p>Some truth there was in his ſtory, for
M <hi>Du Pan</hi> hath ſince told me and many
others, that they remembred very well how
at that very time a man of ſuch and ſuch a
ſhape, riding on a very leane horſe, that
hung downe his head, had ſpoken with
them, and that ſuch diſcourſes paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them.</p>
            <p>The Demon told us alſo of another bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of mine living in the Vale of the <hi>Lake
de Joux</hi> in the Countrey of <hi>Vaux</hi> ſaying
that one day when ſome of our neere kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
were come to viſit him, he to give them
ſome recreation made them goe upon the
lake without a boate, upon floating wood
tyed together: And that they being farre
on the Lake a ſtormy wind did ariſe, which
conſtrained them to returne in haſte to the
ſhore. Not farre from which all that floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
wood was overturned and they all
welnigh drowned. Which ſtorme he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to be of his raiſing. The relation
of that paſſage being very true, it may be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108154:12"/>
true alſo that he had raiſed that wind, as we
reade in the booke of Job, that Satan raiſed
a great winde that made the houſe fall upon
the children of that holy man.</p>
            <p>Another night the Demon ſpeaking to
<hi>Claude Repay</hi> a bleacher of linnen cloath,
one of them that uſed to come to me at
night, asked him whether he remembred
not that upon ſuch a day, after he had ſet
in order ſome pieces of cloath and skeanes
of yarne, he found them a while after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
out of their place and out of order,
and then ſaid that it was his doing. He
asked another bleacher called <hi>Philibert
Guillermin,</hi> who was alſo in the company,
whether he remembred not that one day
as he was ſtooping to turne ſome pieces of
cloath and skeanes of yarne, lying upon
the graſſe, ſomething pulled him behind
by the skirts of his doublet, and made him
goe back two or three ſteps, and that the
next evening as he lay in his bleaching
houſe, his hat which he had hanged on a
naile by his bed-ſide was flung at his face,
and made him ſtart out of his ſleepe. That
(ſaid he) was of my doing. Both <hi>Repay</hi>
and <hi>Guillermin</hi> acknowledged that theſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108154:13"/>
things had happened to them, but who had
a hand in theſe accidents they knew not
before.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Philibert Guillermins</hi> brother, a
merchant of <hi>Lovan</hi> comming from <hi>Lyons</hi>
lodged in his brothers houſe, and had a
mind to viſit me the firſt night, but his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would not let him. The Demon failed
not to tell us of it, ſaying, I know why
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Philibert</hi> came not to ſit up here yeſter-night.
His Brother had a good minde to have
beſtowed a viſit upon us, but <hi>Philibert</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
him, becauſe he would not that his
brother ſhould heare what noiſe we keepe
in this houſe.</p>
            <p>He ſpake alſo of a late quarrell betweene
one <hi>James Berard</hi> a cutler of <hi>Maſcon</hi> and
one <hi>Samuel du Mont</hi> who had ſo beaten
the ſayd <hi>Berard</hi> that he had brought him
to deaths dore, which was true and told ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particulars of that quarrell which were
not knowne. He told us how at the late
fayre of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Lawrence,</hi> upon which the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of <hi>Maſcon</hi> march in armes under their
ſeverall colours, one <hi>Francis Chickard</hi> had
beene hurt with a musket ſhot in the legge,
which afterwards being gangrened was cut
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108154:13"/>
off; And he named the man that had ſhot
him, and ſaid that he had done it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
of <hi>Chickard,</hi> to whom he bore a
malice, which might very well be true.</p>
            <p>He related a notable ſtory of thoſe that
lived before in the houſe where we dwelt,
<hi>Philibert Maſſon</hi> and <hi>Guillauma Blane</hi> his
wife, commonly called <hi>la Challonoiſe;</hi> that
one day, they being fallen out, the wife
tooke her time when her husband would
goe downe into his ſhop, and puſht him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
with ſuch violence that he fell downe
the ſtares ſtarke dead. And that ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
by another paire of ſtaires went
downe and called the prentices and jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neymen
from the ſhop to their drinking,
that they finding their maſter in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the ſtaires dead, might impute
his death to ſome ſudden ſickneſſe.
This ſecret revealed by the Devill many
have believed to be a truth.</p>
            <p>Another night the Demon ſpeaking to
one of our company told him ſuch private
and ſecret things that the man who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
never to have told them to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
came to believe that the Devill knew
his thoughts, till I had diſabuſed him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:108154:14"/>
Then he began to mock God and all
Religion, and ſaying <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> he skipt
over the ſecond perſon, and upon the
third perſon he made a foule horrible and
deteſtable equivocation. Whereupon I
being incenſed with a juſt anger told him:
But rather thou wicked and abominable
Spirit, ſhouldeſt have ſaid <hi>Gloria Patri,
creatori coeli &amp; terrae, &amp; Filio ejus Jeſu Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto,
qui deſtruxit opera Diaboli:</hi> That is
Glory be to the Father, Creatour of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth, and to his Sonne Jeſus
Chriſt, who hath deſtroyed the workes of
the Devill. He then deſired us with
great earneſtneſſe that we ſhould ſend for
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Du Chaſſin</hi> the Popiſh Parſon of <hi>St
Stevens</hi> Pariſh, to whom he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
himſelfe, and that he ſhould not faile
to bring holy water along with him, for
that (ſayd he) would ſend me away pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſently.</p>
            <p>We wondered that the dog of the houſe
who uſed to be very watchfull, and would
barke at the leaſt noiſe, yet never barked
at the loud ſpeaking and hideous noiſe of
the Demon: He ſaid of his owne accord
without asking, <hi>You wonder that the dog
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108154:14"/>
barketh not, It is becauſe I made the ſign of the
Croſſe upon his head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then being upon a merry pinne, he fell
a ſcoffing and jearing, and among others
things ſayd that he was one of thoſe that
ſcaled the walls of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and that the
ladder being broken he fell from the wall
into the ditch, where he had beene neere
to have beene eaten by the frogs, whoſe
croaking he did perfectly imitate. He
ſaid that a Jeſuite called <hi>Father Alexander</hi>
ſtood at the foot of the ladder, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Savoyards</hi> to goe up boldly, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them that they ſhould take the city,
and winne Paradiſe: And that when the
thirteene that were got up and taken, were
led to the gallowes, the women of the
towne ſayd to the hangman, Courage Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſan,
thou ſhalt have mony to drink.</p>
            <p>Speaking of <hi>Pays de Vaux</hi> he ſaid that it
was a countrey where they made goodly
carbonadoe's of witches, and at that he
laughed very loud. He delighted much in
jeſting with the mayd of the houſe calling
her <hi>Breſſande</hi> (that is a woman of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
of <hi>Breſſia)</hi> and counterfeited her lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
One night as ſhe went up to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108154:15"/>
garret to fetch coales he told her, <hi>Thou
art very bold to paſſe ſo neere me,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a noiſe as if he had clapt his hands
together, he told her, <hi>I will put thee in my
ſack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſeemed alſo to delight much in jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
with one <hi>Michael Repay</hi> who came
almoſt every night to us with his father,
calling him often <hi>Michel Mihell.</hi> He
told him once that he would bring him to
warre with the <hi>Marqueſſe of St Martin</hi>
who was raiſing a troope of horſe in <hi>Breſſia</hi>
to go to <hi>Savoy.</hi> But <hi>Michael Repay</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him ſmiling, ſhould I goe to warres
with ſuch a coward as thy ſelfe, ſince thou
profeſſeſt that thou didſt flie from the
ſcalado of <hi>Geneva?</hi> To which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
anſwered. <hi>And do you think that I
would goe and be hanged with my camrades?
I was not ſuch a foole.</hi> Continuing to jeaſt
with <hi>Michael Repay</hi> he put him in mind
that the Sunday before going to Church
with one <hi>Noel Monginot</hi> to the village of
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rigny,</hi> he was ſaying that the way to catch
the Devill was to ſpread a net for him,
and then he told him, <hi>Wilt thou now ſpread
thy net to catch me?</hi> At the ſame time he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108154:15"/>
did ſo lively counterfeit the voyce of
<hi>Michael Repay's</hi> mother that he ſaid laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his father, <hi>Father, truly he ſpeakes
juſtilike my mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another time he told us in a faint and
moaning tone that he had a mind to make
his will becauſe he muſt needs goe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Chambery where he had a law-ſuite
ready for the triall, and that he feared to
dye by the way; wherefore he had the
mayd to goe for a Notary naming Mr <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
father to that <hi>Tornus</hi> of whom we
ſpake before; Of his family he ſaid many
particularities, of which, as alſo of all the
paſſages of this Demon acted in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
the ſayd <hi>Tornus</hi> the ſonne, a Royall
Notary as his father, hath left a relation,
written, and ſigned with his owne hand,
which I have in my keeping for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all that is here related. And it was to
have ſuch an authenticall teſtimonie that
I adreſt my ſelfe to him when this vexation
came upon me.</p>
            <p>In that relation he mentioneth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
legacies which the Demon declared
that he would leave, to one this, to
another that. One of them to whom he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108154:16"/>
ſayd that he would give five hundred
pounds, anſwered him, that he would
have none of his money, and wiſht that it
might periſh with him. He named another
to be his heire generall, who alſo anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that he would not accept the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<hi>I free thee of it</hi> (ſayd the Demon)
<hi>for ſix pence and a piece of bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A while after he counterfeited that he
was not the ſame Spirit that had ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but his ſervant onely, That he came
from waiting upon his Maſter, who had
charged him to keepe his place in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
while he was in his journey to
Chambery. And when I rebuked him in
ſuch words as God put in my mouth, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
with much ſeeming lenity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
<hi>I beſeech you Sir to pardon me, you are
miſtaken in me, you take me for another. I
never was in this houſe before, I pray Sir
what is your name?</hi> As he was thus ſpeaking
one Simeon Meiſſonier, that uſed to reſort
often to my houſe upon that occaſion, ruſht
ſuddenly to the place whence the voyce
ſeemed to come, and having ſearcht it
againe and againe, as others had done
before him, and found nothing, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108154:16"/>
to the place where we were all, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him ſeverall things from the place
where the voyce ſounded, among other
things a ſmall bottle. At which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
fell a laughing and ſaid to him. <hi>I
was told long ſince that thou wert a foole, and
I ſee now that thou art one indeed, to believe
that I am in that bottle: I ſhould be a foole
my ſelfe to get into it, for ſo one might take
me with ſtopping the bottle with his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One night when <hi>Abraham Lullier</hi> a
goldſmith was comming into the houſe,
where he ſeldome fayled to be at that
houre, the Demon ſaid, <hi>Goe, open the doore to
Lullier who is comming,</hi> and at the ſame time
Lullier knockt at the doore. As ſoone as he
was come in, the Demon told him, that he
deſired to learne the goldſmiths trade of
him, and that for his prentiſhip he would
give him fifty Crownes. Then giving
him faire words, <hi>I love thee well</hi> (ſaid he)
<hi>thou art an honeſter man then ſuch a man,</hi>
(naming another goldſmith a man of
Geneva) <hi>who hath coſened ſuch a Lady of
Maſcon, who was gone to viſit ſome of her kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at Geneva, in the ſale of ſome rings, Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108154:17"/>
and plate.</hi> Upon which when <hi>Lullier</hi>
told him <hi>I have no need of thy love, I am
content with the love of my God, Neither will
I take ſuch a prentice as thee.</hi> The Demon
anſwered <hi>Since thou wilt not teach me the
Goldſmiths trade, let</hi> Maſter Philibert <hi>teach
me to be a Bleacher.</hi> Then acting againe
the part of a ſervant he complained that he
was poore and ill clad, that he ſtarved for
cold, and that his wages were but twelve
crownes a yeare. He told us that if we
would have him to goe away quickly we
ſhould give him ſomething, and that any
thing would pleaſe him. I told him that
he knockt at the wrong doore, and that I
would not give him the paring of my
nailes. He anſwered <hi>You have then very
little charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe he obſtinately affirmed that he
was not the ſame that had bin in the houſe
from the beginning, but his ſervant, yea
that he was not the ſame that had bin in
the houſe the night before, that then one
of his fellow ſervants was waiting, and that
they two were expecting their maſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
from his Journey to Chambery
whence he ſhould returne within few daies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:108154:17"/>
Howſoever whether it was the Maſter
Devill that then ſpake, or one or more of
his ſervants, I have beene informed by
worthy witneſſes that at the ſame time
there was a Spirit in the houſe of <hi>Monſieur
Favre</hi> the firſt preſident of <hi>Chambery,</hi> who
for his learning in law was one of the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
men of his age: To him the Spirit
ſpake, and told him, among other things,
that he came from <hi>Maſcon</hi> and had paſt
through <hi>Breſſe,</hi> and ſeene ſuch and ſuch
kinſmen of his.</p>
            <p>To returne to what was in our houſe at
that time, the Spirit beſpoke aloud great
preparations of proviſion, as turkies, partri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
hares, and the like for the comming of
his Maſter. Then he ſung many prophane
and bawdy ſongs, among others that which
is called <hi>le filou.</hi> He counterfeited the voyce
of Juglers and mountebankes, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
that of huntſmen crying aloud <hi>holevrier
ho levrier,</hi> as hunters uſe to ſhoute
when they ſtart a hare.</p>
            <p>He offered to tempt us by covetouſneſſe
(one of the ordinary temptations of the
Devill for which reaſon he is called Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona.)
Divers times he would peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108154:18"/>
affirme that there was ſix thouſand
crownes hidden in that houſe, and that if
any of us would follow him he would,
ſhew us where the money was hid. But I
can ſay with a good conſcience before God
and his holy Angels, that I never ſearcht
for it, nor employed others about it, nor
ſuffered any to looke for it, or ever had any
will to make benefit by it.</p>
            <p>He would try us alſo by curioſity, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that if we had a mind to ſee him in
any ſhape of man, woman, lyon, beare,
dog, cat, &amp;c. he would give us the ſport of
it, Which motion we did much abhorre
and reject, ſaying that we were ſo farre
from deſiring to ſee him in any of theſe
ſhapes, or any other, that we were very
deſirous, if it might be Gods pleaſure, never
to heare him; but that we hoped that God
would ſhortly deliver us from all his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>In the end he became very angry, firſt
againſt me becauſe I had told him <hi>Goe thou
curſed into the everlaſting fire prepared for
the Devill and his Angels.</hi> Whereupon he
told me. <hi>Thou lieſt, I am not curſed, I hope
yet for ſalvation by the death and paſſion of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108154:18"/>
Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This he ſayd perhaps to
make us believe that he was the ſoule of a
woman deceaſed a little before in that
houſe, the daughter of a woman whom I
had ejected by law out of that houſe, for
there had beene a rumour that when ſhe
died ſhe prayed to God that ſhe might
returne to the houſe after her death to vexe
us.</p>
            <p>He told me in great wrath that he would
doe this and that to me. Among other
things he told me that when I ſhould be
a bed he would come and pull off my blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
&amp; pull me out of the bed by the feete. I
anſwered him the ſame thing that the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Prophet David ſaid to his enemies,
<hi>I will lay me downe and ſleepe for the Lord
maketh me dwell in ſafety.</hi> I told him alſo
that which Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to Pilate, <hi>Thou
hadſt no power on me but what is given thee
from above,</hi> Whereupon he anſwered me
repeating two or three times theſe words
<hi>It is well for thee, It is well for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was alſo very angry with one of the
company who had called him <hi>ſtinking hee-goate,</hi>
and gave him many ill words, as theſe
<hi>Thou wouldeſt appeare a good man, but thou</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:108154:19"/>
               <hi>art but an hypocrite, thou goeſt often to Pont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deville,
pretending to goe heare Sermons: But
when thou goeſt thou takeſt thy boxe of bills;
&amp; bonds along with thee, to exact thine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reares
&amp; vſe money. Goe, thou wouldſt make
no conſcience to hang a man for twenty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
as Mr Denis doth;</hi> That maſter <hi>Denis</hi>
was the hangman of <hi>Maſcon.</hi> Then making
a noiſe as if he had clapt his hands together,
he ſayd agaíne to the ſame man, <hi>Thou mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
heare the ſhew of a valiant man, having
brought thy ſword along with thee this night,
but if thou beeſt ſo bold as to come hither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a light, it ſhall be ſeene which of vs two is
the moſt valiant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſayd all theſe things of the time
paſt, &amp; preſent, he would alſo ſpeake of the
future. Speaking of thoſe that profeſſe the
reformed Religion within the Kingdome of
France, he made once this exclamation! <hi>O
poore Hugonots! you ſhall haue much to ſuffer
within a few yeares! O what miſchiefe is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
againſt you!</hi> &amp; more words to the ſame
purpoſe.</p>
            <p>He ſayd of my wife that was with childe,
&amp; neare her time, that ſhe ſhould have a
daughter, &amp; ſayd it two or three times.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108154:19"/>
The caſe ſhe was in made me feare, that ſhe
ſhould get ſome harme in her childbearin,
by a fright, cauſed by our infernal gheſt.
Wherefore, I deſired her to goe out of the
houſe, &amp; goe to her grandmother the
Lady <hi>Philiberta de la Mouſſiere</hi> with whom
ſhe had bin bred from her infancy, &amp; to lye
in at her houſe. But ſhe did excuſe herſelfe
from it very courageouſly, ſaying, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away would be miſtruſting the power
&amp; mercy of God: That ſince it pleaſed God
to viſit vs ſo he might find vs as well in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
houſe, &amp; that to reſiſt the Devill we
muſt not flee from him. Wherein verily I
acknowledged her to be in the right, becauſe
wee are often exhorted in the Scripture, to
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſiſt, &amp; fight, &amp; wreſtle with the Deuill,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut never to flee from him, which would be

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eilding to him the victory. For he is like
he wolfe, or the crocodile, whom if you
and againſt ſtoutly they will runne away,
but if you feare them &amp; runne from them
they will run after you.</p>
            <p>The Demon ſayd one night before vs all,
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat without fayle I ſhould dye within three
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eares, thinking thereby to torment me
with a continual apprehenſion of death, &amp;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108154:20"/>
ſo make me fall if he could into ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
&amp; ſo into ſicknes thereby to have
made his words good. But I anſwered him
in the words of St Paul Act 20. <hi>None of
theſe things moue me neither count I my life
deare vnto my ſelfe, ſo that I might finiſh my
courſe with Joy &amp; the miniſtery which I have
received of the Lord Ieſus, to teſtifie the Goſpell
of the grace of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Demon having uſed all theſe wiles
againſt us was forced to ſay that he could
not prevaile againſt us, becauſe we did
call two much upon the name of God.
To ſhew the efficacy of our prayers, this
is an obſervable truth, that every time that
the Devill ſaw that wee began to kneele to
goe to our prayers he left talking, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times told us theſe words, <hi>While you are
at your prayers I'le goe take a turne in the
ſtreet.</hi> Really, whither he went forth or
ſtaid we had a wonderfull ſilence during
our prayer; But no ſooner was the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
done but he began againe as before, and
urged and ſollicited us to ſpeake with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And ſo continued ſpeaking and provoking
us to ſpeake till the 25 of November when
he ſpake theſe laſt words <hi>Ha ha je ne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leray</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:108154:20"/>
               <hi>plus,</hi> that is, <hi>Alas alas I ſhall ſpeake
no more:</hi> From that very time he gave
over, and ſpake no more.</p>
            <p>I might adde many other diſcourſes of
this Demon, but I confeſſe that I purpoſely
omit them becauſe they offend either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
or the State or the good name of
ſome great perſons and honorable fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
or becauſe they are foule and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
as proceeding from an uncleane Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
So much as wee have related is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to ſhew how ſtrange and admirable
was this ſpeaking of the Devill.</p>
            <p>As his words were ſtrange and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſo were his actions, for beſides thoſe
which I have related, done in my abſence,
he did many more of the ſame kind as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſing
about very often a great roll of
cloath of fifty ells which a friend had left
at my houſe to be ſent to <hi>Lyons</hi> by water.
Once he ſnacht a braſſe candleſtick out of
the maids hand leaving the candle lighted
in her hand: He would very often take that
mayd's coates and hang them over the
bed poſts, ſetting over them a rough hat
ſuch as the countriwemen of Breſſe uſe to
weare for ſhe was of that countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:108154:21"/>
Sometimes he would hang at thoſe poaſts
a great ſtarching plate with coards ſo ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and with ſo many knots that it was
impoſſible to untie them and yet himſelfe
would ſuddenly untie them in a moment.
Once I found my bootes ſo intangled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a winding blades that they could not
be taken off. And many times he hath
ſo twiſted radiſhes together that the like
could not be done unleſſe it had bin ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
with a very long patience and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>One afternoone a friend of mine one
Mr <hi>Connain</hi> a Phyſitian of <hi>Maſcon,</hi> beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a viſit upon me; As I was relating unto
him theſe ſtrange paſſages we went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the chamber where the Demon was
moſt reſident: There we found the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therbed,
blankets, ſheets, and boulſter, layd
all upon the floore. I called the mayd to
make the bed, which ſhe did in our preſence,
but preſently we being walking in the ſame
roome, ſaw the bed undone and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
downe on the floore as it was before.</p>
            <p>In the roome over that, where I had my
ſtudy, I found ſeverall times part of my
books laid on the floore, and my houre-glaſſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108154:21"/>
unbroken, and no other harme. As
I was once ſitting in my ſtudy the Demon
made a noiſe as it had beene a great voly of
ſhot in the roome above. Sometimes he
would be the groome of my ſtable rubbing
my horſe, and platting the haire of his tayle,
and maine, but he was an unruly groome,
for once I found that he had ſaddled my
horſe with the crupper before, and the
pommel behind.</p>
            <p>He was a good while in the houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we could perceive that he reſorted to
my bedchamber. But one night after all
were retired that were come to heare him,
my ſelfe and my family being all a bed,
the dores and the windowes of the houſe
being well ſhut, he came in and began to
whiſtle ſoftly and by intervalles, as if he
had bin afraid to awake us: he knockt as
if it had bin with his finger upon a trunk
neere my bed, as he did many times ſince.
He would throw our ſhooes about the
roome, thoſe of the maid eſpecially, who
feeling him once taking one of her ſhoes
laid hold preſently on the other, and ſayd
ſmiling. <hi>This thou ſhalt not have.</hi> Under
the table in the ſame roome he did once
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108154:22"/>
imitate the noiſe of hempdreſſers that beate
the hempe foure together ſuch as we had
in our neighbourhood, and keeping the
ſame equall meaſure.</p>
            <p>He made us heare for a long time a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
not unpleaſant of two little bells
tyed tohether which he had taken among
ſome ruſty irons in my houſe. When I
heard them firſt, and knew by their ſound
that they were mine, I went to the place
where I had layd them, but did not find
them. Neither did the Demon uſe theſe
bells in my houſe onely, but he carried
them about to many places both of the
towne and countrey. Upon a Lords day
morning as I was going to officiate at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigny,</hi>
with ſome elders of my Church we
heard the ſound of thoſe bells very neere
our eares. Mr <hi>Lullier,</hi> one of our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
affirmed unto me that he had heard
thoſe bells many times at his houſe. Many
others have heard them very neere, but
could never ſee them.</p>
            <p>Neither did that Demon play his tricks
onely at my houſe, Mr <hi>Lullier</hi> hath told
me of many of his actions in his houſe and
both ſhop. As the taking and hiding of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108154:22"/>
his jewels or tooles, and then putting them
againe where they were before. While
Mr <hi>Lullier</hi> was telling me of this, he layd
a golden ring which he had then in hand
upon the table with the toole that he held
it with, but preſently he found them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſing
and in vaine ſought them halfe an
houre; wherefore he betooke himſelfe to
other worke; but then he and I ſaw both
the ring and the toole fall, we knew not
from whence, upon the table againe.</p>
            <p>One night that <hi>Lullier</hi> had not ſet up
with us as he uſed to doe, two that came
from my houſe very late ſtayd by <hi>Lulliers</hi>
ſhop to give him an account of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
actions and words that night. While
they were talking the Demon ſmote three
times very hard upon a ſhed of boards
that was over the ſhop.</p>
            <p>The next night after, <hi>Lullier and Repay</hi>
comming from my houſe met a woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
at the corner of the ſtreete in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
habit ſpinning by Moone-ſhine. But
when they came neere to know what ſhe
was, ſhe vaniſhed from their ſight.</p>
            <p>Leaving now ſuch actions as the Demon
did out of my houſe as things of which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108154:23"/>
I cannot ſpeake with the like certainty as
thoſe which I have ſeene &amp; heard my ſelfe.
I will but adde his laſt actions at my houſe,
and indeed the moſt troubleſome of all, as
they ſay that the Devill is alwaies more
violent in the end then in the beginning,
and is then moſt fierce when he muſt be
gone. He threw ſtones about my houſe
continually the tenne or twelve laſt daies
from morning to evening, and in great
quantity, ſome of them of two or three
pounds weight.</p>
            <p>One of thoſe laſt daies Mr <hi>Tornus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to my houſe about noone, would
know whether the Devill was there ſtill,
and whiſtled in ſeverall tones, and each
time the Devill whiſtled to him againe in
the ſame tone. Then the Demon threw
a ſtone at him, which being fallen at his
feete without any harme to him, he tooke
it up and marked it with a coale, and flung
it into the backſide of the houſe which
is neere the towne wall and the river of
<hi>Saone,</hi> but the Demon threw it up to him
againe, and that it was the ſame ſtone he
knew it by the marke of the coale: <hi>Tornus</hi>
taking up that ſtone found it very hot and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108154:23"/>
ſaid he believed it had beene in hell ſince
he had handled it firſt.</p>
            <p>Finally after all theſe words and actions
the Demon went away the 22 day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember;
And the next day a very great
viper was ſeene going out of my houſe,
and was taken with long pincers by ſome
naylours our neighbours, who carried it all
over the towne crying, <hi>Here is the Devill
that came out of the Miniſters houſe,</hi> and
finally left it at one <hi>William Clarke's</hi> houſe
Apothecary, where it was found to be a
true and naturall viper, a ſerpent rare in
that countrey.</p>
            <p>All the time that the Demon haunted
my houſe God permitted him not to doe
us any harme, neither in our perſons nor
in our goods. Thoſe bells which he did
ſo toſſe and carry about, he hanged at a
naile over the chimney of the roome where
he was moſt converſant, the day that he
left the houſe. He had not ſo much power
given him as to teare one leaſe of my
bookes, or to breake one glaſſe, or to put
out the candle, which we kept lighted all
the night long. Wherefore I bow
my knees, and will as long as I live,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108154:24"/>
unto my gracious God to give him thanks
for that great mercy.</p>
            <p>This is the plaine and true relation of
that Demons words and actions. And
<hi>Marcelin</hi> a Capuchin that preacht at the
ſame time at <hi>Maſcon</hi> hath truly related
many of theſe paſſages in a booke of his,
printed at Grenable againſt Mr <hi>Bouterove,</hi>
ſaying, that he had the ſtory from diverſe
perſons, eſpecially from Mr <hi>Fovillard</hi> Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Generall in the <hi>Balliage of Maſcon,</hi>
who upon the generall rumour of that
ſtrange accident, ſent his brother in law
Mr <hi>Francis Gucrin</hi> and Mr <hi>Guichard</hi> an
Advocate to my houſe, to deſire me to
come to him, as I did, to tell him the whole
matter. Yet (by <hi>Marcellins</hi> leave) it is
not true that which he and other preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
and paſſionate men doe inferre out
of it to diſgrace my perſon and my profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion,
namely, that I had communication
with evill Spirits. For God beares witneſſe
to my conſcience that I never had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
with thoſe horrible creatures, and
know no more of them then what it hath
pleaſed his divine wiſdome to let me know
by his word &amp; by this domeſtique experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108154:24"/>
and that my chiefe curioſity was to
improve the little talent which God hath
given me to inſtruct my ſelfe and others
in the true and ſolid ſcience of eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
which is to know him the onely
true God and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath
ſent.</p>
            <p>And truly Marcellin and others that
have ſpoken and written of this hiſtory to
my diſadvantage herein, contradict both
Mr <hi>Fovillard</hi> Lievtenant Generall of <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>
and the Lord <hi>Gaſpard Divet</hi> then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Maſcon,</hi> who upon the common
report of theſe paſſages ſent for Mr <hi>Tornus</hi>
to know the truth of them; And for more
certainty ſent his owne Secretary Mr
<hi>Chamber</hi> to learne the particulars of them
from mine owne mouth, to whom I rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all without concealing or diſguiſing
any thing. Theſe two Gentlemen <hi>Tornus</hi>
and <hi>Chamber</hi> have told me ſince that the
Biſhop had heard that ſtory with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
and had made ſome records of
the ſame.</p>
            <p>If any now enquire of me what may the
cauſe be of this admirable accident (as
there is nothing more ordinary or more
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108154:25"/>
naturall to every man then to enquire of
the cauſes eſpecially of things extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
I will anſwere that conſidering the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of time, and place, and perſons,
which I had then to doe with, many cauſes
ſeeme to have concurred for it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, whereas there are times in which
Devils are in a manner unchained and have
more liberty to doe their feats, and other
times when they are tyed ſhort and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from acting, as we learne in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
chapter of the Revelation. Truly one
may with good reaſon ſay that when the
Demon made himſelfe ſo bold in my
houſe it was a time when the Devill
was, as it were, let looſe; for then the world
was full of ſtories of the extraordinary
pranks of thoſe wicked Spirits.</p>
            <p>This may be juſtified by the booke
written by Mr <hi>de l' Anere</hi> one of the Kings
Counſellours joined in Commiſſion with
Mr <hi>D' Eſpagnet</hi> Preſident at <hi>Toloſa</hi> to Judge
the witches of the country of <hi>Labour,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Countrey of the <hi>Baſques</hi> neere
the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> mountaines, the title of the
booke is <hi>A repreſentation of the inconſtancy
of Demons and wicked Spirits,</hi> where ſuch
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108154:25"/>
ſtrange and horrible things are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
as will make the readers haire to
ſtand.</p>
            <p>To which joine the horrible ſtory of
<hi>Lewis Gauffredi,</hi> a Prieſt <hi>of Marſeilles</hi> one
of the greateſt inſtruments of the Devill
that ever Hell brought forth, who had
beene burnt a little before by the order
of the Court of Parliament of <hi>Aix in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time a Demon appeared at
<hi>Lyons</hi> in the ſhape of a fine Gentlewoman
to the Lieutenant of the Knight of the
watch named <hi>la Jacquiere,</hi> and to two
others of his companions, which three had
carnall knowledge of that Demon, and
thereby came to a moſt tragicall and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
end. Which ſtory is printed among
many other tragicall ſtories of our
time.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, which was in the year
1612, the like ſtory to that of <hi>Lyons</hi> was
publiſht, how in Paris, the firſt of January
of that yeare, a perſon of quality had
cohabitation with a Demon, which to him
appeared a beautifull Lady, but the next
morning that Lady being viſited by Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108154:26"/>
and Phyſitians was found to be the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of a woman that had beene hanged a
few dayes before.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time the priſons of
<hi>Maſcon</hi> were filled with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men and women, young and old of
the village of <hi>Chaſſelas,</hi> and other townes
neere it, all indicted of witchcraft, who
being condemned at <hi>Maſcon,</hi> appealed to
the Court of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and
were conducted to <hi>Paris</hi> by a maſſinger
and ſome guards. In the way a coach met
them, and in it a man that looked like a
Judge, who ſtaid, and asked the maſſinger
what priſoners he led, whence they came,
and whether they went. The maſſinger
having ſatisfied him, the man (if one may
call him ſo) eying theſe priſoners ſayd to
one of them, calling him by his name, Ho
now! art thou one of them? Feare nothing,
for neither thou nor any of thy company
ſhall ſuffer. And his words proved true,
For ſoone after they were all relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time a girle of <hi>Maſcon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
13 or 14 yeares of age daughter to
one of the chiefe citizens of the towne,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108154:26"/>
lying with the mayd of the houſe, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that ſhe abſented her ſelfe many times
in the night, and once asked her whence
ſhe came, the maid anſwered that ſhe came
from a place where there was good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
gallant danſing, and all kinds of
ſports and merriment. The girle taken
with this report deſired the mayd to bring
her to that place. Whereupon the maid
anointed her, and made her doe the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ceremonies preſcribed to witches by
the Devill, after which the girle was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up into the ayre by a Demon, as ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
but ſeeing herſelfe above the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of the Capucin fryers, ſhe was
afraid, and called upon God, who did helpe
her and cauſed the Demon to lay her
downe in their garden about midnight:
The Capucins hearing her lamenting voice
came to her helpe, and when ſhe had told
them who ſhe was, and what had happened
to her, ſhe was ſecretly conducted by two
of them to her Fathers houſe. This relation
I have heard from many perſons, affirmed
as moſt certainly true. That girle I have
often ſeen, and I was told that ſhe was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

At the ſame time the common report
was, that a Demon haunted the houſe of
a woman baker of <hi>Maſcon,</hi> in the ſtreet
<hi>de na Tupinerie,</hi> in a mans ſhape, with a red
cap. and would looke out of the window
by moone light. This many perſons have
affirmed to me to be very true, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Abraham Lullier being one of them.
I doubt much whether the Demon hath
yet left the houſe notwithſtanding all the
exerciſing, and the judiciall courſe alſo
which was uſed to eject him.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time a Demon kept a great
ſtirre at <hi>St Stevens</hi> Church of <hi>Maſcon,</hi>
turning over many graves, which being brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
about the towne, I ſaw, as living in that
neighbourhood, great part of the people
flock thither.</p>
            <p>The like happened alſo in the Church
of St <hi>Alban</hi> neere <hi>Maſcon,</hi> and at the ſame
time.</p>
            <p>Againe, at the ſame time a widowes houſe
at <hi>Marigny les Nonnains,</hi> not farre from
<hi>Maſcon,</hi> was for three moneth haunted
by a Demon who did there a great deale
of harme, letting out the wine in the cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and beating untragiouſly ſeverall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108154:27"/>
among others a lockſmith that came
into the houſe drunk, and gave many ill
words and threatnings to that Devill, who
preſently was even with him, for he tooke
one of the andirons, and grievouſly beat
him with it, till he ran away out the houſe,
which he did in all haſte. By theſe relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and many of the like kinde, which I
omit, it is evident that at the time that the
Demon was at my houſe; the Devill was
in a manner unchained.</p>
            <p>I conceive alſo that this Demon might
be ſent to me by ſome that were incenſed
againſt me, for procuring a licence from
the King to build a Church for our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
congregation neere the walles of
<hi>Maſcon;</hi> for that very day that the Devill
began that diſorder in my houſel, was
threatened by one before the civill cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
of Maſcon, that <hi>ſome evill would
overtake me preſently,</hi> and that man was
ſuſpected to be a diſciple of one <hi>Ceſar</hi> a
knowne Magician, who had lived <hi>Maſcon</hi> a
little before.</p>
            <p>Many have attributed the comming of
that Demon to my maid <hi>Breſſande,</hi> of
whom I ſpake before, for ſhe was ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to be a witch, borne of parents ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108154:28"/>
to be guilty of witchcraft as ſome
doe report: I remember that once ſhe
asked of me, whether any of thoſe that
had given themſelves to the Devill, could
find mercy before God. And that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, when ſhe ſaw me afraid leſt the
Devill ſhould hurt two youths that lay in
a roome next to that where he was heard,
ſhe told me Feare not, he will doe them
no harme. And the truth is that ſhe
would jeſt and be familiar with him. For
beſides that I ſaid of it before, ſhe would
once expoſtulate with the Demon that he
brought her no wood, whereupon he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
threw downe a fagot for her at the
ſtaire foot; And whereas upon her offering
to leave our ſervice another came to ſerve
us in her place and lay in the ſame bed
with her, the Demon, who never hurt her,
would beate that new maid in the bed,
and powre water upon her head till he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
her to goe away. My ſuſpicion of
that <hi>Breſſande</hi> was increaſed by a relation
which ſhe made unto me, one day that I
was ſick, of a tall black man that had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
unto her the night before by
mooneſhine, holding a viall in his hand
like a Phyſitian. This and other like
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108154:28"/>
things gave me an ill opinion of her, as
one that might be a concurrent cauſe of
the comming of that helliſh gheſt.</p>
            <p>To theſe adde the circumſtance of the
place; for in the ſame houſe a murther
had beene committed, if the Demons words
and the common report may be credited.
As it is not unuſuall that houſes where
ſome murther or ſome other foule fact
hath beene committed will be haunted by
the Devill. <hi>Cardan</hi> relateth that there is
a caſtle at <hi>Parma</hi> belonging to the noble
family of the <hi>Torelli,</hi> in one of whoſe chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's
a wicked ſpirit appeares in the ſhape
of a foule old wife every time that one of
the family is to die, ever ſince that an old
woman very rich was ſlaine in that houſe
by her covetous nephewes, who cut her in
pieces and threw her into the jakes.</p>
            <p>But the moſt likely cauſe is that after
I had recovered that houſe by law, and was
put in poſſeſſion by the power of juſtice,
the woman whom I came to diſpoſſeſſe was
found under a chimney calling upon the
Devill and uſing terrible imprecations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me and my family, ſaying that
<hi>ſhe would be content to be hanged, yea to be
damned, and to be in the bottome of hell with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108154:29"/>
all the Devills if ſhe might but be avenged of
me and mine.</hi> Which words being related
to me, I preſented a Petition aganſt her to the
Judge of <hi>Maſcon</hi> Lieutenant Generall <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illard</hi>
who bound the woman to her good
behaviour, forbidden her to annoy us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in our perſon or our Goods upon
great penalties; And I and my family were
put under the protection of the King and
juſtice. Of which proceſſe I keepe ſtill with
me the judiciall Acts. But without ſtaying
any more upon the ſecond cauſes, I attribute
all to the diſpoſition of the firſt, and lift up
mine eyes to the hand that gave the blow,
ſhewing together his ſtrength in my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
his mercy in my ſinfulneſſe, and his
wiſe, moderate, and admirable dealing with
me in that he ſuffered me not to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
above my ſtrength, but gave me with
the temptation away to come out, that
I might be able to beare it. Great reaſon
I have to ſay with the Royall Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.
<hi>Our ſoule is eſcaped as a bird out of the
hand of the fowlers, the ſnare is broken and we
are eſcaped, Our helpe is in the name of the
Lord who maat heaven and earth,</hi> To him be
glory for it, now and for evermore, Amen.</p>

Appendix of the
Tranſlatour.</head>
            <p>THe Author to make his word good that
he would publiſh none of the diſcourſes of
the Demon that were offenſive to God, or the
State, or the credit of ſome honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
hath left out diverſe notable ſtories,
ſome of which he hath related to my Reverend
Father, upon whoſe relation I will adde here
two conſiderable paſſages. Being to ſpeake of
two ſeverall perſons for the one I muſt be true
to the intent of the Authour, which is to offend
no man, whether I will or no; for I know not
the mans name. The name of the other I doe
purpoſely ſuppreſſe.</p>
            <p>One of them was a grave Divine who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Demon ſpeake profanely, rebuked him
religiouſly, and vigorouſly. To whom the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
anſwered, Miniſter you are very holy
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108154:30"/>
and very ſerious in this company, you were not
ſo when you were ſinging ſuch a baudy ſong in
ſuch a Taverne, and then the Demon ſung the
whole ſong before the company. The Divine
anſwered much to this purpoſe, It is true, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
I have beene licentious in my young years,
but God in his mercy hath given me repentance
and pardon; But for thy tart thou art confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in ſinne, and ſhalt never have repentance
nor pardon. Let every one keepe a watch to his
words and actions, for the Devill, who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the accuſer of the brethren, and is ſo by
his trade, keepes a regiſter of that which we
ſay and doe, and will be ſure to bring it forth
when and where it may doe us moſt
harme.</p>
            <p>The other man was an eminent Officer of a
Court of Iuſtice and a Papiſt, who beeing
brought by his curioſity to the Miniſters
houſe, to heare that Devill that told future
things and ſecrets both of publique and private
buſineſſes, would needs offer to make queſtions
to the Demon about ſeverall things; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Miniſter, who had alwaies very
earneſtly forbidden and hindered that any
ſhould propound queſtions to the Devill, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Gentleman to forbeare, and repreſented
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108154:30"/>
to him the ſinne and the danger of it; But the
Lawyer rejected his counſell with ſcorne,
bidding him to teach his owne flock and let
him have the government of himſelfe. So
having ſilenced the Miniſter, he entertained
himſelfe with the Devill without interruption,
queſtioning him ſometimes about one abſent
friend, ſometimes about this or that private
buſineſſe, ſometimes about newes and State
affaires. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon all which when the Demon
had anſwered him, he ſpake to him further,
much to this purpoſe. Now Sir, I have told
you all that you demanded, I muſt tell you next
that which you demand not, That at this very
time while you are making queſtions to the
Devill, ſuch a one (whom he named) is doing
your buſineſſes with your wife, and then
revealed many ſecret foule dealings of the
Lawyer, which made him appeare a diſhoneſt
man. Neither was this all, for in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
the Devill told him. Now Sir let
me Schoole you for being ſo bold as to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Devill, you ſhould have taken the
Miniſters ſafe counſell. Then upon a ſudden
the whole company could ſee the man drawne
by the arme into the midſt of the roome,
where the Devill whiyled him about, and gave
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108154:31"/>
him many turnes with great ſwiftneſſe, then
touching the ground onely with his toe, and
then threw him downe upon the floore with
great violence. His friends tooke him up
and carried him to his houſe where he lay ſick,
and diſtracted many daies: giving by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
a leſſon to all, that the Devill may be
for a while a faire companion to them that
will keepe company with him, but will pay
them in the end with torment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire.</p>

hath exerciſed the charge of the holy

fifty yeares, firſt in this towne of <hi>Buſſy,</hi>
where he was borne, being deſcended of
the moſt ancient and conſiderable family

Of which he had an eſpeciall teſtimoniall
given him by the Church of <hi>Maſcon</hi>

the like he hath from the Church of
Thoiry by an Act bearing date the

that although it hath pleaſed God to
bring him into many, and ſome very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
trials, eſpecially while he
ſerved the Church of <hi>Maſcon.</hi> yet the
