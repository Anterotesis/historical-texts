            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE sacred Scriptures (right worshipful) both of the olde and new Testament, do speake in sundrieplaces of Witches, Coniurers, &amp; Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, and that such doings are in high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation before God: but what these can do few of the vulgar sort do rightly vnderstand. For the most part do ascribe vnto them very foolishly, such power and efficacie in working, as in deede the deuill is not able to perfourme, though God should enlarge his chaine &amp; giue him full scope to doe all that he desireth. Againe, some few are of the minde, that whatsoeuer is spoken in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, or in other writers concerning things wrought by such kinde of people, it was not done by the deuill, but was a meere craft and cosenage of the deceiptfull men and women, which haue taken vpon them such matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue no meaning to teach that deuils euer did any thing that way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that all other writers haue erred which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the same power of deuils. The opinion of these latter is grosse, and in some sort contumelious, being against the direct testimonies of Gods word. The vaine conceipt of those former, that is to say, of the multitude, which imagine that Witches can worke at their pleasure, &amp; so are the comon plague of the earth, breedeth so innumerable sins, that it is as a monster with many heads. It is no meruaile that ignoraunt men which despise the light of the gospel are deceiued by the crafty illusions of Satan: but this may seeme strange, that men instructed in the truth should be abused and erre though not in the grossest maner, yet grosly: but in deed the things are sildome handled by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the holy word, at the least, in such full maner as might

cut downe all false opinions conceiued in mens mindes about the same. I haue therefore bin mooued vppon such considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to take some trauell, and set forth somewhat to conuince mens vaine opinions therein. I had not this minde, to set forth any large discourse what hath bin Iudged and deemed in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times by learned men, and what they testifie concerning the slights of deuills by oracles, diuinations and such vaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt: but onely to giue a taste to the simpler sorte euen from the doctrine of the bible vnto which I doo only lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a learned worke: but in very deede to apply that small measure of knowledge which God in mercy hath giuen me, to the benefit of those that want it. If any with deeper skill shal reueale that which I haue not attained vnto, I will be right glad, not onely for my selfe, but also for our countrimen which greatly neede instruction in the same. I present it vnto your worship, not for the greatnes of the worke, but to testifie my hearty good-will: which in respect of that louing fauour, and friendship which your worship hath for certaine yeares shewed towards me, is great: but farre greater, because that your zeale hath bin shewed towards the gospell, and loue towards al those that publish and professe it. I trust your worship will take in good part this poore gift, considering from what minde it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: there bee some things handled in it, which are vsually committed both in the city and in the country, that are horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before God, and to be seuerely punished by such as are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in authority, and therfore not vnfit to be perused by them. The Lord which hath inriched your worship diuers waies with his good gyfts, increase and double the same to his honor and your eternall comfort. Amen.</p>

I only purpose so far to open Satans packe, and to make shew of so many of his false and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait wares, as may instruct the simple sort to discerne the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and to iudge of all the rest, which I trust euery modest and sober mynd wil allow to bee in some measure sufficient. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we haue this aduantage, that wee are most sure that al his finest stuffe is no better then his coursest wares, because that all his doings are for naughty and wicked purpose, howsoeuer they may seeme to bee profitable. Whereas then the light of

Gods word doth dispell the thicke darknes wherwith this slie enemie hydeth himselfe, and manifesteth his most pestiferous and deadly poison in some thinges, let it bee a sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for all his doinges, without further examination. I am moued to deale with this matter, (and I wish it were dealt throughly in by such as are fully able) for this consideration, that I see many through ignorance of such things are greatly ouerreached by Satan, and so entangled and snared with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that they fal into very foule and horrible sinnes: those that vnderstand the Latine tonge, may very wel satisfy themselues with that which wearines with great iudgement and trauell hath written touching this argument, I haue not seene any that haue written in our tong, which lead not into error on the one side or the other: for there be extremities on both sides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which men do fall. The most part haue bene besotted, euen such as did take themselues to be very wise: for they haue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely beleued that witches could do great wonders, ascribing such power vnto deuils as belongeth onely to God. Others there bee which do stifly maintaine (but how wisely let it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare) that all witchcraft spoken of, either in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or testifyed by other writers to haue bene among the heathen, or in thee latter dayes, hath bene, and is no more but either more cosenage, or poisoning: so that in the opinion of these men, the deuill hath neuer done, nor can do any thing by witches and sorceres. It may be some man wil obiect, and say, what hurt can grow from this opinion? Who can tell what hurt wil ensue and grow thereof, vnlesse he saw first somewhat by experience, this we all do see, that one carnell of wheat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sowen, doth grow vp and bring forth a whole eare, with an hundreth carnels in it sometyme. If one error be planted, who can tell what increase it may yeeld in tyme? the grownd doth not bring forth the corne with such increase, as mans hart doth errors. If a man draw in one linke of a chaine, another follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth and is by and by in sight, which draweth wee know not how many after it, vntil we see the last. There is no error that goeth alone, or that is not linked vnto other. The holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures

(which make the man of God perfect, and perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed vnto enery good worke) are for to iudge and to decide all controuersie in this case. I will therefore onely sticke vnto them for testimonie and proofe.</p>

A definition doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of those causes which giue the whole essence and containe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect nature of the thing defined: therefore where that is found out, there is a very cleere light. If it be perfect, it is much the greater, though it be not fully perfect, yet it giueth some good light. For which respect though I dare not affirme, that I can giue a perfect definition in this matter, which is hard to do euen in knowen things, because the essential forme is hard to be found, yet I do giue a definition, which may at the least giue notice what maner of persons they be, of whom I mynde to speake. A Witch is one that woorketh by the Deuill, or by some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish or curious art, either hurting or healing, reuealing thinges secrete, or foretelling thinges to come, which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil hath deuised to entangle and snare mens soules withal vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to damnation. The coniurer, the enchaunter, the sorcerer, the deuiner, and whatsoeuer other sort there is, are in deede com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed within this circle. The Deuill after diuers sortes no doubt, and after diuers formes doth deale in these, but who is able to shew an essentiall difference in each of them from all the rest? I hold it no wisedome, nor labour well spent to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell much therein, one artificer hath deuised them al: they bee

all to one ende and purpose, howsoeuer they may differ in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rules for practise of them, that is litle or nothing besides mere dilusion. Who wil not confesse that the father of lies is not to bee trusted? who knoweth not that all his doinges are hidden vnder colourable shewes? shall men seeke for stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in his wayes? shall they be so folish as to Imagine, that things are effected vy the vertue of wordes, gestures, figures, or such lyke? doubtles all those are but to deceiue, &amp; to draw men forward, and to plunge them more deeply into errors and sinnes. And now touching the antiquity of witchcraft, wee must needes confesse that it hath bene of very auncient tyme: because the holy Scriptures do plainly testify so much. For in the tyme of <hi>Moses</hi> it was very ryfe in Egypt. Neither was it newly sprong vp: being common and growen vnto such ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes among the nations, that the Lord reckoning vp diuers kindes, saith that the gentils did commit such abhominations, for which he would cast them out before the children of Israel,<note place="margin">Deut. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Deutron. 18.</hi> How long it was before that tyme, can not for certainty be discussed: sauing that (as we haue said) it was not yong in those dayes, when <hi>Moses</hi> wrote.

               <head>That there be 8. sortes of Witches and practisers of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilish art, mentioned, Deuter. 18. whose names and their interpretation do here follow.
The 3. Chapter.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Her are no doubt a thousand waies differing euery one from the rest in one circumstance or other, vnder which Satan doth hide and couer his craft and deadly poyson. But yet the holy Ghost to warne al men to beware, doth mention onely 8. sortes, vnder which no doubt hee comprehendeth all other: for there bee other names in the Scriptures, but yet such as do note in the Egyptian and Chaldean tong, those that are the same with some of these. I suppose that this one reason may suffice for to proue, that vnder eight names all are comprehended, because that here is a general matter dealt in. For the Lord shewing that those gentils caused their children to passe through the fire doth by the trope <hi>synecdoche</hi> of the part for the whole, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all that false worship and idolatrie into which they were blindly led and seduced. Then hee nameth who they were, whose helpe Satan did vse as chiefe instrumentes to seduce withall. And lastly agaynst all these hee doth oppose the true Prophet, whom hee would raise vp from tyme to tyme, vnto his people, at whose mouth they were to learne his holy wil and the true and acceptable worship.</p>
               <p>Now then let vs come vnto the names by which those euill people are named by the holy ghost in the Hebrew tong, for their interpretation, so farre as wee may attayne, wil bring some light hereunto.</p>
               <p>The most of them be set down in the forme of participles. The first is called <hi>Kosem Kesamim,</hi> that is, one which deuia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

diuinations: the latter word is added for to distinguish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the deuining was more general then by diuinations, as appeareth by that speech which <hi>Saul</hi> vsed vnto the witch, when hee requested her to deuine by her spirite, and to bring vp him whom he should name. The word is somtime vsed in good part For in the third chapter of Esay, God doth threten for a plague that he wil take away <hi>Kosem.</hi> And king <hi>Solomon Prou. 16.</hi> doth commend <hi>Kesem,</hi> that is diuination in the lippes of the king, which should guide him in iudgement. For in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Kosem</hi> is put for a man of excellent and rare giftes for gouernment. In other places of the holy Scriptures, where it is taken in euill part, it is put for false prophets which with their lying and vaine diuinations did seduce the people. These<note place="margin">Icch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>3. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mich. 3.</note> did sometyme deuise lies: sometyme they did dreame dreams, which they followed and propounded to the people, as if they had receaued them from God, for God did vse that as one way to reueale himselfe to his seruants, when as in deed they were in these diuiners but the vanities of their owne hartes, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions of vncleane spirites which alwaies counterfait the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirite of God. Sometyme the deuill did inspire them, and shew them visions, as if he had bene the holy Ghost, and made them vtter his wares vnder the name of God. This matter is is sufficiently proued by the history which is written <hi>1 Reg. 22</hi> for there it is shewed, that to the end king <hi>Ahab</hi> might bee se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and goe vp to <hi>Ramoth Gyliad</hi> vnto battaile, a deuill hath power giuen him to be a lying spirite in the mouth of the 400 false prophets which were <hi>Ahabs.</hi> Diuers thinges are in that place set forth to the reach of our capacity, but this is clere what effect it wrought, for both the Prophets and <hi>Ahab</hi> were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eceiued. Sometyme the Lord himselfe did speake vnto <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sem,</hi> though we neuer read that any true Prophet was so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but sorcerers, which did fetch answers &amp; diuinations from the deuil, whom they tooke to be God, hee did so cunningly handle the matter. But wee do not reade in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of any moe but one sorcerer, whom the Lord spake vnto. And that was <hi>Balaam,</hi> for he is called <hi>Kosem Ios. 13. ver. 22</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3288:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which name sheweth that hee was no Prophet of the Lord. hee was accustomed to fetch answers from the Deuill, why els did hee will those that were sent from the King to stay all night, to see what answere hee should haue? It is sayd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that he went <hi>Likkath Kesamim,</hi> that is, to meet with diuinations. A thing which hee was accustomed vnto: but at this tyme God himselfe did speake vnto him.</p>
               <p>The second is called <hi>Megnonen,</hi> from whence this name was deriued, none can for certainty affirme, for it may come <hi>Gnun,</hi> whereof commeth <hi>Gnonah,</hi> which signifyeth a set tyme for any purpose. It may also as well bee deriued from <hi>Gnanan,</hi> which is a clowd. Of whether of them it commeth, it is vsually taken for such as did practise Indiciarie Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, which from the course of the heauens, and the stars, did take vpon them to foreshew warres, pestilences, sedicions, treasons, and the death of great Princes. Moreouer they did teach the fit and prosperous times for to buy or to sel: to iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by Sea or by Lande, to make peace, to vndertake warre, or to marry. These also did take vpon them to shew vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer man (so that they did know the instant of his byrth) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were borne vnder a lucky or an vnlucky planet. What vertue or what vice he should be giuen vnto: whether he should be rich or poore, learned. or vnlearned, what manner of death hee should dye. Agaynst these God did inuey by his Prophets, declaring their vanity, accompting them among the witches and sorcerers. Their errors are very vyle and abhominable by which they did seduce the blynd. Wee may see how the Lord doth speake of them <hi>Iesay chapter 47. ver. 15.</hi> where hee calleth them <hi>Hobere schammaim,</hi> that is, obseruers of the Heauens, and <hi>Chozim baccahochabim,</hi> gazers vppon the Starres.</p>
               <p>It is not the mynde of the Lord to condemne the obseruing and beholding of the course of the Heauens, and the Starres: for they set foorth the great glory of the Creator, as those are<note place="margin">Psalm 8. Psalm 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> much to blame, which do not diligently behold them, to be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp vnto admiration &amp; worshipping of the great God. But
<pb facs="tcp:3288:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
those Astrologians did behold them aiuisse, ascribing all good thinges vnto them, which are peculier vnto God, like wise the euil thinges which are from the deuil, and from the corrupted nature of man by original sinne. Yea they tye the prouidence of God vnto the Starres. For if there bee any sound vertue in a man, it is of grace through fayth, and not from the Starres, drookennes, adultery, murther, disobedience, cruelty, and such like are of the Deuill, and from the nature of man by him corrupted in the fall of Adam. If a man should aske these vayne fooles whether the nature of the starres bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged since mans fall, what will they answere? for this they must needes confesse, that if the Starres bee the cause and fountaine of vice in men, then they bee either changed from their first creation from good into euill, or else that God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the cause and fountayne of euill. And so as they committe vile sacrilege on the one side, when they make the starres the bestowers of vertues, lykewise on the other side they fall into horrible blasphemie when they make God the creator of the cause of euil. The holy Scriptures do teach, that vice and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes is in vs from our sinfull parentes, and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill brought it in and doth increase the same: famins, pestilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and cruell warres are sent by the wrath of God for sinne. The wise Astrologians tell vs of this and that coniunction of planets, which wil cause tyrants to rage, frendes to be false one to an other, women will bee disobedient to their husbandes: these thinges in deede come much to passe, and folish people beleue that the Astrologians did foresee it by the Starres. If men did prosper, it was ascribed vnto that lucky planet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they were borne. In aduersity they blamed the Starres, warres, pestilences, and famins being thought to come from them, men neuer consider their sinnes which haue bene the cause of Gods indignation (for those thinges hee sendeth as the roddes and scourges of his wrath) but are led into a further mischiefe: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:3288:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perswaded that there is the power to bring prosperity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitye, there will hee woorship. In respect therefore of this, the Astrologians are litle better then witches. For the deuill doth seduce by them. Some will exclaime that wee do now condemne the excellent and noble skill of Astronomie. But that is nothing so. For it is a precious gift which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto men, wherby they are able to take view of his works which are so high aboue them. Men do behold goodly things so sone as they cast their eies vpon the heauens. But such as haue the skill of Astronomie doe behold a great deale more. All men do see a glorious trimme worke, but yet a far off. Whereas the Astronomers are after a sort caried vp hard to it, and see those things which common sense doth not attaine. It is verifyed vppon all which the Prophet sayth: the heauens declare the glory of God. For what minde is so blunt, but doth conceiue that the diuine power is great, and glorious, which made, set in order, and susteineth such a worke? The rudest sort do find that the course of the Sunne and the Mone do order the dayes, and the nightes, moneths, and yeares, Winter and Sommer? Who perceiueth not what great power the Sunne hath with his cherishing heate to cause thinges to grow? the Mone beareth a great sway in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Diuers other thinges there be which are manifest to the simple. But how farre beyond al these goe the learned Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers, which do come nigh to gather the distance, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the wonderfull greatnes of the celestiall bodies. and their incomprehensible swiftnesse? incomprehensible I say vnto man. When from these they turne their cies towardes the Creator, How can they but bee amazed at the consideration of his greatnes? they see the seuerall courses of planets, and their motions, and the same fixed by an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>changeable decree: how can they cease wondring at the wisedome of God, who hath so skilfully fashioned them all? that which is secrete vnto others, as the influences &amp; powers, is apparant in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure vnto them. Mens death eather for the time or for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is not subiect to the stares: much lesse vertue or vice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

ingendred in mens myndes by them. The Astronomers do very grosly erre in these predictions about windes &amp; showrs: but yet no doubt there bee many thinges which depend much vpon the course of the heauens: which is no derogation to the prouidence of God, who hath ordayned, and doth vse them as instruments for the same. Great operations in the bodies of men and beasts, as al skilful phisitions do find, come from the planets. And no doubt the deuil tooke occasion hereby for to lead men further in these thinges then they should haue gone. The third is called <hi>Menachesh. Nachash</hi> signifyeth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, from whence the same is deriued. <hi>Laban</hi> when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated <hi>Iacob</hi> to abide still with him, doth vse that woord. I haue (saith he) coniectured, or found by experiments that God hath blessed me for thy sake. For hee felt that his cattle did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease<note place="margin">Gen. 30.</note> and thriue vnder his hand. <hi>Ioseph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> when hee had caused his siluer cup to be put into the sacke of his brother <hi>Beniamin,</hi> and vpon search being found in the same, speaketh after the same maner: and sayth he did deuine or coniecture by that cup what manner of men they were. It seemeth that the word was vsed indifferently, and often times taken in good part. When it is taken in euill part, it semeth to note such as in Latine are called <hi>Augures:</hi> A kind of sooth sayiers, which did coniecture and prophesie by the voices, and by the flying of Birdes by the intrals of beasts, &amp; other like obseruations. These were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; had in great estimation. For the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser sort did beleeue that the Gods (as they vse to say) did vse the tonges of birdes as theire interpreters, to make thinges knowen vnto men. The like for the flying of birds, which they did obserue when they went about any matter. Hereupon some were accompted luckie and some vnlucky birds. And how the deuil did play to del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> men by the intrals of beasts, who kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth? the thing is not now in practise: but yet some reliques &amp; dregs of this kind of witch craft (if I may so cal it) do remaine among vs. For some wil gather by the chattring of pyes, that they shal haue gestes come vnto them. The rauen he sitteth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the steeple and cryeth: which way doth he looke sayth one,
<pb facs="tcp:3288:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from thence ye shal haue an eie ere it be long. Another goeth abrode early in the morning, &amp; a hare crosseth his way: a very vnlucky signe he taketh it to be, and looketh not to speede well that day. Frends meet together &amp; make mery: some one at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares doth turn down the salt: the man or the woman towards whom it falleth, doth blush and take litle comfort of the dainty banquet. For that is taken to be a grieuous euil sign of mishap that will follow. Heauy newes is brought vnto some, that her father, or her mother, or her brother is dead: I did euen looke for such a matter (saith she) for my nose this day did sodainly break forth a bleeding. Thus hath the deuill crept into the mindes of vnbeleeuing people, and causeth them to turne their eies from God. These things must we condemne, but we must take heed that we do not withal disalow those things which are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued. For no doubt, as we see by experience, fowls &amp; beasts do foreshew some things, but yet by a natural cause. The goose and the ducke, &amp; diuers other water fowles, do diue and wash them and make a great sturre against raine. The crow he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth otherwise then ordinary. Other fowles there be, which do flocke together and come vp from the sea, when a cold blast is toward. The cow, though shee bee not very nimble, nor taketh great pride in her running, yet set<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eth vp her taile, &amp; about shee goeth the fields. The litle gnat foundeth her trompet &amp; giueth warning of a shower. What shall wee say to these &amp; a number such like? that they be as the heathen said the interprters of the gods: no verely, but there is a natural cause, and that is this: the disposition of the ayre is changed, &amp; that do these fowles &amp; beasts feel in their bodies, which maketh them so to deale, that ther is such a change in the disposition of the aire, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense in men, do not perceiue it, yet many things do shew. What maketh the salt to bee wet, but that the moysture of the ayre doth dissolue it? what maketh the marble stone to sweat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst raine, but euen the moisture of the aire which it draweth to it? what maketh the soot to fal downe by lumps &amp; gobs out of the chimney, but the moist ayre against rayne doth loosen it? If any man wil yet doubt how the sowls or beasts should feele
<pb facs="tcp:3288:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the change of the ayre in their bodies: hee may see it is not a thing strange. For a man whose arme or his leg hath bene bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or that hath had some mayme or sore bruse in his bodye, doth feel a great ache against rayne: this doth come of the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the air. And thus wee see it behoueth men to discerne betweene such things as haue a natural cause, &amp; therby do after a sort foreshew things: &amp; those which haue no cause in nature, but are to be reiected. The 4 is called, <hi>Mechashshepha.</hi> It is deriued from <hi>Cashaph,</hi> which is found in the holy scriptures, &amp; that is <hi>2 cron. 33. 6.</hi> what the word doth properly signify, or from whence it is drawen, can no man tel. More then this, that it is vsed for a kind of witches &amp; sorcerers. Some do imagine that it was such a one as did deale, not by the deuil, but by poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son only, so that in their opinion, where it is translated, thou shalt not suffer a witch to liue <hi>Ex. 22.</hi> It should be more fitly said, thou shalt not suffer a poisoner to liue. But this is of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, for the matter is far otherwise, as shalbe shewed: their opinion is grounded vpon the greeke translation, which is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed vnto the 70 interpreters: for they do translate this word <hi>Mechashshepha Pharmacous,</hi> which say they do signify such as did make &amp; vse poison. The first error is in this, that they consider not that <hi>Pharmas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> are as wel good confections and holsom medicines, as poisons: this is manifest that witches do take vpon them to deale with medicines &amp; confections which they vse together with their charmes: they make diuers oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, which satan doth vse to delude them withall. He tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them also to make poisons: whervpon this is cleere that the greeke woord <hi>Pharmakeia</hi> is vsed as a generall name for witchcraft &amp; sorcery, as we may se in diuers places of the new testament. <hi>S. Paul. Gal. 5.</hi> reciting the works of the flesh vseth that word for witchcraft. Babilon is charged that she had sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the nations by her witchcraft: wheras in deed that word is vsed. But if any man shall say these profes are weake, and do not make the matter so clere as to be out of all controuersie, then let them consider a second error in those which hold opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that <hi>Mechashshepha,</hi> was one which dealt only with
<pb facs="tcp:3288:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
poison, &amp; not by the deuil: for howsoeuer the signification of the wordcan not be found, yet we find plainly expressed in the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures what this kind of witch did. In the 2 chap. of <hi>Dan. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezer</hi> among others whom hee would haue to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete his dreame, sendeth also for <hi>Mechashshephim.</hi> If these were poisoners what should they do about such a busines? we see that among the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> &amp; euen in the kings court, they were had in great estimation, as wise men, &amp; interpreters of secrets. If either the name it selfe had signifyed, or their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise shewed them to be poisoners, how could they haue bin estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? Is any man so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>bsurd as to thinke that kinges would take poisoners for their chief wise men? <hi>Moses</hi> doth report that when <hi>Aaron</hi> had cast downe his staffe before the R. of Egypt, &amp; it was turned into a serpent, he sent for his wise men, and his enchauntrrs and they did the like, For euery man cast downe his staffe before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and they were turned into serpents. These enchaunters which made the appearance of serpentes, and of frogges, &amp; of turning water into blood, are first in that place called <hi>Mechashshephim,</hi> and then <hi>Chartummim:</hi> what shall wee say then, that the king of Egypt called for poisoners, and that they were indeede but poisoners that wrought such feats before him? I suppose this is plaine inough vnto al that will not wilfully bend themselues to cauill, for to proue that <hi>Mechashshepha</hi> is not a poisoner, but a witch. This kinde is that which I mynd chiefly to speake off, with some that follow and therefore in this place I do omit to speake further.</p>
               <p>The 5 is called <hi>Chober chabar,</hi> which is one that doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunt by enchauntment. <hi>Chabar</hi> doth signify to associat and ioyne together: this enchaunter as it seemeth is so called of the society which he hath with the deuil. <hi>Lacha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For such as deale with deuils do know many things, which other men can not know so far as God doth permit vnto the deuil to reueale: this kind is commonly ioyned with <hi>Shoel Ob,</hi> and therefore thought to differ litle from the same. For they both wrought with the Deuill as doe the Witches, and also the Coniurers.</p>
               <p>Either of them no doubt may verie wel set forth both our Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Coniurers, though there seem to be great difference betweene them, which is no more in déed, but the craft of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. His auntient manner of practise with <hi>Shoelob</hi> and <hi>Iidde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoni</hi> haue bene detected, and therefore he hath turned thinges into an other forme, but the matter is the same. Coniurer go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one way to work, &amp; the witch an other, the one as it seemeth for on purpose, the other for an other, but yet the cheife end is all one. The eyght and last is called <hi>Doresh el hammethim,</hi> that is as much as to say, on which enquireth at the dead. This kind of witch was called of the grecians <hi>Necromantes,</hi> that is one which vseth diuinations by the dead. And the art it self was called <hi>Necromancia.</hi> I sée not how this could much differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But the deuill feined him selfe to be the soule of such or such a body, and handled the matter so that they could perceiue none other. Thus much may suffice for the names vsed in the holy scriptures.

haue power and scope no further vpon them, than he giueth strength and power of grace to resist, at the least so farre that the wicked one can not cause them to sinne vnto death. This then being out of al controuersie, that his power euen in that<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.</note> wherein it is greatest, and where he seemeth to haue his chiefe right, is limited: how shall it be deemed but that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the bodies of both men and beasts, or of anie other cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, he can doe nothing but vpon speciall leaue and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission graunted vnto him.

When God will haue him to touch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie creature, either man, beast, fish, foule, tree, corne, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, he flieth vpon it, and maketh the greatest shew that he can.</p>
               <p>These things are we plainlie taught in the holie scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not onelie by those which were possessed with diuels, and were greeuouslie tormented in bodie: but also by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying both men and cattell. In the booke of <hi>Iob</hi> the first chapter, we are plainely taught, first that the diuell could not touch <hi>Iob,</hi> nor any thing that was his, then that hauing leaue, he slew his children, destroied his seruants and cattell, and plagued him in his bodie with sores, the holie ghost doth so manifestlie teach that the diuell did this, that to denie it is flat impietie, and the vaine and friuolous cautls to prooue the contrarie not woorth the answering. The holie ghost doth applie himselfe in that place to our rude capacitie, It is very true: and so doth he in manie places of the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, doth it follow therefore that the things were not? We are not capable of things spirituall, and therefore they be set forth vnder the forme of things corporall and visible. We may not imagine that deuils thrust in themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the holie angels into the glorious presence of God in heauen. Neither must we suppose that GOD talketh with the diuell and he with him: but these and such like things are borrowed to set before vs things inuisible.</p>

God limitteth their boundes, he restraineth, he enlargeth them at his good pleasure. But how Satan doth knowe where leaue is giuen him, we cannot conceiue.

He knew that the theeues and murtherers which slewe his seruaunts and draue away his cattell, were stirred vp by the Deuill, he stayeth not aboute them nor yet about the Deuill, but looketh and addresseth himselfe vnto him which hath rule ouer men and Deuils, shall we say then God did it, therefore the Deuill did it not? It may be obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that if the Deuill did those thinges, then is hee able to raise vp mighty windes, tempestes, lightning and thunders.

First touching the Enchaunters of <hi>Egypt,</hi> might it not be that they made Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents indeede by naturall Magicke, for they which do know the secretes of nature may do things straunge &amp; meruellous, To this I answere, that if <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> did by their skil in the secrete power of nature, turne their staues into ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry serpents, I know few of the miracles of Christ, which they might not eyther doe, or as greate. Christ turned water into Wine. If those Enchaunters had bene there and by naturall Magicke had turned their staues into serpents, who woulde not, or might not iustly haue affirmed their miracle to be the greater? The workes which Christ did beare witnes of him, as he saith, to declare that he was the sonne of god. How could this testimonie bee infallible, if so greate thinges might bee wrought by the power of nature, we see then it is against pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie to bring such a thing in question, any way to beate it into mens heads. Againe, if those Magicians had such skill to worke by nature, they must needs go beyond nature her selfe, which were a foule absurdity to bee anye way graunted,
<pb facs="tcp:3288:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for they could bring forth serpents at an instant, and she can not bring forth the least things that grow, or that haue life but by degrees: take a little flie, first it is a fliblow, then a maggot, and afterwards commeth to haue wings, both god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and nature condemning such opinion of naturall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike, I will speake no further of it. It will be obiected that yet notwithstanding it doth not follow of necessitie that they did it by the diuell, for there is a third waie by which by all likelihood it was done, If there be but a third, as indeed it is vnpossible to find a fourth, and that it be proued not to be by that, then it must of necessitie be left vnto the first, that is to the diuell. Let vs see what that is: what absurditie say some can follow, if we affirme that they were very serpents indeed, and that God himself did make them, to the end that <hi>Pharaos</hi> hart might be hardened: I answer that here will greater absurditie follow, than by affirming that the sorcerers by their inchantments did make a shew of serpents, and that hee which coueteth to auoid <hi>Charibdis</hi> doth fall into <hi>Scylla,</hi> shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one danger, lighteth into a greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for (if men will see) there is no absurditie at all to affirme that the diuell did make appearance of serpents, but to saie the staues were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into verie serpents indeed, and that God did it, doth draw a taile after it which is not sweete. If this may be, or that these two might stand together, that God doth condemne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, and now worke by inchanters, yet how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd were this for any man to affirme, that the power of God did resist and withstand himselfe, for <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> came in the power of God, <hi>Paule</hi> saith <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> withstood them, if God turned their staues into Serpents, then God withstood them, &amp; his power was opposed against himselfe, his woonders were for to fight one against another. The Lord is brought in here on both sides, I know not what other men can see, but so farre as I can iudge, this is grosse impiette.</p>

But the strongest rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of all is yet behind to be gathered out of the speech vsed vnto <hi>Saule.</hi> The speech and phrase is such as agreeth not with the nature and purpose of a diuell, for the papists doe confesse that the diuell can not abide at the naming of God. They doe indeed, and such as beleeue them are not much wiser than they. The diuell seeketh for to draw men into sinne, and not to warne and rebuke them for euill as he doth <hi>Saule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this had beene a diuell, he would haue beene more craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie than to leaue so godly an admonition which should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall vnto his kingdome. Alacke, alacke, I see that those which take vpon them to be wiser than all men, are soonest deceiued by the diuell. Doth not saint <hi>Paule</hi> affirme that Sathan can transforme himselfe into the likenesse of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Can not he or doath not he vse right excellent godly speeches mixed with bad, to the end he may deceaue? There can not almost be a more subtil speech to establish ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable errors, than that which he here vseth vnto <hi>Saule?</hi> It is not disagreeing from his nature, nor any preiudice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his kingdome to speake good words, to the end hee maye doe hurt.</p>
               <p>Those were good words, and might seeme to be vttered vnwiselie to the decay of their owne kingdome, when diuels came out of many crieng and testifieng, That Iesus was the sonne of God: but they were craftilie spoken, and for a pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

               <p>What an excellent speeche doth the Dauill vtter out of the maide at <hi>Philippos,</hi> when she followed <hi>Paule</hi> and the other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters<note place="margin">Act. 16.</note> of the gospel which were with him? These men, saith that Deuill, be the sernants of the most high God which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you the way of saluation? What can be spoken more pithely in fewe wordes to set foorth the dignity of the Apostle and his companions? What can more commend the certainty and preciousnesse of their doctrine, he setteth foorth, and commendeth those ministers of the Gospell, to be the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of the most high God. What saith the Apostle more by the spirtte of God when he doth moue men to esteeme of him not as of a common person? Is not this the greatest dignitie he challengeth, <hi>Paule</hi> a seruant of God, an Apostle of Iesus Christ? What is more precious then saluation? Who ought to be more welcome? Then they whose doctrine doth guide men in the way thereunto? God himselfe doth send it, it must needes be infallible. Doth S. <hi>Paule</hi> say any more in effect, when he calleth the Gospell the word of reconciliation? And saith they were Embassadors from God to doe the message? Did the Deuill forget himselfe at this tyme? Was he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous indeede that <hi>Paule</hi> should be had in honour, &amp; that men should harken vnto his doctrine, to learne the way of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Would hee goe about to throwe downe or diminish his owne kingdome, or was he so sottish that he did not knowe what was against himself? This is more straunge, that the Deuils which gaue aunsweres being accounted Gods, and credite giuen vnto them and worshipped as Gods among the Heathen, would yet giue such a testimonie, there was no commendation esteemed so among the Heathen, such as at that time were the people of <hi>Philippos,</hi> so much as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation which <hi>Apollo</hi> gaue of any man.

Let vs obserue further some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumstances &amp; we shall easely see it was not the <hi>Witch</hi> nor any man or woman which spake thus vnto <hi>Saul.</hi> First this is a cleare case, that the <hi>Witch</hi> could not for certaintye know that <hi>Saul</hi> should be ouerthrown. For to say that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had forsaken him is vtterly false, he had (as the holy ghost reporteth) gathered all <hi>Israell</hi> vnto the battell, and mustred a great army, <hi>Saul</hi> was affraid, but yet hee kept it close from the people, for they set valiantly vpon the hoast of the <hi>Philisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> &amp; fought with them, then if the woman could not knowe for certaintie that <hi>Saul</hi> should at that time be ouerthrowne, how durst she plainly tell him that he should die, &amp; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in so short a space, euen the next day?

It will be aunswered that the Deuill could not know for certainey that <hi>Saul</hi> should be ouerthrown. It is very true, but yet he could collect more certainly then any man, he did see more on both sides then the <hi>Witch</hi> coulde gather by a few wordes, he knew what was the strength &amp; courage of the <hi>Philistians,</hi> and that they purposed to fight the next day, and what doubt was in the hart of <hi>Saul,</hi> the woman could not be sure when the battell would be.

And who is so simple in the knoweledg of Gods word and the Histories set forth therein, but must needes confesse, that it hath alwayes bin the manner of couseners and flatterers to tell Kinges of prosperous and good successe, and to speake pleasaunt things. Wherefore do couseners and flatterers practise their lewde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but for fauour and gaine? Can any be fit for such a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, which is so foolishe as to tell a King that hee shall be destroyed? Was this Kinge <hi>Saul</hi> growne contemptible and of no power? Wee may see in the Historie that hee was of greate force and dealte cruelly. For he destroyed <hi>Nob</hi> the Citie of the Priestes with the edge of the sworde, hee persecuted <hi>Dauid,</hi> and had many to set him on, durste now a poore woman dispise him? Was the forme of words vsed by <hi>Samuel</hi> so commonlie bruted abroade, and in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye mans mouth, that the verie <hi>Witch</hi> had it so perfectlie.

speeche vnto <hi>Saull</hi> it is said expresly, God will rend the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from out of thy hande, and giue it to <hi>Dauid.</hi> I doubt not but whosoeuer considereth these thinges, and is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bent to maintaine his owne conceite, hee will confesse that this was the Deuill, who knoweth what God speaketh by his Prophetes, and is right sure it will come to passe. Whereas the most part of men neuer regarde what the Lord hath spoken.</p>
               <p>The Deuill did speake vnto <hi>Eua</hi> out of the Serpent. A<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> thing manifest to prooue that Deuils can speake, vnlesse we immagine that age hath made him forgetfull and toungue tyde. Some holde that there was no visible Serpent before <hi>Eua,</hi> but an inuisible thing described after that manner, that we might be capable therof. The reasons which are brought for proofe are more then friuolous, and therefore I will but briefely touche them. It was the Deuill himselfe and not a snake which seduced <hi>Eua,</hi> that is moste true. For who doth maintaine that the beast was any more but the outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instrument which the Deuill vsed. This instrument was not a snake, but one of the greater beastes. For <hi>Nachash</hi> doth not onely signifie a snake, but also the beaste which is called a serpent. Whereof there be diuers kindes and some greater then other. <hi>Behemoth</hi> are beastes, among which wormes are not reckoned, and this Serpent is matched with them, as one of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When it is saide thou art cursed aboue euerye beaste. It is further saide, that if heere by the name Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent were ment both the Deuill and a beast, the holy ghost would haue made some distinction, that we might bee enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as though it were such an absurdity to set foorth the story as it did at that time appeare vnto <hi>Eua,</hi> and to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend vnder the name of that which was visible &amp; knowne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the instrument, the chiefe worker who was vnknowne &amp; invisible? <hi>Eua</hi> did not as yet know of the fall of Angels, shee knew no name of Deuill or Sathan, she did not vnderstande that there was a Deuill, no doubt God did instruct both <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Eua</hi> that there was another besides that visible ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb facs="tcp:3288:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when he promised them victory by Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> further this is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, that the Deuill is called a Serpent by an Allegorie, and therefore what necessity to take it there of a beast? I answere that the Deuil indeed is by a metaphor called a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in many places of holy scripture. But doth it therefore follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in this place was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And for learned interpretors of that Historie, as Maister <hi>Clauine</hi> and others, what iugling is it to alleage some of their sayings contrarie vnto their meanings, which do very well accorde with this, that the Deuill spake out of a beast indeede. It is thought a poore Snake shoulde not haue the cursse layde vppon him, for how coulde hee be guilty of anye sinne? This cannot stande with the iustice of GOD. I aunswere that Maister Painter hath deceaued many which take it to be a Snake, and touching this beaste the serpent, it standeth with the iustice of God that he should be accursed aboue euery beast. He is an ignoraunt man that knoweth not that euery beast, and the very earth it selfe had a cursse laide vpon them for mans sinne, they did not offend but were made for mans sake.</p>
               <p>Then if God in iustice layde a cursse vppon them, as to saye it were not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But to let those goe, this is the chiefe and principall, for the matter which I haue vndertaken, to shewe euen by the very storye that there was not onely the Deuill, but also a very corporall beaste. If this question bee demaunded, did <hi>Eua</hi> knowe there was anye Deuill, or anye wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate Angels. What man of knowledge will say that she did? She did not as yet knowe good and euill. She knewe not the authour of euill. When the Lorde sayde
<pb facs="tcp:3288:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Lord said vnto hir, What is this which thou hast done? she answereth by and by, The serpent deceiued me. Shee saw there was one which had deceiued hir, shee nameth him a serpent, whence had she that name for the deuill whome shee had not imagined to hee? It is plaine that she speaketh of a thing which had before this receiued his name.</p>
               <p>It is yet more euident by that she sayth, yonder serpent, or that serpent, for she not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Anie man of a sound mind maye easilie see that <hi>Eua</hi> nameth and pointeth at a visible beast, which was nombred among the Beastes of the fielde. The cursse is directed to both vnder one, because they were ioyned in one touching the worke, some thing in it cannot belong to the Serpent, as the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory by Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Likewise no allegorie can well mollifie some speeches to apply them vnto a spirite, as to goe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his brest, to eate dust all the daies of his life, then we see that Deuils can speake.

Here therefore is the chiefe matter of all, which is to disclose, and lay open the subtilty, the errors, and sinnes, which by this meanes he dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth men vnto. I will first begin with the coniurer and the
<pb facs="tcp:3288:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
witch, and all those which vse enthauntment. How miserable is their case, which are so fallen from the liuing God, to haue society aud felowship with deuils? The coniurer estemeth him selfe to be a great Lord and commaunder euen of deuils, and in deed hath no power to do any thing further then Satan is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and receiueth power from God, and moueth his wicked heart to deale in. This great bynder and commaunder of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, hath his own soule bound and commaunded by them, and is in miserable and vile captiuity.</p>
               <p>The Witch is not allso great, but yet the pore old hagge thinketh her selfe strong, that shee hath two or three seruants as she may seme to plague such as she is offended withall. Alas what an horrible state hath the feind brought her into, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be her seruant, and yet commaundeth her, and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>leth in her heart euen as her God. What greater victorie then that which he hath gotten ouersuch? The charmer often times kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no deuil: but with his charme of words he can catch rattes, and burst snakes, take away the paine of the tooth a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>he, with a paire of sheares and a siue, find out a theife. Many other pretie knackes hee glorieth in, as if he had attayned great wisedome. The art is deuillish, when any thing is done the deuil worketh it, he is the instructer of the enchaunter, and so indeed his Lord. What should I speake of al the rest, one word may suffice, they bee horrible deluded by the subtil serpent, and made his bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaues. This were much, though Satan could obtayne no more but euen to draw those miserable caitifs into so deepe a degree of wickednes. But this is not the chiefe thing he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by meanes of these to plunge the blind world headlong in the gulfe of wicked apostasie. And how he hath preuailed were a great and long trauell to set forth, only a tast may suffice. In old tyme among the heathen, and prophane nations he preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so farre that hee was taken to be God. His illusions, were esteemed to bee by a deuine power, for so <hi>S. Luke</hi> reporteth. <hi>Act. 8.</hi> where hee sheweth that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had long tyme by Magike astonished the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and they sayd hee was the great power of God: vntill the power of God did appeare
<pb facs="tcp:3288:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
indeed by the woonders which <hi>Phillip</hi> wrought, for then his were disclosed to be but illusions, sleights and shewes of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. For though the deuill can do thinges which are strange and wonderful vnto man (as he did by <hi>Simon</hi> make the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> woonder) yet in very deede<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they bee no true miracles, neither can he worke any, though God should giue him leaue to shew all his power. Further also among the heathen his answers were taken for the very oracles of God. From hence sprong the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lthy maner of woorshipping deuils, abhominable idolatry, and superstitions. Therfore the Lord commaundeth his people when hee had brought them out of Egipt that they should not geue eare vnto such as the heathen did. Hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth for to rayse vp alwayes vnto them a Prophet, as whose mouth they should learne to know his will, vnto whom they should harken. <hi>Deuteron. 18.</hi> We see then it is very manifest that while Satan stood in reputation to bee God, He applyed himselfe by witches and enchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters to set vp a religion where hee might bee most deuoutly worshipped. The most of all his practises tended to that purpose. At the comming of Christ, by the light of Christ, by the light of the Gospel, he was disclosed, and could couer himselfe no longer vnder so goodly a couering but was knowen indeed to be a Deuil. Now he must walke as a Deuil and seeke to deceiue after an other sort.</p>
               <p>And herein his subtilties haue also excelled, to the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of wickednes among the people. For when the light of Gods word was suppressed, as it was in the popery, then was a way made for him, to worke all his feates. Then did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inrers and witches, and enchanters abond. Then were al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of charmes rife and common. Then were a thousand ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall inuentions and toyes. To set forth all particulers were infiuite, therfore some few shall serue for all the rest. Satan hath a throne and a kingdome in the hart of euerie man, vntil such time as hee bee regenerate by the holy word of God, and that the power thereof be in him. He holdeth the hart in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes aud infidelitie, and filleth it full of all filthie lusts of sinne. He knoweth well that if he be espied, men could not but with
<pb facs="tcp:3288:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
horror abhorre there miserable estate, and seeke after some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Hee doth therefore seeke to deale <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>losly. Hee would make men beleeue that he is not nigh them. What redier way hath he to bring men into that opinion, then that they may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he is not abrode vnles he be fetched vp by coniurers, and breake away from them? If there be any terrible tempestes, and mighty thunders which set foorth the glory of God, then is he abroad. If hee can then get leaue of God, (as the wicked world is worthy that God should giue him power to deceiue them) hee will shew himselfe by some likelines in the middest of the storme, or else declare his presence by rending vp some trees or shewing some terror one way or other. Now there is great feare, for many beleeue that the deuil is abrode indeede, and hath raysed vp the windes, and brought the thunders.</p>
               <p>Then tales flie, and rumors are spred abrode, that there haue bene coniurers. They be taken say some, and the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed. Three deuils are broken loose, and others say fiue: thus is Satan magnifyed, when as the great woorkes of God are ascrybed vnto him. Hee carieth away the glorie which the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty should haue. How vile a thing is this? most miserable in this behalfe was the state of popery: for the great prelates &amp; graue fathers did beleeue this and led the people vnto it. And see what deuise they had. When any violent tempest came, they had the hollowed bell in euery steeple to bee rung, which did repell and keepe him backe. For hee could not come within the sound of that. They had coniured water to sprincle in euery corner of their houses, they had holy bread and crosses, that he could rest no where. These were his owne inuentions for to mocke the people, for he made them beleeue hee was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen away by these, when as in the meane time he ruled in their hartes. To come now to the witch, what hurt doth shee? If yee aske the common people, yee shall haue this answere: shee is the very pestilence of the earth, all calamity is brought vpon men by her. Shee killeth men and beastes. Shee tormenteth men, &amp; she destroyeth mens goods. No man can be in safety so long as shee liueth. Woe bee vnto him which doth displease
<pb facs="tcp:3288:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
her, thrise happy are they which do not meddle with her. Is not this foule hauocke trow yee, which the witches do make? Yea but how is it possible that poore old women should do such thinges? O syr, they do it not by themselues. They haue their spirites which they keepe at home in a corner, some of them twoo, some three, some fiue: these they send when they be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> them for to plague a man in his body, or in his cattle. This matter hath bene tryed: for diuers well disposed men, euen for very pity to see what hurt witches do by sending their spirites, haue seriously taken the matter in hande, and haue hunted those puckrils out of their neaites. And what haue they found? they haue found that some one woman hath had three. They haue found where shee kept them in wooll.</p>
               <p>What meate shee gaue them, What likenes they had, What were their names, Whether they were hees or shees, and how many men they had killed. Some haue bene han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and haue at the gallowes confessed the whole matter. Who is able to declare the brutish errors and foule sinnes which multitudes are led into, by this craftye dealing of the dealing of the Deuil. For my selfe I do not thinke that I can shew the tenth part. But yet I see so much as may make any Christian hart bleede to beholde. I will endeuor to open the collusion of Satan and his purpose in this thing, so far as I can: with the follies which the blinde multitude fall into, and do not espie the same.</p>
               <p>First then for the maner. The poore old witch, pined with hunger, goeth abroad vnto some of her neighbours, and there begge a little milke which is denied. Shee threatneth that she will be euen with them. Home shee returneth in great fury, cursing, and raging, Forth shee calleth her spirite, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him to plague such a man. Away goeth hee. Within few howres after the man is in such torment, that he can not tell what hee may doe. Hee doth thinke himselfe vnhappy that he was so foolish to displease her.</p>
               <p>What shal wee say vnto these things? Is here no packing? Is not here first of all a way taken by the wiely and wicked
<pb facs="tcp:3288:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
serpent to bring men in beliefe that hee is not nigh them, nor medleth not vnlesse his dame send him? Hee goeth about like a roaring Lyon, seeking whom he may deuour, as <hi>Saint Peter</hi> sayth, Shall wee bee so sottish to beleeue that hee lyeth at the witches house? hee is a mighty tyrant, if God do suffer him, that hee beyng a spirite do take vpon him the shape of some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vermin, as cat or weasill, it is but to deceiue. He lyeth and sleepeth in warme wool, the witch doth giue him milke, or a chicken, and hee doth eate, these are vain illusions, what nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hee such thinges? he resteth not, hee eateth not, he slepeth not. How much greater folly is it to enquire of his sexe? as though there were hee deuils and shee deuils? But to come nigher vnto this tragedie. Doth not shee send him? yes shee doth send him which did send her first. Who put into her heart to begge of that man? had hee no stroke in the matter that hee would denie her request? are they not for the most part in as great blindnes and infidelity almost as the witch is, which are bewitched: hee knoweth well ynough where hee maketh his match: Shee doth furiously rage and curse: doth not the deuil worke it in her heart? wel, the man is tormented indeede, who doth that? here is great cunning. Sometime he doth it: some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tyme he maketh a shew that he doth it, when it is not so: when hee doth it who geueth him the power? did the witch? they bee voide of reason which thinke so. Had hee power and lay still while shee sent him, not minding to do any thing, vnlesse hee were requested? what foole can imagine that? How is this thing then? doubtles this wicked deuill either did know that God had geuen him power, and so did stirre vp and set on the witch: or else he did see great likelihood that God would giue him leaue to torment the man in his body or his goods because of his wicked life and infidelity, For hee is neuer wearie, but secketh all occasions. And we haue so flat testimonies of Gods word, that (where God gaue him leaue) hee tormented the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men, that such as affirme hee can not plague that way, shew themselues ouer bold agaynst the truth.

               <p>For hee seeth the humours in the bodies of men, and beasts. Hee seeth the rootes and causes of diseases, and when they wil come foorth. Hee stirreth his dame, or rather his poore vass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Ther was natural cause of lamenes of sicknes and death which the Lord sent, and Satan would haue it layd vpon him. The witch seeth such effectes follow, and gathereth for certaynty that shee did it. The man cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to mynd how hee displeased her, and how shee did threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him, and now is sure shee did it. These are part of his wayes, let vs looke further. He is a bloody murtherer and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to draw men into periury and cruelty. Hee seeketh therefore to bring many such vnto their death for witchcraft as are no witches. Some woman doth fal out bitterly with her neighbour: there followeth some great hurt, either that God hath permitted the deuil to vex him: or otherwise. There is a suspicion conceiued. Within fewe yeares after shee is in some iarre with an other. Hee is also plagued. This is noted of all. Great fame is spread of the matter. Mother <hi>W.</hi> is a witch. She hath bewitched goodman <hi>B.</hi> Two hogges which died strangely: or else hee is taken lame.

Well neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, sayth one, do ye not suspect some naughty dealing? did yee neuer anger mother <hi>W?</hi> truly neighbour (sayth he) I haue not liked the woman a long tyme. I can not tell how I should

displease her, vnlesse it were this other day, my wife prayed her, and so did I, that shee would keepe her hennes out of my garden. Wee spake her as fayre as wee could for our liues. I thinke verely shee hath bewitched me. Euery body sayth now that mother <hi>W</hi> is a witch in deede, and hath bewitched the good man B. Hee can not eate his meate. It is out of all doubt: for there were which saw a weasil runne from her hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into his yard euen a little before hee fell sicke. The sicke man dieth, and taketh it vpon his death that he is bewitched: then is mother <hi>W</hi> apprehended, and sent to prison, shee is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayned and condemned, and being at the gallows, taketh it vppon her death, that shee is not gylty: and doubtles some are put to death not beyng gylty. Now let vs see what the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil hath gayned by this practise. For though at sometymes the coniectures fall out right, yet many times there is innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t blood shed: which is a greuous sin.

Yea sundry tymes the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of children is taken accusing their owne mothers, that they did see them giue milke vnto little thinges which they kept in wooll, The children comming to yeares of discretion confesse they were entised to accuse. What vile and monstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse impieties are here committed: It falleth out sometyme that some visitation lighteth vppon some person man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Either the deuill doth torment indeed, or els the party faineth to be tormented (which hath bene often seeue) and then accuseth such a woman to haue sent the deuil. It is strange to see the madnes of the people, that wil aske the deuill who sent him. And then he telleth who is his dame, and to how many she hath sent him, and how many hee hath kylled. If it were the Deuill indeede, would they beleeue him? Is it not his desire to bring innocent persons into daunger? Would not bee very gladly haue a number of men periure and forsweare themselues? doth the Lord will men to goe vpon their oth in a matter, at the testimony of a deuill?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3288:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>Who would thinke that euer such brutish ignorance should be found in men, in the tyme of the Gospell? This is also a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise which would make a man tremble to thinke vpon it, that there should euer such abhominable beastlinesse bee found in a land where Christianitie is professed: If they doe suppose that one is bewitched, they enquire after a wise man or a wise wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to learne who hath done the déede. If it be not meere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt but that the partie hath a deuill, &amp; telleth them indéed the man is bewitched, and describeth such or such an olde woman, Yet let me aske a fewe questions. First, I demaund whether it be allowed for any man to deale with the deuill? Is not that man by the commaundement of God to be put to death which hath a familiar spirite? Are not they then almost as euill as he, which seeke vnto him? No doubt it is a cléere case and cannot be coloured. But I shall after haue occasion to prooue it by the testimonies of the holy Scripture, and therefore I doe omit the same now. Then further I do demaund whether they will beléeue the deuil? Do they thinke he will accuse a giltie person or an innocent soonest? Doe they or can they imagine that the deuill will bewray any thing that shal do good? Will one deuil doe that which shalbe to the hinderance of another? No doubt it is a iust vengaunce vppon men that haue despised the light, that they bee thus giuen ouer to forsake God, and to followe after deuils. I will procéede yet further to lay open the filthie vices which the people are drawne into by witchcraft, whiles indéede they bewitch themselues through infidelitie. A man is sicke, his sicknesse doth linger vpon him, Some doe put into his head that he is bewitched, He is counselled to send vnto a cunning woman, She saith he is forspoken indéede, she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth them what to vse, there must be some charme and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie vsed. The partie findeth ease, &amp; is a glad man, he taketh it that he hath made a good market, it was a luckie hower whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sent to that woman. For doubtlesse he did thinke that if he had not found so speedie a remedie, the Witch would vtterly haue spoyled him. Now the deuill is driuen out of him and is gone. The wise woman with her Familer was too strong for
<pb facs="tcp:3288:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him. O that the hearts of men were not turned into the hearts of beasts, but that they would consider. Is Satan become a weldoer? Is hee so charitable and so pitifull that hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue mens miseries? Or doth one deuill cast foorth another? Doth the weaker giue place vnto the stronger? Is Satan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided against Satan? Some man will replye that this is a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thing and well tried by experience, that many in great distresse haue bin reléeued and recouered by sending vnto such wise men or wise women, when they could not tel what should els become of them, and of all that they had. Shall not men take helpe where they can find it? Why do men go vnto Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicions? Let it be graunted that men finde helpe by Witches, Yet this must néedes be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, that as it is for the most part a plague and token of Gods displeasure, where he hath power graunted him to vexe: so is it a more heauie iudgement, which the wicked world hath deserued, that he is suffered to heale. For now they cannot say that the Lord is their health and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but their Phisicion is the deuill. As all the workes of God are good, and vnto right good end: so of necessitie all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans workes be euill and to most deuilish purpose. If he haue power giuen him to possesse and to plague the bodie: he is not driuen out, (for Satan doth not driue out Satan) but healeth the bodie, to the end he may the more fully possesse and destroy the soule. His charitie and his pitie are no better. O miserable health so recouered. O wretched men so relieued: they do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the deuill is driuen out of them, and he hath entred in déeper. For can that which is deuilish, as a charme, driue out the deuil? They say it is such as doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sist of good words. It is so much the more blasphemous and abhominable. For the name of God and the sentences of his holy word, are most shamefully abused vnto sorceries, which is one speciall thing which the deuill doth couet. He which seeketh helpe in sicknes at the hands of a Phisicion, doth that which is lawfull being ordeyned of God, For he hath giuen the nature &amp; properties vnto things, which shall serue for medicine. Shall a man ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hold it lawfull to seeke helpe at the deuill. Well, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede

further. A man hath a siluer cup missing, all corners are sought but yet it cannot be found: straungers there came none vnto his house: needes must it be one of his own seruants that hath plaied the théefe. Euery man deuyeth the matter, &amp; sayth he sawe it not. Here is dubble griefe, not so much for the losse of the cup, as that a man should haue a théefe in his house and not know him. And which is more, it may be that he whom he most suspecteth is least giltie: were it not good to haue meanes for to trye out such a matter? He could bee content to ride xl. miles to haue it tryed. He enquireth secretly where there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cunning man of great fame, Thether he hasteth. Home he returneth &amp; in very déede findeth the cup, &amp; knoweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> théefe, though he may not bewray him. What shal we thinke of this? Euen that one deuill hath plaied the whole play, &amp; euery part thereof: &amp; therfore it is all alike for good. First the deuill temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the seruant to steale the cup: The selfe same deuill put into the mind of the maister to seeke vnto a cunning man.

They should not commit spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall whoredome with deuilles, as the Lord doth here charge those which seeke vnto deuilles. What a foule thing is this, that such as haue made a solemne vowe in baptisme, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the deuill and all his workes, should now séeke vnto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles for helpe?

Then how much more are these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to bee rooted out, which haue so vnfaithfully broken their vowe made vnto GOD, and haue committed whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with deuills. If there were no other hurt but this by witchcraft, you sée the deuill hath gained much: when many giue counsell, and many doo seeke vnto such as haue familiare spirits, and so in effect, fall from the liuing God. I might stay here and procéede no further to shew what doth mooue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill to doo such things by Witches, as he could doo as well without them: and what doth mooue him to heale such as are hurt, to reueale things which are lost or stolen, and as it were to doo good: But I goe a litle further, and shew great and generall mischiefes.

But men looke no further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> witch: they fret &amp; rage against her: they neuer looke so high as vnto God: they looke not to the cause why y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> deuil hath power ouer them: they seeke not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease Gods wrath, But they fly vpon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> witch: they think if shee were not, they should doo well enough: shee is made the cause of all plagues &amp; mischiefes: whereas in very deede she is but an Instrument which the deuill vseth for a colour: their owne wickednesse hath prouoked God to anger, &amp; to giue the deuill power ouer them. It is their own infidelity which hath bewitched them: they should now turne vnto God, and they runne after the deuill: For some fall vpon the Witch and beate her, or clawe her, to fetch blood: that so her spirite may haue no power. These are well after, for the deuill is glad to make them Witches. For when as they ascribe power vnto such things to driue out deuils, what are they but Witches? Some runne vnto the Witch when any friend of theirs is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, and threaten her, that if she doe not take home her spirite, and if that he come any more they will cause her to bée hanged. They should runne only vnto God by a liuely faith, true repentance and hartie prayer, to haue the deuill remooued; and they runne vnto the Witch, &amp; ascribe vnto her that which doth belong only vnto God: for they thinke that she hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to send the deuill, and to take him off. Alas, is there any true faith in these men? The deuill hath bewitched them, to kéepe them out of the way of repentaunce, and to make them his bondslaues.</p>

It may be, they be so blind and so wicked, that God hath giuen power vnto the deuill to make hauocke indéede. He mooueth the Witch, and she sendeth him. Their sinnes they looke not vpon, but how to ouercome the power of the Witch, as they imagine. And what doe they? They take a Hogge or some other beast and burne it aliue. Doth this driue away the deuill? Sure if it doe, it is not because it doth

ouercome him, but because he is delighted with their burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring which they offer vnto him.

These bee the fruites of Poperie, which hath remooued away the light, and left the people in the dark to be deluded by the deuill: which remooued away the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall armour wherewith the soule should bee defended and taught the people verie witcheries.

Wee sée that it is a most clere case, that God ordreth all by his good proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The witch can doo nothing, for the deuill which is farre greater then she can doo nothing. But the wicked world full of all contempt of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth deserue that the deuill should haue power to worke many feates, to the end they may haue strang delusion, and the efficacie of error come vpon them. This doth <hi>S. Paul</hi> set foorth <hi>2. Thess. 2.</hi> For there wee may sée that Satan hath libertie giuen him to shewe his efficacie with the power of lying Signes and woonders. If Satan coulde make no shew or appearance of woonders, by doing things which are beyond the reach of man to counterfait, why should it bee called a power and efficacie, and why should they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led signes and lying woonders? Our Sauiour him selfe, <hi>Math. 24. vers. 24.</hi> doth shew that there should arise false Christs, and false Prophets, and should giue great signes and woonders. I conclude therefore, that as the righteous God
<pb facs="tcp:3288:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doth permit &amp; suffer the deuill, for the wickednes of the world, to shew foorth an efficacie and power, By giuing signes and woonders (y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is such things as men are not able to doo, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doo account them woonders, though they be no true woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in déed, nor wrought vnto a good end, but to establish false religion) so doth he let loose the same deuill, or suffer him to doo many things by Witches and Coniurers, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisers of the holy religion may bee seduced. There hath bene meere cosinage in most of the popish miracies: (For if they had bene done as they report, they should haue bene mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in deede, and the deuill is able to doo no miracle, but to make a shew by illusion) yet were they belieued by occasion of those shewes which hee made at some times.

These be his words, the man or the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in whom there shall be <hi>Ob</hi> or <hi>Iiddegnoni,</hi> shall dye the death. Out of which places we may collect the true cause of this seueritie to bée in very déede the familiaritie with deuils. The deuils be the vtter enemies of GOD, which seeke by all meanes to dishonor him and to deface his glorie. How can any then vse familiaritie with them, vse their helpe, or seeke vnto them, but he committeth a monstrous enormitie, and such as deserueth a thousand deathes. Moreouer the Witch, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurer, the Enchaunter, the Sorcerer, and the rest are the cause of foule errors and much wickednesse, much horrible abusing Gods holy and sacred name, and therefore are woorthie to dye. This being the true cause why God doth abhorre such, as it is manifest, we may easily sée the grosse error of the blind mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, in this behalfe. For they hold that witches should bee put to death, and not onely that, but are inflamed with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull rage and fury to haue it accomplished.

is a false cause, for where doo we euer finde in the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that Witches or Coniurers haue such things layd vnto their charge? I haue shewed the priuy packing which Satan vseth in this behalfe. When men are once so be witched as to thinke, who can liue in safety while witches remaine: they run with madnesse to séeke all meanes to put them to death, &amp; not onely them, but all such as are suspected. They run to Coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to know if they be not witches who they suspect. They examine witches to know whether their spirites haue not told them how many witches be within certaine miles of them, &amp; who they be. The Lord doth not alow one witnesse being a man in a cause of death to be sufficient: but these would alow the accusation of one deuill if he accuse xl. persons: they thinke it a merueilouse charitable deede where there is one that hath bene suspected for witchery, to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Many Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers neuer weigh the force of the euidence which is brought, but as if they had their oth for coniectures or likelihoodes, they are oftentimes very forward to finde guilty, being sicke of the same disease that the accusers be. But some man will reply &amp; demaund why the people should not be so earnest to séeke their death &amp; rooting out? why should it be reputed as a fault? they doo it of a good minde, &amp; to the glory of God. In déed if it could be shewed that they doo it in regard of Gods glorie it were of a good minde &amp; much to be comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: but it is manifestly to be prooued that Gods glory is not regarded. For if the people did regard Gods glory, they would hate witchchraft, &amp; shew their vehemency against it, because his dishonor is much procured thereby, as when men go for help vnto his enimy: but we sée they hate not that. But if a man or child be sick, they run vnto a witch, they hate not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ioyning in compact with deuils, when as they runne for help vnto them: they haue somewhat lost or stole: they doo by &amp; by fly vnto deuils: they make account that those be good witches &amp; do no harme. But in very déed they be as euill as other witches, for they haue felowship with deuills
<pb facs="tcp:3288:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which is the chiefe fault, for those da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mages which they ascribe vnto witches, are not in their hand to giue power to the deuill for to doo: Then if they did it for loue of God they would hate these also: but we sée they doo not only alow them, but make of them. God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth in his law that all that haue familier spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits should be put to death, &amp; yet I say the faithles people doo make much of them, &amp; alow of them.

The Lord saith he would raise vp a Prophet vnto the people <hi>Deut. 18.</hi> Those which giue eare vnto him shalbe safe. Some man will say that is but in this one poynt, that he shall not be deceiued by such as wrought by the deuil, nor led into error. But where is there any remedie mentioned to preserue a man from the bodily harmes done by Witches? I aunswer, that it were a straunge thing for the holy Scriptures to appoynt a medicine for such a disease as it neuer mentioneth. The word of the Lord doth neuer mention that Witches can hurt the bodie at all: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth no where prescribe any remedie for that which is not. The malignant spirits or wicked deuils, doe hurt both bodies and soules: and therefore there is a way taught how to be frée from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: They haue no increase of power by a Witch: but only thus much, that for the iust vengeaunce of God vpon the vngodly, the is glad to bee sent, and obteyneth power: but he that is armed against them alone, is armed against both witch and them. Against them there is no power can preuaile, but the power of God. Therefore when the holy Apostle doth set men in battell against deuils, he willeth them to be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. This mightie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God is made ours onely by faith. For which cause S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith that faith is our victorie. He that beléeueth doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome the world: which cannot bee vnlesse he doe ouercome the prince of the world. This faith is the free gift of God: but yet because he hath ordeyned outward meanes to come vnto it, we are willed to take vnto vs all the whole armour of God
<pb facs="tcp:3288:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wherein this might consisteth. And to the end that the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may the more affect vs, Saint <hi>Paule</hi> doth expresse the whole matter vnder the likenesse and termes of warre. For thereby appeareth that there is néede of Gods power, that we may escape out of the great perrill. The Apostle as a chiefe Captaine in the Lords Armie, doth stirre vp and prepare all Christian souldiers. He sheweth who be the enemies. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth their terror in sundrie respects. But yet vndoubted vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie vnto all those which followe his prescript. All the power of God wherewith wee resist and ouercome the deuill, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed into vs by faith alone. But because he speaketh as of a souldier in his compleat armour, he applieth but one part vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to faith, and the rest vnto those things which doe goe vnsepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably with faith. The souldier had his head and all parts of his bodie with his legges and feete armed: then had he his sword in his right hand, and his shield in the left. Euen so in this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall armour applyed by similitude vnto the soule, here is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour for the head, for the feet and legges, and for al the whole bodie, and then the shield of faith to hold foorth in the one hand, and the spirituall sword which is the word of God in the other hand. The summe of the whole is, that by faith in the Gospell of Iesus Christ we are armed with power of grace, with true knowledge and light, with sincere integritie of heart, and with a godly life, with zeale, with patience, and with all other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly vertues, so that the fierie darts of the deuill, neither in tempting vnto filthie sinnes, nor yet in damnable heresies and opinions, can fasten vpon vs. If wee want the true faith, wee want grace: we be not in Christ, we haue not his spirit. This faith is grounded vpon the word of God: for the word is sent to bee preached, that men may heare and beléeue. If men bée ignorant in the word of God, they cannot haue power to resist the deuill: they haue no sword to fight with him. Christ our great Captaine hath left vnto vs an example which we ought to follow, when he resisted the deuill. For at euery temptation, he draweth foorth this same spirituall sworde, and saith it is written, and so woundeth Satan therewith, that he taketh the
<pb facs="tcp:3288:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
foyle. Moreouer, as men are to bee armed with the power of GOD, so are they continually to pray, for by faithfull prayer they shall obtaine a continuall supplie of grace, to ouercome the new and fresh assalts of the deuill. We are to giue thanks also vnto God at all tymes for his benefites, to depend vppon his prouidence, to commend vnto his keeping both our soules and bodies, and all that we possesse. Thus shall the deuill haue no power for to hunt vs: but if the Lord doe giue him leaue to afflict vs, yet shal it be no further then may tend vnto our good. For all things worke together for good vnto those which doe loue God. Let it mooue vs to seeke increase of faith, by often hearing of Gods word taught: let it driue vs vnto continuall<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> meditation in the same, and vnto a godly life. For all those which despise the glorious Gospell of Christ, or the publishing of the same, and most especially such as fight against it, doe to their power set vp the kingdome of the deuill, and bring in all witcherie. The light of the Gospell doth beate him downe: and therefore when Christ sent foorth his Disciples at the first to preach, and they returning reioyced, that euen the deuilles were made subiect vnto them: he saith, I saw Satan fall downe from heauen like lightning. The Lord send abroad the light of his truth to throw downe Satan, and to driue away darknes from the mindes of the people.</p>
