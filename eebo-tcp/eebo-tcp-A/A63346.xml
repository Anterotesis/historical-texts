            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat there hath been a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie between the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Angl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> (the immediate consequence of which hath been the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Earl from a Place of great Honor and Trust under his Majesty, for which he was in every respect extraordinarily well qualified perhaps no man questions. And many may be likely to say, that the more fatal such quarrels amongst great Persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are to either side, the more instructive they commonly prove to the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who are thereby let into a Prospect of those things which were thought too sacred for the view of the profane Vulgar.</p>
            <p>As every inferior Soldier may learn Skill &amp; Address, by seeing two Generals engage in the sight of their Armies, so certainly this Paper Battel between these Great ones may be of use to all sorts of men that have the lest Grain of that commendable Ambition, to propound to themselves the greatest Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Wherefore I conceive no man, of which
<pb facs="tcp:41251:3"/>
side soever Fortune or Choice hath placed him, can blame me for procuring and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to publick view authentick transcripts of what hath passed in this Affair.</p>
            <p>The bare curiosity to know how such men write, were almost enough to tempt any one to peruse these papers, but then when they relate to the History of unmovable Affairs, of which eitherof the parties may say,
<q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quorum pars magna fui.—</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
And when they were so great men in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, &amp; their Parts in the History so great that they may be compared to <hi>Caesar</hi> writing the Commentaries of his own Enterprises; I should think him very dull that need be courted to be a Reader</p>
            <p>But these Papers carry in them what I hope vvill further recommend and endear them to the greater part of this Nation; most of them being in defence of the poor English Protestants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to some of vvhich the Earl of <hi>Anglesey</hi> hath most generously assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the glory of their Martyrdom, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the unblemished honor of preventing the utter ruin &amp; extirpation of the rest.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> who had been too too fortunate an Head to the RomanCatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb facs="tcp:41251:3"/>
Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> had not only in Print justified his own engagement with <note place="margin">E, Castlehav. Memoirs, p. 12.</note> that bloody Party, butwould make that chiefly a Defensive War, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was certainly the effect of an universal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy amongst the Papists there. Nor is it to be doubted but there were Encouragers in <hi>England.</hi> This engaged the Earl of <hi>Anglesey,</hi> amidst his many avocations, to ward off the second blow against them who had suffered almost beyond all Example before: and his interposition extracted from the Earl of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlehaven</hi> a Confession, that he himself <note place="margin">Pref. to the Memoirs.</note> acted as a Rebel, and that all the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Sea cannot wash that Rebellion off that Nation, which was begun most blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily on the <hi>English</hi> in that Kingdom in a time of a setled Peace, without the least occasion given.</p>
            <p>I must confess there are several passages in the Letter to the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> wherein the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> seems concerned to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his own actions. How far the Charge or the Defence is made good, it is not for me to judge: nor shall I in the least enter into the merits of it.</p>
            <p>I am sure the Earl of <hi>Anglesey</hi> made a most noble Declaration, fit to be written in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="tcp:41251:4"/>
of Gold; <hi>Truth,</hi> says he, <hi>being the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and best Friend, I had rather one or several</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This being the said Earlsavowed Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, methinks he ought to be importunedby a publick Address, that what he hath medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and hath been <hi>preparing from Records and authentick unquestionable Relations and</hi>

                        <opener>The Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Your Majesties Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Steward of Your Majesties Houshold, most humbly represents:</opener>
                        <p>THat the Earl of <hi>Anglesey</hi> Lord Privy-Seal, in the Year 1681. caused a Book to be Printed (whereof he hath acknowledged himself to be the Author) intituled <hi>A Letter from a Person of Honour in the Country, written to the Earl of</hi> Castlehaven, <hi>being Observations and Reflections upon his Lordships Memoirs concerning the Wars of</hi> Ireland.</p>
                        <p>That in the said Book there are divers passages and expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are not only untrue, but reflecting in a high degree upon His Late Majesties Government, and particularly in Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Rebellion and War in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to the several Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations and Peaces made by His, and Your Majesties Authority and Command.</p>
                        <p>That in the said Book the Lord Privy-Seal hath Malitiously endeavour'd to Calumniate and Asperse the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> by calling in question his Faithfulness and Loyalty to His Late Majesty, the Sincerity of his Profession in point of Religion, and insinuating that the Cessations and Peaces (destructive as he says to the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Protestants)</hi> were advised and procured by him the said Duke, out of his Affection to the <hi>Irish Popish Rebells,</hi> because he was Allyed to many of them in Blood and by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</p>
                        <p>That the Lord Privy-Seal in the course of above Twenty Years free and friendly Acquaintance and Correspondence with the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> never thought fit to give him any intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Lordships Intention to write a History of the Wars of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and other transactions there, wherein both the Duke and his Lordship (tho' of opposite Parties) had a great part, but chose rather to seek for information from the Earl of <hi>Castle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven,</hi> and to publish his <hi>Observations on the Earl of</hi> Castleha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'<hi>s Memoirs,</hi> in a Conjuncture when his Reflections in his Book and his Letter of the <hi>Seventh</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1681. to the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> might not only do most mischief to him, but to the Government. The Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> humbly conceives that at least, while the Lord Privy-Seal and he have the honor to be of your Majesties Privy Council, and in the stations they are, it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41251:5"/>
will not be fit for him to publish such an Answer to the Lord Privy-Seal's Book and Letter, as might otherwise be necessary in Vindication of Truth, His Late Majesties Justice and Honor, and his own Integrity.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore most humbly proposed, That Your Majesty would be pleased to appoint a Committee of your Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to look over the Lord Privy-Seal's Book, and to call his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> before them, and if upon Report from them, it shall appear to your Majesty that the Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glesey</hi> has fallen into the Mistakes and Errors herein laid to his Charge, That then Your Majesty would be pleased to Consider of the best and most Authentick means how Reparation may be made to all that are injured by the Earl of <hi>Anglesey</hi>'s Book and Letter, and to prevent the Credit his great Place, supposed Knowledge (especially in the Affairs of <hi>Ireland)</hi> and his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Candor and Impartiality may give to his Writings, in these and future times.</p>

                  <p>I <hi>Am in the first place to beg Your Majesties Pardon for my Obedience to Your Order for appearing here this day, being in no condition of health to have left my Bed, and altogether unfit for the presence of the King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And indeed I expected that the Duke of</hi> Ormond <hi>would rather have Complained and Printed against the Earl of</hi> Castlehaven <hi>his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs; which Aspersed and Scandalised Your Royal Father's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and represented the Protestants of</hi> Ireland <hi>as Rebells, and the Confederate</hi> Irish <hi>Papists as Loyal Subjects, then against me, who had Vindicated His Majesties Government, and his Protestant Faithful Subjects so Effectually in my Letter to the said Earl, That his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in an Epistle to the Reader which he after added to his</hi> Memoirs, <hi>confessed himself and the</hi> Irish <hi>Confederates the Rebells:</hi> And that all the Water in the Sea would not wash that Rebellion off that Nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is the first quarrel I ever had with any man, and Your Majesty sees how it is brought upon me, and cannot but believe it very unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to me from one who hath so many Years professed Friendship to me. But that which troubles me in it is, That it is pretended to be upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my failing in Duty to His Late Majesty and Your Self, whereas if I can pretend to Merit in any thing, it is for Exemplary and Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Faithfulness and Service to You both.</hi>
                  </p>

SIR, <hi>That I may not trouble You with much Discourse, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Vindication of my Innocence to Writing, which I present for my Answer to the Duke of</hi> Ormond'<hi>s Accusation, and to which I shall add no more but my desire, That tho' the Duke of</hi> Ormond <hi>hath thought fit to Attaque me thus causelesly, all the Contention hereafter between him and me may be who shall serve Your Majesty best, and cost You least.</hi>

            <p>In the next place all the Papers Written and Printed, that had passed between the Duke and the Lord Privy-Seal, were read as they lay in order, and both the Lords discoursed and bandied the matter fully, which the King heard with great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: The Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> notwithstanding doing that right to the Lord Privy-Seal, as to Acknowledge that none had been more Active and Instrumental in his Majesties Happy Restauration, or carried it on with more Success in great Dangers and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than his Lordship. In conclusion the Duke was Ordered to charge the Lord Privy-Seal by particulars in Writing, that he might know what to Answer, generals not being sufficient, and so that business was left at that time.</p>
            <p>Now follows the Lord Privy-Seal's Answer to the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> Representation or Complaint against him.</p>

                        <opener>The Earl of <hi>Anglesey</hi> Keeper of your Majesties Privy-Seal, (mistead by an ill President admitted) most humbly represents.</opener>
                        <p>THat having this <hi>Eighteenth</hi> day of <hi>June,</hi> received in Bed, where he had continued for above a Month last past, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much afflicted with the Gout, and deprived of the use of Hands and Leggs, and by reason of Pains and Sicknesses getting little rest, which he hath reason to believe was well known to the Duke of <hi>Ormond;</hi> your Majesties Order in Council of the <hi>Seventeenth,</hi> with a Copy of the Representation of the said Duke an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, and Command to attend your Majesty in Council on <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> next, at <hi>Three</hi> of the Clock in the Afternoon at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> which he resolves by Gods Blessing to do if he shall be in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Health and Strength to be carried thither, without Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of his Life; which he doth not believe that the Duke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thinks, after a year and halfs concerning himself in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, is to be adventured to gratifie a hasty proposal, upon his changing his way of proceeding.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, That your Majesty may not be under the least prepossession by what the Duke hath represented with heat, and sharpnels against the said Earl, he doth humbly offer to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, That though the Duke appear before your Majesty, as a Representer, the said Earl cannot but look upon him as a Petitioner, the Title by which all Subjects that complain, Address to your Majesty, and for want of which he hath observed many Suitors rejected with their Requests.</p>
                        <p>And therefore your Majesty is desired to be informed in the first place by a deduction of all that hath passed between the Duke and the Earl in this Affair, which is as followeth.</p>
                        <p>The Book complained of was written about two years ago by meer Accident of the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven</hi>'s sending his Printed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs, to the Earl then at <hi>Blethington</hi> in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> where having read the same, and conceiving the <hi>English,</hi> and Protestants to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly dealt with therein, and the <hi>Irish</hi> foul Cause professedly justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, though the most Execrable Rebellion that ever was in the World; the Earl could not digest the same, but upon a bare Old Memory without help of Writings or Notes, immediately put pen to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41251:7"/>
paper and the <hi>Eighth</hi> of <hi>July</hi> wrote a Letter to the said Earl of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> which he believes his Lordship hath yet to shew, tho' when it appeared afterwards in print, about <hi>October,</hi> 1680. one was sent to his Lordship taking Notice thereof, and asking him what he had done with the said Letter, who then Confessed he had lent it to a Friend, but he would recover it again. The Letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus Printed, the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> had soon sight of it, for in his Letter to the Earl of <hi>Anglesey</hi> of <hi>November</hi> the <hi>12th.</hi> 1681. he takes Notice that he had seen it a Year before, and writes his Pleasure of it so Satirically, that the said Earl returned his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> following, which the said Duke takes Notice of in his said Representation, though he never before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Receipt thereof, nor was pleased to make any Reply to it, though it gave him sufficient occasion: thus (when the said Earl expected a Reply) things stood till the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint made to your Majesty, which he humbly submits whether it be fit to be received or proceeded upon in Council, after so open a litigation thereof in Print, wherein the said Duke had appealed to the People, and accused the Earl with as much Acrimony as it was possible for the Duke's sharp Pen to do, it being as the said Earl conceives, below the dignity of Your Majesty and the Board, after the Duke has proceeded so far in a private Quarrel of his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, without Success, (and that those the Duke had appealed to seemed generally satisfied that the Earl had fully Vindicated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the Aspersions laid upon him by the Duke's said Letter) for your Majesty to be Addressed to so late, and in a Cause so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; wherein the Earl had justified himself in the method the Duke himself lead him, and is ready to proceed further so to do, if the Duke shall please to Reply in maintenance of his Printed Charge.</p>
                        <p>However the Earl not knowing what course in this Affair will be pursued, or directed, saith that he doth not disown the Book mentioned in the Duke's Representation, so far as he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd the same in a Letter written by him to the said Duke.</p>
                        <p>But denies that in the said Book or Letter, there are divers, or any passages and expressions which are not only untrue, but reflecting in a lugh degree upon his Late Majesties Government, and particularly in Relation to the Rebellion and War in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to the several Cessations and Peaces made by his, and your Majesties Authority and Command, which the said Earl hath formerly intimated in writing to the said Duke in Answer to a Letter of his insinuating the same thing, and urging for particulars which the said Earl could never yet obtain.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41251:7"/>
The said Earl is no further charged with malitiously calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating and aspersing the said Duke, and insinuating several parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars to that purpose, but the passages in the said Books of that import are still reserved, and not thought fit by the said Duke, to be expressed so as the Earl may know what, or how to Answer.</p>
                        <p>And the said Duke is not ignorant that malitious Calumny or Scandal against so great a Person as the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely punishable by <hi>Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What to say more herein the said Earl knows not, till the Duke gives more clear and particular occasion.</p>
                        <p>Whosever shall take Notice of what the Duke Asserts of his and the Earls free Converse and Friendship for above twenty years, and which the Earl adds (and the Duke cannot forget) the real and adventurous friendship with the Earl, hath ingaged in with and for the Duke, he cannot but wonder as others do, that they are so easily cancell'd and turned into rancor and ill returns, without demonstrating a change in the Earl, which may satisfie inquiring men the Duke hath a Cause.</p>
                        <p>For else it seems wonderful and past belief to intelligent men, that the Earl who professeth that he bears Malice to no Person living, nor ever had quarrel with any man, that counts it his great misfortune in his Old Age, when he was preparing to go to his Grave in Peace and in perfect Charity with all men, he should be Attacqued by one who hath professed friendship to him above these twenty years, and as he finds by Letters and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise was intimatly a friend to his Father: As it is miraculous to the same degree, that the Earl in his circumstances should willingly be drawn into controversie with so great and fortunate a man, and so antient a friend as the Duke of <hi>Ormond.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But since it hath been the Dukes pleasure or humor so violently, and so many ways to assault the Earl, he must not take it ill that he cannot bear wounds patiently, and without just resentment.</p>
                        <p>The Duke complains further, that in the course of above twenty years free and friendly acquaintance and correspondence with him, the Earl never thought fit to give him any intimation of his intent to write a History of the Wars of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and other Transactions there.</p>
                        <p>The said Earl cannot recollect with certainty whether he did or no, but he very well remembreth that many years ago he acquainted Sir <hi>George Lane</hi> then the Duke's Secretary, and now Viscount of <hi>Lanesborrow</hi> (and who told him he had the custody of all the Duke's Papers and Writings of publick Affairs)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41251:8"/>
with his intended History of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who promised him the assistance of them, but he could never yet obtain any from him: Nor from the Duke himself since he made a free offer and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of them by his Letter of the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> threatning to appeal from the Earl as a partially ingag'd, and unfaithful Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian if he accepted them not, he being as he wrote, more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to prevent than rectifie Errors and mistakes. The Earl ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this noble encouragement from so great a person, (and who was to make so great a part of it) to proceed in his History by his Letter of the <hi>Seventh</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> acknowledged and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Duke's favour, expecting the performance thereof, but never heard since from the Duke till by his Representation to your Majesty, wherein he seems to forget or retract all that had passed, tho' the Earl had given him all the Assurance a man of honour could do, that he would be exactly faithful and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in the History, and now shews that he is unwilling any History should be written by the Earl, whose candor and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality he will yet allow to be but pretended, and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth that your Majesty will prevent the Credit which they, his great place, and supposed knowledge (especially in the Affair of <hi>Ireland)</hi> may give to his Writings in these and future times, never considering that himself hath greater Places. Yet the Earl doth not apprehend their giving Credit to any thing the Duke hath or shall write against the Truth, which the Earl is resolved to tye himself strictly and authentically to, if he be suffered to go on, and not discouraged in his Design with which he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to close his Labours in this Life, for the good of <hi>England,</hi> and the Safety of that poor Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> harrassed by Rebellions and Massacres, and which must expect and undergo more (still preparing) unless prevented by wise Councils here, upon the warnings that a true Account of former times and failings may give us.</p>
                        <p>And since the Earl hath been versed above forty years in publick Affairs, without blemish or dishonour, and intends by your Majesties permission, to Dedicate his History to your Self, which sure he would not be so weak as to offer, if any thing were to be in it of the nature the Duke presageth, the Earl therefore hopes the Duke may at least trust your Majesties wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with the publishing of what you shall have the perusal of if you shall judge it worth your reading before it go to the Press, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intended both for the Honour of the Late King and of your Majesty, and not to gratisie any private humor or party, or to disguise or cover the <hi>Errors</hi> or <hi>Miscarriages</hi> of any Subject what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41251:8"/>
As to the Duke's Reflection, that the Earl chose rather to seek for Information from the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven</hi> than from him, the contrary doth appear ever since the Earl had any hopes giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him of the Duke's Assistance, with such Authentick instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and writings as may contribute to the History, which the Earl cannot but yet expect and he never desired other informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the said Earl of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> than in the Military Actions wherein the Duke employed him as a General, and never thought of making other use of them than as they concur'd with, clear'd and confirm'd the true Account the Earl was possessed of in those Affairs before.</p>
                        <p>As to the Duke's insinuating (where he mentions the War of <hi>Ireland</hi> and other Transactions there, wherein they had both a great part) that they were of opposite Parties, since he accounts it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to his design of aggravating to the utmost against the Earl, the occasion is willingly imbraced to give your Majesty a brief and true Information of the part the Earl had both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the late unhappy Time.</p>
                        <p>The Earl was (under the Authority his Late Majesty had entrusted both Houses of Parliament with for Ordering and Governing the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> after the horrid Rebellion begun) instrumental there to preserve the <hi>Brittish</hi> and <hi>Protestant Interest, Countries</hi> and <hi>Garrisons,</hi> from being swallowed up by <hi>Owen Oneill</hi>'s Barbarous Army, or falling into the Bloody <hi>Irish</hi> Hands. He also held Correspondence with, and offer'd Assistance to the then Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> to Preserve the <hi>English</hi> and save the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and other <hi>English</hi> Garrisons and Quarters from the Treacherous <hi>Irish,</hi> who broke all Faith with the Marquess.</p>
                        <p>He likewise sent to the Marquess the Late King's Majesties posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Prohibition in Writing, against making any Peace, or hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all further dealing with the <hi>Irish,</hi> and used his most earnest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions herein, foreseeing it would be destructive to the <hi>English,</hi> and mischievous to the Late King; and still offer'd Assistance to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess to encourage him in vigorous opposing the <hi>Irish,</hi> and to enable him to disappoint their <hi>Treachery,</hi> and the Consequence of their <hi>Faith-breaking.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The said Earl after the Peace notwithstanding made with the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> Confederate Rebells, and their Shameful and Treacherous Breach of it, with design and endeavor to Surprize the Marquess and all the <hi>English</hi> Garrisons in <hi>Lemster,</hi> and after they had so handled their business as to get the Commissioners of Parliament, (which were Arrived at <hi>Dublin</hi> by the Marquesses invitation, to receive the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and all other Garrisons and Strengths under his Command,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41251:9"/>
and secure them against the <hi>Irish,</hi> for which end they had brought Forces, Shipping, Provisions, and Ammunition of all sorts with them) to be rejected and sent away by the Marquess.</p>
                        <p>He upon a second Invitation of the Marquess to the Parliament, (upon the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebells continued Breaches and Treacheries) went again for <hi>Ireland,</hi> after he had used all his Interest to persuade them to send again, though they were very unwilling, and it was much opposed by reason of the former unexpected disappointment.</p>
                        <p>And was the chief employed in Commission from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with an Army of Horse and Foot, furnished with all things necessary to deliver the Marquess and <hi>English</hi> from the <hi>Irish</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries and Designs, and to receive the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> and other Garrisons, into the Parliaments Custody, who were trusted, and able to preserve the same for the Crown, if we could agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Articles for that purpose, which by the Blessing of God the Earl did to the Marquess and the late Lord Chancellour <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stace,</hi> (whom the Marquess chiefly Trusted therein) to their great Satisfaction, as well as his own and the <hi>English</hi> and Protestants; and after He and the rest of the Commissioners had received the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> and other Garrisons, and Conveyed the Marquess with the Honor due to his Quality, to the Sea side to take Shipping for <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> as the Articles gave Leave; and had spent some time to lay the Foundations which after happily succeeded, for the total Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Irish,</hi> and breaking their Cursed Confederacy and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for Treachery, and Final Subduing them to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with the Forfeiture of all their Estates, for the Satisfaction of Adventurers and Soldiers, and the vast Encrease of the Revenue of the Crown.</p>
                        <p>The Earl returned for <hi>England</hi> as he had Leave to do, before he went, where by his Interest in Parliament he secured to the Marquess the <hi>Thirteen Thousand Pounds,</hi> &amp;c. Agreed by the Articles for the Surrender of <hi>Dublin,</hi> &amp;c. to be paid to him, though much endeavour was used by the Lady Vicountess <hi>Moore</hi> and others; upon legal pretences to deprive him of it; So that he lost not one Penny of it, and then the said Marquess thought, and held the said Earl his Real Friend, and a punctual Performer of <hi>Publick Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <div type="part">

                              <hi>In</hi> England <hi>the Earl's part was as followeth:</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To preserve the Church in its Legal Establishment to the last, to desend the King and the Laws, against Usurpation and Arbitrary Government, to adventure his Estate and Life to save His from Execrable Murder, and never to sit still till he and his Friends, His Late Majesties and Your Faithful Subjects, had compassed Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Happy Restauration, with the apparent and imminent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their Lives, whereof the said Duke had vast benefits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger.</p>
                           <p>Now if the Duke will give the Earl information of his part, as an opposite Party in the said Transactions, he promiseth they shall not want their due place and regard in History, when all done by both shall be truly and exactly Recorded.</p>
                           <p>The Earl doth not know what the Duke means by saying, That at least while the Lord Privy-Seal and he have the Honor to be of your Majesties Privy-Council, and in the Stations they are, it will not be fit for him to publish such an Answer to the Lord Privy-Seal's Book and Letter, as might otherwise be necessary in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Truth: unless he would insinuate it fit for the Earl to be displaced to make room for that long threaten'd Answer, that so he might have the more home and fuller stroak at the Earl before your Majesty, when he hath endeavored but cannot hurt him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your People.</p>
                           <p>And it appears that it is but a New Phancy and Consideration taken up by the Duke, for when he was pleased not only to Write but, Print his Virulent Letter of the <hi>Twelfth</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> agains<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> the Earl, it had not it seems affected his Thoughts as of any import, and this also shews, That it is too late and dishonorable an appeal to be made to your Majesty, after the Duke hath done it, without Success in Print to the People, and would never in probability have been attempted, but that he thinks he hath arrived in a more happy conjuncture, or hath entertained some groundless hopes of Favour by the Earls depression, which he will never in the least apprehend from a just Master that he hath faithfully served so long.</p>
                           <p>And therefore the Earl conceiving that the Duke hath already in Print charged him with all he hath to say, and more than he can make good; and there being an Obligation of Honor lying upon him to publish any answer to the Lord Privy Seals Book which (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difference or respect to him) would be necessary in Vindication of Truth, and the said Earl no ways apprehending the dint of such an Answer; humbly beseecheth your Majesty that the Duke may be at
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41251:10"/>
liberty and encouraged in his worthy design for vindication of Truth by his Answer without regard to the Earl, who is ready and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be trampled upon for the Truths sake, and dreads much more what the Duke may with vain hopes whisper or insinuate to your Majesty, than any thing he can or shall think sit to publish for that End.</p>
                           <p>The Earl tho' he acknowledgeth your Majesties Favor in the Office he enjoys, it being a Testimony of your Gracious Acceptance of his long Faithful and Unblemish'd Service; Yet for the Duke (who hath partaken more deeply of your Royal Bounty and Favor, than any other Subject (to say no more) to go out of his way after he had decipher'd the Earl sufficiently by his Title of Honor and Name of Office, to mention his great Place seems to be rather in underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing than with intention to allow your Majesties poor Officer what his Predecessors, though some of them were of inferior quality to his, have enjoyed without Envy or Scorn, from the greatest Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                           <p>And I can truly say, that I have not paid my Debts incurred in your Majesties Service, nor preferred my many Children, nor grown Rich by my Service and great Place, though my Ancestors and I have received Titles of Honor, and Marks of Favor from your Majesty and Predecessors, for divers Generations.</p>
                           <p>As to the Duke's proposal, That your Majesty will be pleased to Appoint a Committee of your Privy-Council, to look over the Lord Privy-Seal's Book, and to call the said Earl, and Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> before them, and to Report to your Majesty how reparation may be made to all that are injured by the Earl's Mistakes and Errors, in his said Book and Letter.</p>
                           <p>The Earl saith, That the Duke seems to conceive that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and Council have more Leisure than the Earl dares presume, and the Earl hopes the Duke may content himself by your Majesties Favor to Govern one Kingdom under you, without involving this in his Concerns, or offering to impose his Dictates upon your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and Council of <hi>England,</hi> who have Wisdom to appoint Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, or take other course for business (properly before them) without the direction of the Parties concern'd, which most men in modesty forbear to give.</p>
                           <p>And though the Duke seems in great hast to have Mistakes and Errors fixed upon the Earl, he on the contrary (and though time will shew that all that are, will appear to be on the Duke's part) presumes not to give your Majesty trouble herein, or to pursue the Duke for what is common to mankind.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41251:10"/>
And he conceives it an Employment below your Majesty and Council, to be set upon an Essay to find matter to justifie what the Duke hath injuriously published against the Earl, which course being his first choice, he may freely pursue if he please.</p>
                           <p>As to the Duke's Objection, That the Earl saith the Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Peaces were destructive to the <hi>English</hi> and Protestants, he believes the Duke will not say the Earl was the first that said so by above thirty years, for it hath been Printed long ago, and the Truth of History and publick acts will evince it, must the Earl only be restrained from saying what he thinks, and the Duke knows he thought near Forty years ago, and endeavor'd to prevent as much as he could, and believes he can make good that time, was, when the Duke was much of the same Opinion.</p>
                           <p>It was indeed an unhappiness to conclude Cessations and Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that neither the <hi>Irish</hi> nor <hi>English</hi> were satisfied with, and my unhappiness is not small to be the only <hi>English</hi> man Reproached for an Opinion they generally had, and felt by sad and dismal Effects.</p>
                           <p>If the Earl hath dealt more plainly with the Duke than his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture averse to Contention (and who hath had quarrels with none in the whole course of his Life) inclines him to, he hopes your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty will Consider that to be taxed of Untruth and Reflection on his Late Majesties Honor and Justice, and branded as a Malitious Calumniator, a close concealed and disguised Enemy to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, a designer of Mischief to the Duke and the Government, and one who chose the most effectual Conjuncture for those things, with pretence only of Candor and impartiality, are Provocations unusual and not easily born by Persons of Honor, and might the better have been forborn, because after all this loud noise and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Charge, the Duke himself dwindles it into bare Mistakes and Errors, which who Lives that is not guilty of, and the Earl con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, is a Task very improper to be laid upon your Majesty to Examine, especially in Cases of Controversie thereupon between your Majesties Subjects.</p>
                           <p>Thus the Earl tho' he had reason first to complain, if he could have thought it decent to trouble your Majesty with private disputes (after the Duke had Scandalized him in Print, for which he prays and hopes Reparation) in obedience to your Majesties Order hath represented what he conceived expedient upon this occasion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with if the Duke be not satisfied.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41251:11"/>
It is desired that he would in due form of Law, and by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and certain Articles charge the said Earl with particulars, to which he may Answer by Advice of Council, and if he Vindicates not himself, let him be exposed to the Censure of this present Age and Posterity, and incur your Majesties displeasure, less than which cannot be aimed at by the Duke, who to satisfie his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just and causeless Animosity, makes use of his Power to alienate from the Earl your Majesties favor, good opinion and confidence, after above three and twenty years faithful and diligent Service, wherein the said Earl hath almost worn out his Strength and Life, without Conviction of any failure or transgression, which surely the said Duke would never do (after he had privately quarrell'd the Earl, and exposed him the worst he could in Print, and this Affair having taking a circuit of almost two years) unless he conceived he had met with some extraordinary juncture to bear down the Earl, nor trouble your Majesty and Council, when so great Affairs are before them, with such private concerns and complaints, after so long a run, and using other ways unsuccessfully, to Vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from what was never intended as a Charge against him.</p>
                           <p>I conclude Praying (as I have heartily endeavored) for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Prosperity of your Majesties Government, to be equal to the greatest of your Royal Predecessors, wishing your Majesty many such Subjects as I have been and am, whom the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> seems so Earnest to rid your Majesty of; or leave under a black Character, and misrepresentation in your Service which he shall never be able to compass.</p>

                        <p>SAving still the benefit of his former Answer deliver'd in the <hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> and what was then done at Council, the said Earl fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saith:</p>
                        <p>That 'tis to be consider'd that all the said particulars were passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in a private Letter to a Friend, not designed for publick view. That the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven</hi> to whom it was written being convinced thereby, as appears by a Second Epistle to the Reader added to his <hi>Memoirs,</hi> wherein he saith that his acting as a Confederate Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick was in plain <hi>English</hi> as a Rebel, That he doth not excuse the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, for all the Water of the Sea cannot wash it off that Nation, it having been begun most bloodily on the <hi>English</hi> in that Kingdom, in a time of setled Peace, without the least occasion given. A No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Remarkable Confession of one who had been long of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Council of the Confederate <hi>Irish.</hi> And which makes it the more wonderful, that the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> should be so severe a Censor on a Letter which had so good an effect on him it was written to.</p>
                        <p>In the next place the said Earl saith, That since the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> thought it fit to concern himself in a Letter not written to him, he should have been so impartial as to have taken Notice of this Passage therein, Pag. 61. <hi>Your Lordship having been privy to all the Cabals and Secret Councils against the</hi> English <hi>and Protestants, will I hope if you find any thing written by me, questionable or doubtful in your Opinion, favour me with your severest Reflections thereupon, for, as I design nothing but exact Truth wherever it light, so if by any inadvertancy or want of full information, I should Err or come short in the least, your Lordship shall find me ready to retract or supply, but never to persist in it,</hi>

whereby it appears, that the Earl of <hi>Anglesey</hi> had no Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Injure any man as he is not Conscious he hath.</p>
                        <p>These things premised, the said Earl gives this short An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer or rather Justification to the said particular Charges,</p>
                        <p>First, to that Marked <hi>No.</hi> 1. 2. 3. which are all but one Clause in the letter Page 27 <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the Cessations and Peaces were of advantage only to the <hi>Irish,</hi> and highly dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and destructive to the <hi>English</hi> and Protestants.</p>

                           <p>The said Earl passing by the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> being the Chief promoters of them, the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> sent Agents to <hi>Oxford,</hi> purposely to oppose and divert the Influence thereof, and to hinder agreements with the <hi>Irish,</hi> which they fore-saw would be destructive to the <hi>English</hi> and Protestants, the whole passages of the proceedings herein, were published in 1644. in a Book Intituled, the False and Scandalous Remonstrance of the Inhumane, and Bloody Rebells of <hi>Ireland,</hi> together with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thereunto on the behalf of the Protestants of <hi>Ireland;</hi> the perusal whereof will fully Justify the Earl in what he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, besides the Two Houses of Parliament, their Declarations and Reasons against both Cessations and Peaces: But to put it past dispute, the Earl Refers to His Majesties Declaration, and the Act for the Settlement of <hi>Ireland</hi> in which the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> himself, had a great hand and gave the Royal Assent pa. 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>By which his Majesty that now is in full Parliament, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that his Royal Father had been forced to the Cessation and Peace which he had made with the <hi>Irish,</hi> and that, he was thereby Compelled to give them a full pardon, in the same Act His Majesty also declares, that he himself was necessitated to make the second Peace with the <hi>Irish</hi> upon difficult Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

If all this do not prove the Cessations and Peaces dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> of advantage only to the <hi>Irish</hi> and destructive to the <hi>English</hi> and Protestants, I submit to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                           <p>And why else were the Peaces upon hearing all Parties laid aside, and the <hi>Irish</hi> their Estates divided among the English?</p>

                     <salute>May it please your Majesty,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>Having Received your Majesties order in Council of the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> to produce the third of <hi>Aug.</hi> next at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> to your Majesty in Council, the Vouchers mentioned by me in my Answer to the Paper delivered, in the <hi>13th</hi> Instant by the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and the increase of my fit of the Gout, occasioned by my last Attendance incapacitating me personally to obey the said Order, I hold it my duty to yield the obedience I am able by this humble address to your Majesty.</p>
                  <p>I find by the entry of the last Council days proceedings, that beyond what the Lord Chancellor declared to me, at the board of your Majesties Judgment of a Clause, in the 32 page of my Letter to the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> which was not so much as mentioned in the Duke of <hi>Ormonds</hi> said paper; A Resolve pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Council on that Letter, to this effect; that it was a scandalous Libel against your Majesties Royal Father, against your Majesty, and against the Government, but I find no Clauses, whereon such Judgment, is grounded, your Majesty may Imagine with what Amazement, as well as trouble this came to my knowledge, I should with less Concern, have seen a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at my old faithfull heart, then to have Received the wound I have from your Royal hand, after Three and Twenty years faithfull and diligent service under great Trusts.</p>
                  <p>I do not know, by what Right or Authority the Council Table, who are limited by Lawes in their Jurisdiction, take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the Tryal of a Peer for pretended Libelling, though I shall be glad to see their zeal against real Libelling, which is the Dangerous and Countenanced sin of the Age.</p>
                  <p>I am supported at present under my misfortune in this, that your Majesty, who hath so often declared to your People, that you will Govern according to Law, will not deny your old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant a fair and Legal Tryal, in some one of your Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, upon the points, whereof the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> hath accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me, before they take any Impression on your Majesty to my prejudice, and then, I no ways doubt by a due Administration of the Laws, I shall by Jurors legally Impanel'd and untamper'd with, which is the Right of every Subject, be represented
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41251:15"/>
to your Majesty in this affair, under a Charracter more suitable to that unblemished and honor, with which, I am ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at old age. But if the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> upon his prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of me, before those Judges who have power to hear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, shall by supplying his defect of proofs in Council, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict me for a Libeller, in any one point of his Charge, I shall not only deserve your Majesties Censure, but the utmost severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Law in my punishment, which may Gratifie the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of some who promote, and wait for my supplanting.</p>
                  <p>The only passage that I yet know of, which your Majesty seems to take offence at, being that in page the 32. of the <hi>Irish</hi> Committees, being in at the Intrigue of the Popish faction at Court <hi>&amp;c.</hi> since it was suddenly and unexpectedly urg'd against me at Council, not being one of the particulars, I was ordered to Answer that day, I could then only Answer what occurr'd to me on that surprise, without so much as my reading the Clause <hi>(viz.)</hi> that first negatively, by those words was not meant His late Majesty or his Council, but the Popish faction then haunting the Court, like Locusts against the Laws, which prohibit their approach to it, and as many as will be owned then Papists at Court, and were capable of Intriguing, I do not scruple to say, I intended them, and such there were of my Knowledge at that time, who may be justly suspected, to have laid the design of all the Calamities of this Kingdom and <hi>Ireland</hi> that ensued.</p>
                  <p>And as long as any such shall dare to come to Court, and by their Faction spread Libells to the scandal of all legal proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the exasperating your People dayly in affront, of the wise provision the Laws of the Land have made against them, neither your Majesty nor your Kingdoms can be safe, but the seeds of sedition will grow up to Confusion.</p>
                  <p>And for your Majesties further satisfaction, of my harmless intention in that expression, now I have perused it at Leisure, I find that in that Clause, I assert nothing positively, but when with disjunctive particles, I had mentioned divers particulars, which were in that Juncture the Jealousie and discourse of the times, and even the boast of the <hi>Irish</hi> themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41251:15"/>
I Conclude, that I would not take upon me to determine any thing, but that soon after the said Committees return for <hi>Ireland,</hi> brake out that Execrable and unparrallel'd Rebellion of the Papists.</p>
                  <p>By this time your Majesty and the Council will I hope, see cause to think, that a Summons for me to produce Vouchers, after they have given so terrible a Judgment against me comes too late, and that if I were in a Condition to attend at the day appointed, it would be no Contempt to decline making of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defence before the Lords, who have prejudged me, and Condemned me as Guilty, before the hearing of the Cause be Concluded, which I hope no other Court will do, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that I know done by them till now in my Case, nor do I hear, that the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> is censured for the scandalous Pamphlet, which he owned at Council, to have published against me, whereof I Complained: I must therefore hope, that what I have delivered in Council already, will be better and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially considered, without my giving your Majesty further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble therein.</p>
                  <p>And as I have spent the best of my days in your Service without Reproach, so I hope still to stand Justified to all the world, what I Resolve, whilst I live to be</p>
