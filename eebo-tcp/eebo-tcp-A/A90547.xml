         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sir <hi>Henry Stradling</hi> in the Vice-Admiral, the day grew foggy, and rainy, and
Å¿uch weather is very frequent in that cuntry and coaÅ¿t, we went on free to the

appointed in that Towne by the Parliament for a garriÅ¿on, there every where
we had Å¿pectacle Å¿ad enough, the greater part of the Towne IriÅ¿h, and under

            <p>(13.) This day my <hi>Lord Kinalmachy</hi> came early and then was a <hi>Sermon</hi>
preached by the <hi>Preacher</hi> of our <hi>Fleete,</hi>
               <note place="margin">13.</note> after which ConÅ¿ultation was taken

<hi>Bandon,</hi> and Å¿o by Cart brought to the Towne, where that night we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with much joy, and great acclamations, houÅ¿es and hearts open unto
us, and the rather becauÅ¿e with our <hi>Fleete</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> had Å¿ent that Towne
a good portion of <hi>Ammunition</hi> and proviÅ¿ion for the Towne; there were 7000
<hi>Soules</hi> and many miniÅ¿ters, and very many poore, they had foure Companies
of <hi>Foot</hi> and one Troope of <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> whereby they had not onely held their
owne but had taken 4. or 5. <hi>CaÅ¿tles</hi> from the <hi>Enemy;</hi> The Towne is walled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
and a freÅ¿h river runs thorough it, but commanded by the hils about it,
three gates it hath beyond, what greater Cities have for Å¿tatelines and Å¿trength,
the water abounding with <hi>Salmon</hi> and other fiÅ¿h is no Å¿mall refreÅ¿hing to the
Inhabitants, by which and Mr. <hi>Pennoyers</hi> care we found the Town in a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

            <p>This morning we intended early to march,<note place="margin">15.</note> but were hindred partly with
our owne proviÅ¿ion not comming early enough, partly through want of horÅ¿e
and accommodations to draw our Cannon and Baggage, Å¿o that we march'd
that day but two miles from the Towne, and when it was late in the day, we
were in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure fitted for our march but we drew to Councell (the next
day being <hi>Sabboth)</hi> what we Å¿hould doe, and it being conÅ¿idered what a
burden we might be to the Towne, Å¿o full of poore, and Å¿ome of our Officers
urging the diÅ¿honour of retreating, being ingaged, that it was thought meet to
proceed, eÅ¿pecially Å¿ince we were intreated by my Lord <hi>Kinalmaky</hi> and <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
thither to come and doe Å¿omthing for the enlargement of them, and their
comfortable Å¿aving their harveÅ¿t, and <hi>Macchanty Reugh</hi> threatning the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguering
of them that weeke, our marching into the Countrey might be
very uÅ¿efull; that night we had Å¿ome horÅ¿e from <hi>Bandon</hi> and two Foot-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,

The next morning we Å¿et forward in a great fogg, and reÅ¿olved to leave an
old <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Towne called <hi>Clonotikelty</hi> on the left hand, and Å¿o on to the
reliefe of <hi>Rafe-Barry;</hi> but upon the way Å¿ome of <hi>Bandon</hi> adviÅ¿ed us of a great
prey of Cattell at that Town which we Å¿hould miÅ¿Å¿e (if we Å¿topt it not in our
back-returne) becauÅ¿e the Countrey would Å¿oone be upon knowledge of our
paÅ¿Å¿ing that Towne, and heard of 5 or 6 hundred of the Enemy lying in the

we marcht cloÅ¿e by their Cabins: before we came to the Towne we found

<hi>Muskerry,</hi> againÅ¿t my Lord <hi>Encheqine,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles VavaÅ¿or,</hi> and our Army

we marched on, the Towne having onely poore people in it, but a common
Rendevous for the Enemy, and thoÅ¿e that were not Å¿uddenly Å¿urprized, went
out of their houÅ¿es and hid themÅ¿elves in Corne and buÅ¿hes, and tops of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es;
we had not marcht out a mile out of the Towne, but the Commanders
of the <hi>Bandon</hi> Companies (whoÅ¿e counÅ¿ell we depended upon, being Å¿tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers)
aÅ¿Å¿ured us that all our Cattell would be driven away before our returne,
by a company of people that attend every Army, and Force that march out,
they call pillagers, who though not Å¿oldiers, yet with Å¿ome light Armes they
follow the Campe on horÅ¿e and foot, and whilÅ¿t the Soldier muÅ¿t keepe his
order, they run into the houÅ¿es, lade their horÅ¿es with what they can get, drive
away the Cattell, and vvholly diÅ¿courage the Soldiers.</p>

Å¿udden'd Å¿ome hearts; of theÅ¿e wee had above an hundred attending us, our
Lieutenant Generall made an Order for theÅ¿e, that they Å¿hould not ride under
the command of a Captaine who came to attend his LordÅ¿hip, one Captaine
<hi>Brookes,</hi> who had loÅ¿t his Ship of 400. Tun at <hi>KinÅ¿ale,</hi> and had done eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Service upon the Land, and deÅ¿erved very well, and now entertained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t

no command, but of their owne advantages, and though preÅ¿t with many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
Å¿cattered at pleaÅ¿ure, Å¿tript the Å¿laine, made havock of all, and moÅ¿t

and obÅ¿erved by our <hi>Bandon</hi> friends, they perÅ¿waded wee Å¿hould leave one
Company behind to attend the Cattle, for of them our Å¿elves had need, not
having our Ships of ProviÅ¿ion come to us: it was objected one Company
was too little, becauÅ¿e the Enemy might fall on, wee having Å¿till heard Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

keepe in a Body, or take Å¿ome Church or Å¿trong houÅ¿e if aÅ¿Å¿aulted: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
we marched on, and tooke about 100. Cattle, foure or five hundred

all agreed but himÅ¿elfe, his owne Lieutenant Å¿aid that elÅ¿e we were undone,

preÅ¿ently two Ships to <hi>BriÅ¿toll</hi> for Å¿upply eÅ¿pecially of them, we fought for

this night Å¿ecretly diÅ¿patcht away a MeÅ¿Å¿enger for Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi>
and his company which would have beeene 500. or 600. men, with which
help we made no queÅ¿tion of gaining the Towne, though we had a Å¿trong
enemy round about us except to Sea-ward, and as Å¿trong within; but that
we lookt at our cauÅ¿e, our mens valour, and their cowardiÅ¿e. This night the
Enemy out of the Countrey fell upon our men in the Abby, were well bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
fled leaving their broges and trouÅ¿es behind them.</p>
            <p>CounÅ¿ell was taken with the Seamen to goe for <hi>Sliego</hi> and them to joyne

            <p>25. MoÅ¿t of this day was Å¿pent about 3. of our men that were condemned

This day Letters came from the Major to Capt. <hi>Willoughby</hi> concerning the
pacification anÅ¿wering his objections, and reÅ¿olving to Å¿tick to what they
had promiÅ¿ed by my Lord <hi>Clinnriccard,</hi> in the meane time great were our
cares what to doe, lying wind-bound all this time, and that Country being Å¿o
barren in compariÅ¿on of other places; that wee were forced to travell fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to burne their Corne and HouÅ¿es than in other places: Captaine <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardÅ¿on</hi>
had his Arme broken unhappily by a Gunner and BoatÅ¿on of the
Artillery though after well cured and they both gaining their credit by choice
Service, wee Å¿ent to <hi>Donnel-O-Brian</hi> a friend for cattle.</p>
            <p>31. Wee kept a FaÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>1. We had Letters Å¿ent from my Lord <hi>Clinriccard</hi> by EnÅ¿igne Scot, that he
himÅ¿elfe was Å¿icke; but that Mr. <hi>Burk</hi> his KinÅ¿man and his owne Steward
Å¿hould come to us and end all controverÅ¿ies betweene Fort and Towne: we
then tooke our guns aboard; but very unwillingly, our Seamen readier to
fall on nakedly, than forÅ¿ake the worke, and the Å¿ouldier no way backward;
for this teÅ¿timony I muÅ¿t give them both, that they have exceedingly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their Countrey and the cauÅ¿e, even to the equalling any of their Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in valour, and all manner of forwardnes.</p>
            <p>2. We grew weary of expecting Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> having promiÅ¿ed to
Å¿tay 8. or 10. dayes for him; and therefore thought of a Å¿udden departure,
principally becauÅ¿e there came a meÅ¿Å¿enger to us out of <hi>Limrick</hi> River of the
Å¿ad eÅ¿tate of the CaÅ¿tles there, Å¿ince Capt. <hi>ConÅ¿tables</hi> departure, which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened
them to bring downe the great Gun, the Å¿ight of which affrighted
our EngliÅ¿h out of their CaÅ¿tles, as witnes <hi>Asketon</hi> that Å¿tately CaÅ¿tle unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
given up without receiving a Å¿hot, and being inforced by Sir <hi>Edward
Denny</hi> who was with us, that <hi>Trelee</hi> had but 10. dayes granted for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of that CaÅ¿tle which they had defended to admiration, till they were
forced to eat hides, &amp;c. We had this day the Gentlemen from the Lord <hi>Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riccard</hi>
with papers and PropoÅ¿itions to Å¿atisfie the Captaine of the Fort, they
brought with them 24. Oxen, and 60. Å¿heepe, which were the firÅ¿t two
weekes proviÅ¿ion.</p>
            <p>3. This day we had 3. or 400. Souldiers went downe in Å¿ome Ships to the
Iles of <hi>Arram,</hi> where they did Å¿ingular Å¿ervice, took 300. head of Cattell
deÅ¿troyed many with very good houÅ¿es, burnt their corne and Townes, and
Å¿lew and hung many of the Rebels: all this day we waited the Å¿igning of the
PropoÅ¿itions.</p>
            <p>Being late, wee Å¿pent on Å¿hore, Letters paÅ¿t betwixt the Fort and Towne;
we had an Armorer came into the Towne and went to MaÅ¿Å¿e; we tooke five
priÅ¿oners, Å¿ome of note.</p>
            <p>5. We went aboard making all haÅ¿t for <hi>Trelee;</hi> the Captaine of the Fort
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:124650:10"/>
and the gentlemen came aboard with all things iÅ¿Å¿ued for their particulars, as
alÅ¿o two men that were Å¿ent to view the Towne for mining which they had
threatned to the Fort. We left a Ship, and two veÅ¿Å¿els, and a Barge to attend
the Fort and river, and Å¿o moÅ¿t ready to depart.</p>
            <p>A Å¿mall veÅ¿Å¿ell came on from <hi>Corke,</hi> one <hi>Lambert</hi> Captaine, who brought
Å¿ome more powder to the Fort from <hi>Corke</hi> aÅ¿Å¿igned by the Å¿tate of <hi>England,</hi>
into which went 50. or 60. poore people come out of the CaÅ¿tle in <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>

            </p>
            <p>6. We Å¿et Å¿aile, but could not get into <hi>Limrick</hi> River, two or three of our
Ships followed us.</p>
            <p>7. We were in like condition beating at Sea.</p>
            <p>8. Letters came aboard us at Sea from my Lord <hi>Clynriccard</hi> with Letters
to my Lord of <hi>EÅ¿Å¿ex.</hi>
            </p>

very deÅ¿erving man, hee hung out a flag to us, we Å¿ent on Å¿hore and brought
him a-board whom wee furniÅ¿hed with neceÅ¿Å¿aries who tould us wee were
come too late and that <hi>Trelee, AÅ¿keton, Clare,</hi> and other CaÅ¿tles were given

and his Forces with the Å¿laughter of many men and taking 3. peices of

and profeÅ¿t hee had already 150. which would periÅ¿h if wee provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

and that the Earle of <hi>Thomond</hi> was in great danger at <hi>Bonnatty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. Early in the morning my Lord <hi>Forbes</hi> writ to <hi>Daniel-O-Brian</hi> uncle
to the Earle of <hi>Thomond</hi> who had his Sonne Captaine of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> and
himÅ¿elfe profeÅ¿Å¿ing a newtralitie or withall the reÅ¿t that hee was the Kings
good Subject, my Lord adviÅ¿ed him to meet him at the Earle of <hi>Thomonds,</hi> by
this time our Fleete came togeather.</p>
            <p>11. Being <hi>Sabboth</hi> wee continued a-board reÅ¿olving that night to goe up
with 2. or 300. men to <hi>Bonnatty</hi> there wee found our Rere-Admirall and
the French prize of 150. Tunne laden with Ammunition for the <hi>Rebells</hi> and
taken there by our aforeÅ¿aid Å¿hip whoÅ¿e owner is Sir Nicholas CriÅ¿pe, heere
wee hung five of our priÅ¿oners formerly taken, At this time there came abord
us one Capt. <hi>VÅ¿her</hi> who had a CaÅ¿tle neer us, and kept it well, by all Å¿uch men
we were given to underÅ¿tand that without a Å¿trong Å¿tanding garriÅ¿on in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Province and Country (if it were poÅ¿Å¿ible) little would bee done as they
conceived, becauÅ¿e the poore <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Inhabitants would bee expoÅ¿'d to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tant
danger upon removall of flying Armies, This River of <hi>Limricke</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿'d
moÅ¿t unto us of any place wee had Å¿eene both for Land and Water.</p>
            <p>This night wee went up to <hi>Bonnatty</hi> my Lord of <hi>Thomonds</hi> CaÅ¿tle with

200. men 4. Barges 2. Barkes and 2, Shallops where my Lord kindly wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
us and there his uncle Sir <hi>Daniel-O-Brian</hi> met us.</p>
            <p>12. Wee Å¿pent in conÅ¿ultations with the Earle, who certified us with
much greife that Å¿ince the River was left without Å¿hipping divers CaÅ¿tles
were taken, whereby the Enemy had bin furniÅ¿hed with 800. Armes and Å¿ix
Barrells of Powder, and the way they uÅ¿ed was by bringing the great
Gunne called the Roaring Meg towards the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> CaÅ¿tles, through dread
of which the EngliÅ¿h yeelded; this Gunne one of our Å¿hips through want of
winde miÅ¿t in <hi>Limrick</hi> River, it being in a boat but tooke the Carriages in
another and wee have log'd this Gunne in a Cricke with one of our Å¿hips at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it, there being no meanes for them to carry it backe but by water.</p>
            <p>This night Sir <hi>Daniel-o-Brians</hi> man was Å¿ent to <hi>Clare</hi> to the Gentrie to
come to <hi>Bonnattre</hi> the next day at nine in the morning, Å¿ome war me Å¿peches
paÅ¿t betwixt Å¿ome of our Commanders and Sir <hi>Daniel</hi> which put him into a

            <p>13. An anÅ¿wer of the Letter Å¿ent wherein the Gentry deÅ¿ired 3. in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone
for their apearance which was granted, but Sir <hi>Daniel</hi> went away
very early, without taking leave, out of feare and horror doubtles, having been
told that wee were deÅ¿irous hee Å¿hould make good his Loyaltie before the
Parliament, over night 100. Rebels lay at my Lords Parke-pale, who (wee
Å¿uppoÅ¿e) waited to fetch Sir <hi>Daniel</hi> off; TheÅ¿e retardings made us adviÅ¿e
and conclude to fall upon Sir <hi>Daniels</hi> HouÅ¿es, and <hi>Clare</hi> CaÅ¿tle, in which we
found my Lord of <hi>Thomond</hi> doubtfull, and intruth his caÅ¿e is nice, the chiefe
of the County being his Kinred, and himÅ¿elfe without power, Å¿aving 50.
HorÅ¿e in his Stable: part of this day was Å¿pent in preaching.</p>
            <p>14. We heard the Gentry would come in; but they failed (as their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:)
we heard this night of 300. Rebels againe at my Lords Parke which
we would have beene upon, and earneÅ¿tly preÅ¿t it; but my Lord of <hi>Thomond</hi>
would have us yet wait longer on the Gentry, ere wee exercis'd hoÅ¿tility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t
<hi>Thomond.</hi> At laÅ¿t wee made our PropoÅ¿itions to the CaÅ¿tle, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to goe downe to our Ships, which came to this, That his LordÅ¿hip
continuing a ProteÅ¿tant and loyall, his danger muÅ¿t needs be great, and that
this Rebellion did not diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h Relation nor GreatneÅ¿Å¿e, and therefore if
hee pleaÅ¿ed, wee would either continue there with all our force, and joyne
with him at <hi>Bonatty,</hi> and Å¿o try what wee might doe in ioyning with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe
to reduce <hi>Clare</hi> and <hi>Thomond:</hi> or if he Å¿uÅ¿pected us too weake, that he
might take all he had and was portable into our beÅ¿t Å¿hips, together with his
owne perÅ¿on, and we would adventure our Å¿elves in his CaÅ¿tle to maintaine
that place, and infeÅ¿t the Enemy what wee could; this wee left with his
LordÅ¿hip.</p>
            <p>15. We departed, and a few miles from thence we came to an Anchor
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:124650:11"/>
in the River, and landed 300. men on <hi>Limrick</hi> Å¿ide, where our men fought
both wirh HorÅ¿e and Foot, burnt abundance of Corne, and foure of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles;
and amongÅ¿t others, kild the foÅ¿ter Brother of Mr. <hi>SteevenÅ¿on:</hi> wee
loÅ¿t two Å¿ick men, that could not follow their Companies, but had no armes.
At night our men retreated Å¿afely to their boats from two thouÅ¿and of them.</p>
            <p>We Å¿ail'd downe lower in the River, and called at <hi>Fitz-Gerralds</hi> the
Knight of the Valley, or <hi>Glyn</hi> whom my Lord Å¿ummoned by writing, our
MeÅ¿Å¿enger at landing met a Letter with a HorÅ¿e-man at the waters Å¿ide, who
had a Letter from my Lord <hi>Clinriccard</hi> in favour of his KinÅ¿man the Knight
of the Valley: an anÅ¿wer was Å¿ent him, and we departed: my Lord Å¿ent to
Sir <hi>Tege Macmahun,</hi> who is a good friend, but could not come to us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his weakneÅ¿Å¿e of body.</p>
            <p>This night the Earle of <hi>Thomond</hi> came to us, and lay aboard the Vice-Admrall,

            <p>22. Early we began to land 15. HorÅ¿e firÅ¿t, and then our Foot, who were
entertained with 30. MuÅ¿quettiers of the enemy playing upon them, but hurt
none but a boy in the Shoulder. The Enemy fled into CaÅ¿tle two or three of
our Ships playd upon the place till we landed two halfe Cannon. The Enemy
in great numbers appeared on the Å¿ide of the hill, with whom our HorÅ¿e
fought with the loÅ¿Å¿e of one of ours, and many of theirs, multitudes of them
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:124650:12"/>
comming on, wee Å¿trengthened our guards, and kept them waking all the
night with Demi-culverin in one of our Ships, the night was very rainy.</p>
            <p>23. Our Cannon plaid up upon it, but none from the Ships, tore
downe part of the maine houÅ¿e, and tooke very good effect, the Enemy Å¿hot
faintly. After dinner my Lord reÅ¿olved to Å¿torme it: but firÅ¿t march'd round
and fought the enemy on the Å¿ide of the hill, who appeared in three Bodies of
HorÅ¿e and Foot; ours put them Å¿oone to their wonted poÅ¿ture of flight.</p>
            <p>Some commanded, men were appointed to enter, where the Å¿ea-men had
much honour, they preÅ¿ently came to puÅ¿h of pike at a narrow hole, a gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ours with a cantridge of powder blew off two or three of them, the
reÅ¿t would not take quarter, one leapt out of the CaÅ¿tle window, twenty five
of them were Å¿laine upon the place: this is remarkeable that moÅ¿t matters
fell out as at the laÅ¿t Å¿iege forty yeares Å¿ince, but that we loÅ¿t fewer men, and
won it in leÅ¿Å¿e time, with leÅ¿Å¿e meanes: we took the knights Å¿iÅ¿ters Å¿on pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oner,
who acquainted us with the knights flying away two daies before, and
calling in the force of the country upon us, not thinking the caÅ¿tle Å¿hould bee

of the river of <hi>Lymrike,</hi> it having Å¿ixteene hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

            <p>25. Being Sabboth we Å¿pent on Å¿hore, and Å¿ome of us aboard, the weather
was rainy, and windy.</p>
            <p>26. We Å¿tript our cannon, and landed two Sakers for defence of the place.</p>
            <p>27. Councell was taken what garriÅ¿on to leave there, and how to diÅ¿poÅ¿e
of our Å¿icke men.</p>
            <p>28. Our men went aboard, and burnt much corne, fought with many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of the enemy, without any loÅ¿Å¿e of ours, burnt a Towne of theirs.</p>
            <p>29. A prize brought to us from <hi>Sleigo,</hi> taken from the midÅ¿t of the enemy,
laden with tallow and hides, which they were Å¿ending into <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Bilbo</hi>
for ammunition, wherein foureteene taken, and three friars by the Å¿ame Å¿hip,
divers of the Scots relieved, and a MiniÅ¿ter with Å¿ome people brought to us.</p>

burnt and Å¿poyled many CaÅ¿tles, houÅ¿es of note, and mills of the enemy, guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the coaÅ¿t from <hi>KinÅ¿ale,</hi> almoÅ¿t to <hi>London-Derry,</hi> blockt up <hi>Limricke,</hi> and
<hi>Galloway,</hi> and diverted them Å¿till as we went from other deÅ¿ignes; fighting
with them when ever we came, and laÅ¿tly taking in that lovely and uÅ¿efull ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tle
of the Knights of the Valley, where we left our men ready for further Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,

OBSERVATIONS
concerning the VVarre,
AND
The State of Ireland, both for the
raiÅ¿ing and laying the REBELLION.</head>
            <head type="sub">1.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is eaÅ¿ily noted that the Å¿eeds of the ruine
of a State are Å¿owne in the dayes of greateÅ¿t
proÅ¿perity; and that peace breeds plenty, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
breeds pride, and that brings forth Warre,
and that runs againe the former round.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Popery Å¿uffered among the IriÅ¿h, and
prophaneneÅ¿Å¿e amongÅ¿t the EngliÅ¿h, have been
the Parents of this MonÅ¿ter; though it might have other Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives
and NurÅ¿es.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though we are aÅ¿Å¿ured 1000000. EngliÅ¿h have beene mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and we hope many more IriÅ¿h Å¿laine; yet miÅ¿chiefe may
be Å¿o fomented that it may know no limits nor bounds.</p>
            <p n="4">4. PopiÅ¿h deluÅ¿ions carry Å¿uch Å¿trength with them, eÅ¿pecially
when they meet with an ignorant Å¿pirit, that knowne truths and
common Principles have the dores bard againÅ¿t them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By all wee could gleane in all the providence met with by
<pb facs="tcp:124650:13"/>
Sea or Land for intelligence, we Å¿ee that the worke now in hand
and the queÅ¿tion is Religion, and Religion PapiÅ¿t and ProteÅ¿tant,
cover'd under Puritane or Round-head and good Subject.</p>
            <p n="6">6. An IriÅ¿h Rebel and an EngliÅ¿h Cavallier in words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we found as unlike as an egge is to an egge.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is moÅ¿t true, that from the higheÅ¿t to the loweÅ¿t, from
the Regular to the Å¿ecular, from the Capitives we had to the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that came to Parley with us, from the Man to the Woman,
from the living to the dying, they profeÅ¿t unto us they fought by
the Kings Order for the Kings Honour, that wee were his enemies
not they; which made us profeÅ¿Å¿e a new quarrell againÅ¿t them
for prophaning his MajeÅ¿ties name, and entitling him to all their
murders and miÅ¿creant practiÅ¿es.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Three things are found, are by the IriÅ¿h as I wiÅ¿h: <hi>viz.</hi> to
have their Religion free, and their Religion in their owne hands,
which the wiÅ¿eÅ¿t we met with aÅ¿Å¿ured us is promiÅ¿ed them, and
that you Å¿hall read in their <hi>EccleÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿ticall Parliament</hi> held at <hi>Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny</hi>
which is now printing for you, where you may Å¿ee their end
and their meanes conducing thereunto.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The unfaithfulneÅ¿Å¿e of moÅ¿t of our MiniÅ¿ters, the Å¿cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility
and monÅ¿trous ignorance of our EngliÅ¿h, have adminiÅ¿tred
oyle to their Flame in abundance, and brought downe wrath from
Heaven, nor in our civill Government there without many Å¿ad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿perÅ¿ions
from them, wherein <hi>Dublin</hi> Å¿uffers much, not onely the
toleration but complyances with RomiÅ¿h Idolaters, hath made
them impudent and ours careleÅ¿Å¿e; eÅ¿pecially many pieces of our
worÅ¿hip ariÅ¿ing from the Å¿ame fountaine, and running in the Å¿ame
Sea with theirs as <hi>DioceÅ¿an BiÅ¿hops,</hi> their Courts, Officers, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
and Attendants, Church-cenÅ¿ures, Burialls, ChriÅ¿tenings,
Liturgie, Holy-dayes, FaÅ¿ts, hallowed Places, Images, VeÅ¿tures,
GeÅ¿tures, &amp;c. Truth it is, the continuance of <hi>Ireland</hi> in its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
condition would have trenched upon Gods honour; where
one MiniÅ¿ter had 24. Livings, and the place many times Å¿upply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Ale: drapers at 40. l. <hi>per Annum.</hi>

11. Without all queÅ¿tion, as the long continuance of ignorance
there, (the people being unchatichized) hath led in more of this
barbariÅ¿me, Å¿o I feare the former rebellion had never a thorough
cure, I will not Å¿ay that many of the engliÅ¿h planters that went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were <hi>de faece;</hi> foundation-Å¿tones Å¿hould bee Saphyres, Å¿o that
is no marvell if many that have fled thence, have left the country
worÅ¿e than they found it.</p>
            <p n="12">12. As our PrieÅ¿ts doe now more Å¿trengthen the rebellion, not,
Å¿o on our Å¿ide, men that call themÅ¿elves overÅ¿eers of churches, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
a doore unto it, rhat you may conclude there was never any
grand miÅ¿cheife brooched in the world, but Å¿uch as have beene
marked by clergy-mens fingers, and the warre now in <hi>Europe</hi> all
over is EpiÅ¿copall.</p>
            <q>In the Cure note theÅ¿e things.</q>
            <p n="1">1. A bucket of water Å¿hall quench that at firÅ¿t, which many tuns
cannot, after loÅ¿t opportunity. It is not cunctation but expedition,
not <hi>Fabius,</hi> but <hi>Hanniball</hi> muÅ¿t Å¿till be rebellious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If credit may be given to rebels, they generally profeÅ¿t that
two words from his MajeÅ¿ties owne hand by a knowne meÅ¿Å¿enger
to them, Å¿hould command downe all their Armes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Had the country riÅ¿en in any conÅ¿iderable bodyes of engliÅ¿h
at firÅ¿t, and every man either not given rebels too much credit, or
truÅ¿ted to his owne private guard, it had beene ctuÅ¿hed in the egge
which is now growne a flying Å¿erpent.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Lieutenant or Generals perÅ¿onall appearing there upon
the death of the former, muÅ¿t needs have given a checke to many of
their barbarous proceedings, and encouraged the engliÅ¿h there in
reÅ¿iÅ¿tance, want of governement makes engliÅ¿h odious, that their
very cattell are loathÅ¿ome to theÅ¿e monÅ¿ters, one of their Armie
Å¿poyling in five dayes forty Å¿even thouÅ¿and engliÅ¿h Å¿heepe, and in
time they would devoure one the other, were our neceÅ¿Å¿ity capable
of Å¿o much patience.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If the vaÅ¿t expence of this kingdome had beene rightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
both for Å¿hipping and land forces, this bogge muÅ¿t needes
have been dryed up by Gods bleÅ¿Å¿ing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Our engliÅ¿h comming over freÅ¿h and hearty, were better to
<pb facs="tcp:124650:14"/>
be hazarded upon Å¿ome of the enemies Townes, then there detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to eate our men garriÅ¿ons, and moÅ¿t of them periÅ¿h with the
country-diÅ¿eaÅ¿e.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If <hi>Galloway, Lymrike: Wexford</hi> and <hi>Waterford</hi> were recovered,
the whole rebellion is Å¿haken, which is iriÅ¿ible with halfe our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
there maintained, the Å¿tate here being nine hundred thouÅ¿and
pounds charge already.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It may then be reduced when Å¿ouldiers and commanders there
Å¿hall rather attend the preÅ¿ent work, than the continuance of their
trade.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The IriÅ¿h Lords and Gentry that are found faithfull muÅ¿t be
encouraged, who will force about them, accompanied with good
markes of authoritie and truÅ¿t from hence, will draw in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, who already curÅ¿e their PrieÅ¿ts and Gentry.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Ships and Å¿ea-men are of Å¿ingular uÅ¿e, both in Å¿ea and land
Å¿ervice, provided that good intelligence bee kept from <hi>Spaine,
France,</hi> and <hi>Dunkirke,</hi> in which worke, and much of the land mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ten honeÅ¿t faithfull merchants but united, Å¿hall doe more than
many Committees of State, who are (through much other work)
taken off from attending <hi>ad idem,</hi> to which I add the neceÅ¿Å¿ary uÅ¿e
of horÅ¿e, without which little can be done.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The PreÅ¿idents of Provinces and Countries, muÅ¿t be deÅ¿ired
not to Å¿uffer great Armies to bee kept guarding of their Townes
and DemeÅ¿nes, but imployed about the generall worke, upon our
comming thither, we met with no conÅ¿iderable man, but had moÅ¿t
need of us.</p>
            <p n="12">12, One faithfull, honeÅ¿t, able miniÅ¿ter is worth five hundred
men if planted there, the people being as ignorant of their duty, as
Å¿enceleÅ¿Å¿e of their miÅ¿ery,</p>
            <p>I am bold to thinke if the preÅ¿ent advantage were taken of the
Adventurers Å¿hips lying by <hi>Lymrike</hi> and <hi>Galloway,</hi> the places might
Å¿oone be ours, their domeÅ¿ticke combuÅ¿tions betwixt the old and
young merchants, in either being well knowne unto us. This onely
I will adde, let <hi>England</hi> here be quiet, and <hi>Ireland</hi> will not long bee
rebellious, which the good God grant for his Sons Å¿ake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
