            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We had the winde weſt very freſh,<note place="margin">8.</note> and after tempeſtuous, we loſt ſight of

            <p>This day in the morning we diſcovered the head of <hi>Kinſale,</hi> though our
Rendevous were long in land on <hi>Baltamore</hi>-hay,<note place="margin">11.</note> yet not able to fetch either,
we went in that morning to <hi>Kinſale,</hi> where we found the <hi>Swallow</hi> and the
<hi>Bonaventure,</hi> of the Kings Captain <hi>Kettleby</hi> commanding in the Admiral, &amp;
Sir <hi>Henry Stradling</hi> in the Vice-Admiral, the day grew foggy, and rainy, and
ſuch weather is very frequent in that cuntry and coaſt, we went on free to the
caſtle, and ſpoke with the commanders there, three companies we alſo found
appointed in that Towne by the Parliament for a garriſon, there every where
we had ſpectacle ſad enough, the greater part of the Towne Iriſh, and under
much juſt ſuſpicion, others fled thither living in miſerable holes and huts,
there we found Captaine <hi>Zachary, Richardſon,</hi> and young <hi>Thompſon</hi> of our
fleet, there we ſpake with ſome of <hi>Bandon</hi> being 8. miles from <hi>Kinſale,</hi> and
with ſome of <hi>Corke</hi> alſo, by which we intimated our arrivall: thither came
Sir <hi>Edward Denny</hi> by whom we heard of his defeat at <hi>Trelee,</hi> where in land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he loſt forty or fifty men, and was forced to retreat, and craved
our aid.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Kynalmachy</hi> one of my Lord of <hi>Corks</hi> ſons Governour of <hi>Bandon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">12.</note>
came to ſee my Lord <hi>Forbes,</hi> and promiſed to come againe next morning to
ſpeake further for the attempting ſomething about <hi>Bandon,</hi> ſince God by his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124650:4"/>
providence had called us to theſe parts, who by his <hi>Letters</hi> deſired helpe
of us.</p>
            <p>(13.) This day my <hi>Lord Kinalmachy</hi> came early and then was a <hi>Sermon</hi>
preached by the <hi>Preacher</hi> of our <hi>Fleete,</hi>
               <note place="margin">13.</note> after which Conſultation was taken
to march with our men to <hi>Raph-barry</hi> where one <hi>Mr: Freake</hi> with many <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
were beſeiged and in greate danger, wanting <hi>Foode and Ammunition</hi> &amp;c.
and wee being poſſeſt with our duty though ſix of our Veſſells were not yet
arrived, not to be wanting in any thing wherein ſuch Forces as we had might
be uſefull, and not knowing <hi>Raph-barry</hi> to be further than five myles beyond
<hi>Bandon</hi> we were willing to ſtrech our mens leggs, though we ſuppoſe wee
marched neere 25. miles out right of <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles.</p>
            <p>(14.) We marched to <hi>Bandon</hi> with 8.<note place="margin">14.</note> 
               <hi>Colours</hi> and about 600. men where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
100. <hi>Seamen</hi> commanded by the <hi>Captaine</hi> of the <hi>Admirall,</hi> this whole
number went to the worke moſt cheerefully, two ſmall <hi>braſſe Pieces,</hi> and
our <hi>Ammunition</hi> with ſome <hi>Victualls</hi> were brought up by our Barges neere
<hi>Bandon,</hi> and ſo by Cart brought to the Towne, where that night we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with much joy, and great acclamations, houſes and hearts open unto
us, and the rather becauſe with our <hi>Fleete</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> had ſent that Towne
a good portion of <hi>Ammunition</hi> and proviſion for the Towne; there were 7000
<hi>Soules</hi> and many miniſters, and very many poore, they had foure Companies
of <hi>Foot</hi> and one Troope of <hi>Horſe</hi> whereby they had not onely held their
owne but had taken 4. or 5. <hi>Caſtles</hi> from the <hi>Enemy;</hi> The Towne is walled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
and a freſh river runs thorough it, but commanded by the hils about it,
three gates it hath beyond, what greater Cities have for ſtatelines and ſtrength,
the water abounding with <hi>Salmon</hi> and other fiſh is no ſmall refreſhing to the
Inhabitants, by which and Mr. <hi>Pennoyers</hi> care we found the Town in a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
way.</p>
            <p>This morning we intended early to march,<note place="margin">15.</note> but were hindred partly with
our owne proviſion not comming early enough, partly through want of horſe
and accommodations to draw our Cannon and Baggage, ſo that we march'd
that day but two miles from the Towne, and when it was late in the day, we
were in ſome meaſure fitted for our march but we drew to Councell (the next
day being <hi>Sabboth)</hi> what we ſhould doe, and it being conſidered what a
burden we might be to the Towne, ſo full of poore, and ſome of our Officers
urging the diſhonour of retreating, being ingaged, that it was thought meet to
proceed, eſpecially ſince we were intreated by my Lord <hi>Kinalmaky</hi> and <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
thither to come and doe ſomthing for the enlargement of them, and their
comfortable ſaving their harveſt, and <hi>Macchanty Reugh</hi> threatning the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguering
of them that weeke, our marching into the Countrey might be
very uſefull; that night we had ſome horſe from <hi>Bandon</hi> and two Foot-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
and in the ſafeſt order we could we continued that night upoin a bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
hill.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:124650:5"/>
The next morning we ſet forward in a great fogg, and reſolved to leave an
old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Towne called <hi>Clonotikelty</hi> on the left hand, and ſo on to the
reliefe of <hi>Rafe-Barry;</hi> but upon the way ſome of <hi>Bandon</hi> adviſed us of a great
prey of Cattell at that Town which we ſhould miſſe (if we ſtopt it not in our
back-returne) becauſe the Countrey would ſoone be upon knowledge of our
paſſing that Towne, and heard of 5 or 6 hundred of the Enemy lying in the
way, the chiefe Leaders of them were <hi>Maccharty-Reugh, Tiege Douning,
Adonovaut,</hi> one <hi>Arundel</hi> and ſome others; but we ſaw none, though it ſeems
we marcht cloſe by their Cabins: before we came to the Towne we found
divers <hi>Iriſh,</hi> whom before their death wee examined, by whom we were
informed that the aforeſaid Army were bound for the aſſiſtance of my Lord
<hi>Muskerry,</hi> againſt my Lord <hi>Encheqine,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Vavaſor,</hi> and our Army
at <hi>Mallo,</hi> and glad we were that we might ſo divert them, when we came to

                  </gap>kelty</hi> we made an halt, and many were taken and ſlaine; there we found ſtore of Cattell, which were put into a pen, and after leſſe than an houre
we marched on, the Towne having onely poore people in it, but a common
Rendevous for the Enemy, and thoſe that were not ſuddenly ſurprized, went
out of their houſes and hid themſelves in Corne and buſhes, and tops of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
we had not marcht out a mile out of the Towne, but the Commanders
of the <hi>Bandon</hi> Companies (whoſe counſell we depended upon, being ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers)
aſſured us that all our Cattell would be driven away before our returne,
by a company of people that attend every Army, and Force that march out,
they call pillagers, who though not ſoldiers, yet with ſome light Armes they
follow the Campe on horſe and foot, and whilſt the Soldier muſt keepe his
order, they run into the houſes, lade their horſes with what they can get, drive
away the Cattell, and vvholly diſcourage the Soldiers.</p>
            <p>Theſe have beene the occaſions generally of all the loſſe amongſt the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi>
theſe ſpare neither woman nor child, as we ſaw before our eyes which
ſudden'd ſome hearts; of theſe wee had above an hundred attending us, our
Lieutenant Generall made an Order for theſe, that they ſhould not ride under
the command of a Captaine who came to attend his Lordſhip, one Captaine
<hi>Brookes,</hi> who had loſt his Ship of 400. Tun at <hi>Kinſale,</hi> and had done eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Service upon the Land, and deſerved very well, and now entertained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us for the leading of our little Trope: but theſe Pillagers would know
no command, but of their owne advantages, and though preſt with many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
ſcattered at pleaſure, ſtript the ſlaine, made havock of all, and moſt
of them ſtaid behind us at <hi>Clonokelty</hi> attending their prey: which knowne
and obſerved by our <hi>Bandon</hi> friends, they perſwaded wee ſhould leave one
Company behind to attend the Cattle, for of them our ſelves had need, not
having our Ships of Proviſion come to us: it was objected one Company
was too little, becauſe the Enemy might fall on, wee having ſtill heard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of them as wee went, my Lord commanded three Companies back,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:124650:5"/>
               <hi>Bandon</hi> men aſſuring us it were too much, and that no Enemy would looke
upon ſuch a number.</p>

men, the reſt of them not come; Captaine <hi>Price</hi> with his being about 80.
divers of his being not well abbard the Ship, and a Company of 80. more of
<hi>Bandon</hi> commanded by one of their Lieutenants, with advice given them to
keepe in a Body, or take ſome Church or ſtrong houſe if aſſaulted: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
we marched on, and tooke about 100. Cattle, foure or five hundred
ſheepe, and divers horſes, and brought them to <hi>Ralfe Barry</hi> to Mr. <hi>Freake,</hi>
who met us with much joy, where wee came to ſee many <hi>Engliſh</hi> pent up
in a conſiderable Caſtle; and after praiſing God and prayer, we refreſhed our
ſelves with ſuch food as he had; and our Soldiers began to make ready ſheep,
hoping they might have quartered there all night.</p>
            <p>But as ſoone as we had dined, we had three Poſts came to us from our three
Companies, that the Enemy was in view; and a fourth, that they had skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſht:
thus we were ſoone taken from any thoughts of eaſe, and Horſe and
Foet made ready to returne; and though many might well be wearied with
ſuch a tireſome march, yet they would goe to the helpe of their friends, and
truly this I muſt affirme, more couraged know not where to finde then I ſaw
that day, leaving with the Gentlemen of the Caſtle neere 20. men with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
for his preſent reliefe and the Caſtle aforeſaid, we marcht back, and
in the way met many that told us all our three Companies were deſtroyed;
more came to us ſtill, and ſome even naked of thoſe pillagers we had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
even to appall us, that it was impoſſible for us to fight it through; ſome
of us told them of their Barbariſme in the morning when they were ſlaying
the children, blood would have blood againe: ſome of us were thoughtfull
about the day being Sabbaoth, to which, and other objections neceſſity and
preſent danger afforded ſome anſwers, and on we went, ſeeing the hills on
both ſides full of Horſe and Foot, and (which was mercy even to wonder)
that afternoone proved cleere and faire, whereby wee were abundantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
comming within a mile of the Towne we ſaw two Colours, one of
ours; another of <hi>Bandon</hi> in a piece of ground caſt up round like a bull-warke,

but certainely let whom it concernes be adviſed, that religion in theſe choiſes
eſpecially at theſe times gaine the firſt place, little doe you know the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
thereby. My Lord forthwith ordered a body to encounter the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and gain'd his ground cloſe by the water, that he could not be intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and this he led himſelfe, then left a good reſerve in the reare, either to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

over the plowed land, where he was forced to march in the front, the horſe

the ſea on the one hand of them, and the horſe on the other, the ſmall cannon
he gave order upon his march ſhould be ſhot, to try if thereby Captaine
<hi>Price</hi> and the <hi>Bandon</hi>-company might be relieved, all which vvas done, my

the Peeces were fire<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and <hi>Price</hi> was freed, and the reſt, and joyned to us, and
after our men had throwne up their caps for joy that they ſhould fight, the
enemy at the turning of an hand, fled and ſcattered, their colours were given
to horſemen, our horſe purſued and made ſlaughter of them, the multitude
of horſe and foot ſpread upon the hills were vaniſhed, many kild in the water,
amongſt them <hi>Arundel</hi> and his ſons with divers of note, two ventured and
ſwam over, three or fourſcore carried out with the tide, and thus the Lord was
pleaſed to glorifie himſelfe, that the leaſt number to ſpeake in faithfulneſſe
that fell of them that day, was betwixt five and ſix hundred, that night wee
march't beyond <hi>Clonokelty,</hi> a mile or two, getting the advantage of a dry hill,
not onely to reſt on, but alſo to ſecure our ſelves, in regard of ambuſhments,
and other diſadvantages, which they wholly attend, and there with a prey of
two thouſand ſheep, above an hundred cattel, and fifty horſes of that Country,
we continued that night.</p>
            <p>But if you ſhall aske me what became of Captaine <hi>Weldon</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and what they did whilſt we were abſent at <hi>Ralph Barryy;</hi> to ſatisfie, I got
this anſwer following, under the hand of Captaine <hi>Price,</hi> who in the word
of a chriſtian aſſured me of the truth of it to his utmoſt knowledge.</p>
            <p>Three companies of us being left at <hi>Clinokeltey,</hi> my Lord gave order that
<hi>Weldon</hi> being the eldeſt Captaine, I ſhould aſſiſt him, with charge to
give account of the pillage, till he returne, we ſet our guards upon every point
of the Towne, and tooke full view of the Towne, how we might be upon
defence and offence, whereupon <hi>Weldon</hi> anſwered that we were to guard
three ſtreets, I told him that was the next way to overthrow us, but he would
not heare, ſo I view'd the Towne my ſelfe, and found three places fit for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and defence, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Will. Hulls-houſe,</hi> or the Church-yard, or the hill
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:124650:6"/>
betwixt <hi>Rafe-barry</hi> and the Towne, which after all I retreated unto, but hee
had not an eare open to counſaile. Then I marched to an <hi>Iſland</hi> my Lord had
ſent me unto, for 1500. Sheep and other Cattle to keepe a guard on it, which
I did with twenty Musketteers, I met thirty horſe of the enemy, and ſixty
foot marching towards the Towne, I marched and charged them, they ranne
away, ſo then from the iſland, I brought off fifteene hundred ſheepe, twenty
cattell, and thirty horſe, twenty two hogges, and brought them to the
Towne; by that time the enemy approached upon the hill, rounding the
Towne, being five or ſix thouſand in three companies to come downe upon
the ſeverall ſtreets. I adviſed <hi>Weldon</hi> and the other officers as before, to which
all agreed but himſelfe, his owne Lieutenant ſaid that elſe we were undone,
where upon he ſaid we were all cowards, and of the three ſtreets, I wiſhed
him to take his choice, and he ſhould not finde us cowards, I march't out
towards the enemy, my ſouldiers flung up their caps and gave a ſhout, and
gave fire bravely with a brace of bullets, and made their foot and two troops
of horſe retreat without any loſſe of ours, but ſome hundred of theirs, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

I went to their reliefe, and comming on their reare, they of <hi>Bandon</hi> ran away
without ſhooting one ſhot, and came through the Towne with confuſion
with divers pillages, and ſo diſordered us; I, in the reare with ten Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
charged the enemy then purſuing at hand, who dividing to compaſſe me,
forced me to retreat out of the Towne, to a little old breſt-worke, and there
we gathered in our forces and held them play, till my Lord brought up his

            <p>This day being ſabboth and faire weather,<note place="margin">23</note> vve kept on ſhore.</p>
            <p>We ſayled from <hi>Kinſale</hi> in the evening,<note place="margin">24</note> and left ſome ſhips to bring avvay

            <p>We came into <hi>Caſtle-haven</hi> in the afternoone,<note place="margin">25</note> and ſaw aboundance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels

            <p>In the morning our barges went a ſhore to <hi>Adonovants</hi> Caſtle,<note place="margin">26</note> which
they were nevvly fled from, and fired, where our ſouldiers burnt many houſes,
and a mill of much concernement to them, ſpoyled corne, fired many boates,
and with one barrell of powder blew up his Caſtle, dividing it ſelfe into tvvo
parts, and vvas 60. foot high, and very thick, as thick as their caſtle it uſe to be;
thereappeared a thouſand of the enemy, but would not give us fight, called us
Parliament dogs, Puritan-dogs, ſayd wee fought againſt the King and the
Church, &amp;c. Here my Lord committed a Prieſt of my Lord <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> to

            <p>We man'd out our boats to ſearch the iſlands,<note place="margin">29</note> and got ſome horſes, hogs &amp;c.
this day Captaine <hi>Rainſborough</hi> came to us from England, and Captaine

            <p>We turned up towards <hi>Golloway,</hi>
               <note place="margin">8</note> and could not gaine it that night, Wind
Eaſt, our Vice-admirals boat went a ſhore, and tooke ſome cattell, burnt ſome

            <p>We came in and anchored before the Towne,<note place="margin">9</note> my Lord ſent a letter to the
Towne, and another to my Lord <hi>Clanricard,</hi> who is Governour of Towne
and County, following his owne commiſſion therein, <hi>viz.</hi> not to attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing till he had firſt adviſed with the preſent Governour of the places he
came unto, Captaine <hi>Willoughby</hi> came aboord us that night, and Captaine
<hi>Aſhly</hi> whom we found lying there to attend the Fort, who ſeemed to clear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
breach of the Pacification, ſo far as concerned them. The Towne anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the letter ſent them with many proteſtations, that they were loyall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
hung out upon one of their Towers the Kings colours, and laboured to
perſwade us that Captain <hi>Willoughby</hi> onely had broken the trerm'd of Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>The reſt of our fleet came,<note place="margin">10</note> my Lord writ againe to the Towne, to let them
know that he meant to land his men, and refreſh them, and if they of the Town
would ſend a teſtimony of their loyalty by ſome freſh meats, they ſhould ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
approve themſelvs, our men were on ſhore divers hours, a counſel was held
aboord us, becauſe we ſaw the Towne at worke by the bridge, in which time
two came aboord us from the Towne, with a letter from the Towne, they ſtill
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:124650:8"/>
profeſſing their reſolution not only to ſtick to their loyalty, but alſo the terms
of the Pacification made, my L. <hi>Forbes</hi> being earneſt to have the matters clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
they promiſed that next morning at eight two of the Town ſhould come
to him againe.</p>
            <p>None comming from them,<note place="margin">11.</note> my Lord ſent his owne Enſigne to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
letting them know they dallyed, that day our ſouldiers went out for
freſh meat, and brought home ſome, and burnt a whole Towne, that night a
letters came from my Lord <hi>Clanricard</hi> very well pen'd, and ſhewing him a
man of wiſedome and parts, wherein he cleared <hi>Galloway</hi> men, and caſt the
imputation upon Captaine <hi>Willoughby</hi> for breaking the Pacification, and in
the ſame the Towneſmen were confident.</p>
            <p>Another letter was ſent a ſhore from my Lord with articles as will appear,<note place="margin">12.</note>
wherein they were charged not to trifle, but to ſhew themſelves in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
allegiance, and to correſpond with the Fort. A counſell was held for
the landing our men at an Abby on the weſt ſide of the Towne, within muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
ſhot, a place of ſingular conſequence, and advantage for the deſigne, and ſo
to proceed if matters were not well compoſ'd betweene the Fort and Town.
The <hi>Penington</hi> was ſent to <hi>Sliego</hi> to take off a veſſell of the Rebels of fourſcore
tun, and to attend theſe parts, as alſo three veſſels ſent to the river of <hi>Limrike</hi>
to guard that, it being left voyd by <hi>Cunſtable</hi> and <hi>Coles</hi> departure, eſpecially
againſt the French, who (we heard) were comming thither with much am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
for the River and Towne. This night accordingly our men lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Abby, at the landing of eleven colours of ours, ſome ſculking varlets
in buſhes, and ſome ſhot at our men, it being on <hi>Eeroonnaght</hi>-ſide, which
ſtandeth in open rebellion, as <hi>Galloway</hi> men did acknowledg. This day my
Lord ſent another letter to them, to urge their anſwer to the Articles, for wee
durſt not take upon us to be Judges, my Lord of <hi>Clanricard</hi> being Governour
of the Towne and County, and one that had faithfully approved himſelfe to
Captaine <hi>Willoughby</hi> in rayſing the ſiege when hee was beleaguered, and for
refreſhing him in his neceſſities, which bred much tenderneſſe in us to give
him offence; and being excommunicated by their Church, with his followeth

            <p>My Lord received a letter from the Towne in anſwer to his about the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,

no more: this day the weather foule and miſty, as it is uſuall in theſe parts,
which prejudiced our work much, eſpecially time before our winter being ſo

            <p>Being Sab<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">14.</note> we kept it aboard, my Lo: having given notice to the Maior the day

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124650:8"/>
               <hi>Clynriceard,</hi> he would begin to worke. In the Evening came Letters by the
Captaine of the Fort, from my Lord <hi>Rennelagh</hi> Preſident of <hi>Connagh</hi> and my
Lord <hi>Clinriccard,</hi> the former deſired forbearance of all hoſtility, till <hi>Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
he came to us. This night order was given that the next day 500. ſhould
into the Country of <hi>Eer-Conaugh</hi> to burne and ſpoyle, becauſe wee had no
day-light to burne out.</p>
            <p>My Lord and ſome others dinde a ſhore at the Fort,<note place="margin">15.</note> where we found the
Biſhop of <hi>Tuam</hi> and his family, 36. Miniſters, of which 26. ſerved as ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and did duty; and this day according to former order the 500. <hi>Foot</hi> and
ſome <hi>Horſe</hi> marched out, and 80. poſſeſt the <hi>Abby,</hi> and by this time wee had
two halfe Culverins mounted or ſet upon Field-Carriages and all manner of
preparations were made for the aſſaulting the <hi>Towne,</hi> and great willingneſſe
there was in our men, though the Towne be as ſtrong and compact as moſt in
Europe for houſe and walls.</p>
            <p>Our men returned with about 100. cattell and as many ſheepe having burnt
ſome <hi>Ireiſh Townes</hi> and corne as they went by the way.<note place="margin">16.</note> As they came out of a

               </hi> though the laſt night ſome of them ran to it,
but beaten back by a ſhot from the Fort, wee received 40. Beeves, and 50.
Muttons from <hi>Donnell Brian,</hi> who dwelt on <hi>Thomond</hi> ſide, and profeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

this day a Councell was held, and 36. pieces of ordinance landed, being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to fall on two dayes after.</p>
            <p>The Weather very ill,<note place="margin">18.</note> miſty and rainy, 200. of our men had order to pull
downe the timber of the <hi>Abby,</hi> to make Platformes, which accordingly they
did, but could not make bring away that night, the weather was ſo foule, at
midnight 7. or 8. Muſquet ſhot from the Towne, in the morning they ſaw
3. Pieces mounted in the Towne which the Enemy cleared.</p>
            <p>A very rainy day,<note place="margin">19.</note> wherein nothing remarkable but that ſome ſhot paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:124650:9"/>
to conferre with my <hi>Lord Clinriccard</hi> and the <hi>Towneſ-men;</hi> This day <hi>Captain
Zacharies</hi> ſhip came from <hi>Kinſale,</hi> for himſelfe being ſhot in the back we left
at <hi>Banden</hi> to be cured, by whom wee heard of <hi>Captaine Kettlebies</hi> removeall
from <hi>Kinſale,</hi> but no man was certaine whither hee went: that time there
came a Letter from Sir <hi>Charles Coote,</hi> who gave us hope we might have his
preſence with his men; <hi>Zacharies</hi> Ship freed the Engliſh out of a Caſtle with
one Shot, and put the <hi>Reb,</hi> to flight.</p>
            <p>Being <hi>Sabboth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">21.</note> the Preſident came to us to the Fort, and came to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
which was in the fields, din'd in the Fort with my Lord <hi>Forbes,</hi> two
things are mainly driven at; firſt that the Fort ſhould be victualled for eight
moneth, and ſecondly that ſufficient hoſtages ſhould be given out of the Town
for ſecuring it to the King. In the afternoone he rid to <hi>Terelan</hi> with Captain
<hi>Willougbies</hi> Propoſitions. The Evening our packet-boat came in called the
<hi>Rafe,</hi> by whom we had newes from <hi>Limrick</hi> and other parts from my Lords
Caſtell Steward, who writ for ſupply, which accodingly was ſent him:
this night order was given for a counſell of War next morning.</p>
            <p>Foure of our Barges were ſent to get plank from a rack a mile or two from
us,<note place="margin">22.</note> to make Platformes for our Ordnance. Wee tooke 3. Rebels over night,
our officers were early at a Counſell of Warre, when all both Seamen and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
under-writ to ſtand to my Lord to the utmoſt, and it was reſolv'd to try
our ſtrength upon the Towne, if the Kings Fort might not enjoy fit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
            <p>The Preſident came to the Fort from <hi>Terelan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">23.</note> and my Lord <hi>Clynriccard</hi>
writ that he would alſo come to my Lord <hi>Forbes</hi> thither: but after much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
he did not, which we ſuſpect fell out through doubt how matters
would ſtand if we proceeded in hoſtility, and his Lordſhip wanting a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
guard for himſelfe being excommunicate by the Rebels, and told by the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular
B. of the place, that not a man there would draw his ſword for him.
Then we received Captaine <hi>Willoughhies</hi> Propoſitions anſwered by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the Country for the ſupply of the Fort according to his deſire.
My Lord <hi>Clynriccard</hi> being upon his return gave my Lord <hi>Forb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

as God ſhould allot us, aſſuring him he ſhould be as ſafe as himſelfe, and that
his Kinred did but watch opportunities to miſchiefe him, he ſtill complained
of power wanting, and thought we were not ſtrong enough, and was
earneſt that pacification might not be broken, aſſuring us if it were, the
Countrey would be longer in reducing and with much more charge to the
State; My L. <hi>Forbes</hi> earneſtly preſt my L. Preſident, who had 2500. men from
the State, that he would joyne with us, or lend us but 500. men, he told us
that his men were almoſt in a mutiny through want of pay and neceſſaries;
and thoſe he had were appointed for the ſafety of my Lord <hi>Clynriccard;</hi> but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:124650:9"/>
but yet if we would come to <hi>Sliego</hi> his men ſhould joyne with us, and then
eſpeciall ſervice might be done; Thus theſe Lords departed, and we retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to a Counſell of Warre, where Captaine <hi>Willoughby</hi> perſwaded us (hee
having knowledge of the Towne that we were too weake, moſt of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
being like Caſtles, and the wall ſtrong and hard to mine; we conſidered
many of our men were then fallen ſick of the Countrey-diſeaſe, and that wee
long wanted of three ſhips of proviſions of all ſorts, that we thought to ſend
preſently two Ships to <hi>Briſtoll</hi> for ſupply eſpecially of them, we fought for
other diet, and tooke 6. or 700. Cattell at leaſt. This night all men were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to conſider by the morning what were beſt to doe by way of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell:
this night ſecretly diſpatcht away a Meſſenger for Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi>
and his company which would have beeene 500. or 600. men, with which
help we made no queſtion of gaining the Towne, though we had a ſtrong
enemy round about us except to Sea-ward, and as ſtrong within; but that
we lookt at our cauſe, our mens valour, and their cowardiſe. This night the
Enemy out of the Countrey fell upon our men in the Abby, were well bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
fled leaving their broges and trouſes behind them.</p>
            <p>Counſell was taken with the Seamen to goe for <hi>Sliego</hi> and them to joyne
with the Preſidents men, and bring with us 500. or 1000. Scots to diſpatch
the buſineſſe of <hi>Galloway;</hi> but we found ſuch difficultie in that Northeren
though but 30. or 40. leauges that it was deſiſted from.</p>
            <p>25. Moſt of this day was ſpent about 3. of our men that were condemned
for ſeverall offences and pardoned at the Gallowes; this night a prize was
brought us by one of our ſhips a Barhado-man laden with Tobacco and trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the <hi>Rebells</hi> in <hi>Limrick</hi> River a ſhip 140. Tunn, Theſe two ruines
of <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Limrick</hi> we reſolved becauſe we had ſtrong intelligence that
the <hi>French</hi> were reſolved forcibly to bring in <hi>Ammunition</hi> thether, more
Letters came from my Lord <hi>Preſident</hi> and my L. <hi>Clinriccard</hi> to aſſure us of
the agreement to be ſtood unto for ſupplying the Fort, nor have we omitted
to preſent all thoſe Letters as wil appeare; This night the <hi>Earle Connaghs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi>

            <p>1. We had Letters ſent from my Lord <hi>Clinriccard</hi> by Enſigne Scot, that he
himſelfe was ſicke; but that Mr. <hi>Burk</hi> his Kinſman and his owne Steward
ſhould come to us and end all controverſies betweene Fort and Towne: we
then tooke our guns aboard; but very unwillingly, our Seamen readier to
fall on nakedly, than forſake the worke, and the ſouldier no way backward;
for this teſtimony I muſt give them both, that they have exceedingly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their Countrey and the cauſe, even to the equalling any of their Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in valour, and all manner of forwardnes.</p>
            <p>2. We grew weary of expecting Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> having promiſed to
ſtay 8. or 10. dayes for him; and therefore thought of a ſudden departure,
principally becauſe there came a meſſenger to us out of <hi>Limrick</hi> River of the
ſad eſtate of the Caſtles there, ſince Capt. <hi>Conſtables</hi> departure, which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened
them to bring downe the great Gun, the ſight of which affrighted
our Engliſh out of their Caſtles, as witnes <hi>Asketon</hi> that ſtately Caſtle unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
given up without receiving a ſhot, and being inforced by Sir <hi>Edward
Denny</hi> who was with us, that <hi>Trelee</hi> had but 10. dayes granted for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of that Caſtle which they had defended to admiration, till they were
forced to eat hides, &amp;c. We had this day the Gentlemen from the Lord <hi>Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riccard</hi>
with papers and Propoſitions to ſatisfie the Captaine of the Fort, they
brought with them 24. Oxen, and 60. ſheepe, which were the firſt two
weekes proviſion.</p>
            <p>3. This day we had 3. or 400. Souldiers went downe in ſome Ships to the
Iles of <hi>Arram,</hi> where they did ſingular ſervice, took 300. head of Cattell
deſtroyed many with very good houſes, burnt their corne and Townes, and
ſlew and hung many of the Rebels: all this day we waited the ſigning of the
Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>Being late, wee ſpent on ſhore, Letters paſt betwixt the Fort and Towne;
we had an Armorer came into the Towne and went to Maſſe; we tooke five
priſoners, ſome of note.</p>
            <p>5. We went aboard making all haſt for <hi>Trelee;</hi> the Captaine of the Fort
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:124650:10"/>
and the gentlemen came aboard with all things iſſued for their particulars, as
alſo two men that were ſent to view the Towne for mining which they had
threatned to the Fort. We left a Ship, and two veſſels, and a Barge to attend
the Fort and river, and ſo moſt ready to depart.</p>
            <p>A ſmall veſſell came on from <hi>Corke,</hi> one <hi>Lambert</hi> Captaine, who brought
ſome more powder to the Fort from <hi>Corke</hi> aſſigned by the ſtate of <hi>England,</hi>
into which went 50. or 60. poore people come out of the Caſtle in <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
the which he carried for <hi>Corke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. We ſet ſaile, but could not get into <hi>Limrick</hi> River, two or three of our
Ships followed us.</p>
            <p>7. We were in like condition beating at Sea.</p>
            <p>8. Letters came aboard us at Sea from my Lord <hi>Clynriccard</hi> with Letters
to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. Wee got within <hi>Loops-head</hi> and came to an anchor neere Captain <hi>Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi>
Caſtle who preſerved himſelfe and ſome hundreds with him ſtoutly, a
very deſerving man, hee hung out a flag to us, we ſent on ſhore and brought
him a-board whom wee furniſhed with neceſſaries who tould us wee were
come too late and that <hi>Trelee, Aſketon, Clare,</hi> and other Caſtles were given
up, and aſſured us of the Victory of my Lo: <hi>Enchaquin</hi> in <hi>Munſter</hi> over <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gray</hi>
and his Forces with the ſlaughter of many men and taking 3. peices of
Ordnance, which made the Engliſh flye to him expecting dayly to be maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
and profeſt hee had already 150. which would periſh if wee provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not for them, all which wee found true to our great griefe and trouble
and that the Earle of <hi>Thomond</hi> was in great danger at <hi>Bonnatty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. Early in the morning my Lord <hi>Forbes</hi> writ to <hi>Daniel-O-Brian</hi> uncle
to the Earle of <hi>Thomond</hi> who had his Sonne Captaine of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> and
himſelfe profeſſing a newtralitie or withall the reſt that hee was the Kings
good Subject, my Lord adviſed him to meet him at the Earle of <hi>Thomonds,</hi> by
this time our Fleete came togeather.</p>
            <p>11. Being <hi>Sabboth</hi> wee continued a-board reſolving that night to goe up
with 2. or 300. men to <hi>Bonnatty</hi> there wee found our Rere-Admirall and
the French prize of 150. Tunne laden with Ammunition for the <hi>Rebells</hi> and
taken there by our aforeſaid ſhip whoſe owner is Sir Nicholas Criſpe, heere
wee hung five of our priſoners formerly taken, At this time there came abord
us one Capt. <hi>Vſher</hi> who had a Caſtle neer us, and kept it well, by all ſuch men
we were given to underſtand that without a ſtrong ſtanding garriſon in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Province and Country (if it were poſſible) little would bee done as they
conceived, becauſe the poore <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inhabitants would bee expoſ'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
danger upon removall of flying Armies, This River of <hi>Limricke</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſ'd
moſt unto us of any place wee had ſeene both for Land and Water.</p>
            <p>This night wee went up to <hi>Bonnatty</hi> my Lord of <hi>Thomonds</hi> Caſtle with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:124650:11"/>
200. men 4. Barges 2. Barkes and 2, Shallops where my Lord kindly wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
us and there his uncle Sir <hi>Daniel-O-Brian</hi> met us.</p>
            <p>12. Wee ſpent in conſultations with the Earle, who certified us with
much greife that ſince the River was left without ſhipping divers Caſtles
were taken, whereby the Enemy had bin furniſhed with 800. Armes and ſix
Barrells of Powder, and the way they uſed was by bringing the great
Gunne called the Roaring Meg towards the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Caſtles, through dread
of which the Engliſh yeelded; this Gunne one of our ſhips through want of
winde miſt in <hi>Limrick</hi> River, it being in a boat but tooke the Carriages in
another and wee have log'd this Gunne in a Cricke with one of our ſhips at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it, there being no meanes for them to carry it backe but by water.</p>
            <p>This night Sir <hi>Daniel-o-Brians</hi> man was ſent to <hi>Clare</hi> to the Gentrie to
come to <hi>Bonnattre</hi> the next day at nine in the morning, ſome war me ſpeches
paſt betwixt ſome of our Commanders and Sir <hi>Daniel</hi> which put him into a
ſhaking fit.</p>
            <p>13. An anſwer of the Letter ſent wherein the Gentry deſired 3. in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone
for their apearance which was granted, but Sir <hi>Daniel</hi> went away
very early, without taking leave, out of feare and horror doubtles, having been
told that wee were deſirous hee ſhould make good his Loyaltie before the
Parliament, over night 100. Rebels lay at my Lords Parke-pale, who (wee
ſuppoſe) waited to fetch Sir <hi>Daniel</hi> off; Theſe retardings made us adviſe
and conclude to fall upon Sir <hi>Daniels</hi> Houſes, and <hi>Clare</hi> Caſtle, in which we
found my Lord of <hi>Thomond</hi> doubtfull, and intruth his caſe is nice, the chiefe
of the County being his Kinred, and himſelfe without power, ſaving 50.
Horſe in his Stable: part of this day was ſpent in preaching.</p>
            <p>14. We heard the Gentry would come in; but they failed (as their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:)
we heard this night of 300. Rebels againe at my Lords Parke which
we would have beene upon, and earneſtly preſt it; but my Lord of <hi>Thomond</hi>
would have us yet wait longer on the Gentry, ere wee exercis'd hoſtility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Thomond.</hi> At laſt wee made our Propoſitions to the Caſtle, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to goe downe to our Ships, which came to this, That his Lordſhip
continuing a Proteſtant and loyall, his danger muſt needs be great, and that
this Rebellion did not diſtinguiſh Relation nor Greatneſſe, and therefore if
hee pleaſed, wee would either continue there with all our force, and joyne
with him at <hi>Bonatty,</hi> and ſo try what wee might doe in ioyning with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to reduce <hi>Clare</hi> and <hi>Thomond:</hi> or if he ſuſpected us too weake, that he
might take all he had and was portable into our beſt ſhips, together with his
owne perſon, and we would adventure our ſelves in his Caſtle to maintaine
that place, and infeſt the Enemy what wee could; this wee left with his
Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>15. We departed, and a few miles from thence we came to an Anchor
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:124650:11"/>
in the River, and landed 300. men on <hi>Limrick</hi> ſide, where our men fought
both wirh Horſe and Foot, burnt abundance of Corne, and foure of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;
and amongſt others, kild the foſter Brother of Mr. <hi>Steevenſon:</hi> wee
loſt two ſick men, that could not follow their Companies, but had no armes.
At night our men retreated ſafely to their boats from two thouſand of them.</p>
            <p>We ſail'd downe lower in the River, and called at <hi>Fitz-Gerralds</hi> the
Knight of the Valley, or <hi>Glyn</hi> whom my Lord ſummoned by writing, our
Meſſenger at landing met a Letter with a Horſe-man at the waters ſide, who
had a Letter from my Lord <hi>Clinriccard</hi> in favour of his Kinſman the Knight
of the Valley: an anſwer was ſent him, and we departed: my Lord ſent to
Sir <hi>Tege Macmahun,</hi> who is a good friend, but could not come to us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his weakneſſe of body.</p>
            <p>This night the Earle of <hi>Thomond</hi> came to us, and lay aboard the Vice-Admrall,
with whom three of the chiefe Rebels of <hi>Thomond</hi> had beeen and
promiſed to come with the Gentry aboard our Ships.</p>

him.</p>
            <p>19. We ſtayd in expectation of the Gentry from the ſhore, who had their

will appeare in their Letters hereto annexed. VVe had a counſell wherein
it was concluded the next day to attempt the Knight of the Valley with 6.
Veſſels, and all things anſwerable. It was alſo agreed that Captaine <hi>Peters</hi>

            <p>21. VVe ſet ſaile for the Valley, being 3. Leagues up, and comming by the
place in the evening, went beyond a mile or two and anchored.</p>
            <p>22. Early we began to land 15. Horſe firſt, and then our Foot, who were
entertained with 30. Muſquettiers of the enemy playing upon them, but hurt
none but a boy in the Shoulder. The Enemy fled into Caſtle two or three of
our Ships playd upon the place till we landed two halfe Cannon. The Enemy
in great numbers appeared on the ſide of the hill, with whom our Horſe
fought with the loſſe of one of ours, and many of theirs, multitudes of them
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:124650:12"/>
comming on, wee ſtrengthened our guards, and kept them waking all the
night with Demi-culverin in one of our Ships, the night was very rainy.</p>
            <p>23. Our Cannon plaid up upon it, but none from the Ships, tore
downe part of the maine houſe, and tooke very good effect, the Enemy ſhot
faintly. After dinner my Lord reſolved to ſtorme it: but firſt march'd round
and fought the enemy on the ſide of the hill, who appeared in three Bodies of
Horſe and Foot; ours put them ſoone to their wonted poſture of flight.</p>
            <p>Some commanded, men were appointed to enter, where the ſea-men had
much honour, they preſently came to puſh of pike at a narrow hole, a gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ours with a cantridge of powder blew off two or three of them, the
reſt would not take quarter, one leapt out of the Caſtle window, twenty five
of them were ſlaine upon the place: this is remarkeable that moſt matters
fell out as at the laſt ſiege forty yeares ſince, but that we loſt fewer men, and
won it in leſſe time, with leſſe meanes: we took the knights ſiſters ſon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
who acquainted us with the knights flying away two daies before, and
calling in the force of the country upon us, not thinking the caſtle ſhould bee
taken ſo ſoone. The place is rich pleaſant and profitable for all the merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
of the river of <hi>Lymrike,</hi> it having ſixteene hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it in faire lands, we found the place furniſhed with all utenſils and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
for a family. The plate and ſilver was gone for <hi>Lymrike,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
moſt of which is in <hi>Ireland:</hi> it ſeemes they wanted bullets in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
by their ſhooting window-lead and ſmall ſtones, in the ſiege we loſt but
foure men.</p>
            <p>25. Being Sabboth we ſpent on ſhore, and ſome of us aboard, the weather
was rainy, and windy.</p>
            <p>26. We ſtript our cannon, and landed two Sakers for defence of the place.</p>
            <p>27. Councell was taken what garriſon to leave there, and how to diſpoſe
of our ſicke men.</p>
            <p>28. Our men went aboard, and burnt much corne, fought with many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of the enemy, without any loſſe of ours, burnt a Towne of theirs.</p>
            <p>29. A prize brought to us from <hi>Sleigo,</hi> taken from the midſt of the enemy,
laden with tallow and hides, which they were ſending into <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Bilbo</hi>
for ammunition, wherein foureteene taken, and three friars by the ſame ſhip,
divers of the Scots relieved, and a Miniſter with ſome people brought to us.</p>
            <p>At this time another ſhip from <hi>Bilbo</hi> taken laden with iron, ſteele, ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
and proviſion in <hi>Galloway</hi> river, his invoyce came to five thouſand
pound. We alſo had certaine tidings of another of ten guns gone into <hi>Dingle,</hi>
which three or foure of our ſhips were ſent to fetch out, and have (I hope)
taken long ſince.</p>
            <p>And thus we left our men dayly working, and bringing other parts of

               <hi>Limrike</hi>-river, this day my Lord <hi>Glenmorris</hi> was buried the arch-rebell.</p>
            <p>So that to ſumme up our voyage, it comes to thus much, in two or three

when they meet with an ignorant ſpirit, that knowne truths and
common Principles have the dores bard againſt them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By all wee could gleane in all the providence met with by
<pb facs="tcp:124650:13"/>
Sea or Land for intelligence, we ſee that the worke now in hand
and the queſtion is Religion, and Religion Papiſt and Proteſtant,
cover'd under Puritane or Round-head and good Subject.</p>
            <p n="6">6. An Iriſh Rebel and an Engliſh Cavallier in words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we found as unlike as an egge is to an egge.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is moſt true, that from the higheſt to the loweſt, from
the Regular to the ſecular, from the Capitives we had to the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that came to Parley with us, from the Man to the Woman,
from the living to the dying, they profeſt unto us they fought by
the Kings Order for the Kings Honour, that wee were his enemies
not they; which made us profeſſe a new quarrell againſt them
for prophaning his Majeſties name, and entitling him to all their
murders and miſcreant practiſes.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Three things are found, are by the Iriſh as I wiſh: <hi>viz.</hi> to
have their Religion free, and their Religion in their owne hands,
which the wiſeſt we met with aſſured us is promiſed them, and
that you ſhall read in their <hi>Eccleſſaſticall Parliament</hi> held at <hi>Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny</hi>
which is now printing for you, where you may ſee their end
and their meanes conducing thereunto.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The unfaithfulneſſe of moſt of our Miniſters, the ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility
and monſtrous ignorance of our Engliſh, have adminiſtred
oyle to their Flame in abundance, and brought downe wrath from
Heaven, nor in our civill Government there without many ſad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſions

11. Without all queſtion, as the long continuance of ignorance
there, (the people being unchatichized) hath led in more of this
barbariſme, ſo I feare the former rebellion had never a thorough
cure, I will not ſay that many of the engliſh planters that went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were <hi>de faece;</hi> foundation-ſtones ſhould bee Saphyres, ſo that
is no marvell if many that have fled thence, have left the country
worſe than they found it.</p>
            <p n="12">12. As our Prieſts doe now more ſtrengthen the rebellion, not,
ſo on our ſide, men that call themſelves overſeers of churches, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
a doore unto it, rhat you may conclude there was never any
grand miſcheife brooched in the world, but ſuch as have beene
marked by clergy-mens fingers, and the warre now in <hi>Europe</hi> all
over is Epiſcopall.</p>
            <q>In the Cure note theſe things.</q>
            <p n="1">1. A bucket of water ſhall quench that at firſt, which many tuns
cannot, after loſt opportunity. It is not cunctation but expedition,
not <hi>Fabius,</hi> but <hi>Hanniball</hi> muſt ſtill be rebellious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If credit may be given to rebels, they generally profeſt that
two words from his Majeſties owne hand by a knowne meſſenger
to them, ſhould command downe all their Armes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Had the country riſen in any conſiderable bodyes of engliſh
at firſt, and every man either not given rebels too much credit, or
truſted to his owne private guard, it had beene ctuſhed in the egge
which is now growne a flying ſerpent.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Lieutenant or Generals perſonall appearing there upon
the death of the former, muſt needs have given a checke to many of
their barbarous proceedings, and encouraged the engliſh there in
reſiſtance, want of governement makes engliſh odious, that their
very cattell are loathſome to theſe monſters, one of their Armie
ſpoyling in five dayes forty ſeven thouſand engliſh ſheepe, and in
time they would devoure one the other, were our neceſſity capable
of ſo much patience.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If the vaſt expence of this kingdome had beene rightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
both for ſhipping and land forces, this bogge muſt needes
have been dryed up by Gods bleſſing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Our engliſh comming over freſh and hearty, were better to
<pb facs="tcp:124650:14"/>
be hazarded upon ſome of the enemies Townes, then there detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to eate our men garriſons, and moſt of them periſh with the
country-diſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If <hi>Galloway, Lymrike: Wexford</hi> and <hi>Waterford</hi> were recovered,
the whole rebellion is ſhaken, which is iriſible with halfe our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
there maintained, the ſtate here being nine hundred thouſand
pounds charge already.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It may then be reduced when ſouldiers and commanders there
ſhall rather attend the preſent work, than the continuance of their
trade.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Iriſh Lords and Gentry that are found faithfull muſt be
encouraged, who will force about them, accompanied with good
markes of authoritie and truſt from hence, will draw in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, who already curſe their Prieſts and Gentry.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Ships and ſea-men are of ſingular uſe, both in ſea and land
ſervice, provided that good intelligence bee kept from <hi>Spaine,
France,</hi> and <hi>Dunkirke,</hi> in which worke, and much of the land mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ten honeſt faithfull merchants but united, ſhall doe more than
many Committees of State, who are (through much other work)
taken off from attending <hi>ad idem,</hi> to which I add the neceſſary uſe
of horſe, without which little can be done.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The Preſidents of Provinces and Countries, muſt be deſired
not to ſuffer great Armies to bee kept guarding of their Townes
and Demeſnes, but imployed about the generall worke, upon our
comming thither, we met with no conſiderable man, but had moſt
need of us.</p>
            <p n="12">12, One faithfull, honeſt, able miniſter is worth five hundred
men if planted there, the people being as ignorant of their duty, as
ſenceleſſe of their miſery,</p>
            <p>I am bold to thinke if the preſent advantage were taken of the
Adventurers ſhips lying by <hi>Lymrike</hi> and <hi>Galloway,</hi> the places might
ſoone be ours, their domeſticke combuſtions betwixt the old and
young merchants, in either being well knowne unto us. This onely
I will adde, let <hi>England</hi> here be quiet, and <hi>Ireland</hi> will not long bee
rebellious, which the good God grant for his Sons ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
